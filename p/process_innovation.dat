To address these important questions, this study empirically delineates the nature of explorative and exploitative alliances, examines how they affect product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations,</b> and investigates how such effects vary in different contexts. Using a sample of 220 Chinese firms in the glass industry, we use the structural equation modeling procedure to analyze the data.

Interestingly, they also find that <b>process</b> <b>innovation</b> has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.

40|$|This paper explores whether workers share {{innovation}} {{returns and}} how the size of innovation returns is affected by market conditions. Using a panel data of Spanish manufacturing firms {{during the period from}} 1990 to 1993, we answer affirmatively to both questions. Product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations</b> both generate returns, but such returns are higher for <b>process</b> <b>innovations.</b> The size of innovation returns seems to be affected positively by demand growth, by product standardization, and by low product market concentration. The three empirical results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions, such as Schmoockler's (1966) theory of demand-pool innovation, the price-elasticity of demand effects postulated by Kamien & Schwartz (1970), and the replacement effect suggested by Arrow (1962).

40|$|A 1993 {{survey on}} the {{innovative}} activities of Europe’s largest industrial firms obtained useable results on patenting activities for 604 respondents. The data {{are used to}} calculate the sales-weighted propensity rates for 19 industries. The propensity rates equal the percentage of innovations for which a patent application is made. The propensity rates for product innovations average 35. 9 %, varying between 8. 1 % in textiles and 79. 2 % in pharmaceuticals. The average for <b>process</b> <b>innovations</b> is 24. 8 %, varying from 8. 1 % in textiles to 46. 8 % for precision instruments. Only four sectors have patent propensity rates, for both product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations</b> combined, that exceed 50 %: pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and precision instruments. Regression results that control for the effect of industry sector show that patent propensity rates increase with firm size and are higher among firms that find patents to be an important method for preventing competitors from copying both product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations.</b> The effect of secrecy is not so straightforward. Firms that find secrecy to be an important protection method for product innovations are less likely to patent, as expected, but secrecy has little effect on the propensity to patent <b>process</b> <b>innovations.</b> The R&D intensity of the firm has no effect on patent propensity rates for both product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations.</b> The sector of activity has a strong influence on product patent propensities but very little effect on process patent propensities, after controlling for the effect of other factors...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to study the empirical relationship between innovations and export performance of Polish firms. Research Design & Methods: Our analytical framework refers to the most recent strand in the new trade theory literature based on the Melitz (2003) model that stresses the role of firm heterogeneity and the importance of firm productivity in entering export markets. We treat innovations as a key element that can increase the level of productivity and study the significance of both product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations.</b> The empirical implementation of the theoretical framework is based on the probit model and the unique Polish CIS firm-level dataset covering the period 2008 - 2010. Findings: Our estimation results indicate that the probability of exporting is positively related to product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations,</b> firm size, the share of university graduates in productive employment and foreign capital participation. The results depend also on the level of technology used in the analysed sector and the relative importance of export market. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop an innovation supporting mechanism that would stimulate both product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations</b> in Poland. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in the use of the unique Polish CIS firm level dataset that allows distinguishing between product and <b>process</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R

Results show that displacement effects induced by productivity growth in the production of old products are large, while those associated with <b>process</b> <b>innovations,</b> which are likely to be compensated by price decreases, appear to be small. The effects related to product innovations are, however, strong enough to overcompensate these displacement effects. ...|$|R
