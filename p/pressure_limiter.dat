50|$|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has {{developed}} two {{separate and distinct}} standards on pressure Measurement, B40.100 and PTC 19.2.B40.100 provides guidelines on Pressure Indicated Dial Type and Pressure Digital Indicating Gauges, Diaphragm Seals, Snubbers, and <b>Pressure</b> <b>Limiter</b> Valves.PTC 19.2 provides instructions and guidance for the accurate determination of pressure values {{in support of the}} ASME Performance Test Codes. The choice of method, instruments, required calculations, and corrections to be applied depends on the purpose of the measurement, the allowable uncertainty, and the characteristics of the equipment being tested.|$|E
40|$|The press (10) has a {{fixed base}} plate (1) {{and a second}} {{parallel}} base plate (2), which is borne {{on at least one}} linear device (6) and which moves parallel to the fixed base plate. The base plates hold several removable workpiece holders (3, 4) to removably press or clamp individual component groups (5) of a furniture frame. A control and evaluation device, is connected to at least one press <b>pressure</b> <b>limiter.</b> The press is pivotally positioned on a base frame (9) about a pivot axis (8), and has a pivot drive (7). The workpiece holders, which are designed to fit workpiece components, are for flexible positioning with a quick-change unit on the base plate by hand or a handling device using quick change units, which may be achieved by snap-fitting into a hole or groove.

40|$|AbstractA {{physically}} based {{mathematical model}} for an {{electric power system}} is developed to provide an adequate test bed for the testing and evaluation of slow speed dynamics emergency state control strategies. This model incorporates all the major components of the system, includes explicit representations for all the major physical variables and control, and is capable of simulating {{a wide variety of}} emergency contingencies. The dependence of the overall power system's behavior on the response characteristics of mechanical prime movers and the limitations placed on the overall system's response by absolute power and power rate capability constraints of the prime movers are described. Certain stochastic aspects of the system's behavior as well as the mechanisms governing cascading failures, which have characterized many major power system collapses in recent years, are introduced; and problems concerning the control of electric power systems under emergency state operating conditions are identified. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the system under normal and emergency operating conditions and to show the importance of tie-line interconnection, especially to a region that is importing power {{from the rest of the}} system, as well as the effects of governor control action, initial <b>pressure</b> <b>limiter</b> and generation schedule prior to disturbances...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{suppress}} the failure of preserving positivity of density or <b>pressure,</b> a positivity-preserving <b>limiter</b> technique coupled with h-adaptive Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method is developed in this paper. Such a method is implemented to simulate flows with the large Mach number, strong shock/obstacle interactions and shock diffractions. The Cartesian grid with ghost cell immersed boundary method for arbitrarily complex geometries is also presented. This approach directly uses the cell solution polynomial of DG finite element space as the interpolation formula. The method is validated by the well documented test examples involving unsteady compressible flows through complex bodies over a large Mach numbers. The numerical results demonstrate the robustness and the versatility of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytic}} fluid model {{based on}} particle and momentum conservation describes {{the response of}} the scrape-off layer to an applied radial electric field. The model explains why the variation of plenum <b>pressure</b> during <b>limiter</b> biasing in TEXTOR shows the opposite behaviour as divertor biasing in Tokamak de Varennes: the mechanical baffles that define the throats of the pump limiter are aligned along the magnetic field, thus preventing collection of the induced perpendicular flux when the drift is directed towards the scoop. Rather, the optimal pumping is expected when the drift is directed away from the scoop due to the increase of the parallel flux needed to satisfy the Bohm-Chodura criterion. Qualitative agreement is obtained with measurements of the parallel flow near the limiter throat, and with measurements of the plenum pressure during negative biasing for both directions of toroidal magnetic field. The results, extrapolated to Tore Supra, predict that the actual design with throats should provide close to optimal pumping with minor modification of the natural radial electric field, but greater performance could be obtained with negative biasing if a toroidally symmetric neutralizer geometry were adopted...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental procedure for comparing different families of IC Engine lubricating pumps {{in terms of}} total consumed energy in a NEDC driving cycle. Measures are performed on a test rig able to reproduce the oil temperature profile, the lubrication circuit permeability and its variation during the engine warm-up. The pump under test is driven by a variable speed electric motor supplying the engine velocity profile of the driving cycle. The load on the pump is generated {{by means of a}} variable restrictor controlled in a closed loop by a proper combination of speed, temperature, flow rate and pressure signals in order to replicate the typical permeability of the lubricating circuit. The method has been applied to a 15 cc/rev crankshaft mounted gerotor pump for a medium displacement Diesel engine; the flow-pressure characteristics of the lubricating circuit at different temperatures and the oil heating rate measured on the engine have been supplied to the test rig control system. The reference pump has been contrasted with a crankshaft mounted variable displacement vane pump with absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>limiter</b> device and an off-axis external gear pump with the same displacement and pressure setting. Experimental tests bring to evidence the advantage of the variable displacement pump during short trips with cold start, while the external gear pump prevails at the end of NEDC cycle where highest engine speeds and oil temperatures are reached...|$|E
