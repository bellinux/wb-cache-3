Mitsou was seeking unspecified damages {{and an end}} to distribution of the song. [...] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2015, in a ruling that said that the song was a [...] "constitutionally <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> of art" [...] and the New York Civil Rights Law did not apply to it.|$|E
2500|$|Noted {{copyright}} authority Melville Nimmer describes {{two different}} tests for substantial similarity, [...] "fragmented literal similarity" [...] and [...] "comprehensive non-literal similarity", {{which have been}} widely adopted and utilized by U.S. courts. Either test {{may result in a}} finding of infringement. Fragmented literal similarity occurs when fragmented copyrightable elements are copied from a <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> in a manner not allowed by fair use. It is more limited than comprehensive copying, involving briefer elements such as a stanza of a song or an image. Comprehensive non-literal similarity may occur {{even in the absence of}} verbatim duplication of copyrighted elements when, in the words of J. Thomas McCarthy's McCarthy's Desk Encyclopedia of Intellectual Property, one work appropriates [...] "the fundamental structure or pattern" [...] of another. Justice John M. Walker, Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted in Arica v. Palmer that a court may find copyright infringement under the doctrine of [...] "comprehensive non-literal similarity" [...] if [...] "the pattern or sequence of the two works is similar".|$|E

50|$|Publication of an {{otherwise}} <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> by the U.S. government does not put that work in the public domain. For example, government publications may include works copyrighted by a contractor or grantee; copyrighted material assigned to the U.S. Government; or copyrighted information from other sources.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 1976 Copyright Act, {{copyright}} protection {{was provided by}} a dual system under both federal and state laws. Federal law provided [...] "statutory copyright" [...] {{and the laws of}} each state provided [...] "common law copyright." [...] Roughly speaking, the old [...] "statutory copyright" [...] <b>protected</b> <b>works</b> that were registered and the old [...] "common-law copyright" [...] <b>protected</b> unregistered <b>works.</b>|$|R

They successively describe the ongoing extension {{of the sense of}} <b>protected</b> <b>works,</b> the concomitant increase of incomes of property rights and the problems raised by the protection of these rights against piracy (Hadopi law), and finally the management perspectives of these rights by means of new legal licences controlled by companies in charge of collecting and distributing royalties (Sociétés de Perception et de Répartition des Droits - SPRD).

5000|$|The term [...] "author" [...] {{is used to}} {{designate}} the original creator(s) of any type of <b>protected</b> <b>work,</b> e.g., the artist, photographer, director, architect, etc. Where the author cannot be identified, e.g., for anonymous works and collective works, the copyright is exercised by the original publisher.|$|E
5000|$|Registration of a <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> is optional, but a Register of Intellectual Property (Registro de la Propiedad Intelectual) exists (see [...] "External links") for {{authors who}} wish to take {{advantage}} of it.

50|$|Copyright and {{trademark}} issues {{also found}} {{new life in}} the digital revolution. The widespread ability of consumers to produce and distribute exact reproductions of <b>protected</b> <b>works</b> dramatically changed the intellectual property landscape, especially in the music, film, and television industries.|$|R
50|$|Copyright {{law does}} not grant authors and {{publishers}} absolute control {{over the use of}} their work. Only certain types of works and certain kinds of uses are protected; only unauthorized uses of <b>protected</b> <b>works</b> can be said to be infringing.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the first question, an 11-word extract of a <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> is a reproduction in part {{within the meaning of}} Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC, if the words reproduced are the expression of the intellectual creation of the author. The ECJ stated that it was for the national courts of EU countries to decide when such a reproduction is the author's expression of intellectual creation.|$|E
50|$|Copyright {{infringement}} {{is the use}} {{of works}} protected by copyright law without permission, infringing certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder, such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform the <b>protected</b> <b>work,</b> or to make derivative works. The copyright holder is typically the work's creator, or a publisher or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.|$|E
50|$|Copyright is {{a bundle}} of rights given by the law to the creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and the {{producers}} of cinematograph films and sound recordings. The rights provided under Copyright law include the rights of reproduction of the work, communication of the work to the public, adaptation {{of the work and}} translation of the work. The scope and duration of protection provided under copyright law varies with the nature of the <b>protected</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

50|$|Section 43 of the Lanham Act governs false and {{misleading}} advertising, and can apply {{in some instances}} to attribution of <b>protected</b> <b>works.</b> However, it cannot {{be used to create}} moral rights for works outside of the Act. See Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox.|$|R
50|$|This {{amendment}} {{resulted in}} motion pictures being specifically {{added to the}} category of <b>protected</b> <b>works.</b> Prior to this amendment, United States copyright law did not protect nor register motion picture films.

50|$|The act {{creates a}} {{distinction}} between access-control measures and copy-control measures. An access-control measure limits access to {{the contents of the}} <b>protected</b> <b>work,</b> for example by encryption. A copy-control measure only limits the ability of a user to copy the work. Though the act makes it illegal to distribute technology to circumvent either type of copy protection, only the action of circumventing access-control measures is illegal. The action of circumventing a copy-control measure is not prohibited, though any copies made are still subject to other copyright law.|$|E
5000|$|An {{orphan work}} is a {{copyright}} <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> for which rightsholders are positively indeterminate or uncontactable. Sometimes {{the names of the}} originators or rightsholders are known, yet it is impossible to contact them because additional details cannot be found. [...] A work can become orphaned through rightsholders being unaware of their holding, or by their demise (e.g. deceased persons or defunct companies) and establishing inheritance has proved impracticable. In other cases, comprehensively diligent research fails to determine any authors, creators or originators for a work.|$|E

50|$|The Copyright Act {{automatically}} <b>protects</b> <b>works</b> {{created by}} South Africans or in South Africa.

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{retailers}} {{have used the}} take-down system of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act {{as a means to}} remove the offending price listings. This policy may come from the fear that competitors will slash prices, and shoppers may comparison shop. The actual validity of the claim that prices form a <b>protected</b> <b>work</b> of authorship is uncertain as the prices themselves (though not the advertisements) might be considered a fact in which case they would not receive the same level of protection as a copyrighted work.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} cases, Kelly objected to linking because it caused users to bypass his home page and {{intervening}} pages. He was unable, however, to show substantial economic harm. Kelly argued largely that {{the part of}} the copyright statute violated was the public display right ((5)). He was aware of the difficulties under the reproduction and distribution provisions (17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1) and (3)), which require proof that the accused infringer trafficked in copies of the <b>protected</b> <b>work.</b> The court focused on the fair use defense, however, under which it ruled in Arriba's favor.|$|E
5000|$|Anyone who [...] "knowingly uses or {{attempts}} {{to use an}} audiovisual recording device to transmit or make {{a copy of a}} ... <b>protected</b> <b>work...</b> from a performance of such work in a motion picture exhibition facility..."

50|$|While the United States was refusing any {{protection}} for foreign literary works, {{more and more}} countries in Europe started adapting the principle of “national treatment”.
