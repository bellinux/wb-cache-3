40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of in-vitro planktonic and immobilised cell models for determining the antimicrobial efficacy of common antimicrobial wound dressings. Methods and Results: Five strains of A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (MRSA) were tested against four antimicrobial wound dressings containing silver, honey or PHMB, using both a planktonic and immobilised cell model. Across all species and models used, the NSCD demonstrated the best antimicrobial activity being as good if not better than all the other dressings. The <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> model was less effective at differentiating the dressings on antimicrobial performance as the immobilised cell model indicating that a diffusion barrier had a significant impact on the performance of some dressings. In the presence of the diffusion barrier antimicrobial impact of the Honey and PHMB dressings was significantly reduced particularly in the case of A. baumannii. Activity was at least an order of magnitude lower in the immobilised cell model vs. the <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> model. Conclusions: The use of a <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> model within standard tests may overestimate the efficacy of honey and PHMB. The use of an immobilised cell model provides a more demanding test for antimicrobial dressings allowing dressing to dressing and pathogen to pathogen differences to be more clearly quantified. Significance and Impact of study: The introduction of planktonic and immobilised cell models as part of testing regimens for wound dressings will provide a more thorough understanding of their antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} and an opportunistic human pathogen that causes chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals. These infections {{are hard to}} treat, {{partly due to the}} high intrinsic resistance of the bacterium to clinically used antibiotics and partly due to the formation of antibiotic-tolerant biofilms.

40|$|Objectives In {{the present}} study, the {{effectiveness}} of Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (PACT) was evaluated on <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> and biofilms of five Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates. Methods <b>Planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> and biofilms of E. faecalis E 2, E 3, ER 3 / 2 s, OS 16 and AA-OR 34 were grown in SDMY medium plus 0. 4 % glucose. Approximately 5. 0 × 107 CFU <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> and 24 h biofilms were subjected to PACT using the combination of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs, Biotable®) and Photogem®. The metabolic activity of bacterial cells was evaluated by a resazurin assay. Biomass values of the biofilms were determined by a crystal violet assay. Results Compared to the water-treated control group, gradual increases of light energy led to greater reduction of metabolic activity of <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> and biofilms of E. faecalis when the combination of LEDs and Photogem® was applied. Photogem® alone significantly reduced the metabolic activity of <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas LEDs or Photogem® alone {{did not result in}} biofilm viability changes.

Differential growth rates in biofilms are often referred to, particularly {{in response to}} limited diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. We observed growth rates of attached Pseudomonas sp. strain CT 07 cells that were notably higher than the maximum specific growth rate measured in batch culture. Despite dilution rates in continuous flow cells that exceeded the maximum planktonic specific growth rate by 58 times, sampling of the effluent revealed > 109 cells ml- 1, suggesting that biofilms function {{as a source of}} planktonic cells through high cell yield and detachment. Further investigation demonstrated considerable <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> yield from biofilms as young as 6 h, indicating that detachment is not limited to established biofilms.

Biofilm-issued <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> promote blood-borne, secondary sites of infection by the inoculation of the infected sites with bacteria from the intravascular space. To investigate the potential role of early detachment events in initiating secondary infections, we studied the phenotypic attributes of Staphylococcus aureus <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> eroding from biofilms with respect to expression of the collagen adhesin, CNA. The collagen-binding abilities of S. aureus have been correlated to the development of osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. In this study, we focused on the impact of CNA expression on S. aureus adhesion to immobilized collagen in vitro under physiologically relevant shear forces. In contrast to the growth phase-dependent adhesion properties characteristic of S. aureus cells grown in suspension, eroding <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> expressed invariant and lower effective adhesion rates regardless of the age of the biofilm from which they originated. These results correlated directly with the surface expression level of CNA.

40|$|NanoSpain 2017 Salmonella enterica is {{responsible}} {{for the majority of the}} reported foodborne outbreaks, and that is why it is considered one of the most important foodborne pathogens nowadays [1]. Like many others bacteria, S. enterica can survive disinfection and resist a wide variety of biocidal agents [2]. Nowadays, the synthesis of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and its application in magnetic hyperthermia (MH) is of great interest, with MH being recently reported as a viable alternative to traditional disinfection methods against bacteria [3]. However, fundamental studies comprising the MH effect on different populations of planktonic cells and biofilm cells are scarce. Therefore, this work aimed at evaluating the effect of MH on different populations of planktonic cells and biofilms of S. enterica. The work was performed using a S. enterica collection strain (NCTC 13349), which different <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> populations (lag, exponential, and stacionary phase) were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml, while biofilms were formed in silicone coupons. Samples containing both magnetite nanoparticles and S. enterica cells or biofilms have been subjected to an alternating magnetic field of chosen amplitude 100 Oe with frequency of 873 kHz until different temperatures were reached. In order to evaluate the bactericidal effect of MH, survival of planktonic and biofilm cells was determined by colony forming unit (CFU) enumeration. Based on the most relevant results, cell membrane integrity and the effects of MH on cells surface and biofilm structure were analysed through microscopy techniques. Results showed that the high structural-magnetic quality magnetite nanoparticles used were effective against all <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> populations and biofilms under an oscillating magnetic field. In fact, MNPs-based hyperthermia was able to promote a significant cell viability reduction on all <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> populations both bacterial lyfe styles. Nonetheless, planktonic cells were more tolerant to MH than biofilms, possibly due to diffusion limitations along these bacterial communities. Microscopy images of planktonic cells and biofilms showed that MH can affect cell membrane integrity as well as the biofilms structure. In conclusion, this work presents evidences of the bactericidal effect of MH produced by MNPs against S. enterica, both regarding planktonic populations and biofilms. This ability of MH to control a major foodborne pathogen constitutes a novel contribution to the finding of new useful applications of hyperthermia. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

In these cases, both DET and indirect electron transfer through exogenous electron shuttle, H 2 may be performed in the MES system(Tremblay and Zhang 2015).

However, we noticed that the total coulombic efficiency, of the MES system, decreased with the decrease in cathodic potential. At a potential of −  0.6  V, the total coulomb efficiency was 84 %, while at a potential of −  1.2  V, the total coulombic efficiency dropped to only 37.8 %. This drop {{might be due to}} the relative low CO 2 transformation efficiency of the C. scatologenes <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell.</b> As the cathodic potential decreases, the H 2 evolution rate increases. The H 2 utilization rate of the C. scatologenes <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> was lower than the H 2 evolution rate in the cathodic chamber, thereby leading to the accumulation of H 2 and the decrease in coulombic efficiency of the MES system.

40|$|Biofilms are {{considered}} to be highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. Strictly speaking, this is not the case—biofilms do not grow in the presence of antimicrobials any better than do <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells.</b> Biofilms are indeed highly resistant to killing by bactericidal antimicrobials, compared to logarithmic-phase <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells,</b> and therefore exhibit tolerance. It is assumed that biofilms are also significantly more tolerant than stationary-phase <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells.</b> A detailed comparative examination of tolerance of biofilms versus stationary- and logarithmic-phase <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> with four different antimicrobial agents was performed in this study. Carbenicillin appeared to be completely ineffective against both stationary-phase cells and biofilms. Killing by this β-lactam antibiotic depends on rapid growth, and this result confirms the notion of slow-growing biofilms resembling the stationary state. Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that kills nongrowing cells, and biofilms and stationary-phase cells were comparably tolerant to this antibiotic. The majority of cells in both populations were eradicated at low levels of ofloxacin, leaving a fraction of essentially invulnerable persisters. The bulk of the population in both biofilm and stationary-phase cultures was tolerant to tobramycin. At very high tobramycin concentrations, a fraction of persister cells became apparent in stationary-phase culture. Stationary-phase cells were more tolerant to the biocide peracetic acid than were biofilms. In general, stationary-phase cells were somewhat more tolerant than biofilms in all of the cases examined. We concluded that, at least for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the model organisms for biofilm studies, the notion that biofilms have greater resistance than do <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> is unwarranted. We further suggest that tolerance to antibiotics in stationary-phase or biofilm cultures is largely dependent on the presence of persister cells...|$|R
40|$|Assembly of {{bacterial}} flagella is developmentally important during both <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> growth and biofilm formation. Flagellar biogenesis is complex, requiring coordinated expression of over 40 genes, and normally commences during the log-to-stationary transition phase. We describe here a novel membrane-localized regulator, MorA, {{that controls the}} timing of flagellar development and affects motility, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas putida. MorA is conserved among diverse Pseudomonas species, and homologues are present in all Pseudomonas genomes sequenced thus far. In P. putida, the absence of MorA derepresses flagellar development, which leads to constitutive formation of flagella in the mutant cells in all growth phases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the absence of MorA led {{to a reduction in}} biofilm formation. However, unlike the motility of P. putida, the motility of the P. aeruginosa mutants was unaffected. Our data illustrate a novel developmentally regulated sensory and signaling pathway for several properties required for virulence and ecological fitness of Pseudomonas species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Microbial biofilms exist {{all over}} the natural world, a {{distribution}} that is paralleled by metal cations and oxyanions. Despite this reality, very {{few studies have examined}} how biofilms withstand exposure to these toxic compounds. This article describes a batch culture technique for biofilm and <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> metal susceptibility testing using the MBEC assay. This device is compatible with standard 96 -well microtiter plate technology. As part of this method, a two part, metal specific neutralization protocol is summarized. This procedure minimizes residual biological toxicity arising from the carry-over of metals from challenge to recovery media. Neutralization consists of treating cultures with a chemical compound known to react with or to chelate the metal. Treated cultures are plated onto rich agar to allow metal complexes to diffuse into the recovery medium while bacteria remain on top to recover. Two difficulties associated with metal susceptibility testing were the focus of two applications of this technique. First, assays were calibrated to allow comparisons of the susceptibility of different organisms to metals. Second, the effects of exposure time and growth medium composition on the susceptibility of E. coli JM 109 biofilms to metals were investigated. Results This high-throughput method generated 96 -statistically equivalent biofilms in a single device and thus allowed for comparative and combinatorial experiments of media, microbial strains, exposure times and metals. By adjusting growth conditions, it was possible to examine biofilms of different microorganisms that had similar cell densities. In one example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was up to 80 times more resistant to heavy metalloid oxyanions than Escherichia coli TG 1. Further, biofilms were up to 133 times more tolerant to tellurite (TeO 3 2 -) than corresponding planktonic cultures. Regardless of the growth medium, the tolerance of biofilm and <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> E. coli JM 109 to metals was time-dependent. Conclusion This method results in accurate, easily reproducible comparisons between the susceptibility of planktonic cells and biofilms to metals. Further, it was possible to make direct comparisons of the ability of different microbial strains to withstand metal toxicity. The data presented here also indicate that exposure time is an important variable in metal susceptibility testing of bacteria. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{biofouling}} simulation system {{consisting of}} a flow cell and a recirculation tank was used. The fluid circulates at a flow rate of 350 [*]L⋅[*]h− 1 in a semicircular flow cell with hydraulic diameter of 18. 3 [*]mm, corresponding to an average velocity of 0. 275 [*]m⋅[*]s− 1. Using computational fluid dynamics for flow simulation, an average wall shear stress of 0. 4 [*]Pa was predicted. The validity of the numerical simulations was visually confirmed by inorganic deposit formation (using kaolin particles) and also by direct observation of pathlines of tracer PVC particles using streak photography. Furthermore, the validity of chemostat assumptions was verified by residence time analysis. The system {{was used to assess}} the influence of the dilution rate on biofilm formation by Escherichia coli JM 109 (DE 3). Two dilution rates of 0. 013 and 0. 0043 [*]h− 1 were tested and the results show that the <b>planktonic</b> <b>cell</b> concentration is increased at the lower dilution rate and that no significant changes were detected on the amount of biofilm formed in both conditions...|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of growth conditions such as the temperature (20, 30 and 37  °C), incubation duration (24 and 48  h) and surface type (stainless steel and polycarbonate) on the cell surface physicochemical properties and adhesion to abiotic surfaces of biofilm-detached and <b>planktonic</b> Staphylococcus aureus <b>cells.</b> This study tested also the hypothesis that S. aureus <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit distinct pathogenic properties compared with their sessile counterparts. The results showed that the changes of the growth conditions promoted changes in the zeta potential, hydrophobicity, electron donor/acceptor character of the studied cell populations. Biofilm-detached cells showed a greater adhesion to stainless steel and polycarbonate compared with <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells.</b> Compared with <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells,</b> sessile ones showed higher cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells, DNase activity, and siderophore levels. The higher cytotoxic effect and production of DNase and siderophore increased with the increase of temperature and duration of incubations. Based on the obtained data, the S. aureus biofilm-detached cells were found to be distinct in many physiological properties compared with their planktonic counterparts.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physiology and behaviour following treatment with ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), of Pseudomonas fluorescens in both the planktonic and sessile states. Steady-state biofilms and <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> were collected from a bioreactor and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted using a method that did not destroy the cells. Cell structure and physiology after EPS extraction were compared in terms of respiratory activity, morphology, cell protein and polysaccharide content, and expression of the outer membrane proteins (OMP). Significant {{differences were found between}} the physiological parameters analysed. <b>Planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> were more metabolically active, and contained greater amounts of proteins and polysaccharides than biofilm cells. Moreover, biofilm formation promoted the expression of distinct OMP. Additional experiments were performed with cells after EPS extraction in order to compare the susceptibility of <b>planktonic</b> and biofilm <b>cells</b> to OPA. Cells were completely inactivated after exposure to the biocide (minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC 0. 55 + 0. 20 mM for planktonic cells; MBC 1. 7 + 0. 30 mM for biofilm cells). After treatment, the potential of inactivated cells to recover from antimicrobial exposure was evaluated over time. <b>Planktonic</b> <b>cells</b> remained inactive over 48 h while cells from biofilms recovered 24 h after exposure to OPA, and the number of viable and culturable cells increased over time. The MBC of the recovered biofilm cells after a second exposure to OPA was 0. 58 + 0. 40 mM, a concentration similar to the MBC of <b>planktonic</b> <b>cells.</b> This study demonstrates that persiste...|$|R
