40|$|High-resolution {{manometry}} {{capable of}} pressure monitoring from the pharynx to the stomach together with <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> plotting represents an unquestionable evolution in oesophageal manometry. However, with this advanced technology come challenges {{and one of}} those is devising the optimal scheme to apply high-resolution oesophageal <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> (HROPT) to the clinical evaluation of patients. The first iteration of the Chicago classification was based on a systematic analysis of motility patterns in 75 control subjects and 400 consecutive patients. This review summarizes the analysis process as it has evolved. Individual swallows are analysed in a stepwise fashion for the morphology of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ), the extent of OGJ relaxation, the propagation velocity of peristalsis, the vigour of the peristaltic contraction, and abnormalities of intrabolus pressure utilizing metrics that have now been customized to HROPT. These results are then synthesized into a comprehensive diagnosis that, although based on conventional manometry criteria, is also customized to HROPT measures. The resultant classification objectifies the identification of three unique subtypes of achalasia. Additionally, it provides enhanced detail in the description of distal oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus subtypes, and OGJ obstruction. It is our expectation that modification of this classification scheme will continue to occur and this should further clarify the utility of <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> plotting in assessing oesophageal motility disorder...|$|E

The occurrence of dynamic stall at all but the inboard station (30 % span) shows good quantitative agreement with the theoretical limits on inflow velocity and yaw that should yield dynamic stall events. A full three-dimensional characterization of the surface <b>pressure</b> <b>topographies</b> combined with flow visualization data from surface mounted tufts offer key insights into the three-dimensional processes involved in the unsteady separation process and may help to explain the discrepancies observed with force measurements at 30 % span.

Recently, high-resolution esophageal <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> (HREPT) has been introduced and is now considered as the new standard to study esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function. In this study we performed a head-to-head comparison between HREPT and conventional sleeve manometry {{for the detection of}} TLESRs. A setup with two synchronized MMS-solar systems was used. A solid state HREPT catheter, a water-perfused sleeve catheter, and a multi intraluminal impedance pH (MII-pH) catheter were introduced in 10 healthy volunteers (M 6 F 4, age 19 - 56). Subjects were studied 0. 5 h before and 3 h after ingestion of a standardized meal. Tracings were blinded and analyzed by the three authors according to the TLESR criteria. In the HREPT mode 156 TLESRs were scored, vs 143 during sleeve manometry (P = 0. 10). Hundred and twenty-three TLESRs were scored by both techniques. Of all TLESRs (177), 138 were associated with reflux (78 %). High-resolution esophageal <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> detected significantly more TLESRs associated with a reflux event (132 vs 119, P = 0. 015) resulting in a sensitivity for detection of TLESRs with reflux of 96 % compared to 86 % respectively. Analysis of the discordant TLESRs associated with reflux showed that TLESRs were missed by sleeve manometry due to low basal LES pressure (N = 5), unstable pharyngeal signal (N = 4), and residual sleeve pressure > 2 mmHg (N = 10).

First, the introduction of high-resolution manometry with <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> plotting as a new diagnostic tool has made it possible to classify achalasia into three subtypes. The most favorable outcome is predicted for patients receiving treatment for type II achalasia (achalasia with compression).

Second, the first multicenter randomized controlled trial published by the European Achalasia Trial group reported 2 -year follow-up results indicating that laparoscopic Heller myotomy was not superior to endoscopic pneumatic dilation (PD). Although the follow-up period was not long enough to reach a convincing conclusion, it merits the continued use of PD as a generally available technique in gastroenterology. Third, the novel endoscopic technique peroral endoscopic myotomy is a promising option for treating achalasia, but it requires increased experience and cautious evaluation.

40|$|Achalasia is a {{neurodegenerative}} motility {{disorder of}} the oesophagus resulting in deranged oesophageal peristalsis and loss of lower oesophageal sphincter function. Historically, annual achalasia incidence rates {{were believed to be}} low, approximately 0. 5 - 1. 2 per 100000. More recent reports suggest that annual incidence rates have risen to 1. 6 per 100000 in some populations. The aetiology of achalasia is still unclear but is likely to be multi-factorial. Suggested causes include environmental or viral exposures resulting in inflammation of the oesophageal myenteric plexus, which elicits an autoimmune response. Risk of achalasia may be elevated in a sub-group of genetically susceptible people. Improvement in the diagnosis of achalasia, through the introduction of high resolution manometry with <b>pressure</b> <b>topography</b> plotting, has resulted {{in the development of a}} novel classification system for achalasia. This classification system can evaluate patient prognosis and predict responsiveness to treatment. There is currently much debate over whether pneumatic dilatation is a superior method compared to the Heller&#x 2019;s myotomy procedure in the treatment of achalasia. A recent comparative study found equal efficacy, suggesting that patient preference and local expertise should guide the choice. Although achalasia is a relatively rare condition, it carries a risk of complications, including aspiration pneumonia and oesophageal cancer. The risk of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is believed to be significantly increased in patients with achalasia, however the absolute excess risk is small.

40|$|Esophageal {{achalasia}} is {{a primary}} motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphinc ter relaxation and absence of esophageal peristalsis leading to impa ired bolus transit, manifested with symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, and weight loss.

Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, reproducibility and inter-observer agreement of HRM for the detection of tLESRs, in comparison with PSM. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent HRM alone and on a separate occasion with PSM simultaneously. LES pressure was monitored for 1 hour during fasting and 2 hours postprandial. Criteria for tLESRs were defined by characterizing spontaneous LES relaxation associated with common cavity, and then applied to all spontaneous LES relaxations. Inter observer agreement and the rates of tLESRs detected by HRM and PSM were compared. Results: New HRM criteria for the detection of tLESRs have been established. A similar number of tLESRs were identified during the 2 HRM recordings (median per subject 15 and 13 (p= 0. 07), and less with PSM (median per subject 11, p< 0. 01). The overall concordance rate between the 2 procedures was substantial (kappa= 0. 61). The inter-observer agreement was almost perfect (kappa= 0. 83) with HRM and only fair (kappa= 0. 38) with PSM.

Twenty-five patients were not treated, and 25 patients were treated (11 by pneumatic dilation, 14 by myotomy). Nonparametric testing {{was used to assess}} differences among groups of treated patients (10 had type 1 achalasia and 15 had type 2 achalasia), and the Pearson correlation was used to assess their relationship. There {{were no significant differences in}} TBE measurements between patient groups. Of the 25 patients who received treatment, 10 had a manometric pattern consistent with persistent achalasia after treatment (6 patients with type 1 and 4 patients with type 2 achalasia), whereas 15 appeared to have resolved the achalasia pattern (peristalsis was absent in 8 patients and weak in 7 patients). The height of the barium column at 5 minutes and Eckardt Scores were reduced significantly in patients who had resolved their achalasia pattern, based on HRM. The integrated relaxation pressure and the TBE column height correlated at 5 minutes (r = 0. 422; P <. 05). Patients who resolved their achalasia pattern, based on HRM, showed improved emptying based on TBE measurements and improved symptom scores. There was no significant difference between patients with type 1 or type 2 achalasia in TBEs. These findings indicate that normalization of the integrated relaxation pressure on HRM is a clinically relevant objective of treatment for achalasi...|$|E
50|$|Hydrostatic models {{filter out}} {{vertically}} moving acoustic waves from the vertical momentum equation, which significantly increases the time step used within the model's run. This {{is known as}} the hydrostatic approximation. Hydrostatic models use either pressure or sigma-pressure vertical coordinates. <b>Pressure</b> coordinates intersect <b>topography</b> while sigma coordinates follow the contour of the land. Its hydrostatic assumption is reasonable as long as horizontal grid resolution is not small, which is a scale where the hydrostatic assumption fails. Models which use the entire vertical momentum equation are known as nonhydrostatic. A nonhydrostatic model can be solved anelastically, meaning it solves the complete continuity equation for air assuming it is incompressible, or elastically, meaning it solves the complete continuity equation for air and is fully compressible. Nonhydrostatic models use altitude or sigma altitude for their vertical coordinates. Altitude coordinates can intersect land while sigma-altitude coordinates follow the contours of the land.|$|R
40|$|Purpose:The cornea is the {{principal}} optical element of the eye so the regularity of its surface topography is critical for visual optics. However the cornea {{is known to be}} susceptible to forces exerted by the eyelids. These corneal changes are bands of 'wave-like' change that are parallel to the position of the eyelid margin. There is little known about eyelid pressure on the cornea which is dependent on eyelid force and the contact area. By analysing the depth and width of corneal topography changes after various downward gaze tasks, inferences could be drawn about upper and lower eyelid <b>pressure.</b> Methods:Corneal <b>topography</b> changes due to eyelid pressure were measured using the Medmont E 300 Corneal Topographer (Medmont Pty. Ltd. Victoria, Australia), for eighteen subjects aged between 18 and 29 years. Four conditions were considered, consisting of two downward gaze angles (20 ° and 40 °) and two visual tasks (reading and staring). The amplitude and width of the ‘wave-like’ changes were analysed {{for each of the four}} conditions and for both upper and lower eyelids. Anterior eye digital photography was used to determine the position of the eyelids in downward gaze and the width of Marx's line. Results:For each condition the average peak-to-valley amplitudes of corneal change were between 1. 4 and 2. 4 µm. For the upper eyelid, the downward gaze angle magnitude had a significant impact on the peak-to-valley amplitude (p< 0. 001), with corneal changes after the 40 ° tasks being 25...|$|R
40|$|Bottom topography, or more {{generally}} {{the geometry of}} the ocean basins, is an important ingredient in numer-ical ocean modeling. With {{the help of an}} adjoint model, it is shown that scalar diagnostics or objective functions in a coarse resolution model, such as the transport through Drake Passage, the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the Deacon cell, and the meridional heat transport across 32 ◦S, are sensitive to bottom topography as much as they are to surface boundary conditions. For example, adjoint topography sensitivities of the transport through Drake Passage are large in choke point areas such as the Crozet-Kerguélen Plateau and south of New Zealand; the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is sensitive to topography in the western boundary region of the North Atlantic Ocean and along the Scotland-Iceland ridge. Many sensitivities are con-nected to steep topography and can be interpreted in terms of bottom form stress, that is, the product of bottom <b>pressure</b> and <b>topography</b> gradient. The adjoint sensitivities are found to agree to direct perturbation methods with deviations smaller than 30 % for significant perturbations on time scales of 100 years, so that the assump-tion of quasi-linearity that is implicit to the adjoint method holds. The horizontal resolution of the numerical model affects the sensitivities to bottom topography, but large scale patterns and the overall impact of changes in topography appear to be robust. The relative impact of changes in topography and surface boundary condition...|$|R
