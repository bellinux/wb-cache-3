50|$|In accounting, a {{business}} or an organization and its owners {{are treated as}} two separately identifiable parties. This is called the entity concept. The business stands apart from other organizations as a separate economic unit. It is necessary to record the business's transactions separately, to distinguish them from the owners' <b>personal</b> <b>transactions.</b> This helps to give a correct determination of the true financial condition of the business. This concept can be extended to accounting separately for the various divisions of {{a business}} in order to ascertain the financial results for each division.|$|E

50|$|An {{example is}} a sole trader or one-man {{business}}(proprietorship): the sole trader takes money from the business by way of 'drawings': money for his own personal use. Despite it being his business and technically his money, there are still two aspects to the transaction: the business is 'giving' money and the individual is 'receiving' money. Even {{though there is no}} other legal distinction between the sole trader and the business, and the sole trader is liable for all of the debts of the business, business transactions will probably still be taxed separately from <b>personal</b> <b>transactions,</b> and the proprietor of the business may also find it useful to see the financial results of the business. For these reasons, the affairs of the individuals behind a business should be kept separate from the affairs of the business itself.|$|E

Allowing for a more defined collection of statistical data of consumer buying and spending habits, this data is collected from real purchases which makes it reliable.|$|E
40|$|How can {{we measure}} {{and compare the}} {{relative}} performance of production units? If input and output variables are one dimensional, then the simplest way is to compute efficiency by calculating and comparing the ratio of output and input for each production unit. This idea is inappropriate though, when multiple inputs or multiple outputs are observed. Consider a bank, for example, with three branches A, B, and C. The branches take the number of staff as the input, and measures outputs such {{as the number of}} transactions on personal and business accounts. Assume that the following statistics are observed: Branch A: 60000 <b>personal</b> <b>transactions,</b> 50000 business transactions, 25 people on staff, Branch B: 50000 <b>personal</b> <b>transactions,</b> 25000 business transactions, 15 people on staff, Branch C: 45000 <b>personal</b> <b>transactions,</b> 15000 business transactions, 10 people on staff. We observe that Branch C performed best in terms of <b>personal</b> <b>transactions</b> per staff, whereas Branch A has the highest ratio of business transactions per staff. By contrast Branch B performed better than Branch A in terms of <b>personal</b> <b>transactions</b> per staff, and better than Branch C in terms of business transactions per staff. How can we compare these business units in a fair way? Moreover, can we possibly create a virtual branch that reflects the input/output mechanism and thus creates a scale for the real branches? Productivity analysis provides a systematic approach to these problems. We review the basic concepts of productivity analysis and two popular methods DEA and FDH, which are given in Sections 12. 1 and 12. 2, respectively.

40|$|Abstract— With the {{accessing}} {{of millions}} of web pages for business and <b>personal</b> <b>transactions,</b> huge amounts of web page access data have been stored in web servers. The existing web pattern mining systems do not provide the necessary tools and functionality to capture all stored distributed web page sequences easily.

Through the approach described {{in this paper we}} address the important data mining problem of sequential web pattern access. We present an approach for mining the sequential web patterns with Distributed mining model. Here the environment under consideration is the one where raw input data is collected from number of web servers at distributed locations. This approach is a combination of distributed concept for web personalization. It utilizes the concept of WAP algorithm and provides ease of getting web sequential patterns enhancing “Web Service Resource Framework”...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that shareholders in the early railway companies were highly dependent upon the honesty and competence of their directors, that there was extensive scope for abuse and that numerous frauds were perpetrated, particularly during the railway mania of 1845 - 7. George Hudson's fraudulent activities are widely referred to, although the literature is, in general, more concerned with Hudson's manipulations of company accounts than with his misuse of the assets {{he was able to}} control as an agent of shareholder interests. At the time, however, Hudson's acts of self-enrichment and his defence of personal responsibility were as important as his accounting manipulations, not least because they posed an important and highly publicized challenge to tentatively formed notions of how directors should act. This paper concentrates on Hudson's dealings with and on behalf of his four major railway companies, analyses his <b>personal</b> <b>transactions</b> and then considers the influence of Hudson's personal frauds and ideas of personal responsibility on the evolution of early, and rather poorly formed, legal conceptions of directorial responsibility.
