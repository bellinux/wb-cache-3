40|$|Wavefront shaping has {{revolutionized}} imaging deep in scattering media, {{being able}} to spatially and temporally refocus light through or inside the medium. However, wavefront shaping is not compatible yet with polarization-resolved microscopy given the need of <b>polarizing</b> <b>optics</b> to refocus light with a controlled polarization state.

40|$|Circular dichroism (CD) {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important tool {{in the study of}} biological molecules as it enables structural information to be obtained nondestructively on solution-phase samples. However, sample requirements for CD are often seen as being too high with protein backbone measurements in standard cuvettes typically requiring ~ 100 – 300 μL of 0. 1 mg/ml protein. To address this issue, we have designed a new form of CD sample holder, which reduces the sample requirements of the technique by two orders of magnitude, with a sample requirement of less than 3 μl. This sample saving has been achieved through the use of extruded quartz capillaries, the sample being held within the internal diameter of the quartz capillary through capillary action. The extruded quartz capillaries exhibit remarkably little birefringence, although still transmitting high energy UV circularly <b>polarized</b> light.

Polarized Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is one of the most important factors used to represent the property of the surface. It uses a 4 x 4 matrix (Mueller matrix) to describe the properties of the light scattered from the surface. In order to measure the Mueller matrix of the samples, a new three axis automated scatterometer has been developed to measure the Mueller matrix of painted surfaces. It can do measurement at any illumination and viewing geometric of the hemisphere and it is more convenient for far-field measurement is presented. The design of the instrument is different to the traditional scatterometer. The significant characteristic of the instrument is that the detector and polarization analyzer are fixed, while the source and the incident optical elements rotate on a stage together. All the possible incident and viewing positions can be reached through the rotation of three motors. The rotations of the motors are fed back through photoelectric- encoders, the "closed loop" control mode ensured the precision of the position.

In passive and active control applications, it is useful to separate each of these components in order to evaluate their contribution to the total structural power flowing through the beam. In this paper, a twisted z-shaped beam is used in order to allow the three types of waves to propagate. The contributions of the structural intensity, due to these waves, are computed from measurements taken over the surface of the beam with a simple homodyne interferometric laser vibrometer. The optical sensor incorporates some <b>polarizing</b> <b>optics,</b> additional to a Michelson type interferometer, to generate two optical signals in quadrature, which are processed to display velocities and/or displacements.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{interest}} in polarization modulated x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy techniques. In particular, the importance of photon helicity in spin-dependent magnetic interactions has expanded the need for high quality circularly polarized x-ray sources with fast switching capabilities. Because circularly polarized photons couple differently with the magnetic moment of an atom than do neutrons, they are able to provide unique magnetic information not accessible by neutron techniques. The development of experiments utilizing circularly polarized x-rays, however, has been hampered by the lack of efficient sources. Two different approaches for the production of circularly polarized x-rays have attracted the most attention; (i) employing specialized insertion devices, and (ii) utilizing x-ray phase retarders based on perfect crystal optics. For soft x-rays (0. 1 [...] 3. 0 keV), source development has centered primarily on insertion devices because there are currently no crystal or multilayer <b>polarizing</b> <b>optics</b> available that cover that full energy range. For harder x-rays (> 3. 0 keV), however, phase retarding optics have been demonstrated, but whether these optics or insertion devices provide the most efficient circularly polarized x-ray source in this energy regime has remained a matter of contention. Advocates of each method have made qualitative statements about their advantages, i. e., insertion devices provide a larger flux and phase retarders provide a higher degree of circular polarization, yet a detailed quantitative comparison has been lacking. In this paper, we attempt to provide such a comparison by examining the efficiencies of an elliptical multipole wiggler (EMW) and a standard undulator followed by phase retarding crystal optics...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Applied Optics and the definitive published version is available at [URL] a recent publication [3 rd International Conference on Surface Metrology, Annecy, France, 2012, p. 1] it was shown that surface roughness measurements made using a focus variation microscope (FVM) are influenced by surface tilt. The effect appears to be most significant when the surface has microscale roughness (Ra ≈ 50 nm) that is sufficient to provide a diffusely scattered signal that is comparable in magnitude to the specular component. This paper explores, from first principles, image formation using the focus variation method. With the assumption of incoherent scattering, it is shown that the process is linear and the 3 D point spread characteristics and transfer characteristics of the instrument are well defined. It is argued that, for the case of micro-scale roughness and through the objective illumination, the assumption of incoherence cannot be justified and more rigorous analysis is required. Using a foil model of surface scattering the images that are recorded by a FVM have been calculated. It is shown that for the case of through the objective illumination at small tilt angles, the signal quality is degraded in a systematic manner. This is attributed to the mixing of specular and diffusely reflected components and leads to an asymmetry in the k-space representation of the output signals. It is shown that by using extra-aperture illumination or at tilt angles greater than the acceptance angle of aperture (such that the specular component is lost), the incoherent assumption can be justified once again.

Riv. and Riv., seen under the light microscope is described. Fibre cells differentiated from cells of the procambium, whilst the parenchyma cells differentiated from cells of the primary thickening meristem which surround the procambium strands. Three stages of early fibre and parenchyma cell development were identified and these are referred to in subsequent studies of cell wall development. The cytology of developing internodal fibre and parenchyma cells seen under the transmission electron microscope (TEM) is described. There were few ultrastructural features to distinguish the two cell types. Thiery's PATAg test was performed to identify organelles which {{may be associated with}} the synthesis of polysaccharides destined for the cell wall. The ultrastructural results are discussed in terms of the process of cell wall deposition. Observations were made of cytoskeletal elements using indirect immunofluorescence techniques. Orientations of cortical microtubules differed from those of the microfilaments throughout early development. Filaments on the inner walls of cells seen under the conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM) were cytoskeletal-like in their orientation and form. Immunogold labelling techniques were performed in an attempt to confirm their identity. Staining with safranin and alcian blue allowed an anatomical description of wall development in fibre and parenchyma cells. These studies were coupled with observations using <b>polarizing</b> <b>optics</b> where cellulose microfibril orientations of the primary and secondary wall layers were established. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used to describe microfibril orientations seen on the inner wall of developing and maturing fibre and parenchyma cells. Chemical extraction of wall matrix materials was necessary for maturing tiss...|$|E
