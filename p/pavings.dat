25|$|Very early {{dates for}} Bell Beakers {{were found in}} Castelo Velho de Freixo de Numão in Guarda, {{northern}} Portugal. The site was located on the summit of a spur. A short-lived first occupation of pre-Bell Beaker building phase about 3000 BC revealed {{the remains of a}} tower, some <b>pavings</b> and structures for burning. After a break of one or two centuries, Bell Beaker pottery was introduced in a second building phase that lasted to the Early Bronze Age, about 1800 BC. A third building phase followed directly and lasted to about 1300 BC, after which the site was covered with layers of stone and clay, apparently deliberately, and abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, {{in which their}} presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are either caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under driveways, foundations, lawns, edges of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in driveways, <b>pavings</b> and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, yard plants, and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from saturated soil.|$|E

In 1876, asphalt-based paving was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial. Asphalt was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Paving [1] is an {{automated}} mesh generation algorithm which produces all-quadrilateral elements. It can additionally generate these elements in varying sizes {{such that the}} resulting mesh adapts to a function distribution, such as an error function. While powerful, conventional paving is a very serial algorithm in its operation. Parallel paving is the extension of serial paving into parallel environments to perform the same meshing functions as conventional paving only on distributed, discretized models. This extension allows large, adaptive, parallel finite element simulations {{to take advantage of}} <b>paving's</b> meshing capabilities for h-remap remeshing. A significantly modified version of the CUBIT [2] mesh generation code has been developed to host the parallel paving algorithm and demonstrate its capabilities on both two dimensional and three dimensional surface geometries and compare the resulting parallel produced meshes to conventionally paved meshes for mesh quality and algorithm perf [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Described as an {{arboreal}} nesting species, O.glaber {{lives in}} open or savannah woodland areas, nesting under stones, old dry logs, in hollow trees and plant stems, and rotten wood. Nests {{can also be}} constructed in buildings and structures, specifically in <b>pavings,</b> ceilings and walls. It is both diurnal and nocturnal, forming long trails from trees {{in search of food}} such as honeydew and insects. It has developed some associations with certain flowers and also tends to associate with some insects, such as mealybugs and aphids. During the nuptial flight, queens mate with either one or multiple males; males only mate with a single queen. Sometimes, a subset of a colony may leave the main colony for an alternative nest site as an act of dispersal. O.glaber often invades human homes to feed on household foods, and is considered a household pest. It has been intercepted numerous times in the United States, where {{it has the potential to}} disrupt the biological control of certain pests and cause long-term ecological impacts in areas where it is not native.|$|E

But Miriam could not escape them thus. In the morning {{and again in the}} afternoon she was able indeed, by creeping round it, to take refuge in the narrow line of shade thrown by the marble column to which she was made fast. At mid-day, however, it flung no shadow, so for all those dreadful hours she must pant in the burning heat without a drop of water to allay her thirst. Still she bore it till at length came evening and its cool.|$|E

50|$|The Highways Act 1555 (and {{subsequent}} Highways Act 1562) placed {{responsibility of}} road maintenance {{on the local}} parishes. The first turnpike trust in Suffolk was established in 1741 to improve the road from Ipswich to Scole via Claydon. An old milestone in Ipswich shows London as 69 mi and Gt Yarmouth 54 mi north. A daily coaching service to London operated at this time, but was expensive at 3d per mile according to Daniel Defoe and the journey took 10 hours in 1762. A map from 1766 shows the predecessor of the A12 road passing through Rumford, Burntwood, Chelmsford, Colchester, Ipswich, Woodbridge, Beckles and finally to Great Yarmouth. The 'Ipswich to South Town and Bungay Turnpike' Turnpike Trust was established in 1785, operating between Ipswich and Great Yarmouth. By 1800 Ipswich was a prosperous town {{with a population of}} 11,000 and an act of parliament titled 'IPSWICH. <b>PAVING</b> ACT 1793' formed a body of men called the Paving Commissioners who were responsible for 'paving, lighting, cleansing, and otherwise improving the Town of Ipswich'.

50|$|Although {{the tactile}} <b>pavings</b> were first {{installed}} in Okayama city in 1967 and were widely installed throughout Japan, tactile <b>pavings</b> were not standardized until 2001 by Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS). Tactile pavers are installed at almost all curb ramps in Japan. Directional tactile pavers are installed on sidewalk and pedestrian crossings frequently used by visually impaired {{people such as}} a route between transit facilities and buildings such as hospitals, school for visually impaired, community centre, major shopping centres, government buildings and so on.|$|E
50|$|Since 1994, Japanese law require {{buildings}} exceeding {{floor area}} of 2,000 m2 {{to install and}} maintain tactile <b>pavings</b> near stairs, ramps, escalators and major pathway. Schools, hospitals, theatres, arenas, community centre, exhibition halls, department stores, hotels, office, multidwelling units or senior homes with floor space less than 2,000 m2 must spend reasonable effort to install and maintain tactile <b>pavings</b> inside the building, but not required. The original law was replaced by another law in 2006 with wider scope including outdoor areas.|$|E

50|$|Today yellow tactile <b>pavings</b> are {{ubiquitous}} throughout Japan.
