50|$|In {{addition}} to the necessity of reliable collision detection, a frame cannot be repeated too many times. A repeater normally listens for the 0101 preamble and then locks onto the bit stream. Once locked on, it would then repeat each bit out the other port(s). However, a number of bits would be consumed at the start while the repeater was locking onto the bit stream. As the frame propagated through each repeater the preamble would get shorter and shorter. Too many bits lost meant that an end node may not have enough <b>preamble</b> <b>bits</b> to lock on and the entire frame would be missed.|$|E

The receiver provides the following functions: quantization (intensity noise filtering), clock and data recovery, burst-mode functionality (automatic phase acquisition) using a clock phase aligner (CPA), framing (for byte synchronization), and forward-error correction (FEC) using a (255, 239) Reed–Solomon decoder. The receiver pro-vides an instantaneous (zero <b>preamble</b> <b>bit)</b> phase acquisition time for any phase step (2 rads) between consecutive packets. With the CPA, we report a zero {{packet loss ratio}} (PLR) for up to four simultaneous users {{and more than a}} 300 -fold improvement in the PLR for a fully loaded system.

30|$|The {{second case}} {{is when a}} Wi-Fi packet arrives during the correlation. If the {{protector}} detects the collision before channel switching, it can simply abort. In more specific, the protector checks the corrupted bits in the first one byte preamble to detect the collision. In the IEEE 802.15. 4 PHY layer, the one byte preamble is converted into two units of 32 -bit chipping sequences by the spread spectrum technique. When the ZigBee nodes {{are the only ones}} that are occupying the channel, the <b>preamble</b> <b>bits</b> should match well at the receiver side. In contrast, considering that the Wi-Fi interference should be detected as a form of consistent and powerful noise, the number of corrupted bits of the ZigBee preambles significantly increases. After the NBP protector sees the correlation value spike, many erroneous bits in the first preamble means that it is very likely that some other simultaneous transmission exists. For this case, NBP takes a conservative approach; the protector does not send the reservation signal because the source of interference is unknown. This behavior may give more channel access opportunities to Wi-Fi nodes, and thus prevent the channel from being under-utilized. We have measured the trend of erroneous bits in our implementation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a serializer/deserializer scheme for asynchronous address event representation (AER) bit-serial interchip communications. Each serial AER (sAER) link uses four wires: a micro strip pair for low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) and two handshaking lines. Each event {{is represented by}} a 32 -bit word. Two extra <b>preamble</b> <b>bits</b> are used for alignment. Transmission clock {{is embedded in the}} data using Manchester encoding. As opposed to conventional LVDS links, the presented approach allows to stop physical communication between data events, so that no “comma” characters need to be transmitted during these pauses. As soon as a new event needs to be transmitted, the link recovers immediately thanks to a built-in control voltage memorization circuit. As a result, power consumption of the serializer and deserializer circuits is proportional to data event rate. The approach is also highly tolerant to clock jitter, due to the asynchronous nature and the Manchester encoding. A chip test prototype has been fabricated in standard 0. 35 μm CMOS including a pair of Serializer and Deserializer circuits. Maximum measured event transmission rate is 15 Meps (mega events per second) for 32 -bit events, with a maximum bit transmission speed of 670 Mbps (mega bits per second). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|As {{software}} defined radio (SDR) becomes more prevalent in wireless communications nowadays, a symbol timing recovery (STR) system with configurability of the symbol rate would be {{required in order to}} support different wireless standards. Convergence time i. e. how much time needed to achieve a synchronous status during alignment of timing phase, is one of the factors to determine STR performance. In the existing multi-symbol-rate STRs, convergence time varies depending on the moment of the symbol rate switching even without considering noise effect. A longer convergence time results in more initial errors in the symbol decision. This is undesirable because longer <b>preamble</b> <b>bits</b> are required for synchronization thus reducing the throughput rate. This paper presents a configurable STR using digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms, with fast convergence time that can be achieved by searching for the minimum timing error (which occurs at the optimal sampling instant) within each symbol period, and then capturing the associated optimal symbol sample at the zero-crossing of the filtered signal. The convergence time is calculated based on the predefined symbol period regardless the moment of the symbol rate switching. The proposed configurable STR is implemented using Xilinx Virtex- 4 FPGA. Implementation results show that at least 21 % of the FPGA hardware utilization has been saved for the proposed configurable STR as compared to the existing configurable STRs. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Wake-up {{receiver}} (WuRx) is {{a well-known}} approach for optimizing the latency and power consumption of ultra-low power transceivers in wireless sensor nodes. Tuned RF (TRF) or Envelope Detection architecture is an appropriate topology for short-range Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications, where achieving a very high sensitivity is not a priority. However, the demand for an improved sensitivity gets emphasized for longer transmission ranges. Regardless of the application, considering the existing trade-off between the power and sensitivity, design techniques and novel architectures are usually employed to optimize the power-sensitivity product. Moreover, considering {{the negative impact of}} higher data rate on the sensitivity, the energy-sensitivity product can be a more reasonable figure of merit when comparing WuRx designs. In this thesis, the RF-subsampling architecture has been combined with the TRF receiver architecture as a first approach for improving the power-sensitivity product. The overall power consumption is reduced as a result of employing the subsampling topology with a low-frequency local oscillator (LO). Post layout simulations show that the proposed WuRx draws only 56 μA from a 0. 5 V supply and exhibits an input sensitivity of - 70 dBm for a data rate of 100 kbps. The chip occupies an area of 0. 15 mm 2 and is fabricated with TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. Another major contribution of this work is to propose and implement a novel dual-mode ultra-low-power WuRx based on the subsampling topology, which not only reduces the overall power consumption but also optimizes the energy-sensitivity product of the receiver. During the typical mode of operation known as the Monitoring (MO) mode, the start frame bits are received at a rate of as low as 10 kbps. Having received the true <b>preamble</b> <b>bits</b> in the MO mode, the remaining wake-up pattern bits are received at a higher rate of 200 kbps during the Identifier (ID) mode. By lowering the gain of the front-end amplifier in the MO mode, the power dissipation is reduced, which in turn causes an increase in the overall noise figure of the receiver. However, adequate sensitivity and hence an optimized energy-sensitivity product is maintained by intentionally lowering the data rate as well as the detection bandwidth of the receiver in the MO mode. The proposed wake-up receiver has been designed and fabricated in IBM 130 nm technology with a core size of about 0. 2 mm 2 for the target frequency range of 902 - 928 MHz. The measured results show that the proposed dual-mode receiver achieves a sensitivity of - 78. 5 dBm and - 75 dBm while dissipating an average power of 16. 4 µW and 22. 9 µW during MO and ID modes, respectively...|$|E

The types of synchronization techniques analyzed are asynchronous (conventional) TDMA, preambleless asynchronous TDMA, bit synchronous timing with a <b>preamble,</b> and preambleless <b>bit</b> synchronous timing. Among these alternatives, preambleless bit synchronous timing simplifies onboard multicarrier demultiplexer/demodulator designs (about 2 : 1 reduction in mass and power), requires smaller onboard buffers (10 : 1 to approximately 3 : 1 reduction in size), and provides better frame efficiency as well as lower onboard processing delay. Analysis and computer simulation illustrate that this technique can support a bit rate of up to 10 Mbit/s (or higher) with proper selection of design parameters. High bit rate transmission may require Doppler compensation and multiple phase error measurements.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{problems of}} legal fragmentation of international investment law {{and human rights}} law and related legal methodology questions regarding person-oriented principles of justice (such as human rights and "proportionality balancing") {{in contrast to the}} more commonly applied focus on judicial balancing of state-centered "principles of justice" (like state responsibility). The paper builds on a comprehensive survey of publicly available investor-states disputes in which human rights were invoked by the parties to dispute (investor, host state and arbitrators ex officio) or third party interveners. The assessment of these awards in Part II of this paper suggests that arbitral tribunals are more open towards human rights as due process rights and as principles ofproceduralfairness and balancing than towards integrating human rights as an authoritative legal regime consisting of legally enforceable entitlements. The only exception to this general trend remains the right to property. However, the assessment generally reveals a lack of any systematic methodology as to how to respond to human rights argumentation. Part III traces the legal reasons behind these observations by looking into the entry points for human rights and obstacles for integration as they emerge from the texts of BITs and IIAs. This part demonstrates the possibilities that already exist for arbitrators to take into account human rights, such as jurisdiction clauses, applicable law clauses, definitions of "investments", the customary rules of treaty interpretation, <b>preambles</b> of <b>BITs,</b> relevant protection standards and rules on awarding damage compensation. The conclusion suggests that the shortcomings are not an inevitable result of textual limitations, as alternative outcomes of ISDS disputes are legally possible and justifiable. In the absence of any development of a clear methodology, textual adjustment might thus not counter fragmentation. Systemic reform might be necessary to ensure transparent, coherent and balanced approaches to human rights argumentation. Published version of EUI LAW WP 2016 / 0...|$|R
