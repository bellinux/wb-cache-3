40|$|ABSTRACT Following {{treatment}} with ultraviolet radiation, human red cells leak cations at accelerated rates which {{depend on the}} radiation dose. With one exception (initial Na efflux), these accelerated cation fluxes fit the Ussing flux-ratio criterion for passive diffusion. Na efflux is transiently high, but with time falls to the value expected {{on the basis of}} the other cation fluxes. An equation based on the hypothesis of colloid osmotic hemolysis satisfactorily predicts the rate of cell swelling as a result of these ion movements. This paper describes the quantitative interrelationships of ion and water fluxes through human erythrocyte membranes following exposure of the cells to ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a lytic agent. The study had a twofold purpose. First, UV radiation studies have frequently neglected alterations in ion <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> even though these may be decisive to cell survival.

30|$|These changes {{generally}} {{occur because}} {{of an increase in}} the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> and such changes commonly result in the leakage of small molecular substances, ions, and formation of lesions (Bajpai et al. 2013). The leakage of cytoplasmic membrane was analyzed by determining the release of cell materials including nucleic acid, metabolites and ions which was absorbed at 260  nm in the suspensions (Oonmetta-aree et al. 2006). After the addition of the α-Phellandrene and Nonanal visibly increased with increasing volatile compound concentration. The maximum release of cell constituents was observed in P. cyclopium treated with α-Phellandrene at MFC. The methyl ester is able to penetrate to the hydrophobic regions of the membranes and the carboxyl groups pass through the cell membrane, perturbing in the lowering of internal pH and denaturing of proteins inside the cell (Marquis et al. 2003). From {{the results of the present}} study combined with the previous studies, we can conclude that the two volatile compounds apparently induced the leakage of intracellular protons. These findings suggest that irreversible damage to the cytoplasmic membranes of P. cyclopium occurred, and the ions inside the cells leaked, ultimately leading to apoptosis of the fungus in the presence of volatile compounds.|$|E

With low concentrations (up to 5 μg/ml) and short reaction times (up to 10 min), oleic acid stimulated free biotin accumulation. Increased concentrations (10 to 50 μg/ml) or reaction times (10 to 30 min) caused progressive reductions in uptake or increased release of previously accumulated vitamin. Combination of Tween 40 (1 mg/ml) with oleic acid (up to 50 μg/ml) detoxified oleic acid and stimulated free biotin uptake. Oleic acid (5 μg/ml or more) reduced cell viability, an effect which was overcome by Tween 40. All other surfactants tested stimulated free biotin accumulation at sublethal concentrations. Aerosol OT and SDS exhibited the same degree of stimulatory activity as detoxified oleic acid; however, at concentrations higher than 200 μm, a rapid decrease in vitamin accumulation was observed which paralleled that caused by increased oleic acid concentrations.

40|$|OmpT and OmpU are pore-forming {{proteins}} of {{the outer}} membrane of Vibrio cholerae, a pathogen that colonizes the intestine and produces cholera. Expression of the ompU and ompT genes is under the regulation of ToxR, a transmembrane transcriptional activator that also controls expression of virulence factors. It was recently shown that bile stimulates the ToxR-mediated transcription of ompU and that ompU-expressing strains are more resistant to bile and anionic detergents than ompT-expressing cells. In order to further understand {{the role of the}} OmpT and OmpU porins in the ability of V. cholerae to survive and colonize the host intestine, we examined the outer membrane <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> expressing only ompU or only ompT or both genes in the absence and in the presence of bile.

In addition, the OmpU-mediated outer membrane permeability was not affected by external bile, while the OmpT-mediated antibiotic flux was reduced by bile in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results confirm that OmpT and OmpU provide a passageway for hydrophilic solutes through the outer membrane and demonstrate that bile might interfere with this traffic in OmpT-producing cells by functionally inhibiting the OmpT pore.

Here, we applied chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI) to inhibit the water permeability of AQP 1, and of two AQP 4 isoforms (M 1 and M 23), one of which (M 23) forms aggregates at the cell plasma membrane. Chimeras containing Killer Red (KR) and AQPs were generated with linkers of different lengths. Osmotic water <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> expressing KR/AQP chimeras was measured from osmotic swelling–induced dilution of cytoplasmic chloride, which was detected using a genetically encoded chloride-sensing fluorescent protein. KR-AQP 1 red fluorescence was bleached rapidly (∼ 10 % per second) by wide-field epifluorescence microscopy. After KR bleaching, KR-AQP 1 water permeability was reduced by up to 80 % for the chimera with the shortest linker. Remarkably, CALI-induced reduction in AQP 4 -KR water permeability was approximately twice as efficient for the aggregate-forming M 23 isoform; this suggests intermolecular CALI, which was confirmed by native gel electrophoresis on cells coexpressing M 23 -AQP 4 -KR and myc-tagged M 23 -AQP 4. CALI also disrupted the interaction of AQP 4 with a neuromyelitis optica autoantibody directed against an extracellular epitope on AQP 4.

40|$|Cryopreservation is an {{important}} process for preserving cells and tissues. The process itself can, however, cause damage to cells and tissues. During addition and removal of a cryoprotective agent (CPA), cells are subjected to imbalanced osmotic pressures between the intracellular and extracellular solutions. Cells can be injured if these shrinkage and swelling events are beyond their tolerable limits. The characteristics of the cell volume changes during these processes depend on the types of CPA, the methods of adding and removing of the CPA and the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> to CPA and water. The typical models of this transportation are the two-parameter (2 -p) model and the Kedem-Katchalsky (K-K) model. The K-K model is more general than the 2 -p model.

Previously, we showed in mice that the permeability to water and cryoprotectants of oocytes and embryos at early cleavage stages (early embryos) is low because these molecules move across the plasma membrane predominantly by simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer, whereas permeability of morulae and blastocysts is high because of a water channel, aquaporin 3 (AQP 3). In this study, we examined the pathways for the movement of water and cryoprotectants in bovine oocytes/ embryos {{and the role of}} AQP 3 in the movement by determining permeability, first in intact bovine oocytes/embryos, then in bovine morulae with suppressed AQP 3 expression, and finally in mouse oocytes expressing bovine AQP 3. Results suggest that water moves through bovine oocytes and early embryos slowly by simple diffusion, {{as is the case in}} mice, although channel processes are also involved in the movement. On the other hand, water appears to move through morulae and blastocysts predominantly by facilitated diffusion via channels, as in mice. Like water, cryoprotectants appear to move through bovine oocytes/early embryos mostly by simple diffusion, but channel processes could also be involved in the movement of glycerol and ethylene glycol, unlike that in mice. In bovine morulae, although glycerol and ethylene glycol would move predomi-nantly by facilitated diffusion, mostly through AQP 3, as in mice, dimethylsulfoxide appears to move predominantly by simple diffusion, unlike in mice.
