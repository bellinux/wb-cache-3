Despite this clear short term orientation, <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> tend to be partially recon-structed from one project to the next implying that there is a need for a long term view, as generally applied to other types of inter-organizational networks (alliances, joint ventures, delivery chains, etc.).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend a multi-agent {{simulation}} model for interorganizational learning {{to explore the}} issue of learning decay on adaptation performance. Researchers agree that <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> can support the development and exchange of new knowledge among firms, however, the question of learning beyond the firm at the boundaries between firms or {{at the level of}} the network remains less explored. Previous research has shown that relational instability in networks can slow learning and that task interdependence moderates the impact of increasing relational instability on <b>project</b> <b>network</b> adaptation performance. Research to date on this phenomenon neglects the effect of forgetting which may impact the performance of <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> where firms work together infrequently.

In this article, I propose a family of models in which pairwise interactions originate from multiway interactions, by starting from ensembles of hypergraphs and applying projections that generate ensembles of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks.</b> I calculate analytically the statistical properties of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks,</b> and suggest ways these could be used beyond theoretical studies. Weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks</b> typically exhibit weight disorder along links even for very simple generating hypergraph ensembles. Also, as the size of a hypergraph changes, a signature of multiway interaction emerges on the link weights of weighted <b>projected</b> <b>networks</b> that distinguishes them from fundamentally weighted pairwise networks. This signature could be used to search for hidden multiway interactions in weighted network data. I find the percolation threshold and size of the largest component for hypergraphs of arbitrary uniform rank, translate the results into <b>projected</b> <b>networks,</b> and show that the transition is second order. This general approach to network formation has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of weighted networks. Comment: 4 figures. 3 tables. 28 pages.

40|$|In many {{project-based}} {{industries such as}} {{construction and}} shipbuilding, the delivery of projects requires the participation of multiple heterogeneous firms. The objective of this dissertation is to explore how inter-organizational relationships influence {{the efficiency of the}} implementation phase in <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> <b>Project</b> <b>networks</b> are defined as temporary inter-organizational networks set up for delivering a project to a client. Furthermore, it is examined how project implementation influences the development of inter-organizational relationships between firms involved in <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> Based on a review of literature on project business, inter-organizational relationships, transaction cost economics, and critical incidents, a conceptual framework is developed to guide the multiple case study involving four <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> from the Finnish shipbuilding industry. Altogether, the empirical data analyzed in this study consists of a total of 40 personal interviews with individuals representing 13 different organizations, and a broad range of documentation including contracts, meeting memorandums and project plans. The results of this study demonstrate evidence of a relation between inter-organizational relationships and the efficiency of project implementation. Critical incidents unforeseen by the participating actors were analyzed in the four <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> A part of these critical incidents was found to be related to inter-organizational relationships and to contribute to the efficiency of project implementation by affecting the ex post transaction costs of monitoring, planning, and adapting transactions between involved firms. Furthermore, the contribution of critical incidents on the efficiency of project implementation was found to be predominantly unfavorable as increases, as opposed to decreases, in transaction costs were found as frequent. In two studied <b>project</b> <b>networks,</b> in which inter-organizational relationships between <b>project</b> <b>network</b> actors were characterized by high degrees of trust and dependence, inter-organizational relationships were found to frequently constitute strengths which reduced the unfavorable contribution of critical incidents to the efficiency of project implementation. In all four studied <b>project</b> <b>networks,</b> inter-organizational relationships were also found to frequently constitute weaknesses which increased the unfavorable contribution of critical incidents to efficiency of project implementation. The results of this study also illustrate that the influence of project implementation on the development of inter-organizational relationships between <b>project</b> <b>network</b> actors can often be characterized as modest, as inter-organizational relationships in three studied <b>project</b> <b>networks</b> were rather stable across the observed one year period. However, when <b>project</b> <b>network</b> actors assess the responses of each other to critical incidents as unacceptable, even highly established inter-organizational relationships may deteriorate rapidly as occurred in one of the four studied <b>project</b> <b>networks.</b> This dissertation complements existing knowledge concerning the relatedness of inter-organizational relationships and efficiency of economic transactions by describing how critical incidents function as a mechanism relating these two concepts in <b>project</b> <b>network</b> contexts. In addition, this study contributes to our understanding of how inter-organizational relationships develop between firms operating in project-based industries. Further, this dissertation sheds new light {{to our understanding of the}} factors that contribute to the efficiency of work carried out in project contexts by emphasizing the importance of transaction costs that incur between involved firms during the implementation phase of the project life cycle. The results of this study have also implications for practitioners responsible for marketing and managing inter-firm projects who can be considered, to a considerable extent, accountable for both the development of inter-organizational relationships between firms they are employed by and other firms in the surrounding business environment, and the efficiency of work carried out in projects in which their employing firms participate...|$|R
