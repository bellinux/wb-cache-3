5|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} record type are those achieved {{at a specific}} competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records {{and a large number}} of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> in track and field competitions.|$|E
5|$|With the O.T.O. {{now being}} revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, {{and brought in}} 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935. He advertised the {{foundation}} of his group through an advert in American Astrology magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, {{as well as social}} events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.|$|E

25|$|The 1980 parade, {{held at the}} National Stadium, almost rained at the start, but the {{performances}} went on as planned as the weather improved later. This was the first parade in which the feu de joie of the Guard-of-Honour contingents made its inaugural appearance. 1981's NDP was the very first parade appearance of the then SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989. (The SCDF of today showed itself {{for the first time}} in the 1982 NDP held in the Padang.) They were held in two decentralised venues, Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> and participation in the celebrations. 1982's parade, back at the Padang site, featured more contingents and for the first time the mobile column drove past after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward (every 5 years).|$|E

Alike his time in England, Frederick was also involved in trade union business, becoming a leading member of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) by at least 1937; he is known to have recruited successfully, given that Bethlehem suffered particular economic depravity during the Great Depression, an event that affected <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> to matches throughout the 1920s. Following this, he worked as a self-employed corn merchant until his death on 12 June 1950; he was survived by his 20-year old adoptive daughter, his wife died several years before him.|$|E

Declining <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> after four years of the president's absence led {{organizers}} in January 1952 to plead for Truman's presence at the next ceremony. Truman agreed to stay at the White House for Christmas 1952, and personally lit the tree. Even though the Korean War was raging during Christmas 1950, 1951, and 1952, crowds were still permitted on the White House grounds. [...] The lone exception was in 1950, when crowds were kept outside the fences due to renovations going on at the White House.|$|E
2500|$|Martin offers another, more pessimistic, {{view of the}} {{religious}} situation in the late 1980s. In a 1986 study, she asserts that the PRK showed outsiders only certain aspects of religious freedom; she also states that the few wats that were restored had {{only two or three}} old monks in residence and that <b>public</b> <b>attendance</b> was low. The monks were allowed to leave the wats only for an hour in the mornings, to collect their food, or during holy days. Lay people who practiced their faith were about the same ages as the monks, and they were allowed to visit the wats only in the evenings. A government circular had also instructed civil servants to stop celebrating the traditional New Year Festival. Some traditional Buddhist festivals still were tolerated, but the state collected a 50 percent tax on donations. Martin believes that Buddhism was threatened externally by state repression and by nonsupport and internally by invalid clergy. She noted that the two Buddhist superiors, Venerable Long Chhim and Venerable Tep Vong, were both believed to be from Vietnam. Venerable Tep Vong was concurrently the superior of the Buddhist clergy, vice president of the PRK's Khmer National Assembly, {{and vice president of the}} KUFNCD National Council. She quoted a refugee from Batdambang as having said, [...] "During the meetings, the Khmer administrative authorities, accompanied by the Vietnamese experts, tell you, `Religion is like poison, it's like opium; it's better to give the money to the military, so they can fight'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brochu {{attempted}} {{to convince his}} partners that the only long-term solution to keep the Expos in Montreal was to replace Olympic Stadium. In addition to being poorly located—far from population centres, restaurants, and bars—fans perceived it as cavernous and unsafe. Additionally, free agents were letting it be known they were not willing {{to play for the}} Expos due to Olympic Stadium's poor playing conditions. A proposed 35,000-seat downtown facility, to be called Labatt Park, was announced in 1997 with a budgeted cost of $250 million and an anticipated opening date of 2001. [...] It would have been a retro-classic park with a facade reminiscent of historic Bonaventure Station. [...] According to a Montreal Gazette editorial supporting the new park, Brochu's threat to move the team unless Olympic Stadium was replaced was [...] "simple logic." [...] Brochu sought $150 million in funding from the provincial government, but Premier Lucien Bouchard refused, saying he could not authorize public funding for a stadium when the province was being forced to close hospitals and had still not paid the Olympic Stadium debt. Many members of the consortium instead favoured selling the team. Hoping to pressure a sale, some members began to feed anonymous tips to the French press to make internal discord between Brochu and his partners <b>public.</b> <b>Attendance</b> continued to fall, decreasing by 39 percent in [...] to an average of 11,295 spectators per game. It was the first of five consecutive seasons in which Montreal drew fewer than one million fans. [...] One of the few bright spots of this time was the blossoming of Vladimir Guerrero into a star; he made four consecutive All-Star Games from 1999 to 2002, each time as the Expos' sole representative.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} demonstrates that higher levels of religious involvement are associated with lower adult mortality risks in the United States. While a handful of clinically- and community-based studies have considered the impacts of private religiosity and strength and comfort received from religious faith on survival status among the elderly (e. g., Helm et al. 2000; Oxman et al. 1995), the vast majority of sociological and epidemiological research in the area has focused on the most clearly social aspect of religious behavior: <b>public</b> religious <b>attendance.</b> The importance of <b>public</b> religious <b>attendance</b> for mortality risk was documented in a recent meta-analysis of the religion-mortality literature (McCullough et al. 2000), where non-attendance was found to be associated with about a 30 % heightened mortality risk in follow-up studies compared to people who attend on a regular basis.

500|$|The 1952–53 season started poorly for Morris. He was {{replaced}} by Keith Miller as state captain, despite having scored almost 700 runs at a fast rate in the previous Shield season at an average above 50, and leading his state to another title. As was the norm for the era, Morris was not informed personally and learned of his demotion second-hand. No official reason was given by the New South Wales Cricket Association, but it was speculated among the media that his penchant for wearing brightly-coloured rubber-soled shoes could have upset the conservative administrators, and that Morris was too genial to be captain. The media made Morris a scapegoat for dwindling <b>public</b> <b>attendances</b> following the retirement of Bradman and lobbied for Miller, who they deemed to be more appealing to the public.
