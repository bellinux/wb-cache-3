The program is quite general {{in that the}} apertures {{do not have to}} be the same sizes, nor do they have to be polarized in the same direction. In addition, several waveguide modes (TE and/or TM) may be specified in the apertures and the mutual coupling between all combinations of apertures and modes will be calculated. The program also allows multiple layers of homogeneous dielectrics to be placed over the aperture array. Outside the layered region, one can specify either a homogeneous half-space, or a <b>perfect</b> <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E

40|$|Systems {{and method}} are {{disclosed}} for measuring small angular deflections {{of a target}} using weak value amplification. A system includes a beam source, a beam splitter, a target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> a photodetector, and a processor. The beam source generates an input beam that is split into first and second beams by the beam splitter. The first and second beams are propagated to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> at least partially superimposed at the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> and incident to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> normal to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> The first beam is reflected an additional even number of times during propagation to the photodetector. The second beam is reflected an additional odd number of times during propagation to the photodetector. The first and second beams interfere at the photodetector so as to produce interference patterns. The interference patterns are interpreted to measure angular deflections of the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Pseudo-steady flows, {{the triple}} point {{moves away from}} the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> and the {{reflection}} is a direct-Mach reflection. In unsteady flows, {{it is also possible that}} the triple point remains stationary relative to the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> (stationary-Mach reflection), or moves toward the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> (inverse-Mach reflection). In inverse Mach reflection, the Mach stem is convex toward the oncoming flow, and the slip plane curves away from the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> Each one of these configurations can assume one of the following three possibilities: single-Mach reflection, transitional-Mach reflection and double-Mach reflection.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} the {{photoswitch}} that the reflecting efficiency of the reflecting member may be drastically lowered due to dewing and clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> due {{to a change in}} the ambient temperature.

In order to avoid the clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> it has been proposed to apply silicon or the like to the <b>surface</b> of the <b>reflecting</b> member.

Single crystals of ice are birefringent not only at optical frequencies but also at radar ones, so in an ice sheet the average crystal orientation fabric determines the overall level of birefringence. The polarisation of radio waves is changed by the birefringent nature of the ice and by the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> whether an internal layer or the basal boundary.
