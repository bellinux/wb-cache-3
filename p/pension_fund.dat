40|$|Sweden {{offers a}} unique natural {{experiment}} {{to analyze the}} microeconomic effects of institutionalized saving on ownership structure, corporate governance and performance of listed companies. First, the Swedish pension reform increased the participation of <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> in the domestic stock market and caused a significant reshuffling in the ownership of the existing <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> Second, the availability of detailed data on firm ownership allows us to document {{the effects of the}} pension reform. We show that the effects of institutional investment on firm performance depend on the industry structure of <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> In particular, we find that firm performance improves if large independent private <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> and public <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> increase their equity stakes in the firm, but not if smaller <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> and <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> related to financial institutions and industrial groups increase their shareholdings.

5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co.

Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of stock market performance on the investment policy of <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> We find that stock market performance affects the asset allocation of Dutch <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> in two ways. In the short term, outperformance of equities over bonds and other investment categories automatically results in a higher actual equity allocation (and vice versa), as <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> do not continuously rebalance their investment portfolios. Each quarter, <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> rebalance, on average, around 39 percent of excess equity returns, leaving 61 percent for free floating. In the medium term, outperformance of equities induces <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> to increase their strategic equity allocation (and vice versa).
