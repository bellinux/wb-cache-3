5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, <b>partial</b> <b>reflection,</b> and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

[...] This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection.

40|$|International audienceWe {{have noted}} {{sporadic}} instances of strong isolated reflections of medium frequency (MF) radar waves from the mesosphere from {{as low as}} 50 km altitude and have devised a set of criteria for isolating these apparently anomalous echoes from those normally occurring from progressive <b>partial</b> <b>reflections</b> in the D-region.

For example, the similarity and simultaneity of the echo structure for the 20 January 2005 with VHF radar results presented by Lübken et al. (2006) are particularly striking. In presenting a number of such echo events since 2001 selected from the MF radar dataset (which spans 1997 to present), we find that virtually all echo occurrences coincide with enhanced solar proton fluxes suggesting that substantial ionisation of the mesosphere is a necessary condition. Strong <b>partial</b> <b>reflections</b> of the radio wave in the lower mesosphere combined with seasonally varying total absorption higher up, thus giving false impressions of lower mesospheric layers preferentially in winter, constitute a scenario consistent with our observations...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The usual {{asymptotic}} {{methods used}} to correct the high-frequency solutions of the wave equation are unsatisfactory as they do not give the low-frequency, <b>partial</b> <b>reflections</b> expected from a region of high velocity gradient. A new iterative solution is obtained which uses the first term of the Langer asymptotic expansion as the zeroth iterate. This satisfactorily gives the <b>partial</b> <b>reflections</b> from a region of high velocity gradient, {{even when they are}} generated near the turning point of the ray. Although the results are somewhat complicated in the frequency domain, in the time domain all types of wave interaction are described by six universal time functions. For any problem, these functions are scaled in time according to the depth of the interaction, and in strength according to the magnitude of the coupling parameter. Numerical results and approximations are given for these functions. Coupling parameters are investigated for acoustic and elastic waves in a plane model, and acoustic and elastic-gravitational waves in a spherical model. The same universal time functions allow the excitation of elastic waves to be studied when the source is in a region of high velocity gradient or is near the wave’s turning point. Results are given for a moment tensor, point source in plane and spherical models. ...|$|R
