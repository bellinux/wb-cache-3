40|$|Over {{one million}} hip {{prostheses}} are implanted in patients worldwide {{each year and}} the need is increasing as the patient group of younger and more active patients is increasing. Many parameters affect the longevity of the implant, where aseptic loosening caused by wear debris {{is the most common}} reason for revision. To be able to monitor wear in vivo and also to predict the longevity of new materials for hip prostheses are therefore important issues in this interdisciplinary research area. This thesis comprise a true non-invasive 3 D method for determination of acetabular cup wear using Computed Tomography (CT) intended for clinical routine use in order to plan for a revision. It also comprises investigations of the influence of surface roughness and sterilization method in wear testing of materials for hip prostheses. Mainly wear of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was investigated since it is the most common soft bearing in hip prostheses. The 3 D-CT method was found to be easy to use and showed an accuracy and repeatability at a clinical relevant level for acetabular cup wear. It should lend itself well to semi-automation. The influence of surface roughness was investigated with both a multidirectional <b>pin-on-disk</b> <b>machine</b> and with a hip simulator. A new low friction coating, Micronite, was also evaluated with the <b>pin-on-disk</b> <b>machine.</b> This coating showed potential for use in artificial joints, but further investigations are needed. In the hip simulator test, it was found that not only a rougher counter surface increased wear, but also sterilization by Î³-irradiation increased wear of UHMWPE cups. QC 2010111...|$|E

40|$|Wear, {{fatigue and}} {{corrosion}} {{are the most}} widely encountered failure modes of materials used in engineering applications, including aero-gas turbines. Although wear is distinctly classified as adhesive, abrasive, erosive, fretting and so on, there are usually more than one wear mechanisms which contribute towards the failure of components in service. This {{is due to the}} fact that there are large numbers of system and materials variables active during the course of materials wear which make the study of materials wear more difficult. This is further complicated by the discrepancies between the laboratory tests and field data. The present investigation was set up to examine wear characteristics of M 50 and T 1 high speed steels at both room and elevated temperatures to draw a thorough understanding of wear behavior of this class of high speed steels.

The critical load transferring from stable friction to unstable friction is around 50 N at a test temperature of 473 K and a sliding velocity of 0. 6 m/s. With the increase of the reinforcement volume fraction, the wear resistance of the composites increases. However, the Al 3 Zr phase is detrimental to the further improvement in the wear resistance of the composites.

Surface welding is large used to produce thick coatings on materials submitted to extremely aggressive environments like several components of an oil refinery plant. Plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding arises as a technique with an excellent reliability, producing deposits with low dilution, strong metallurgical bond and microstructure control. The Ni based alloy (Ni-Cr-Mo-W) is known by its excellent corrosion resistance and high temperature stability. The aim of this work is to relate Ni based alloy coatings deposited on two different substrates, stainless steel 304 L and low-carbon steel 1020, obtained by Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA),to their wear behavior. Coating characterization was done using optical and scanning electronic microscopy, and Vickers microhardness profiles were done under 500 g load. High temperature structure stability was evaluated by accelerated aging tests with temperatures ranging from 650 ÂºC to 1200 ÂºC.

In the present work, aluminium-magnesium-silicon carbide composite (Al- 3 %Mg- 10 %SiC) developed using a stir casting technique is studied for wear, aging and corrosion behaviour. The wear behaviour of the composite is investigated at room conditions at four different loads, 70 N, 80 N, 90 N, 100 N and with varying sliding speeds, i. e. 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 rpm's, using a <b>pin-on-disk</b> wear testing <b>machine.</b> Then the composite was solution treated at a temperature of 250 C for 1 hr and then aged at four different temperatures viz. 120 C, 150 C, 180 C, and 220 C to study the aging behaviour of the composite. The composite is kept in sea water for 42 days and the weight loss was measured in every 7 days to study the corrosion behaviour.

Micro hardness of the specimens at the room temperature was also measured before and after the wear tests by Vickers hardness testing machine. The micro hardness of the hybrid composite test specimens increases with increasing volume fraction of particulates reinforcement.

Dressing of diamond {{grinding wheel}} by alumina dressing tool has been simulated in a <b>pin-on-disk</b> <b>machine</b> in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp diamond grits.

The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of wheel wear, indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina dressing tool for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results.

AlâSic base alloys are perhaps most common particularly due to very attractive characteristics such as high strength to weight ratio, good workability, excellent castability, good thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. In this paper Aluminium LM 25 +SiC composites containing three different weight percentages 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % of Sic have been fabricated by casting method.

Four types of friction and wear behaviors can be observed with associated transition in their values, called regions R 1, R 2, R 3, and R 4, R 1 (0. 1 to 1. 25 ms^- 1) is associated with high friction as well as the wear rate of the pin and the negligible wear rate of the disk. In R 2 (1. 25 to 3. 5 ms^- 1) friction is low and the wear rate of the pin is negligible but the wear rate of the disk is high. The friction and the wear rate of the pin {{as well as that of}} the disk are high in R 3 (3. 5 to 6. 5 ms^- 1). In R 4 (6. 5 to 12. 0 ms^- 1) the friction is low.

The {{evolution}} of the microstructure in the subsurface of the material and the wear rate was co-related to the strain rate microstructural response of the material in uniaxial compression, at different strain rates (0. 1 - 100 s^- 1) and temperatures (298 - 673 K). The strain rates and temperatures in the plastically deforming zone near {{the surface of the}} pins were determined using noniterative methods. The strain rates were found to be in the region of 100 s^- 1 near the surface and decreases as one moves into the sub-surface of the pin. The temperatures increased as the speed increased. These estimated strain rates and temperatures were superimposed on the strain rate microstructural response maps of these materials. The uniaxial compression test results of Ti showed adiabatic shear banding as a microstructural mechanism that evolves at high strain rates (â¥ 10 s^- 1) and lower temperatures (< 575 K). Adiabatic shear bands are sites of easy crack nucleation and propagation. When Ti is slid at low speeds the near surface region of the pins deform in the adiabatic shear banding regions in the strain rate microstructural response map. At such speeds the wear rate is found to be high and reduces as the sliding speed is increased, when the material undergoes a more homogeneous deformation. The microstructural response of Cu under uniaxial compression showed that the material undergoes flow banding at intermediate strain rates (1 s^- 1) and temperatures of up to 473 K. The subsurface microstructure of the pins slid at low speeds showed subsurface cracking and sheet like debris formation. This happen at lower speeds because the flow banding and crack nucleation is expected in the subsurface where the strain rates and temperatures are lower. The present test results show a clear relation to exist between the strain rate response of the material in uniaxial compression and its subsurface microstructural evolution and wear rate...|$|E
