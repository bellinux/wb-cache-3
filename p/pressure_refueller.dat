50|$|Dual-wheel, {{trailing}} link, main {{landing gear}} is provided, with digital nosewheel steering facilitating tight turns. Single-point <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> is also provided, expediting turnarounds.|$|R
50|$|Underwing fueling, {{also called}} single-point <b>refueling</b> or <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> where not {{dependent}} on gravity, is used on larger aircraft and for jet fuel exclusively.|$|R
50|$|Systems fitted by SAGEM {{included}} {{parts of}} the MAESTRO (Modular Avionics Enhancements System Te,) containing a forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) thermal imaging sensor and laser range-finder. An integrated electronic warfare suite and single-point <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> system were also installed. Delivery of the last aircraft was scheduled for mid-1999.|$|R
50|$|The {{refueling}} {{system of}} larger aircraft includes a single positive <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> {{point from which}} all tanks can be fueled. How much and to which tanks fuel is fed during refueling operations {{is determined by the}} controls in the refueling panel, usually installed nearby and accessible to ground crews.|$|R
50|$|For <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling,</b> a {{high-pressure}} hose is attached and fuel is pumped in at 275 kilopascals (40 psi) {{and a maximum}} of 310 kilopascals (45 psi) for most commercial aircraft. Pressure for military aircraft, especially fighters, ranges up to 415 kilopascals (60 psi). Air being displaced in the tanks is usually vented overboard through a single vent on the aircraft. Because {{there is only one}} attachment point, fuel distribution between tanks is either automated or it is controlled from a control panel at the fueling point or in the cockpit. An early use of <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> was on the de Havilland Comet and Sud Aviation Caravelle. Larger aircraft allow for two or more attachment points, however this is still referred to as single-point refueling, as either attachment point can refuel all of the tanks. Multiple attachments allow for faster fuel flows.|$|R
25|$|Fighter {{aircraft}} cannot accept fuel at the boom’s maximum flow rate, {{requiring a}} reduction in <b>refueling</b> <b>pressure</b> when servicing these aircraft, reducing (but not eliminating) the flying boom's advantage over the drogue system when refueling fighter aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Definitive prototypes of the Ka-25 {{incorporated}} {{mission equipment}} and corrosion {{protection for the}} structure. The rotor system introduced aluminium alloy blades pressurised with nitrogen for crack detection, lubricated hinges, hydraulic powered controls, alcohol de-icing and automatic blade folding. Power was supplied by two free-turbine engines sat atop the cabin, with electrically de-iced inlets, plain lateral exhausts with no Infra-Red countermeasures, driving the main gearbox directly and a cooling fan for the gearbox and hydraulic oil coolers aft of the main gearbox. Construction was of stressed skin duralumin throughout with flush-riveting, {{as well as some}} bonding and honeycomb sandwich panels. The 1.5m × 1,25m × 3.94m cabin had a sliding door to port flight deck forward of the cabin and fuel tanks underfloor filled using a <b>pressure</b> <b>refueling</b> nozzle on the port side. A short boom {{at the rear of the}} cabin had a central fin and twin toed in fins at the ends of the tailplane mainly for use during auto-rotation. The undercarriage consisted of two noncastoring mainwheels with sprag brakes attached to the fuselage by parallel 'V' struts with a single angled shock absorber to dissipate landing loads, and two castoring nosewheels on straight shock absorbing legs attached directly to the fuselage either side of the cockpit which folded rearwards to reduce interference with the RADAR, all wheels were fitted with emergency rapid inflation flotation collars. Flying controls all act on the co-axial rotors with pitch, roll and collective similar to a conventional single rotor helicopter. Yaw was through differential collective which has a secondary effect of torque, an automatic mixer box ensured that total lift on the rotors remained constant during yaw maneuvers, to improve handling during deck landings. Optional extras included fold up seats for 12 passengers, rescue hoist, external auxiliary fuel tanks or containers for cameras, flares, smoke floats or beacons.|$|R
50|$|The reactor design {{incorporates}} advanced technologies, {{together with}} several proven positive features of Indian pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs). These features include pressure tube type design, low <b>pressure</b> moderator, on-power <b>refueling,</b> diverse fast acting shut-down systems, {{and availability of}} a large low temperature heat sink around the reactor core. The AHWR incorporates several passive safety features. These include: Core heat removal through natural circulation; direct injection of emergency core coolant system (ECCS) water in fuel; {{and the availability of}} a large inventory of borated water in overhead gravity-driven water pool (GDWP) to facilitate sustenance of core decay heat removal. The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) injection and containment cooling can act (SCRAM) without invoking any active systems or operator action.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{non-linearity}} {{and long}} delay of airport pipe line refueling system, {{it is difficult}} for classical control methods to ensure stable pumping <b>pressure</b> and <b>refueling</b> flow. To improve the stability of the refueling process, the paper introduces human-simulated intelligent control(HSIC) method to the recognization of refueling status, online self-adjusting and control of refueling parameters. Simulation shows that the stability and accuracy of HSIC control methods were better than that of classical PID and fuzzy PID control. The airport pipeline refueling system is a complex control object with nonlinear feature, variable parameters and uncertainty. the PID (proportional, integral,differential) controller can lead to serious integral saturation, system oscillations for this sort of system, so it is difficult to obtain good control quality. Human-simulated intelligent control(HSIC) is an algorithm based on research in human way of controlling behavior and characteristics[1]. With its features of strong adaptability, on-line Parameter identification and parameter self-tuning, HSIC has better performance in computing time, stability, adjust time, and the steady-state error compared with a PID algorithm. {{with the exception of the}} static gain coefficient of the controlled object, it is does not need for HSIC to know the precise mathematical model and other parameters of controlle...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} to use a tank with cryogenic refueling {{as a part of}} the autonomous complex employing the liquefied natural gas. A cryogenic refueling tank-based installation to utilize a low-grade heat has been designed. During its use extra electric power is generated. To assess a performance capability, the proposed installation calculations have been made for different end <b>pressures</b> in cryogenic <b>refueling</b> tank. In all embodiments, the mass of cryogenic refilled is 866 kg. Depending on the pressure an amount of extra electric power is produced owing to utilizing a low temperature potential of LNG. New values, such as the specific amount of extra energy are introduced. These values allow objective assessment of the potential for extra energy when using the cryogenic products with their subsequent regasification in cryogenic refueling tank taking into consideration the operational constraints and the working fluid flow. A cold energy power plant has been also designed to refuel vehicles with the natural gas. In this paper the turbines with desirable expansion ratio to generate the maximum possible amount of power were selected in an optimal way. The optimum degree of expansion for the first turbine in the first loop will be т = 8. 8; for the second turbine in the first loop т = 10; turbines for the second loop т = 3. 9. The total amount of generated electric power will be 3725. 22 kW•h for 225 min. The action time of cold energy power plant, including the time of methane gasification in cryogenic refueling tank, time of refueling vehicles, and time of electricity generation will be 24 hours. The economic assessment of cold energy power plant has shown that the payback period is 3. 4 years. Thus, the performance evaluation by the temperature and pressure levels eliminates the possibility for forming the hydrates. So the calculations have shown that research in the development of power plants looks promising as well as allow you to save the energy potential by using the LNG and other cryogenic liquids. </p...|$|R
