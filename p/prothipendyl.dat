40|$|During {{one year}} we have {{performed}} a qualitative urinary drug screening for patients attending the emergency care and with suspicion of drug abuse, {{in order to}} detect the following drug or its metabolites in urine: methadone (MTD), benzodiazepines (BZD), cocaïne (COC), amphetamine (AMP), opiates (OPI), barbiturates (BAR), tetrahydrocannabinoïds (THC), and tricyclics (TCA). The analyses were carried out at the laboratory by a restricted number of experienced technicians with the kit Triage- 8 (Merck-Darmstadt). Positive results are easily identified by coloured bars on specific zones on the test cassette after a fast immunological reaction between urine and highly specific monoclonal antibodies. Of the 34000 patients having attended the emergency care during the year, 405 were screened: 290 were found positive (169 M and 121 F). The results were distributed as follows: 222 BZD, 80 MTD, 63 OPI, 53 BAR, 39 TCA, 59 THC, 18 AMP and 34 COC. Several drugs were often combined (up to 6 drugs). AMP was found preferentially for patients of less than 20 years, MTD, COC, THC, and TCA for patients between 20 and 60 years and BAR, OPI, and BZD in all the age classes but more frequently for patients from 20 to 60 years. For 87 patients, a request for screening blood by a HPLC/PDA method and urine by GC-MS was prescribed during the hours following the initial urinary screening. All the results were compared. They were concordant for 72 patients. In 6 cases, they were different but performed with a delay of more than 24 H. In nine cases one result was different {{but on the other}} hand, for some samples, there was a presence of other drugs non detectable by our urinary screening: 4 times BZD (once in presence of pipamperone in the blood), 2 times MTD (once with propoxyphene and once with <b>prothipendyl</b> in the blood), once AMP and 2 times THC in urine comparisons (once with clomethiazol in blood and urine). The HPLC-PDA and GC-MS methods gave results for drugs that do not react in our urinary screening system: some are enlisted in the Merck notices but others are not announced. A rapid detection of COC, OPI, THC and AMP in the urine is a tool appreciated by the clinicians particularly in front of an unconscious patient. The interpretation of the results must however be careful and cautious: a number of drugs frequently used are not detected by the screening test and this one does not bring information on the level of toxicity. It makes it possible to take the first therapeutic measures but blood screening by a reference method remains essential, particularly to confirm positive or negative unexpected results.

40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or <b>prothipendyl</b> or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
