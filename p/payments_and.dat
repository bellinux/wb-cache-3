40|$|Abstract. Interbank <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> {{settlement}} systems establish {{conditions for}} the circulation of financial funds {{in the market and}} guarantee the distribution of assets. Non-cash payments are intensively growing in the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement market. Modern electronic systems of interbank payments are introduced to satisfy this need. Interbank <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement sector is very sensitive to changes in the market. This calls the demand to foresee adaptation of the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement system in the dynamic environment. The technological renewal of the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement system was aimed at increasing fund turnover as well as complying with the requirements applied with regard to payment systems. Such challenges make the subject of modelling and analysis of financial flows topical in interbank systems. The article presents a stochastic model for the interbank <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement system and analyses possibility for optimisation of system costs. The results of application of the model developed to the analysis of the real flow of payments in the payment system are given...|$|R

50|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>and</b> {{settlement}} systems play {{an important}} role in improving overall economic efficiency. The <b>Payment</b> <b>and</b> Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act) gives the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision, for the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems in the country. In this role, the RBI focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure <b>and</b> efficient <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement mechanisms. Two payment systems National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) allow individuals, companies and firms to transfer funds from one bank to another. These facilities can only be used for transferring money within the country.|$|R

It enables the RBI to [...] "regulate, {{supervise}} and lay down policies involving <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement space in India." [...] Apart from some basic instructions to banks as to the personal and confidential nature of customer payments, supervising the timely <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> settlement of all transactions, the RBI has actively encouraged all banks and consumers to embrace e-payments.|$|R

When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash <b>payments)</b> <b>and</b> sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

The government printed money to make the <b>payments</b> <b>and</b> to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos and food riots. When the government failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.|$|E

Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E

Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit <b>payments,</b> <b>and</b> care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan <b>payments</b> <b>and</b> eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

The Football Association launched {{an investigation into the}} violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905–06 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road.
