500|$|While this {{mixing of}} campaigns was done without the {{knowledge}} of the members of Fall Out Boy, Wentz did post an acknowledgement on August 22, when CFOB again [...] "hijacked" [...] Decaydance Records website. Decaydance act The Cab began performing with [...] "Citizens for Our Betterment" [...] written on the group's instruments. Finally, on August 26, a blog post of a press release was made on the band's FriendsOrEnemies.com page; it announced Folie à Deux as the title of the upcoming album, due for release on November 4. Wentz said of the endeavor [...] "To me, this is not a marketing campaign. It is a way to cause excitement about your art and have people earn it and understand it...I don't believe the full campaign has begun, and I also believe <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> over the ship in a truly viral way. It doesn't hurt anyone, and hopefully it {{tells the story of the}} project better and makes it more appreciated." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} a topic of {{discussion}} of who is {{held accountable for the}} collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because {{they are the ones who}} are storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is a growing number of people that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree. Examples of such actions include managing their privacy settings so that certain content can be visible to [...] "Only Friends" [...] and ignoring Facebook friend requests from strangers.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{movement}} {{media has}} {{a rich and}} storied history (see Agitprop) that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation of Chiapas, Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994. Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity was another landmark {{in the use of}} New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source. The Indymedia movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement. Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a [...] "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies." [...] A less radical view along these same lines is that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital. Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her [...] "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle." [...] In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement. Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.|$|E

[Coming down again.] And by the way, I must {{thank you for}} sending a card to Mr. Hopper--he's that rich young Australian <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> such notice of just at present. His father made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in {{circular}} tins--most palatable, I believe--I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse to eat. But the son is quite interesting. I think he's attracted by dear Agatha's clever talk. Of course, we should be very sorry to lose her, but I think that a mother who doesn't part with a daughter every season has no real affection. We're coming to-night, dear.

For {{this on your}} walls, Bagshot, deny it though you may, is not art but fashion. I tell you, you do not care a rap for art. You think pictures {{are a part of}} virtue, like a silk hat--or evening dress at dinner. And in your choice of pictures you follow after your kind. I never met a true-born Briton yet who dared to buy a picture on his own accord--unless he was a dealer. And then usually he was not really a true-born Briton. He waits to see what is being hung. He has these things now because he thinks they are right, not because they are beautiful, just as he used to have the Stag at Bay and the Boastful Hound. It is Leighton now; it was Landseer then. Really I believe that very soon the ladies' papers will devote a column to pictures. Something in this style. 'Smart <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> down their Rossetti's Annunciations now, and are hanging Gambler Bolton's new Hippopotamus in the place of it. This Hippopotamus is to be the correct thing in pictures this year, and no woman with any claim to be considered smart will fail to have it over her piano. Marcus Stone's new engraving will also be rather chic. Watts's Hope is now considered a little dowdy.' And so forth. This gregarious admiration is the very antithesis of artistic appreciation, which I tell you, simply must be individual." ...|$|E
