40|$|SummarySeven <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> with {{alterations}} in the polyol region and exocyclic carboxy group were obtained via genetic engineering of the nystatin biosynthesis genes in Streptomyces noursei. In vitro {{analyses of the}} compounds for antifungal and hemolytic activities indicated that combinations of several mutations caused additive improvements in their activity-toxicity properties. The two best analogs {{selected on the basis}} of in vitro data were tested for acute toxicity and antifungal activity in a mouse model. Both analogs were shown to be effective against disseminated candidosis, while being considerably less toxic than amphotericin B. To our knowledge, this is the first report on <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> with improved in vivo pharmacological properties obtained by genetic engineering. These results indicate that the engineered nystatin analogs can be further developed into antifungal drugs for human use...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{antimycotic}} {{drugs in}} fungal infections {{is based on}} the concept that they suppress fungal growth by a direct killing effect. However, amphotericin and nystatin have been reported to also trigger interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) secretion in monocytes but the molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report that only the <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin but none of the tested azole antimycotic drugs induce significant IL- 1 b secretion in-vitro in dendritic cells isolated from C 57 BL/ 6 mouse bone marrow. IL- 1 b release depended on Toll-like receptor-mediated induction of pro-IL- 1 b as well as the NLRP 3 inflammasome, its adaptor ASC, and caspase- 1 for enzymatic cleavage of pro-IL- 1 b into its mature form. All three drugs induced potassium efflux from the cells as a known mechanism for NLRP 3 activation but the P 2 X 7 receptor was not required for this process. Natamycin-induced IL- 1 b secretion also involved phagocytosis, as cathepsin activation as described for crystal-induced IL- 1 b release. Together, the <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> amphotericin B, nystatin, and natamycin trigger IL- 1 b secretion by causing potassium efflux from which activates the NLRP 3 -ASC-caspase- 1. We conclude that beyond their effects on fungal growth, these antifungal drugs directly activate the host’s innate immunity...|$|R

The octamer model does not reproduce the concerted weak =C-H…O intermolecular interactions within the whole aggregate structure and has too large pore diameter. For hexamer model, the pore diameter is within experimental estimates. The hexamer model rather well reproduces characteristic features of a channel with such concerted weak interactions: association mode, H-bonding pattern within the whole assembly and accessibility of polyene hydroxyl groups for hydrophyllic interactions in the pore...|$|R
50|$|Nystatin A1 (or {{referred}} to as nystatin) is biosynthesized by a bacterial strain, Streptomyces noursei. The structure of this active compound is characterized as a <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> with a deoxysugar D-mycosamine, an aminoglycoside. The genomic sequence of nystatin reveals {{the presence of the}} polyketide loading module (nysA), six polyketide synthases modules (nysB, nysC, nysI, nysJ, and nysK) and two thioesterase modules (nysK and nysE). It is evident that the biosynthesis of the macrolide functionality follows the polyketide synthase I pathway.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> {{antibiotics}} exhibit potent antifungal activity, {{most are}} too toxic for therapeutic applications, with the exceptions of amphotericin B and nystatin A1. Unlike amphotericin B and nystatin A1 which form sterol-dependent ion channels, filipin {{is thought to}} be a simple membrane disrupter. Since filipin is highly fluorescent and binds specifically to cholesterol, it has found widespread use as a histochemical stain for cholesterol. This method of detecting cholesterol in cell membranes is used clinically in the study and diagnosis of Type C Niemann-Pick disease.|$|E
50|$|Natamycin, {{also known}} as {{pimaricin}} and sometimes sold as Natacyn, is a naturally occurring antifungal agent produced during fermentation by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis, commonly found in soil. Natamycin has a very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds. Natamycin is classified as a macrolide polyene antifungal, and as a drug, is used to treat fungal keratitis, an infection of the eye. It is especially effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium corneal infections. Other common members of the <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> antifungal family are amphotericin B, nystatin, and filipin. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a natural preservative.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of interferon by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I) · poly(C) ] and poly(I) · poly(C) -diethylaminoethyl-dextran in L 929 cells was enhanced from 10 to 100 times by <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides,</b> including amphotericin B (AmB), AmB methyl ester, nystatin, and filipin. AmB and its water-soluble methyl ester {{were the most}} effective; retinol, a nonmacrolide polyene, was ineffective. Interferon induction by Newcastle disease virus was not enhanced by AmB. The kinetics of interferon production were not markedly altered by AmB. Polyenes and poly(I) · poly(C) -diethylaminoethyl-dextran {{did not need to}} be present on cells simultaneously to enhance interferon production. Pretreatment with polyenes was as effective as simultaneous addition. Even treatment of washed cells, several hours after removal of poly(I) · poly(C) -diethylaminoethyl-dextran, resulted in enhancement of interferon production. AmB did not appear to form a macromolecular complex with poly(I) · poly(C) in that neither the ultraviolet absorption spectrum nor the melting point of poly(I) · poly(C) was altered by mixing with AmB. Isotopic studies indicated that AmB did not enhance binding of poly(I) · poly(C) to cells. Since the <b>macrolide</b> <b>polyenes</b> have been demonstrated to bind to cell membrane sterols with subsequent alterations in membrane permeability barriers, they may enhance interferon production by increasing cell penetration of poly(I) · poly(C) ...|$|R
40|$|N 3 -(4 -Methoxyfumaroyl) -L- 2, 3 -diaminopropanoic acid (FMDP) and 2 -amino- 2 deoxy-D-glucitol- 6 -phosphate (ADGP) {{are strong}} inhibitors of the {{essential}} fungal enzyme, glucosamine- 6 -phosphate synthase, but their antifungal activity is poor, due to slow penetration of these agents through the cytoplasmic membrane. In the present studies we have exploited the possibility of enhancement of ADGP and FMDP antifungal activity by improving their transport properties. It {{has been found that}} membrane-permeabilising <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> amphotericin B (AMB) and its N-methyl-N-fructosyl methyl ester derivative (MF-AME), at subinhibitory concentrations, facilitate diffusion of ADGP through the fungal cell membrane, thus allowing a decrease of its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Synergistic effects have been observed for combinations of ADGP with AMB or MF-AME. Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indexes, determined against a number of Candida spp., have been in the 0. 18 – 0. 81 range.

Members of this class include amphotericin B, {{which has been}} used widely to treat systemic fungal infections. A general synthetic strategy has been devised to prepare polyol chains associated with the polyene macrolides. Cyanohydrin acetonide alkylations were used to assemble the carbon skeleton, and a simple modification of the strategy allowed an advanced intermediate to be converted to either the candidin polyol or the nystatin polyol. The candidin polyol was further elaborated to a protected candidin aglycone. This strategy will be applicable to {{other members of the}} <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> natural products...|$|E

In addition to the three components occurring in the candidin complex {{at the end of}} the fermentation, two other “early” all-trans heptaene components have been characterized. They exist only during the phase of active biosynthesis of candidin. Two of the components of the <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> candihexin complex (hexaene) that have been described as lacking amino sugar were the only intracellular (mycelium-associated) components observed under conditions in which no extracellular polyene remained attached to the producing cell.

40|$|Several <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> are potent {{antifungal}} {{agents that}} have severe side effects. Increased glycosylation of these compounds can improve water solubility and reduce toxicity. Three extending glycosyltransferases {{are known to}} add hexoses to the mycosaminyl sugar residues of polyenes. The Actinoplanes caeruleus PegA enzyme catalyses attachment of a D-mannosyl residue in a β- 1, 4 linkage to the mycosamine of the aromatic heptaene 67 - 121 A to form 67 - 121 C. NppY from Pseudonocardia autotrophica adds an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to the mycosamine of 10 -deoxynystatin. NypY from Pseudonocardia sp. P 1 adds an extra hexose to a nystatin, but {{the identity of the}} sugar is unknown. Here, we express the nypY gene in Streptomyces nodosus amphL and show that NypY modifies 8 -deoxyamphotericins more efficiently than C- 8 hydroxylated forms. The modified heptaene was purified and shown to be mannosyl- 8 -deoxyamphotericin B. This had the same antifungal activity as amphotericin B but was slightly less haemolytic. Chemical modification of this new disaccharide polyene could give better antifungal antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> are potent {{antifungal}} {{agents that}} are also active against parasites, enveloped viruses and prion diseases. They are medically important as antifungal antibiotics but their therapeutic use is limited by serious side effects. In recent {{years there has been}} considerable progress in genetic analysis and manipulation of the streptomycetes that produce nystatin, amphotericin B, candicidin, pimaricin and rimocidin/CE- 108 -related polyenes. This has led to engineered biosynthesis of several new polyenes that are not easily obtained as semisynthetic derivatives. This review summarises recent advances made since the subject was last reviewed in 2003. Polyene biosynthesis generally involves assembly and cyclisation of a polyketide chain, followed by oxidative modifications and glycosylation of the macrolactone ring. New derivatives have been obtained by engineering both early and late stages of polyene biosynthetic pathways. These compounds have allowed more detailed investigations of structure-activity relationships and some are likely to show improvements in therapeutic index. The biosynthetic approach is already yielding sufficient material for testing the toxicity and activity of new compounds, thus opening possibilities for discovery of leads for development of effective and safe antifungal and antiparasitic agents...|$|R
40|$|Systemic and {{invasive}} mycoses {{caused by}} primary and opportunistic fungal pathogens have been emerging as global problems {{because of the}} increase in the number of immunocompro-mised individuals, due to solid-organ transplants, anti-cancer chemotherapy, and extended human lifespan. A recent report estimated that fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neofor-mans, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, are responsible for more than 1 million deaths annually [1]. Despite this, the availability of antifungal drugs or targets for antifungal drug development are very limited. This is unlike the situation of bacterial pathogens and, to an extent, the eukaryotic parasites (which is serious enough) because the animals share a more recent common ancestor with the fungi than other pathogens. Ergosterol and its biosynthetic enzymes are the most popular antifungal drug targets because of the structural distinguishabil-ity of ergosterol from cholesterol in mammalian cell membranes. <b>Polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> directly bind to ergosterol and generate lethal transmembrane channels that leak essential cellular ions and perturb osmotic balances, which leads to cell death [2].

40|$|The genes nysH and nysG, {{encoding}} putative ABC-type transporter proteins, {{are located}} at the flank of the nystatin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces noursei ATCC 11455. To assess the possible roles of these genes in nystatin biosynthesis, they were inactivated by gene replacements leading to in-frame deletions. Metabolite profile analysis of the nysH and nysG deletion mutants revealed {{that both of them}} synthesized nystatin at a reduced level and produced considerable amounts of a putative nystatin analogue. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses of the latter metabolite confirmed its identity as 10 -deoxynystatin, a nystatin precursor lacking a hydroxyl group at C- 10. Washing experiments demonstrated that both nystatin and 10 -deoxynystatin are transported out of cells, suggesting the existence of an alternative efflux system(s) for the transport of nystatin-related metabolites. This notion was further corroborated in experiments with the ATPase inhibitor sodium o-vanadate, which affected the production of nystatin and 10 -deoxynystatin in the wild-type strain and transporter mutants in a different manner. The data obtained in this study suggest that the efflux of nystatin-related <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> occurs through several transporters and that the NysH-NysG efflux system provides conditions favorable for C- 10 hydroxylation...|$|R
40|$|Since the <b>macrolide</b> <b>polyene</b> antibiotics, {{amphotericin}} B (AmB) and its {{methyl ester}} (AmBME), augment interferon production by polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I) :poly(C) ] in vitro, experiments were undertaken {{to determine how}} AmB and AmBME affect the antiviral activity of poly(I) :poly(C) and interferon. AmBME increased the direct antiviral activity of poly(I) :poly(C) 102 -to 104 -fold in L 929, Flow 6000, and T 98 G cells. Viral replication, measured by either direct plaque formation or virus yield, was markedly reduced. Serum interferon levels in mice induced by poly(I) :poly(C) were enhanced by concomitant treatment with AmB. However, the therapeutic effects of poly(I) :poly(C) in encephalomyocarditis and Semliki Forest virus infections were not augmented by combined treatment with poly(I) :poly(C) and AmB.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{action of}} <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> with antifungal activity, amphotericin B and natamycin, involves recognition of sterols in membranes. Physicochemical and functional studies have contributed details {{to understanding the}} interactions between amphotericin B and ergosterol and, to a lesser extent, with cholesterol. Fewer molecular details are available on interactions between natamycin with sterols. We use solid state 13 C MAS NMR to characterize the impact of amphotericin B and natamycin on mixed lipid membranes of DOPC/cholesterol or DOPC/ergosterol. In cholesterol-containing membranes, amphotericin B addition resulted in marked increase in both DOPC and cholesterol 13 C MAS NMR linewidth, reflecting membrane insertion and cooperative perturbation of the bilayer. By contrast, natamycin affects little either DOPC or cholesterol linewidth but attenuates cholesterol resonance intensity preferentially for sterol core with lesser impact on the chain. Ergosterol resonances, attenuated by amphotericin B, reveal specific interactions in the sterol core and chain base. Natamycin addition selectively augmented ergosterol resonances from sterol core ring one and, at the same time, {{from the end of}} the chain. This puts forward an interaction model similar to the head-to-tail model for amphotericin B/ergosterol pairing but with docking on opposite sterol faces. Low toxicity of natamycin is attributed to selective, non-cooperative sterol engagement compared to cooperative membrane perturbation by amphotericin B...|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the {{antifungal agent}} pimaricin by Streptomyces natalensis {{has been proposed}} to involve a cytochrome P 450 encoded by the gene pimD. Pimaricin is derived from its immediate precursor de-epoxypimaricin by epoxidation of the C- 4 –C- 5 double bond on the macrolactone ring. We have overproduced PimD with a N-terminal His 6 affinity tag in Escherichia coli and purified the enzyme for kinetic analysis. The protein showed a reduced CO-difference spectrum with a Soret maximum at 450  nm, indicating {{that it is a}} cytochrome P 450. Purified PimD was shown to catalyse the in vitro C- 4 –C- 5 epoxidation of 4, 5 -de-epoxypimaricin to pimaricin. The enzyme was dependent on NADPH for activity with optimal pH at 7. 5, and the temperature optimum was 30  °C.

In a survey of antifungal compounds from these bacteria, we discovered selvamicin, an unusual antifungal <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide,</b> in bacterial isolates from two neighboring ant nests. Selvamicin resembles the clinically important antifungals nystatin A 1 and amphotericin B, but it has several distinctive structural features: a noncationic 6 -deoxymannose sugar at the canonical glycosylation site and a second sugar, an unusual 4 -O-methyldigitoxose, {{at the opposite end}} of selvamicin’s shortened <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide.</b> It also lacks some of the pharmacokinetic liabilities of the clinical agents and appears to have a different target. Whole genome sequencing revealed the putative type I polyketide gene cluster responsible for selvamicin’s biosynthesis including a subcluster of genes consistent with selvamicin’s 4 -O-methyldigitoxose sugar. Although the selvamicin biosynthetic cluster is virtually identical in both bacterial producers, in one it is on the chromosome, in the other it is on a plasmid.

Among the two predicted bacteriocins, lanthipeptides are peptides that contain several post-translationally modified amino acid residues and commonly show considerable antimicrobial activity (van Heel et al. 2013 b). Meanwhile, the existence of gene cluster for LCI is strong supporting evidence indicating strain GFP- 2 can produce LCI. The prediction of these genes in the genome of Bacillus sp.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Polyene {{macrolides}} are a {{class of}} large macrocyclic polyketides that interact with membrane sterols, having antibiotic activity against fungi but not bacteria. Their rings include a chromophore of 3 – 7 conjugated double bonds which constitute the distinct polyene structure. Pimaricin is an archetype polyene, important in the food industry as a preservative to prevent mould contamination of foods, produced by Streptomyces natalensis. We set out to clone, sequence and analyse the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of this tetraene. Results: A large cluster of 16 open reading frames spanning 84   985 bp of the S. natalensis genome has been sequenced and found to encode 13 homologous sets of enzyme activities (modules) of a polyketide synthase (PKS) distributed within five giant multienzyme proteins (PIMS 0 –PIMS 4). The total of 60 constituent active sites, 25 of them on a single enzyme (PIMS 2), make this an exceptional multienzyme system. Eleven additional genes appear to govern modification of the polyketide-derived framework and export. Disruption of the genes encoding the PKS abolished pimaricin production. Conclusions: The overall architecture of the PKS gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the 26 -membered <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> pimaricin has been determined. Eleven additional tailoring genes have been cloned and analysed. The availability of the PKS cluster will facilitate the generation of designer pimaricins by combinatorial biosynthesis approaches.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} {{strains of the}} human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum resistant to most front-line antimalarial compounds is reason for grave clinical concern. The search for new drugs led us to investigate a number of membrane active <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics, such as amphotericin B, nystatin, filipin and natamycin. The interaction of these compounds with sterols in bilayer cell membranes can lead to cell damage and ultimately cell lysis. The malaria parasite modifies the host erythrocyte membrane by changing the protein and lipid composition and thus the infected cell could be a selective target for membrane active compounds. We found that erythrocytes infected with the trophozoite stage of P. falciparum were particularly susceptible to lysis by amphotericin B (Fungizone™) and, to a lesser extent, nystatin, as determined by ELISA and various microscopy assays. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome™) displayed a similar specificity for parasitised erythrocytes, but complete lysis required a longer incubation period. In contrast, filipin and natamycin did not distinguish between normal and parasite-infected erythrocytes, but lysed both at similar concentrations. In addition, when added to ring-stage cultures, the amphotericin B preparations and nystatin produced a marked disruption in parasite morphology in less than 2 h without an accompanying permeabilisation of the infected host cell, suggesting a second plasmodicidal mode of action. The results imply that selected <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics or their derivatives could find application {{in the treatment of}} severe malaria caused by of P. falciparum. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

There was no evident amphotericin B-induced stimulation of thymidine incorporation into infected BHK- 21 cells. The model presented may be useful to study the potentiation phenomenon of <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The post-polyketide synthase biosynthetic {{tailoring}} of <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> {{usually involves}} oxidations catalysed by cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s). Although members from {{this class of}} enzymes are common in macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters, their specificities vary considerably toward the substrates utilised and {{the positions of the}} hydroxyl functions introduced. In addition, some of them may yield epoxide groups. Therefore, the identification of novel macrolide monooxygenases with activities toward alternative substrates, particularly epoxidases, is a fundamental aspect of the growing field of combinatorial biosynthesis. The specific alteration of these activities should constitute a further source of novel analogues. We investigated this possibility by directed inactivation of one of the P 450 s belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster of an archetype polyene, pimaricin. Results: A recombinant mutant of the pimaricin-producing actinomycete Streptomyces natalensis produced a novel pimaricin derivative, 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin, as a major product. This biologically active product resulted from the phage-mediated targeted disruption of the gene pimD, which encodes the cytochrome P 450 epoxidase that converts deepoxypimaricin into pimaricin. The 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin has been identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance following high-performance liquid chromatography purification. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that PimD is the epoxidase responsible for the conversion of 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin to pimaricin in S. natalensis. The metabolite accumulated by the recombinant mutant, in which the epoxidase has been knocked out, constitutes the first designer polyene obtained by targeted manipulation of a polyene biosynthetic gene cluster. This novel epoxidase could prove to be valuable for the introduction of epoxy substituents into designer macrolides...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Polyenes {{represent}} a major class of antifungal agents characterised {{by the presence}} of a series of conjugated double bonds in their planar hydroxylated macrolide ring structure. Despite their general interest, very {{little is known about the}} factors that modulate their biosynthesis. Among these factors, we have recently discovered a new inducing compound (PI-factor) in the pimaricin producer Streptomyces natalensis, which elicits polyene production in a manner characteristic of quorum sensing. Here, we describe the involvement of an amino-acid exporter from S. natalensis in modulating the expression of pimaricin biosynthetic genes via secretion of the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. Results Adjacent to the pimaricin gene cluster lies a member of the RhtB family of amino-acid exporters. Gene deletion and complementation experiments provided evidence for a role for PimT in the export of L-homoserine, L-serine, and L-homoserine lactone. Expression of the gene was shown to be induced by homoserine and by the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. Interestingly, the mutant displayed 65 % loss of pimaricin production, and also 50 % decrease in the production of PI, indicating that PimT is used as PI-factor exporter, and suggesting that the effect in antifungal production might be due to limited secretion of the inducer. Conclusion This report describes the involvement of an amino acid exporter (encoded by pimT in the vicinity of the pimaricin cluster) in modulating the expression of antibiotic biosynthetic genes via secretion of the quorum-sensing pimaricin-inducer PI-factor. The discovery of the participation of amino acid exporters in a signal transduction cascade for the production of <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> is unexpected, and represents an important step forward towards understanding the regulatory network for polyene regulation. Additionally, this finding constitutes the first detailed characterization of an amino-acid exporter in an Actinomycete, and to our knowledge, the first evidence for the implication of this type of exporters in quorum sensing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dia{{stereoselective}} Synthesis of syn- 1, 3 -Polyols The stereoselective {{construction of}} polyacetate 1, 3 -diols has attracted considerable attention {{due to the}} ubiquity of this motif in complex biologically active <b>polyene</b> <b>macrolides</b> (amphotericin B, RK- 397, mycoticin, candidin). We have developed a highly stereoselective bismuth(III) -mediated two-component hemiacetal/oxa-conjugate addition reaction, which directly provides syn- 1, 3 -diols {{in the form of}} cyclic acetals having an adjacent electron-withdrawing group in the form of aldehydes and ketones. The scope and limitations of this transformation were examined and culminated with the synthesis of the C 18 -C 28 fragment of antibiotic RK- 397. Studies towards the C 1 -C 31 and C 32 -C 52 Fragments of Amphidinol 3 Temporary-tethered reactions provide an important strategy for target- directed synthesis, since they circumvent the problems encountered with entropically unfavorable reactions. The temporary silicon-tethered ring-closing metathesis (TST- RCM) allows for the highly (Z) -selective coupling of mixed silaketals {{in the formation of the}} medium sized rings. The latter compounds can undergo a substrate controlled stereoselective electrophilic functionalisation, for example, hydroboration, dihydroxylation or epoxidation, and produce polyoxygenated motifs that are present in many biologically important natural products. In the course of these studies we have developed a highly convergent asymmetric synthesis of the C 1 -C 31 polyol fragment of amphidinol 3, where the TST-RCM/hydroboration reaction is successfully employed for the efficient coupling ii of the C 16 -C 23 and C 24 -C 30 units of the natural product with concomitant introduction of the crucial propionate-type C 23 -C 24 stereocentres. In the final part of thesis the investigation of the stereoselective dihydroxylation reaction of mixed syn and anti eight-membered cyclic silaketals was carried out. The resulting oxygenated products can be efficiently transformed via an intramolecular cyclisation of δ-hydroxy epoxides into the highly substituted syn- and anti-tetrahydropyrans (THPs), a strategy that could also have application in related natural products, for example, ladder polyether polyketides. The merit of the developed methodology was highlighted in the asymmetric synthesis of the common C 31 (52) -C 39 (44) THP fragment of amphidinol 3, which could be ultimately used in the bidirectional route towards the bis-THP segment of the natural product...|$|R
