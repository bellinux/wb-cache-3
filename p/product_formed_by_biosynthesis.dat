40|$|To {{evaluate}} the possible detection of single enzyme activity via electrochemical methods, a combined finite difference and random walk simulation {{is used to}} model individual enzyme-electrode collisions where such events are monitored amperometrically via the measurement of <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> the enzyme in solution. It is found that the observed signal is highly sensitive to both the enzyme turnover number, {{the size of the}} electrode and the bandwidth of the electronics. Taking single catalase impacts as an example, simulation results are compared with experimental data. Our work shows the requirement for the detection of electrochemically active <b>product</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> individual enzymes and gives guidance for the design of experiments...|$|R

40|$|Head-space gas-liquid {{chromatography}} and mass spectrometry {{were used to}} detect and identify <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, and P. rettgeri from a defined medium supplemented with either phenylalanine, methionine, valine, leucine, histidine, lysine, ornithine, threonine, asparagine, aspartic acid, or tryptophan. In a detailed study of the <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> 68 strains of Proteus spp. from L-methionine, the production of large amounts of both dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan {{was found to be}} a characteristic of the genus. Both sulfur products appeared within a few hours of inoculation. Dimethyl disulfide was a more sensitive indicator of growth than the spectrometric determination of optical density. This suggests that it could be useful for the rapid, automated detection of any species of Proteus...|$|R
40|$|Secondary ion mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) {{has been used}} for analyzing corrosion <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> on the iron surface by reaction of an iron substrate with aqueous solutions containing two percent sodium chloride. In order to follow a formation process of the corrosion products, hydrogen and oxygen in the aqueous solutions were labeled with stable isotopes, D(2 H) and 18 O, respectively. Mass spectra of positive and negative ions showed that deuterium was contained in corrosion <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> reaction with D 2 O solution. On the other hand, 16 O relevant ion peaks as well as 18 O relevant ion peaks were found in corrosion <b>products</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> reaction with H 218 O solution. This indicates that oxygen in the corrosion products is mainly composed of oxygen originating from air and oxygen in aqueous solution. A formation process of corrosion products was discussed {{on the basis of these}} results...|$|R

40|$|The {{reaction}} of the methyl cation with hydrogen cyanide is revisited. We have confidence that we have resolved a long standing apparent contradiction of experimental results. A literature history is presented along with one new experiment and a reexamination of an old experiment. In this present work it is shown {{that all of the}} previous studies had made consistent observations. Yet, each of the previous studies failed to observe all of the information present. The methyl cation does react with HCN by radiative association, a fact which had been in doubt. The <b>product</b> ions <b>formed</b> in the two-body and three-body processes react differently with HCN. The collisionally stabilized association <b>product</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> a three-body mechanism does not react with HCN and is readily detected in the experiments. The radiatively stabilized association <b>product,</b> <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> a slow two-body reaction, is not detected because it reacts with HCN by a fast proton transfer reaction forming the protonated HCN ion...|$|R

30|$|The {{reaction}} conditions {{involved in}} this approach for 15 requires pressure reactor, high temperature and longer reaction time (40 – 45  h) which is unsafe to handle at commercial scale.

Nucleophilic opening of this epoxide can occur by attack at either the 1 or 2 position.
