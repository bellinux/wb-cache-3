40|$|The {{process of}} {{constructing}} a sustainable green building presents {{a number of}} challenges compared with regular buildings. Additional work and documentation is needed in every stage of the project life cycle for the sustainable building to reach its goal of being certified {{according to one of}} the available sustainability rating systems. One of the most important steps toward achieving that goal is the eco-charrette process that takes place during the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> of the project. The importance of this step {{stems from the fact that}} it sets the sustainability goals and objectives for the entire project. This necessitates the creation of an effective decision support methodology that will support project stakeholders in setting the sustainability goals and objectives of the project before committing valuable time and budget resources to the eco-charrette process. Therefore, this paper presents the development of an agent-based model for simulating the interactions between project stakeholders in the sustainability goal and objective setting process of the project <b>predesign</b> <b>phase.</b> The proposed model was developed based on extensive interviews with industry professionals and project stakeholders, and was tested and validated using a case study of an institutional building project. Simulation results were shown to closely resemble the actual case studies evaluated and highlighted the sensitivity and relationships of building design parameters.

40|$|A common {{propellant}} grain geometry for solid rocket motors {{consisting of a}} combined cylindrical and finocyl geometry is explained. The burn-off is simulated by a DLR simulation tool, which gives amongst others a thrust curve as the result. The burn-off simulator was coupled with an optimizer, which uses a Mesh Adaptive Direct Search method to find an optimal solution using a black box program. The assessment function and several constraints are explained. A {{propellant grain}} for a possible booster stage for a hypothetical space launcher is designed using {{the combination of the}} burn-off simulator and the optimizer.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a set of}} {{software}} tools for improving and speeding up the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> in antenna design workflow has been designed based on theoretical formulation. During an internship at IDS S. p. A, a number of Python-based tools have been developed and integrated in the software Galileo EMT, the electromagnetic toolkit of the CAE suite produced by IDS S. p. A. Initially, the theoretical design criteria of rectangular microstrip antennas, rectangular horn, double ridged horn antennas, archimedean spiral, equiangular spiral antennas and a microstrip to parallel stripline balun to feed spiral antennas have been analyzed. After {{the implementation of the}} tools, a design validation has been done through full-wave simulations, comparison with commercial products or scientific papers, prototypes and measurements. Furthermore, a cavity-backed spiral antenna for GNSS applications has been designed by using the proper developed tool. The proposed antenna was designed for direction finding application in L frequency band for GNSS monitors, context in which IDS S. p.

40|$|Stakeholders of {{the built}} {{environment}} including owners, designers, and facility managers have recently begun to consider sustainability as a realistic and beneficial goal for their capital facilities. Over the past few years, there has been increasing evidence that sustainable design and construction results in built environments that are user friendly and energy efficient with lower cost. Governments and organizations started to support sustainability efforts by developing policy and guidance documents on how sustainability can be achieved. However, little effort {{has been made to}} examine how these documents are transformed from rules, policies, and strategies into actual practices, and to investigate their implement-ability. This paper tests several assumptions about the value and role of these documents. These are: current guidance documents are not clear about the intended stakeholders who are expected to use them, they do not address the project delivery processes, do not address sustainability early in those processes, do not provide tools for architects and engineers to utilize while implementing the guidelines in real life practices, and that there are obstacles the professional community faces in implementing those guidelines. The paper envisions a new approach by reporting on critical activities and processes adopted in the B- 3 Project “Building, Benchmarks, and Beyond,” a project conceived by the government of the state of Minnesota to develop sustainable design guidelines for all public buildings in the state to be implemented starting from January 2004. As an integral component of the B- 3 project an inductive analysis procedure has been conducted for five guidance documents. These are: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System (National), Triangle Region Public Facilities High Performance Guidelines (North Carolina), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Guidelines for Creating High Performance Green Buildings (Pennsylvania), High Performance Building Guidelines (New York), and University of Minnesota Sustainable Design Guide (Minnesota). The analysis included overview, intended reader, and goals of each guidance document. However, emphasis was placed on the process aspects as an endeavor to answer a crucial set of questions including: how these documents place value on the process in general terms, what and how different phases of a project delivery are addressed, what documentation is required, and whether they include supporting and compliance tools. A survey of selected Minnesota design professionals has been conducted representing a feedback mechanism where designers {{were asked to respond to}} questions that pertain to their familiarity with guidelines systems developed previously at the Minnesota state or national levels and to indicate weaknesses and strengths of these documents based on their experience. They were also asked to provide suggestions toward the development of Minnesota state sustainable design guidelines. The results of the inductive analysis and the survey of Minnesota architects/engineers reveal that current sustainable design guidance documents have several shortcomings pertaining to the issues examined. This mandated the need for emphasizing the project delivery process aspects, addressing sustainable design features early in this process [...] in the <b>predesign</b> and programming <b>phases</b> [...] , and developing supporting tools to facilitate this process. This necessitated the inclusion of an integrated and performance management guidance component that has the capacity to overcome the obstacles revealed in the examined guidance documents and expressed by the professional community...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{during the}} <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> of new {{airplane}} configurations many different technical disciplines are involved, for example aerodynamics, structure mechanics, flight dynamic, and propulsion technology. There exist strong dependencies {{between the individual}} technical disciplines, so that optimization in each single discipline only will inevitably fail to yield a global optimum. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} consider the overall system in order to evaluate the potential of new technologies realistically. We present a software solution which enable stand-alone applications to cooperate in a multidiscipline simulation environment to allow for a global optimization process. To this end, an XML-based common data format taylored to the requirements of airplane configuration for data exchange has been defined and a set of libraries for the processing of this data format have been implemented to enable the stand-alone tools {{to communicate with each other}} using this format. The data format permits the parametric representations of the geometry of airplane parts and a library to perform geometrical computations based on this representation has been developed. An automated optimization process has been set-up by integrating the separate application's into a simulation framework...|$|E
40|$|Sub-theme 12 : Understanding Organizations as Process: Organization without Design In this paper, we analyze how the {{intentional}} {{lack of an}} urban design plan enabled a creative process of involvement between multiple actors. The fact that the urban design plan was not represented physically meant that the project’s actors had to search for solutions through explorative actions while redefining themselves with respect {{to one another and}} their collective role. Their roles in relation to the project were transformed through their interactions and the openness of the project itself, which we call a ‘spontaneous model’. In our analysis we draw upon Mead’s (1934) processual theory of meaning creation through social � � interaction. We attempt to understand the phenomena that made it possible to design a new district in a town without using any a priori formal graphic representations, in a one-year <b>predesign</b> <b>phase.</b> Traditional urban project design methods demand that a formal graphic representation of the mayor’s (or the contractor’s) wishes be drawn up before starting off a comprehensive legal-contractual process, which aims above all to exclude any ‘arrangements ’ between contractors and service providers. We show how a process ‘without design ’ became possibl...|$|E
40|$|Successfully designing, constructing, and {{operating}} high-performance buildings requires the building owner and {{all members of}} the design team to set goals to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. The team should establish these goals early in the design process and maintain them through the building occupation. One method for achieving high-performance building goals is to follow the energy design process. This process begins in the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> and continues after the building is commissioned and occupied. Understanding which strategies are best suited for the building site and function, setting aggressive energy targets early, and relying on computer simulations to evaluate design options are essential to the process. The building envelope is designed first to minimize energy consumption. The mechanical/electrical/control systems are designed after optimizing the envelope design. Detailed specifications must accurately reflect the design intent. After construction, the building is commissioned, the owner/operators are instructed on the optimal operation of the building, and building operation documents are provided for future reference. This paper focuses on the energy design process. An actual high-performance building demonstrates how to apply the process. This building incorporates energy-efficient and renewable energy design features including daylighting, passive heating and cooling, improved thermal envelope, and photovoltaics...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{research}} shows {{a relationship between}} healthcare architecture and patient-related outcomes. The planning and designing of new healthcare environments is a complex process. The needs of the various end users of the environment must be considered, including the patients, the patients' significant others, and the staff. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals participating in group modeling utilizing system dynamics in the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> of new healthcare environments. We engaged healthcare professionals in a series of workshops using system dynamics to discuss the planning of healthcare environments in the beginning of a construction and then interviewed them about their experience. Methods: An explorative and qualitative design was used to describe participants' experiences of participating in the group-modeling projects. Participants (N = 20) were recruited from a larger intervention study using group modeling and system dynamics in planning and designing projects. The interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Results: Two themes were formed, representing the experiences in the group-modeling process: Participation in the group modeling generated knowledge and was empowering and Participation in the group modeling differed from what was expected and required the dedication of time and skills. Conclusions: The method can support participants in design teams to focus more on their healthcare organization, their care activities, and their aims rather than focusing on detailed layout solutions. This clarification is important when decisions about the design are discussed and prepared and will most likely lead to greater readiness for future building process...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 9 th Nov. 2017. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} study was to understand and evaluate the effect of different factors including age, gender, disabilities and medical conditions on joint mobility. Joint mobility data {{from a group of}} 66 people from a previously existing database has been re-analysed. Twenty four participants had disabilities and 42 participants were considered to be ‘able bodied’ with no recognised disability. For each individual, 18 joint range of motion values were measured and an ANOVA test was employed to demonstrate the influence of the selected factors on joint range of motion. Post Hoc (Tukey) tests were also performed to gain deeper insight into significance levels and correlations between the factors. The results clearly indicate that joint ROM significantly decreases (p< 0. 05) with increasing age for arm abduction, arm medial and lateral rotation, wrist flexion and wrist adduction. Moreover, people with disabilities (wheelchair users and arthritis sufferers) showed a considerable decrease in joint mobility for arm flexion, arm abduction, arm lateral rotation, elbow flexion, elbow supination, wrist extension and wrist flexion. The results also highlight that designing products, equipment, services or workplaces against 5 th and 95 th percentile criteria is unable to provide appropriate and necessary support for achieving the objective of design inclusiveness. Rather designers should have a deep insight of the data variations at a <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> so that more appropriate and informed design decisions can be made that {{are more likely to be}} acceptable for a broad range of the population...|$|E
40|$|Widespread {{concern about}} the impact of the {{emission}} of greenhouse gases on global climate is leading to proposals to reduce such emissions. As a result, this should provide a great stimulus to energy conservation, since it can achieve a reduction in energy consumption without dampening economic activity. During the 1980 &# 146;s, considerable progress has been accomplished in developing improved design methods for process integration, of which the most widely known is pinch technology. While this technique is successful for determining targets in the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase,</b> it has been realised that the minimum approach temperature (AT^) constraint used in the pinch design method (PDM) is too rigid and inevitably limits the flexibility of the designer. In this research, the flexible pinch design method (FPDM) is developed by integrating the art of process design and the science of artificial intelligence (AI) for the synthesis of optimal energy recovery networks. The flexible pinch design can be applied on both free hand basis guided by FPDM Heuristics and computer basis automated by the software, named FLEXNET. FLEXNET employs the A* heuristic search algorithm to guide the problem-solving strategy. As a design philosophy, FPDM is not constrained by any global exchanger minimum approach temperature, instead, a variable approach temperature is used. Alternative designs are generated heuristically and tested by exploiting a hierarchy of decision systems implemented in FLEXNET. The design strategy combined with thermodynamic insights makes the FPDM flexible and efficient to apply to practical situations. The application of the FPDM is well-demonstrated by comparison with designs from eight published case studies, half of which are based on data from industrial processes. It was found that the heat exchanger networks (HENs) designed by the FPDM are not only simpler but also cheaper compared with those designed by currently available methods. It is experienced that for the same operating costs significant capital cost savings of up to 10 - 15 % are often achieved by applying the FPDM...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays bonded scarf repairs are {{the state}} of the art {{technology}} to repair composite aircraft structures. Due to current aerospace regulations [1] the size of bonded repairs is limited. Today low scarfing angles generate large mechanical reserves at the cost of big repair sizes. The influence of design parameters on adhesive scarf stresses has been thoroughly investigated by several authors [2 – 5] in the past. Most of the time finite element models are used to derive material or geometric parameter dependencies on the scarf stresses and strength. There are analytical solutions to the constituent equations of the scarf stresses as found by Hart Smith [6 – 8] but these are iterative solutions. An easy to use formula for the adhesive stresses is given by Baker et al. [9] deriving a peak stress criterion for a given laminate. A comprehensive study has been performed developing a design method improving the straight forward peak stress criterion to get a better approximation of the adhesive scarf stresses. The proposed formula takes effects resulting from the stacking sequence, adhesive thickness as well as adherent offsets into account. Differences of laminate stacking sequences and their effects on the adhesive stress distribution are discussed. The improved analytical prediction is compared to finite element and experimental results. The proposed method is fast and easy to use, providing an improved precision for composite engineers within the <b>predesign</b> <b>phase</b> of bonded repairs. References [1] FAA (ed.).
