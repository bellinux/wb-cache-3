5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a <b>passing</b> <b>shot.</b> Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E
25|$|Tsonga {{is known}} for his {{aggressive}} groundstrokes. His forehand and backhand are both effective in setting up points. His powerful, heavy and accurate forehand is his most consistent shot, especially when delivered down the line. Although his backhand is generally not as strong as his forehand during the rallies, he is very capable of hitting attacking shots on his backhand wing. His net play is skillful, especially on attack. He can play both two-handed and one-handed backhand. He added the one-handed backhand to his repertoire midway through 2011 as was evident in his matches against Murray in the final of Queen's Club and against Federer in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. Although rarely used as a groundstroke in a neutral rally, it is particularly effective as a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> down the line or cross-court.|$|E
25|$|Agassi's {{strength}} was in dictating play {{from the back}} of the court. While he was growing up, his father and Nick Bollettieri trained him in this way. When in control of a point, Agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. This change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, Brad Gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. Gilbert encouraged Agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted Agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot. A signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. This would often be followed by a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.|$|E

50|$|Early in his career, Lendl {{played a}} sliced backhand, {{but in the}} early 1980s he learned to hit his backhand with {{significant}} topspin. This shift allowed him to defeat John McEnroe in 1984 in the French Open, Lendl's first Grand Slam victory. In the first two sets, McEnroe used his habitual proximity to the net to intercept Lendl's cross-court <b>passing</b> <b>shots.</b> In the third set, Lendl started using lobs, forcing McEnroe to distance himself from the net to prepare for the lobs. McEnroe's further distance from the net opened the angles for Lendl's cross-court <b>passing</b> <b>shots,</b> which ultimately gained Lendl points and turned the match around.|$|R
50|$|McEnroe {{played to}} the crowd, {{making fun of}} himself, only {{occasionally}} glaring at the linesman or umpire and throwing his racquet just twice. In spite of being 52, Borg showed he hadn't lost his touch, still exhibiting some sublime <b>passing</b> <b>shots</b> that left 49-year-old McEnroe grudgingly nodding his approval.|$|R
25|$|In 1985, Navratilova {{played in}} what many {{consider}} to be perhaps the best woman's match of all time, the French Open final against Chris Evert. Navratilova battled back from 3–6, 2–4 down to 5-5 all in the third set, before Evert hit a winning backhand <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> on match point to defeat Navratilova 6–3, 6–7(4), 7–5. This was a major turnaround for Evert, who was so outmatched the year earlier in the final that Bud Collins remarked as a TV commentator that the sport needed to create a higher league for Navratilova to compete in. In outdoor matches against Evert, Navratilova led 10–5 on grass and 9–7 on hardcourts, while Evert was up 11–3 on clay. On indoor courts, however, Navratilova had a decisive 21–14 lead. At the end of what {{is widely regarded as}} the greatest rivalry in women's tennis, Navratilova led Evert 43–37 in total matches, 14–8 in Grand Slams and 10–4 in Grand Slam finals.|$|E
2500|$|At 7:00 a.m. on 11 July 1882 Admiral Seymour aboard HMS Invincible {{signaled}} to [...] to commence firing at the Ras El Tin fortifications {{followed by the}} general order to attack the enemy's batteries. According to Royle, [...] " [...] steady cannonade was maintained by the attacking and defending forces, {{and for the next}} few hours the roar of the guns and the shrieks of <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> and shell were alone audible." [...] The attack was carried out by the off-shore squadron as it was underway, the ships turning {{from time to time to}} keep up the barrage. This was not entirely effective and by 9:40, HMS Sultan, HMS Superb and HMS Alexandra anchored off the Lighthouse Fort and concentrated their now-stationary batteries on Ras El Tin. The fort battery was able to score hits, particularly on Alexandra, but by 12:30, Inflexible had joined the attack and the fort's guns were silenced.|$|E

25|$|Pablo Cuevas has a clay-court {{style of}} play. He {{utilizes}} heavy topspin off his forehand side and plays a one-handed backhand. His one-handed backhand {{is not a}} weakness, and he uses it well to create angles and to hit <b>passing</b> <b>shots.</b> Cuevas also has a good slice. For most of his serves, he uses a heavy kick serve. Most of his skill set was on display when he defeated Andy Roddick in Miami in 2011.|$|R
60|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{was in the}} act of replying to this saying with {{a cheerful}} laugh, when the whistling of a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> was instantly succeeded by a crash of splintered wood; and at the next moment the head of the mainmast, after tottering for an instant in the gale, fell towards the deck, bringing with it the mainsail, and the long line of topmast, that had been bearing the emblems of America, as the cockswain had expressed it, among the stars of the heavens.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> is a {{forceful}} shot, as in tennis or team handball, that travels {{to one side}} {{out of the reach}} of one's opponent. In tennis, this shot is generally a groundstroke and is used when one's opponent is running to the net or if he is at the net already. The alternative to a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> is to lob the ball over the opponent's head. The aim of the <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> in tennis is to prevent the opponent from returning the ball once he/she is at the net.|$|E

50|$|One of Maradona's {{trademark}} moves was dribbling full-speed on {{the right}} wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross <b>pass</b> <b>shot</b> behind the leg that holds all the weight. This maneuver led to several assists, such as the powerful cross for Ramón Díaz's header in the 1980 friendly against Switzerland. He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker.|$|R

25|$|He {{began the}} year with a 42-match win streak, winning his first six events {{of the year and}} {{reaching}} his first French Open final, where his opponent was Ivan Lendl. McEnroe won the first two sets, but Lendl's adjustments of using more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand <b>passing</b> <b>shots,</b> as well as McEnroe's fatigue and temperamental outbursts, resulted in a demoralizing five-set loss. In his autobiography, McEnroe described this as his most bitter defeat and implied that he's never quite gotten over it.|$|R

50|$|Valerio learned {{playing tennis}} {{from her father}} and she played on a tennis court at her home. Before {{settling}} on tennis she practiced fencing, horse riding and skiing. Her favorite strokes were the forehand <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> and cut service.|$|E
50|$|Fast returnThe {{fast return}} is {{probably}} the most simple and common form of <b>passing</b> <b>shot.</b> Because the opponent has a shorter reaction time when they are at the net as compared to the baseline, a fast return can catch them off-guard or render them unable to react quickly enough. A fast return is usually played with great power as angled as possible either cross-court or down-the-line. To be able to hit such a shot, a player must have either a very strong and flat forehand or backhand, and not all players are able to execute such a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> well. Players who are adept at using pace to execute passing shots include Andre Agassi, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.|$|E

The practice mode is essential for both masters and newcomers to prepare for the exhibition, tourney, challenge and quest parts of the game.|$|R

He added the Eastern Clay Court Championships to his accolades the same year by eliminating Dick Savitt in the final.|$|R

50|$|Thus tennis shots can be {{categorized}} according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they are hit (lob, <b>passing</b> <b>shot,</b> dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).|$|E
50|$|At {{lower levels}} of the game, not all players have {{penetrating}} volleys and strong overhead shots. So, many use up-and-back strategy. The weakness in this formation is the large angular gap it creates between partners, a gap that an opposing net player can easily hit a clean winner through if they successfully poach a <b>passing</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

50|$|According to Riggs, however, Budge {{still had}} a very powerful, very deadly {{overhead}} and rather than winning outright very many points with his lobbing, he actually achieved two other goals: his constant lobbing led Budge to play somewhat deeper at the net {{than he would have}} otherwise, thereby making it easier for Riggs to hit <b>passing</b> <b>shots</b> for winners; and the constant lobbing helped to wear Budge down by forcing him to run back to the backline time after time. Budge reached two more U.S. Pro finals, losing in 1949 at Forest Hills to Riggs and in 1953 in Cleveland to Pancho Gonzales.|$|R

5000|$|A {{serve and}} volleyer {{has a great}} net game, is quick around the net, and has fine touch for volleys. Serve and volleyers {{come up to the}} net at every {{opportunity}} when serving. They are almost always attackers and can hit many winners with varieties of volleys and drop volleys. When not serving, they often employ the [...] "chip-and-charge", chipping back the serve without attempting to hit a winner and rushing the net. The serve-and-volleyers' strategy is to put pressure on the opponent to try to hit difficult <b>passing</b> <b>shots.</b> This strategy is extremely effective against pushers.|$|R
5000|$|BluffingBluffing is {{probably}} the hardest way to execute a <b>passing</b> <b>shot</b> and requires a good touch {{as well as the}} ability to [...] "confuse" [...] the opponent well. When at the net, the opponent often takes note of the direction the other player is looking at, in order to guess which direction he/she will be hitting and anticipate in advance. This can be exploited by bluffing. Bluffing involves looking in one direction {{in order to make the}} opponent think the shot will be played in that direction, then while keeping the rest of the body angled towards that direction, the ball is hit gently towards the other direction, effectively passing the opponent. However, this makes it hard to execute as one will have to hit the ball without looking in the direction one wants to hit it in, making it hard to aim accurately. This is the rarest way of executing a <b>passing</b> <b>shot,</b> and has only been seen used occasionally by players such as Roger Federer.|$|E

5000|$|Straight-in {{shots are}} usually meant {{to hit the}} front wall as low as possible. If the ball {{contacts}} the front wall so low as to bounce twice before it reaches the service line it is called a [...] "kill" [...] shot. Straight-in shots are normally attempted {{with the idea of}} hitting toward the area of the court the opponent cannot cover. Straight-in shots hit where the opponent can't return them are called down-the-line and cross court <b>passing</b> <b>shots.</b> Often kill shots are returned very close to the back wall as the ball is moving towards the front wall.|$|R
25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to <b>passing</b> <b>shots.</b> Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|R
