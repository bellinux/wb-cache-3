40|$|Virtually every known pair of isospectral but nonisometric {{manifolds}} - with as {{most famous}} members isospectral bounded R-planar domains which makes one "not hear {{the shape of}} a drum" [13] - arise from the (group theoretical) Gassman-Sunada method. Moreover, all the known R-planar examples (so counter examples to Kac's question) are constructed through a famous specialization of this method, called transplantation. We first describe a number of very general classes of <b>length</b> <b>equivalent</b> manifolds, with as particular cases isospectral manifolds, in each of the constructions starting from a given example that arises itself from the Gassman-Sunada method. The constructions include the examples arising from the transplantation technique (and thus in particular the planar examples). To that end, we introduce four properties - called FF, MAX, PAIR and INV - inspired by natural physical properties (which rule out trivial constructions), that are satisfied for each of the known planar examples. Vice versa, we show that <b>length</b> <b>equivalent</b> manifolds with FF, MAX, PAIR and INV which arise from the Gassman-Sunada method, must fall under one of our prior constructions, thus describing a precise classification of these objects. Due to the nature of our constructions and properties, a deep connection with finite simple groups occurs which seems, perhaps, rather surprising {{in the context of this}} paper. On the other hand, our properties define physically irreducible pairs of <b>length</b> <b>equivalent</b> manifolds - "atoms" of general pairs of <b>length</b> <b>equivalent</b> manifolds, in that such a general pair of manifolds is patched up out of irreducible pairs - and that is precisely what simple groups are for general groups.
