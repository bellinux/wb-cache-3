30|$|Gas {{injection}} {{involves the}} injection of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen and other agents to dissolve and mobilize hydrocarbon components {{of crude oil}} (Orr 2005; Rossen and Bruining 2007; van Batenburg et al. 2010). Unfortunately, injection of steam or gas (carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and natural gas) into a reservoir results in a poor sweep efficiency (Rossen and van Duijn 2004; Farajzadeh et al. 2012). Gas injection also suffers from channeling, viscous fingering, and gravity overrides due to the reservoir heterogeneity and its low viscosity and density compared with the resident oil in the reservoir. The less viscous gases have a greater tendency to finger through the existing high-permeability channel pathways or {{to rise to the}} top of the reservoir as a result of gravity override, resulting in premature gas breakthrough (Apaydin and Kovscek 2001; <b>Pal</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> Hence, the concept of mobility control was proposed in order to mitigate gas fingering and gravity override (Yang and Reed 1989; Kharrat and Mahdavi 2012).|$|E
30|$|Foam {{flooding}} {{was introduced}} {{as an effective}} method to reduce the injected gas mobility (Bond and Holbrook 1958), especially carbon dioxide foam, due to the achievable miscibility and greenhouse gas control (Li et al. 2016). Improvement in oil recovery due to high apparent viscosity and favorable flow behavior of foams in porous media {{has been reported in}} the results of previous studies (Rossen and Bruining 2007; Andrianov et al. 2012; <b>Pal</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> Due to a significant reduction in gas and injected water mobility, the fluids were diverted from high-permeability zones to low-permeability upswept zones during the conventional foam (surfactant-stabilized foam) flow in porous media (Wang 1984; Alkan et al. 1991; Kim et al. 2005; Ashoori et al. 2012; Farzaneh and Sohrabi 2013). However, surfactant-stabilized foams are kinetically unstable and coalesce easily in porous media, especially in the presence of oil and in high-salinity and high-temperature environments (Bernard and Holm 1964; Kornev et al. 1999; Alargova et al. 2004; Rodriguez et al. 2007; Hunter et al. 2008). Consequently, a surfactant–silica nanoparticle combination has been recently introduced in order to generate durable foams and to address the limitations of the conventional surfactant-stabilized foams (Binks and Fletcher 2001; Binks 2002; Fujii et al. 2006; Hunter et al. 2009; Yekeen, et al. 2017 a).|$|E

Combination {{of one or more}} of these methods can also be employed to enhance the efficiency of the process. Generally, to get anhydrous (>[*] 99 %) ethanol, at first, distillation is carried out to get a purity of 72 – 92 % (the azeotrope concentration is 95.6 wt%), followed by adsorption to remove rest of the water. The energy consumption of this combined process is about 3.9  MJ/kg compared with that of the single distillation processes (in the range of 6 – 9  MJ/kg) (Sun <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007).|$|R

30|$|Constructional uses of SAHs mainly include {{preparation}} of cementation (Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017</b> b) and demolition of building structures (Ismail <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013).

Kinetics and water release behavior of SAHs during cementations have been investigated recently by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Snoeck <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> However, this approach of using synthetic SAHs has also some innate limitations such as formation of macropores that adversely affects the concrete strength (Gupta <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Mechtcherine <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2017; Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017</b> b; Schröfl <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> Some recent works (Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017</b> a; Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2016; Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017</b> c; Mignon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017</b> d; Schröfl <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017)</b> have suggested use of cellulose-based SAHs in mitigating the strength problem due to excessive swelling of synthetic SAHs.

30|$|The third {{classification}} of FIA plots was a recently developed set of empirically-derived forest community types (Costanza <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> The empirical classification used an unsupervised hierarchical method to cluster tree species composition information within FIA inventory plots across the conterminous U.S. (Costanza <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b> The clusters {{were based on}} the relative importance value for species in each plot, using the same set of species described above and trees greater than 2.54  cm (1  in.) diameter at breast height (Costanza <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2017).</b>|$|R

A framework presented by Wieland <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2017)</b> highlights that both statistical and judgmental criteria {{need to be}} taken under consideration when making scale purification decision.|$|R

30|$|Apparently, for {{mechanistic}} biomarker {{discovery and}} CVD management, {{it is of}} primary importance to pinpoint the causal role of gut microbiota derived metabolites. Koch’s postulate, which states that a given pathogen leads to a distinct disease, have been evolving into molecular and ecological Koch’s postulate including CVD (Vonaesch <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2018). Therefore, many ongoing efforts have been focusing on the causality of gut microbiota derived metabolites in CVD. Key methodologies include randomized controlled trials (Tang <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2013; Panigrahi <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2017),</b> Mendelian randomization approach (Mendelson <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2017)</b> and gnotobiotic animal models (Hibberd <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2017).</b>|$|R
