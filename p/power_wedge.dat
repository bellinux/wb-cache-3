Vowels would initially cost the contestant a flat rate of P2,500 (unless the contestant does not receive any money), but this rule was later scrapped.

A similar P200,000 one-thirds size wedge (again surrounded by Bankrupts) also appears in Rounds 4 and beyond.

A series of overflights was accomplished during March 1977 over an agricultural test site in Kern County, Calif. Soil moisture samples were collected from bare fields at nine sites at depths of 0 - 2, 2 - 5, 5 - 15, and 15 - 30 cm.

As a consequence we recover (and in some cases strengthen) previously results establishing the Quillen invariance of alge-bra model structures via w. e. s of operads, compatibility with cofibrations of the forgetful functors from algebras to spectra and Reedy cofibrancy of bar constructions.

A training subsidy to firms {{can also be used to}} achieve first-best. Trade unions might also remedy the market failure, in two ways.

Two-dimensional power spectra (power in Fourier modes parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight) formed from interferometric visibilities have been shown to delineate a boundary between spectrally-smooth foregrounds (known as the wedge) and spectrally-structured 21 cm background emission (the EoR-window). However, polarized foregrounds are known to possess spectral structure due to Faraday rotation, which can leak into the EoR window. In this work, we create and analyze 2 D power spectra from the PAPER- 32 imaging array in Stokes I, Q, U and V. These allow us to observe and diagnose systematic effects in our calibration at high signal-to-noise within the Fourier space most relevant to EoR experiments.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the effect of {{unemployment}} and labour institutions such as employment protection legislation, coverage of unemployment benefits, minimum wages (MW), union <b>power</b> and tax <b>wedge</b> on migration flows. The authors allow for interactions of these institutions with migration entry laws, as both affect equilibrium wages and employment in destination countries, influencing mobility decisions of immigrants. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use data on migration flows for a sample of 15 OECD countries over the period 1980 - 2006. The relationship between flows and labour institutions is analysed using OLS techniques and including destination and origin-by-yearfixed effects. The coefficients of interest are identified through within country variation. The authors test the robustness of the results to different specifications using, among others, dynamic models for panel data. Findings - The authors find strong and negative effects of unemployment, employment protection and migration policy on flows. The negative effect of migration policy on flows is larger in countries with high than in countries with low employment protection. The authors find positive effects forMW, unemployment benefits and union power. The authors show heterogeneous effects depending on the group of countries of origin and destination. Research limitations/implications - While the identification strategy allows us to estimate the effects of interest, the baseline estimates may suffer from endogeneity problems in terms of omitted variable bias and reverse causality. The sensitivity checks provide mixed results and show that baseline estimates are not always robust to different specifications. Further work is needed to better address the problem of endogeneity. Originality/value - The paper adds to the previous literature on the determinants of immigration flows by explicitly considering the labour market environment in destination countries. The results provide insights into potential interaction effects and coordination of reforms in labour markets and immigration policies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Waiting {{lists for}} {{treatment}} {{are common in}} outpatient and community services, Existing methods for managing access and triage to these services can lead to inequities in service delivery, inefficiencies and divert resources from frontline care. Evidence from two controlled studies indicates that {{an alternative to the}} traditional "waitlist and triage" model known as STAT (Specific Timely Appointments for Triage) may be successful in reducing waiting times without adversely affecting other aspects of patient care. This trial aims to test whether the model is cost effective in reducing waiting time across multiple services, and to measure the impact on service provision, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. METHODS/DESIGN: A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial has been designed to evaluate the impact of the STAT model in 8 community health and outpatient services. The primary outcome will be waiting time from referral to first appointment. Secondary outcomes will be nature and quantity of service received (collected from all patients attending the service during the study period and health-related quality of life (AQOL- 8 D), patient satisfaction, health care utilisation and cost data (collected from a subgroup of patients at initial assessment and after 12  weeks). Data will be analysed with a multiple multi-level random-effects regression model that allows for cluster effects. An economic evaluation will be undertaken alongside the clinical trial. DISCUSSION: This paper outlines the study protocol for a fully <b>powered</b> prospective stepped <b>wedge</b> cluster randomised controlled trial (SWCRCT) to establish whether the STAT model of access and triage can reduce waiting times applied across multiple settings, without increasing health service costs or adversely impacting on other aspects of patient care. If successful, it will provide evidence for the effectiveness of a practical model of access that can substantially reduce waiting time for outpatient and community services with subsequent benefits for both efficiency of health systems and patient care. <br /...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} today {{to say that}} it is time for economists to think about whether the proper guide to the twenty-first century might be not Adam Smith but Joseph Schumpeter: that we should stop {{thinking}} of the good firm as a competitive price taker and instead think of the good firm as a dynamic and innovative monopolist—see, for example, DeLong and Summers (2002). Traditional antitrust policy tries to push today’s prices down to today’s marginal cost. Today’s commonplace welcomes monopoly <b>power,</b> and large <b>wedges</b> between price and marginal cost, for it is the expectation of future monopoly profits from protected intellectual property that is the spur to research and development that induces technological progress and economic growth. Robert Barro (2007 a) argues that not just the profits but the revenues of a company like Microsoft serve as a likely rough lower bound to the social value of its innovations and contributions to economic growth. If firm revenues are a rough match to contributions to economic growth, than the profits of technologically-dynamic monopolists are not too large but too small: they are insufficient to provide the efficient spur to research and development, and governments should be thinking not of antitrust policies to reduce the profits of dynamic innovative monopolies but of protrust policies to subsidize them. Let's try to think about the simple analytics here. Let’s try to model these related ideas of intellectual property, antitrust policy, and economic growth. Let us do so by following Barro (2007 b), who follows a line of authors back to at least Romer (1994), in building our model.
