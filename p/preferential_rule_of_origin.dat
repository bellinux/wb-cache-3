40|$|This study surveys <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{applied by}} 192 {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) covering {{trade in goods}} notified to the GATT/WTO up to 1 November 2010. It {{takes into account the}} <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements <b>of</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check <b>of</b> how these <b>rules</b> affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use of RTAs' preferences and, in their absence, of their margins of preference (MOPs). While the raison d' <b>of</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> flexibilities that provide, through the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration <b>of</b> third-parties into <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> regimes. The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use of preferences is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data of preference utilization, the analysis of the effects <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on <b>preferential</b> trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use of preferences in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis. Finally, the paper briefly outlines some suggestions for further action, including the launching in the WTO of exploratory work on <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> within an open regionalism scenario...|$|R

Volume 2 : AnnexesDefence date: 4 June 2013 The {{analysis}} <b>of</b> {{rationales for}} <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{presented in the}} thesis brings forward the assumptions that, contrary {{to what has been}} written in the literature, it still seems legitimate to maintain <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as distinct from non-preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> However, multiplication <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> regimes causes systemic problems and fairness concerns. The thesis aims therefore at analysing diversification and harmonisation patterns and their interaction with the systemic problems identified. The final objective of the thesis is to analyse the possible methods for regulating <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in light <b>of</b> these systemic issues. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand rationales for and systemic problems derived from <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The methodology, adopted to understand patterns of diversification and harmonisation, combines instead comparative analysis and case study approach with the analysis of WCO and WTO law. While it is impossible to find a solution that could solve all the systemic problems (beside the complete abolition <b>of</b> the <b>rules),</b> this thesis argues that the first objective of the WTO should be to achieve a greater level <b>of</b> correspondence between <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and MFN concessions and address fairness concerns. This should allow the enforcement <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in line with article XXIV GATT, while recognising the particular role <b>of</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in guaranteeing that the partner only benefits from the preferential liberalisation. Contrary to the current literature, the thesis hints that this can be addressed effectively without resorting to international substantial harmonisation and without leaving regulation simply to partial regional harmonisation processes, which are respectively either politically difficult to achieve or ineffective means for properly addressing systemic issues related to <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin...</b>|$|R

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} an emerging economy and has various trade {{agreements with the}} United States of America and the United Kingdom according to which South Africa enjoys different <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> In some respects, current customs and excise legislation relating to <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> places South Africa at a disadvantage in the global arena. In some cases, <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> with developed countries benefit South Africa little {{if they are not}} properly structured, or if the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> various trade agreements contradict each other. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain whether South Africa’s <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are sufficiently aligned with those of more developed economies to improve the economy, thereby increasing trade growth and tax revenue. This study compared the South African <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> with <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> that are applied in another developing country, namely Brazil, as well as to those applied in two developed countries, namely the United Kingdom and the United States. To illustrate the application <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> this study focused specifically on <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> applicable to individual quick frozen poultry. This comparative study identified similarities and differences between the countries, and noted possible improvements to South African customs and excise tax legislation for this industry. It was found that the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> applied in South Africa are similar in some respects to those used in the UK. An improvement that South Africa could make is to minimise the number <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> in effect by negotiating better preferential rates of duty across more than one country.

With rapid increase of bilateral and regional trade agreements, the role <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> has become more evident. In the context of bilateral and regional trade agreements, <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> prevent free-riders from enjoying the benefits negotiated between the countries concerned.

The second (indirect) policy option is to pursue multilateral trade negotiations and reduce MFN tariffs towards zero. In this context, NAFTA ROO would lack both relevance and impact, even if they remained on the books, because tariff preference utilization among NAFTA members would virtually disappear. The current stalemate at the WTO Doha round suggests that a North American CU remains a serious policy option.

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) provide countries with many benefits. The {{multilateral trading system}} also receives these benefits, as successive and overlapping RTAs are the building blocks for the most viable and realistic path to global free trade. Nonetheless, the spread of criss-crossing RTAs {{in the world has}} generated serious problems, including rising transaction costs. While pursuing the long-term goal <b>of</b> harmonizing <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (ROOs), countries need to actively implement the diagonal or full accumulation system on a sectoral basis, starting from the sectors in which identical product-specific rules among participating countries have been introduced. The adoption of coequality in the change in tariff classification and regional value content (VC) rules also give trading firms more flexibility. If WTO members are able to set up model ROOs, the degree of each RTA's deviation from this benchmark may be calculated and certain modalities for its reduction could be negotiated multilaterally. In the longer term, other systemic <b>rules</b> on top <b>of</b> ROOs need to be converged or harmonized across RTAs on a regional or global basis. The effort to defragment fragmented RTAs should continue even beyond the time when most favoured nation (MFN) tariff rates go down to zero worldwide. Even if all preferential origin regimes shall have become irrelevant by then, various other rules and procedures will still have to be converged and harmonized across RTAs.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three separate papers. They are all empirical papers that examine how fragmentation of production processes and global value chains have affected international trade patterns. The first paper focuses on how private standards in the increasingly geographically fragmented food sector affect firm-import behaviour. By providing a quality insurance for the imported good, certification to standards may reduce both the fixed and variable costs of importing, which could {{have a positive effect}} on firm imports. This paper analyses how certification to the GlobalGAP private standard affect imports of fresh fruits and vegetables. No robust relationship is found between GlobalGAP certification and import behaviour at the level of the firm. The second paper takes global value chains into account by examining whether better access to intermediate inputs affects exports of final goods. More specifically, it empirically tests if expanding the set of available input suppliers through <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> liberalisation affects export performance. It is found that access to more suppliers has a positive effect on both export intensity and export diversification. The third paper examines the stability of OECD offshoring flows. The study provides both a descriptive analysis and identifies factors that influence offshoring duration. It is found that offshoring flows have a mean duration of 3 years, but median duration is merely 1 year. Several determinants of offshoring duration are identified. For example, the capital intensity of the offshored product and the level of intellectual property rights protection in the exporting country affect how long a certain input is traded...|$|R

Starting off with the traditional realm of the development policies – trade – the paper shifts to explore how the solely economic notion of development has been enhanced through the introduction of the concept of sustainable development, and how this concept was integrated into two policy areas – that of migration and human rights.

40|$|Excerpt] Determining {{the country}} <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> {{a product is}} {{important}} for properly assessing tariffs, enforcing trade remedies (such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties) or quantitative restrictions (tariff quotas), and statistical purposes. Other commercial trade policies are also linked with origin determinations, such as country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> labeling and government procurement regulations. <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (ROO), {{used to determine the}} country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> merchandise entering the U. S. market, can be very simple, noncontroversial tools of international trade as long as all of the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled primarily in one country. However, when a finished product’s component parts originate in many countries, {{as is often the case}} in today’s global trading environment, determining origin can be a very complex, sometimes subjective, and time-consuming process. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency responsible for determining country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> using various ROO schemes. Non-preferential <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are used to determine the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> goods imported from countries with which the United States has most-favored-nation (MFN) status. They are the principal regulatory tools for accurate assessment of tariffs on imports, addressing country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> labeling issues, qualifying goods for government procurement, and enforcing trade remedy actions and trade sanctions. <b>Preferential</b> <b>rules</b> are used to determine the eligibility of imported goods from certain U. S. free trade agreement (FTA) partners and certain developing country beneficiaries to receive duty-free or reduced tariff benefits under bilateral or regional FTAs, trade preference programs (such as the Generalized System of Preferences), and other special import programs. <b>Preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are specific to each FTA, which means that they vary from agreement to agreement and preference to preference. This report deals with ROO in three parts. First, we describe in more detail the reasons that country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> are important and briefly describe U. S. laws and methods that provide direction in making these determinations. Second, we discuss briefly some of the more controversial issues involving <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> including the apparently subjective nature <b>of</b> some CBP <b>origin</b> determinations, and the effects of the global manufacturing process on ROO.

40|$|Preferential {{arrangements}} (bilateral {{and multilateral}} free trade areas and GSP systems (preferences for developing countries)) are emerging {{everywhere in the}} world trading system and are causing concern because they discriminate against non-members and add complexity, distortions and inconsistency to the global system. <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (ROOs) linked to these arrangements are {{a significant part of the}} problem.

Using EU trade with its GSP and ACP partners, the paper estimates how the utilization of preferences would likely change if AFTA were to veer away from its current uniform RoO requiring a 40 % local content rate. Depending on the sample used, a 10 percentage point reduction in the local value content requirement is estimated to increase the utilization rate of preferences by between 2. 5 and 8. 2 percentage points.

40|$|The European Commission has tabled {{a set of}} {{proposals}} to strengthen 'special and differential treatment' for developing countries. The areas covered include: streamlining and simplification of procedures for the accession of least developed countries to the WTO; measures to support developing countries in meeting sanitary and phytosanitary standards; improving technical assistance for developing countries {{in areas such as}} customs and technical barriers to trade and trade in services; ensuring the participation of at least one panellist from a developing country in disputes between a developing and a developed country; simpler notification procedures for least developed countries; clarifying the WTO rules applicable to regional trade agreements when these involve developing countries. In addition the Commission maintains that 'special and differential treatment' is needed across the whole of the negotiating agenda, particularly with regard to ensuring greater access for developing country exports within the framework of increased differentiation between developing countries. The EU also supports the extension of EBA style initiatives to LDCs by other OECD countries and the more advanced developing countries. Through its proposals the Commission is placing emphasis on avoiding the creation of a two-tier system <b>of</b> WTO <b>rules</b> 'in which developing countries would be second-class members' and on promoting measures which promote rather than restrict trade. In its submission the European Commission acknowledges that progress in elaborating SDT measures has not been as rapid as it ought to have been, but points out that some proposals are fairly controversial requiring 'major changes in WTO agreements' which have 'major systemic implications'. The Commission also expresses concern that some of the problems identified as requiring SDT measures are more related to domestic policy shortcomings rather than weaknesses in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the world trading system. Overall the European Commission wants to see SDT provisions allowing flexibility in the implementation <b>of</b> existing <b>rules</b> rather than the creation <b>of</b> new <b>rules.</b> The EU wants to see decisions taken {{in a number of areas}} before the end of 2003, most notably with regard to: the degree of flexibility under Article XXIV; ensuring that SPS measures do not create unnecessary barriers to trade; greater flexibility with respect to <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The BRIDGES Weekly Digest for December 20 th 2002 reported a failure to close the gap in positions on special and differential treatment, despite eight days of negotiations and a marathon session on December 19 th.

Drawing on different approaches, we show that the current system <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (RoO) in place for EU and US preferential trade agreements (including the GSP) which are representative of RoO practiced by OECD countries should be drastically simplified if developed countries really want to help developing countries integrate into the World Trading System. Besides diverting resources for administration, RoO regimes of the EU and US carry significant compliance costs. More fundamentally, it is becoming increasingly clear that RoO have often been designed to force the Southern partner to buy inefficient intermediate products from the Northern partner (the so-called ‘double transformation rule’ in textiles & apparel (T&A) is such an example) to ‘pay for’ preferential access for the final product. Evidence is also indicating that a significant fraction of the remaining rents (after accounting for increasing costs to comply with RoO requirements) associated with market access are largely captured by the Northern partner. Finally, we report evidence that the restrictiveness of RoO is beyond levels that would be justified to prevent trade deflection implying capture by special interest groups. The paper concludes by outlining alternative paths to reforms. market access; AFTA; ASEAN; NAFTA; PANEURO; <b>preferential</b> trade agreements; <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper furnishes robust {{evidence}} that the GATT/WTO has had a powerful and positive impact on trade. The impact has, however, been uneven. GATT/WTO membership for industrial countries {{has been associated with}} a large increase in imports estimated at about 40 percent of world trade. The same has not been true for developing country members, although those that joined after the Uruguay Round have benefited from increased imports. Similarly, there have been asymmetric effects among sectors, with WTO membership associated with substantially greater imports in sectors where barriers are low. These results are consistent with the history and design of the institution, which presided over significant trade liberalization by the industrial countries except in sectors such as food and clothing; largely exempted developing countries from the obligations to liberalize under the principle of special and differential treatment; but attempted to redress the latter by imposing greater obligations on developing country members that joined after the Uruguay Round.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> {{and their impact}} on trade flows. Four objectives are sought: i) to provide further evidence on the impact on trade <b>of</b> product-specific <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin; ii) to develop a restrictiveness index based on empirical findings; iii) to open the path for the impact <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on particular sectors other than textiles; and iv) to contribute with further evidence on regime-wide provisions. Literature on <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is reviewed in Chapter 2. While theoretical literature establishes certain conditions under which <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> can increase welfare, empirical literature is unanimous about the negative effects they have on trade flows. Two main aspects stem from the review of the empirical literature. First, empirical literature on <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> remains still very limited in scope. Second, in order to proxy the stringency <b>of</b> the <b>rules,</b> traditional literature relies on restrictiveness indices based on an ex-ante observation rule. This rule depends on the authors’ appreciation, which can potentially be incorrect. Chapter 3 provides a broad explanation about the different type of product specific and regime-wide <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The framework to assess the impact <b>of</b> specific <b>rules</b> and regime-wide provisions on trade flows is developed in Chapter 4. The analysis is conducted using a gravity model of disaggregated panel data for four reporting countries and 16 FTA partners, controlling for reporter and partner fixed effects. In order to account for different ways <b>of</b> modeling specific <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> four different methods are confronted. Data sources and explanations are also provided in this Chapter. Each of the methods is estimated for total trade flows, exports and imports, as a way to improve the validity of the estimates. The results, along some issues regarding the proper form of the specification are presented in Chapter 5. The results prove significant for every specification and suggest that regional value content type <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> as well as self-certification procedures promote trade within the FTAs. Using the estimates from the previous chapter, an ex-post restrictiveness index is constructed in Chapter 6. This index is subsequently used to assess the stringency <b>of</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> by sector and by agreement stringency levels. One of the main differences of this index with past indices is the relatively high level of leniency it assigns to regional value content <b>rules.</b> The validity <b>of</b> the ex-post index is checked by estimating the impact <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on North-South trade as well as on agricultural, industrial and textile imports, finding support on the results. After analyzing the state <b>of</b> play <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in today’s world, policy recommendations are provided in Chapter 7. There is a practical unanimity on the need to reform the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as they currently stand. The possibility to choose across-the-board between a regional value content rule and current rules, coupled with self-certification procedures appears to address the concerns of researchers, industry and policy makers.

40|$|The design <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in {{free trade}} {{agreements}} (FTAs) arouses spirited lobbying campaigns that mostly escape public attention. This article {{argues that the}} domestic groups generally most favorable to FTAs differ in their preferences over <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin: industries with large returns to scale favor strict <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to gain scale economies in an FTA, while industries with multinational supply chains prefer lenient <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to accommodate offshore procurement. An econometric analysis <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in the North American Free Trade Agreement finds tougher <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> the higher the external trade protection and the larger the returns to scale, and more permissive <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> the greater the involvement in foreign sourcing.
