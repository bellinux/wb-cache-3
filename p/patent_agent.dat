2500|$|Once filed, {{a patent}} {{application}} is [...] "prosecuted". A patent examiner reviews the patent application {{to determine if}} it meets the patentability requirements of that country.

[...] The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent. [...] In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.|$|E
