2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium <b>photoelectric</b> <b>tube</b> detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E
5000|$|From outer space, ultra-high-energy {{cosmic rays}} reach Earth. These consist of single sub-atomic {{particles}} (protons or atomic nuclei), each with energy levels beyond 1018 eV. When such a single particle reaches Earth atmosphere, {{it has its}} energy dissipated by creating billions of other particles: electrons, photons and muons, all near the speed of light. These particles spread longitudinally (perpendicular to the single particle incoming route), creating a forward moving plane of particles, with higher intensities near the axis. Such an incident is called an [...] "air shower". Passing through the atmosphere, this plane of particles creates UV light, invisible to the human eye, called the fluorescing effect, {{more or less in}} the pattern of straight lightning traces. These traces can be photographed at high speed by specialised telescopes, called Fluorescence Detectors, overlooking an area with at a slight elevation. Then, when the particles reach the Earth's surface, they can be detected when they arrive in a water tank, where they cause visible blue light due to the Cherenkov effect. A sensitive <b>photoelectric</b> <b>tube</b> can catch these impacts. Such a station is called a water Cherenkov Detector or 'tank'. The Auger Observatory has both types of detectors covering the same area, which allows for very precise measurements.|$|E

In five years he earned both bachelor of science (S.B.) and master of science (S.M.) degrees.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of mitogenetic radiation was estimated from data given by Gurwitsch. The {{sensitivity of the}} biological method and of the physical methods were compared. With onion-base pulp and onion roots as mitogenetic inductors, the photographic method gave no perceptible blackening for exposures up to 184 hours. A <b>photoelectric</b> counter <b>tube</b> was described with cadmium as photoelectric metal. Its sensitivity was such that a radiation {{intensity of}} 10 to 15 quanta per cm. 2 per second of the Hg line 2536 A was detectable. Spurious effects produced by the counter tube were described and means for their avoidance given. A number of different biological materials, all supposed to be excellent mitogenetic radiators, were investigated {{by means of the}} counter tube. No mitogenetic radiation could be detected...|$|R

In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over 438 mi of telephone line between London and Glasgow. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of the Epsom Derby. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936 though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.|$|E

5000|$|An image {{dissector}} is a camera tube that creates an [...] "electron image" [...] {{of a scene}} from photocathode emissions (electrons) which pass through a scanning aperture to an anode, which serves as an electron detector.

50|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{important}} use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came into use in radio vacuum tubes, where it had two functions; as a getter, it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated cathode, it increased the electrical conductivity. Caesium was not recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s. Applications for nonradioactive caesium included <b>photoelectric</b> cells, photomultiplier <b>tubes,</b> optical components of infrared spectrophotometers, catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for scintillation counters, and in magnetohydrodynamic power generators. Caesium also was, and still is, used {{as a source of}} positive ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwilight {{observations}} {{were carried out}} in the period « 1983 – 1985 » in different seasons at different sites mainly to deduce {{the beginning and the end}} of twilight.

The photoelectric system was calibrated with the international photoelectric color system. The phenomena were followed in steps each 10 ° in both altitude and azimuth. The depression of the sun below the horizon was calculated from the local time of each scan. The results indicated (at a= 5 ° and A= 10 °) for the latitude of Matrouh that the end and the beginning of the twilight occurred when the depression of the sun (Do) was between 18 ° and 20 °, while the dawn times were found to be between 14 ° and 16 °. The brightness of the twilight phenomena was followed, however, to different altitudes and azimuths [0 °⩽a°⩽ 60 ° and 0 °⩽A°⩽ 60 °]...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the {{feasibility}} of quantitatively pre-setting the ink key distribution on an off-set press. Presently the pre-settings of the ink keys has been left to the pressmens 2 ̆ 7 ability and experience. This, in many cases, involves much 2 ̆ 2 trial and error 2 ̆ 2 work along with lengthy makeready times. This study attempted to reduce makeready time by quantitatively pre-setting ink keys from data obtained from an estimating unit and use of a set of calibration curves. A photoelectric estimating unit was designed and constructed to read integrated densities of copy to be printed. There was one reading for each area of copy corresponding to an ink key on the press. The estimating unit consisted of a series of lenses, a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>tube</b> and a meter movement. The estimating unit yielded readings of the image area for which an ink key is responsible for the supply of ink. The press was a standard off-set type with small paper dials mounted on the face of each ink key. A series of calibration tints were printed. From these tints key settings and their estimated density values curves were generated for use in the pre-setting of the ink keys for any type of copy. Through one test it was found that there are many ways to have the ink keys set and still have the job within specifications. The reasons for this are explained within. Sample copy was read using the estimating unit. Through a series of steps predicted ink key settings were found. This copy was then printed using the ink key pre-settings. All press runs were evaluated to determine whether or not the pre-settings were producing printed copy within specifications. One hundred and ten possible ink key pre-settings were attempted. The results of the study show good correlation between pre-setting ink keys and actual settings done entirely empirically. With a quantitative method pre-setting the ink distribution keys, the makeready time required will be shorter...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a versatile low-temperature {{scanning near-field optical microscope}} (LTSNOM) with {{the capability of}} near-field imaging and spectroscopy, operating at liquid nitrogen (LN) temperature. A sample is illuminated either electronically or optically by introducing a laser beam through specially designed coaxial double lenses and an optical fiber. The detected optical signal is transmitted via a fiber tip to a <b>photoelectric</b> multiplier <b>tube</b> (PMT) or a spectrometer. Shcai-force detection by using a tuning-fork technique is applied to maintain the tip-sample distance. A shear-force topographic image, an optical image and a local spectrum can be obtained simultaneously. The whole scanning head is enclosed inside a container which is immersed in liquid nitrogen in a storage Dewar during the measurement. We have used this LT-SNOM to study the electroluminescence (EL) properties of InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diodes (LEDs), at both room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature. Low-temperature experiments with the LT-SNOM show the stability of our construction and stable image acquisition at LN temperature. The results show that at room temperature the EL intensity distribution is quite inhomogeneous with islands like bright spots, and at LN temperature the EL intensity increased dramatically and the inhomogeneity reduced greatly. Furthermore, the near-field spectra, show a peak at a higher photon energy at around 2. 95 eV at low temperature, in addition to the 2. 7 eV peak observed by far field at room temperature. The results indicate that the self-organized In rich regions {{play a key role in}} the EL properties of these LEDs, which act as radiation recombination centers. In conjunction with near-field spectroscopy, the possible mechanism of this phenomenon is explained in terms of irradiative recombination in the MQWs; as well as the quantum-confined Starks effect...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} American iconoscope was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph.
