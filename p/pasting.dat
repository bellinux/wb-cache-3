5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and <b>pasting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Territory size {{is highly}} variable, ranging {{from less than}} 40km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and {{boundary}} patrols. Clans mark their territories by either <b>pasting</b> or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males {{are more likely to}} enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after {{a long period of time}} if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.|$|E
5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by <b>pasting</b> them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the mix {{composition}} on rheological behavior of a mixture is studied by considering a two-phase model for a mixture. A mixture is decomposed into a granular and a <b>paste</b> phase. <b>Paste</b> itself is divided into the void <b>paste</b> and the excess <b>paste.</b> The slump test is used for evaluation of rheological behavior of a mixture. The results show that the granular-cement <b>paste</b> mixtures can be split into three main classes viz Granular-High <b>Paste,</b> Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> and Granular-Low <b>Paste.</b> In Granular-High <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the excess <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is maximal. In Granular-Low <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the void <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is minimal. In Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> class the behavior is determined by both the excess <b>paste</b> and the void <b>paste,</b> and the deformability is in between that of the two other extreme cases.

5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by <b>pasting</b> fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and <b>pasting</b> of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E

40|$|Bostwick consistencies of reconstituted tomato <b>pastes</b> were {{measured}} both immediately after <b>paste</b> production and after storage times {{of up to}} 9 months. Bostwick values measured after storage were more than twice those measured {{on the day of}} <b>paste</b> production. This increase in Bostwick developed over the first month of <b>paste</b> storage at room temperature and could be slowed down but not prevented if the <b>paste</b> was stored at 4 C. Heating the reconstituted <b>paste</b> for 30 min at 90 C or 15 min at 100 C restored the original consistency. Serum viscosities also decreased during <b>paste</b> storage, but the change in serum viscosity was smaller than the changes in Bostwick. As with the Bostwick, heating the reconstituted juice restored the serum viscosity. For a reproducible evaluation of the consistency of stored tomato <b>paste,</b> it is essential that the reconstituted <b>paste</b> be heated to 90 C or above. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Consistency is an important quality consideration in products prepared from reconstituted tomato <b>paste.</b> During storage, changes occur in tomato <b>paste,</b> which affect the consistency after reconstitution. The results presented here show that for stored tomato <b>paste,</b> heating after reconstitution restores consistency to the same level as measured before storage.

The study investigates rheological behaviour and stencil printing performance of the lead-free solder <b>pastes</b> (Sn/Ag/Cu). Oscillatory stress sweep test was carried out to study the visco-elastic behaviour of the lead-free solder <b>pastes.</b> The visco-elastic behaviour of the <b>paste</b> encompasses solid and liquid characteristic of the <b>paste,</b> {{which could be used}} to study the flow behaviour experienced by the <b>pastes</b> during the stencil {{printing process}}.

Harmful solvents for the cleaning of screens and devices after screen-printing of electronic circuits can be substituted by water. In comparison to cleaning agents on organic base the application of water is more cost efficient and leads to more safety in use. Hence a development of water soluble <b>paste</b> systems is necessary. The new systems should have comparable properties to commercial available systems (not water soluble). Therefore different polymers and solvents for water soluble and ecological burn out organic vehicles were tested.

40|$|Solder <b>pastes</b> and {{isotropic}} conductive adhesives (ICAs) {{are widely}} used as a principal bonding medium in the electronic industry. This study investigates the rheological behaviour of the <b>pastes</b> (solder <b>paste</b> and isotropic conductive adhesives) used for flip-chip assembly. Oscillatory stress sweep test {{are performed to evaluate}} solid characteristic and cohesiveness of the lead-free solder <b>pastes</b> and isotropic conductive adhesive <b>paste</b> materials. The results show that the G' (storage modulus) is higher than G '' (loss modulus) for the <b>pastes</b> material indicating a solid like behaviour. It result shows that the linear visco-elastic region for the <b>pastes</b> lies in a very small stress range, below 10 Pa. in addition, the stress at which the value of storage modulus is equal to that of loss modulus can be used as an indicator of the <b>paste</b> cohesiveness. The measured cross-over stress at G'=G '' shows that the solder <b>paste</b> has higher stress at G'=G '' compared to conductive adhesives.
