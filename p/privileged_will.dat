For those who are elderly, ill or engaged in risky occupations, it is often urgent to get such things settled fast. But some people may be in circumstances where they cannot comply with the formal requirements for a valid will. The law has long recognized this concern {{in the case of}} soldiers and sailors by allowing them to create privileged wills. Many jurisdictions, including Singapore, have legislation to this effect. This article seeks to determine if there remains a place for the <b>privileged</b> <b>will</b> today. The rationale behind them will be compared to interpretations placed by courts on modern-day provisions recognizing privileged wills. It will be shown that there is still a role for the <b>privileged</b> <b>will</b> and that it should be redefined, not removed...|$|E

40|$|THE MEANING of {{the term}} {{gerontology}} is a matter ofcontinuing debate. On the one hand, the answer is simple; gerontology is {{the scientific study of}} the aging process and emphasizes a life course perspective. On the other hand, some scholars focus more on the study of older people (or organisms) and their problems, rather than the aging process per se. The difficulty in defining the boundaries and the foci of gerontology is not surprising, given that the field is only beginning to develop a paradigm (Ferraro, 1990). Although defining a paradigm for the field is a far-reaching task, it may be hepful as I assume the editorial reins of the Journal to attempt to define the boundaries and intellectual foci of this publication. Readers and authors alike wonder, what can we expect from the new editor? Are certain topics <b>privileged?</b> <b>Will</b> certain methods or theories be elevated? My general response to these queries is to frame it as an issue of inclusiveness. Does gerontology favor certai...|$|E
40|$|The law of {{succession}} is a branch of civil law that deals with devolution of property rights and duties of a decedent to his heirs. The new Civil Code that came into force in 2014 brought considerable changes {{in the field of}} the law {{of succession}}. Finally, the legal regulation pays proper attention to the {{law of succession}} and testate succession. After more than sixty years, there were restored legal institutions such as Clauses of lesser importance in a testament (condition, determination of time or a mandate), inheritance contract, <b>privileged</b> <b>wills,</b> legacy, vulgar substitution or fideicommissum. Not only because of these institutions can a testator finally organize freely and according to his own will his property situation mortis causa. The purpose of my diploma thesis is to analyze the testate succession according to the Czech Civil code that became effective on the 1 st of January 2014. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is split into five chapters that deal with individual prerequisites of succession. The prerequisites of succession are as follows: the death of a testator, the existence of a decedent's estate, the capacity of an heir to inherit, the legal ground of succession and the acceptance/non-refusal of inheritance. Meeting all prerequisites of succession is crucial to [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the context}} of the theory, privileged people are {{considered}} to be [...] "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants. Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the <b>privileged</b> person <b>will</b> succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.|$|R
50|$|Code that {{performs}} some <b>privileged</b> action <b>will</b> make {{a demand}} for one or more permissions. The demand makes the CLR walk the call stack and for each method the CLR will ensure that the demanded permissions are in the method's assembly's granted permissions. If the permission is not granted then a security exception is thrown. This prevents downloaded code from performing privileged actions. For example, if an assembly is downloaded from an untrusted site the assembly will not have any file IO permissions and so if this assembly attempts to access a file code access security will throw an exception preventing the call.|$|R

Based on the work of Giddens, his critics and feminist theory, I propose a model of agency that is more ambivalent than that usually presented in childhood studies. Given the conventional emphasis of agency on articulation, rationality and strategy, a failure to incorporate a critical, embodied, engendered, material account of agency into childhood studies risks reinscribing a model in which <b>privileged</b> children <b>will</b> be accorded more agency than those who do not display rationality and choice in conventional ways...|$|R

Referring to the systems of values and affects attached to languages, the concept of linguistic representation – or social representations of languages – has been adopted by sociolinguists and educational specialists in so far as it plays a key role in the process of identity construction as well as in the transmission of language. A collective interview organized in one of the most prominent university in Manila has allowed us to bring forward the social representations of Filipino and English among students before measuring their respective importance through the administration of a questionnaire. The study of these representations among socially <b>privileged</b> Filipino <b>will</b> bring us to question the language configuration and more specifically the place of English in the social structure of this former US colony marked by the permanency of extreme social inequalities.

40|$|In this paper, the {{conflicting}} issues of access, equity and autonomy of Nigerian universities {{are discussed in}} relation to the need to attain and maintain a qualitative and sustainable university education in spite of its deregulation. Nigerians and their governments have attached a lot of emphasis to the provision of university education to the citizens. This accounts for both huge annual private and public investments in university education and large number of forty seven universities in the country. The deregulation of university education is an attempt to make universities in the country autonomous and sustainable. Both admission and revenue generation should be regulated, so that the less <b>privileged</b> citizens <b>will</b> not be denied access to university education. Otherwise, university education will become elitist, and the problem of attaining equity will crop up. However, {{there is a need for}} the Nigerian governments and education agencies to take caution over the deregulation of university education.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{successful}} synthesis {{of a novel}} tricyclic scaffold containing a ring fused triazole and piperidine will be discussed and furthermore its utility as a new potential <b>privileged</b> structure <b>will</b> be evaluated. As starting material for the synthesis of the considered scaffolds the commercially available ethyl 4 -oxopiperidine- 1 -carboxylate 108 was used. Piperidone 108 was converted into scaffolds 96, 97 and 98 alternating the ring size (n= 1, 2, 3) of the fused bicyclic ring. This tricyclic triazole scaffold was incorporated into known biologically active molecules (Sitaglitpin, a DPP- 4 inhibitor; Maraviroc, a CCR- 5 receptor antagonist and GDC- 0941, a pi 3 K inhibitor) to test its potential {{to serve as a}} new possible Privileged Scaffold. Through scaffold hopping, analogues with excellent biological activity against the chosen biological targets were achieved. Additionally, the stereoselective synthesis of one of the four possible isomers of the tricyclic triazole 178 was obtained in 4 steps to give the synthetically access towards the synthesis of all feasible enantiomeric and diastereomeric analogues...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} proceeds {{on the premise}} that if minority race and its predominance in particular schools constitutes a disadvantage in the educational system, then members of the <b>privileged</b> group <b>will</b> tend to place their children in schools that avoid the supposed liability of minority concentration, and thereby perpetuate inequality. We draw upon the remarks of James Coleman, who posited that intangible resources are concentrated in the schools of the privileged group, and are lacking in the schools with a high concentration of minorities. In this research, we examine whether the racial composition of schools has an influence on individual achievement, controlling for the race of individuals. Our findings are that the degree of minority concentration has a powerful negative influence on achievement test results, that this influence {{does not appear to be}} explained by socioeconomic factors or other factors, and that both whites and African Americans are negatively affected by degree of minority concentration.

40|$|When a bidder (referred to as {{the privileged}} bidder) is {{residual}} claimant to {{a part of the}} revenue from an auction with two bidders whose valuations are independently and identically distributed, bidding incentives are changed. Specifically, the <b>privileged</b> bidder <b>will</b> bid more aggressively to increase the auction revenue. Indeed, the privileged bidder is more likely to win the auction and the good is sold for a higher price. However, since the auction is now inefficient, welfare is decreased. These results are of interest for regulators of the EU electricity industry. The extant EU regulatory framework allows for profits from new cross-border transmission lines (socalled interconnectors) to be unregulated and for incumbent Vertically Integrated Utilities (VIUs) to have ownership of generating and transmission activities. When electricity generators have to secure transmission rights in an auction, the VIU, because of its combined ownership of generation and transmission activities, is in the position of a privileged bidder. The VIU will secure a higher profit, while competing electricity generators will earn less because {{they are less likely to}} gain transmission rights and, in any case, pay a higher price for it.

5000|$|The first {{hypothesis}} is the [...] "sexy son" [...] hypothesis which asserts that although females experience an initial reproductive loss {{with their first}} generation, the reproductive success of the second generation compensates for the initial loss. The second generation of males {{is thought to be}} <b>privileged</b> because it <b>will</b> inherit the increased mating ability, or attractiveness, from their fathers and thus will have high success in procuring mates upon maturation. Since these [...] "sexy sons" [...] are projected to have heightened reproductive success, the secondary female’s reproductive success in turn improves. Some researchers, however, have refuted this theory, stating that offspring born to secondary females suffered from poor nutrition, which resulted in shorter tarsi and lower weights than the progeny of primary and monogamous females. These phenotypic traits contribute to lesser success in mate acquisition, rejecting the “sexy son” hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Philosophy has {{repeatedly}} denied cinema {{in order to}} grant it artistic status. Adorno, for example, defined an ‘uncinematic’ element in the negation of movement in modern cinema, ‘which constitutes its artistic character’. Similarly, Lyotard defended an ‘acinema’, which rather than selecting and excluding movements through editing, accepts what is ‘fortuitous, dirty, confused, unclear, poorly framed, overexposed’. In his Handbook of Inaesthetics, Badiou embraces a similar idea, by describing cinema as an ‘impure circulation’ that incorporates the other arts. Resonating with Bazin and his defence of ‘impure cinema’, that is, of cinema’s interbreeding with other arts, Badiou seems to agree with him also in identifying the uncinematic as {{the location of the}} Real. This article will investigate the particular impurities of cinema that drive it beyond the specificities of the medium and into the realm of the other arts and the reality of life itself. <b>Privileged</b> examples <b>will</b> be drawn from various moments in film history and geography, starting with the analysis of two films by Jafar Panahi: This Is Not a Film (In film nist, 2011), whose anti-cinema stance in announced in its own title; and The Mirror (Aineh, 1997), another relentless exercise in self-negation. It goes on to examine Kenji Mizoguchi’s deconstruction of cinematic acting in his exploration of the geidomono genre (films about theatre actors) in The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums (Zangigku monogatari, 1939), and culminates in the conjuring of the physical experience of death through the systematic demolition of film genres in The Act of Killing (Joshua Oppenheimer et al., 2012) ...|$|R
