40|$|Objectives <b>Pseudotumours</b> (abnormal peri-prosthetic soft-tissue reactions) {{following}} metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty (MoMHRA) {{have been}} associated with elevated metal ion levels, suggesting that excessive wear may occur due to edge-loading of these MoM implants. This study aimed to quantify in vivo edge-loading in MoMHRA patients with and without <b>pseudotumours</b> during functional activities. Methods The duration and magnitude of edge-loading in vivo was quantified during functional activities by combining the dynamic hip joint segment contact force calculated from the three-dimensional (3 D) motion analysis system with the 3 D reconstruction of orientation of the acetabular component and each patientâ€™s specific hip joint centre, based on CT scans. Results Edge-loading in the hips with <b>pseudotumours</b> occurred with a four-fold increase in duration and magnitude of force compared with the hips without <b>pseudotumours</b> (p = 0. 02). Conclusions The study provides the first in vivo evidence to support that edge-loading is an important mechanism that leads to localised excessive wear (edge-wear), with subsequent elevation of metal ion levels in MoMHRA patients with <b>pseudotumours...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the natural course of unrevised asymptomatic pseudotumours after metal-on-metal (MoM) hip resurfacing during a six- to 12 -month follow-up period. We used repeated metal artefact reduction sequence (MARS) -magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), serum metal ion analysis and clinical examination to study 14 unrevised hips (mean patient age 52. 7 years, 46 to 68, 5 female, 7 male) with a <b>pseudotumour</b> and 23 hips (mean patient age 52. 8 years, 38 to 69, 7 female, 16 male) without a <b>pseudotumour.</b> The mean post-operative time to the first MARS-MRI scan was 4. 3 years (2. 2 to 8. 3), and mean time between the first and second MARS-MRI scan was eight months (6 to 12). At the second MRI scan, the grade of severity of the <b>pseudotumour</b> had not changed in 35 hips. One new <b>pseudotumour</b> (Anderson C 2 score, moderate) was observed, and one <b>pseudotumour</b> was downgraded from C 2 (moderate) to C 1 (mild). In general, the characteristics of the pseudotumours hardly changed. Repeated MARS-MRI scans within one year in patients with asymptomatic pseudotumours after MoM hip resurfacing showed little or no variation. In 23 patients without <b>pseudotumour,</b> one new asymptomatic <b>pseudotumour</b> was detected. This is the first longitudinal study on the natural history of pseudotumours using MARS-MRI scans in hip resurfacing, and mirrors recent results for 28 mm diameter MoM total hip replacement...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of diffuse fibrous pseudotumour/fibromatous periorchitis, in a 43 year old male, that {{completely}} encased the right testis and was adjacent to a hydrocoele cavity. Although fibrous <b>pseudotumours</b> of this region are uncommon, they are reported to be {{the second most common}} benign paratesticular lesion after adenomatoid tumours. These comprise approximately 6 percent of paratesticular lesions, and are accepted as reactive lesions secondary to trauma, hydrocoele, infections or inflammation. Fibrous <b>pseudotumours</b> have a peak incidence in the third decade of life but can occur at any age. Clinically these lesions mimic malignancy resulting in the treatment by radical orchidectomy.

40|$|Radiotherapy {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to steroid therapy for idiopathic inflammatory orbital <b>pseudotumours.</b> Twenty-four orbits were treated with radiotherapy, of which 75 % responded adequately.

An adequate response to radiotherapy can be predicted if lymphocytes with germinal centres are present in biopsy specimens.

40|$|Abstract Background Epidermal <b>pseudotumours</b> from Hippoglossoides dubius and Acanthogobius flavimanus in Japan and gill lesions in Limanda limanda {{from the}} UK {{have been shown}} to be caused by phylogenetically related {{protozoan}} parasites, known collectively as X-cells. However, the phylogenetic position of the X-cell group is not well supported within any of the existing protozoan phyla and they are currently thought to be members of the Alveolata. Ultrastructural features of X-cells in fish <b>pseudotumours</b> are somewhat limited and no typical environmental stages, such as spores or flagellated cells, have been observed. The life cycles for these parasites have not been demonstrated and it remains unknown how transmission to a new host occurs. In the present study, pseudobranchial <b>pseudotumours</b> from Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, in Iceland and epidermal <b>pseudotumours</b> from the northern black flounder, Pseudopleuronectes obscurus, in Japan were used in experimental transmission studies to establish whether direct transmission of the parasite is achievable. In addition, X-cells from Atlantic cod were sequenced to confirm whether they are phylogenetically related to other X-cells and epidermal <b>pseudotumours</b> from the northern black flounder were analysed to establish whether the same parasite is responsible for infecting different flatfish species in Japan. Results Phylogenetic analyses of small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequence data from Atlantic cod X-cells show that they are a related parasite that occupies a basal position to the clade containing other X-cell parasites. The X-cell parasite causing epidermal <b>pseudotumours</b> in P. obscurus is the same parasite that causes <b>pseudotumours</b> in H. dubius. Direct, fish to fish, transmission of the X-cell parasites used in this study, via oral feeding or injection, was not achieved. Non-amoeboid X-cells are contained within discrete sac-like structures that are loosely attached to epidermal <b>pseudotumours</b> in flatfish; these X-cells are able to tolerate exposure to seawater. A sensitive nested PCR assay was developed for the sub clinical detection of both parasites and to assist in future life cycle studies. PCR revealed that the parasite in P. obscurus was detectable in non-pseudotumourous areas of fish that had <b>pseudotumours</b> present in other areas of the body. Conclusions The inability to successfully transmit both parasites in this study suggests that either host detachment combined with a period of independent development or an alternate host is required to complete the life cycle for X-cell parasites. Phylogenetic analyses of SSU rDNA confirm a monophyletic grouping for all sequenced X-cell parasites, but do not robustly support their placement within any established protist phylum. Analysis of SSU rDNA from X-cells in Japanese flatfish reveals that the same parasite can infect more than one species of fish. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background The role of radiographs in the {{follow-up}} of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing (MoMHR) patients is unclear. We investigated whether {{a combination of}} patient and radiological factors predicted MoMHRs with evidence of a <b>pseudotumour.</b> Methods We performed a retrospective single-centre case-control study (384 MoMHRs). The <b>pseudotumour</b> group (n= 130) all had symptomatic pseudotumours on cross-sectional imaging with the diagnosis confirmed at revision. The non-pseudotumour group (n= 254; subgroup previously reported on) had normal cross-sectional imaging. Radiographs immediately prior to revision were assessed in the <b>pseudotumour</b> group and compared with radiographs performed {{at the time of}} normal cross-sectional imaging in the non-pseudotumour group. Two blinded independent observers analysed radiographs for signs of failure (excellent interobserver agreement). Logistic regression modeling identified patient and radiological predictors of <b>pseudotumour</b> revision. Results <b>Pseudotumour</b> hips more commonly had abnormal radiographs (80. 0 % vs. 63. 4 %; p= 0. 001). Patient and radiological factors predicting <b>pseudotumour</b> revision in the multivariable model were: female gender (odds ratio (OR) 3. 14 (95 % CI 1. 85 - 5. 35); p Conclusions A combination of patient and radiological factors provided useful information for distinguishing between MoMHRs with and without evidence of pseudotumours. Surgeons may wish to consider these specific patient and radiological factors before proceeding with cross-sectional imaging. Radiographs are important when assessing MoMHR patients and should be included in all follow-up protocols. </p...|$|E
