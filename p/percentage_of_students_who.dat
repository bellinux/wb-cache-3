2500|$|One adviser {{suggested}} {{that students who}} are wait-listed [...] "work the wait list" [...] by staying {{in touch with the}} admissions office to make sure they know the student will attend if accepted, and possibly take steps such as forwarding new grades and making a subsequent college visit, or send a one-page letter or 60-second video describing a strong desire to attend and the reasons. A former dean of admissions at Franklin and Marshall College suggests that students not view the wait list letter as a [...] "polite denial" [...] but rather as a possible opportunity. A second report in 2011 confirmed this, and it {{suggested that}} private colleges without [...] "billion-dollar endowments or 40,000 applicants" [...] were finding that the period from May to the start of classes in fall was a time of uncertainty, with many institutions seeking new applicants, and unsure how many of the applicants that had promised to attend would, in fact, show up in the fall. What can happen is that institutions {{at the top of the}} [...] "food chain" [...] accept students from their wait lists, and these students in turn sacrifice their deposit to schools lower down the chain, generating vacancies and uncertainty. A downside to wait lists is that by the time a student is accepted, there may be much less money available for scholarships or grants. There was a report in The Wall Street Journal of a few colleges, such as Franklin & Marshall, that deliberately waitlisted overqualified students on the assumption that, even if accepted, they would almost certainly not enroll. The alleged purpose was to boost the admissions yield rate––the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> accept a college's admissions offer––as a means to improve the college's overall performance on the influential US News college rankings.|$|E
2500|$|Students {{are usually}} {{notified}} of a college's decision in April, {{sometimes in the}} last two weeks of March, unless they had applied using an early approach, and are usually notified by email, although some colleges still send [...] "fat" [...] envelopes (usually an acceptance) or [...] "thin" [...] envelopes (usually a rejection). A trend appears to be declining percentages of acceptances to leading schools. There are indications that the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> say [...] "yes" [...] to an offer of admission (the yield) has been declining, from 49 percent in 2001 to 43 percent in 2009. Admitted students may also be awarded financial aid. There are two kinds of financial aid: need-based aid, awarded entirely on the financial specifics of the student's family, and merit-based aid, given to students judged to show exceptional academic promise. Several reports confirm that accepted students who are dissatisfied with an aid offer should contact the college to see if the offer can be improved. International students who have been accepted should complete an I-20 form. A disappointing aid package may be appealed with a polite call to the school's financial aid office, while being thankful for any funds that have already been offered. In some cases, it is possible to bargain with a school for a more generous aid package, particularly if there is a more generous offer from a second school that the first school sees as a competitor. One report suggested that even by May 2012, 375 colleges still had space for first-year or transfer applicants for the fall of 2012. Twelfth graders accepted to college are expected to maintain good grades during the spring; for example, one hundred high school applicants accepted to Texas Christian University, whose grades plummeted in the spring of their twelfth grade as a symptom of senioritis, received so-called [...] "fear of God" [...] letters from an admissions dean asking them to explain themselves, and threatening to rescind offers of admission.|$|E
