40|$|Large mobile {{irrigation}} {{machines are}} becoming a common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large mobile irrigation machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are becoming a}} common {{part of the package}} when large mobile irrigation machines are commissioned. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large mobile irrigation machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> performance. The development of a solid robust methodology was the primary objective of this dissertation. Eight stages of testing occurred each with incremental changes to develop the methodology for testing. The way the testing was undertaking proved to influence the results of the test. A statistical analysis in terms of an ANOVA and sample size calculations was undertaken on a limited set of data. It was found the for the 16 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> tested the means were not equal. 88 <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> were found to be tested to understand manufacturing variation based on the normal model. The methodology by which the test was carried out was found to influence the outcome of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Each result needs to be interpreted with reference to the methodology. Much more testing is needed to fully understand the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> performance and how they function on large mobile irrigation machines. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> is {{a common}} device used to {{regulate}} the working pressure for plants and machines. In aerospace propulsion systems, {{it is used to}} pressurize liquid propellant rocket tanks at specified pressure for obtaining the required propellant mass flow rate. In this paper, a generalized model is developed to perform dynamic analysis of a <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> so that constant pressure at outlet can be attained. A nonlinear mathematical model of <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> is developed that consists of dynamic equation of pressure, temperature, equation of mass flow rate, and moving shaft inside regulator. The system of nonlinear and coupled differential equations is numerically simulated and computation of pressure and temperature is carried out for required conditions and given design parameters.

In the end, an analytical solution based on constant mass flow rate assumption is compared with nonlinear formulation. The results demonstrate a high degree of confidence in the nonlinear modeling framework proposed in this paper. The proposed model solves a real problem of liquid rocket propulsion system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design, fabricate and test a single step pressure regulation system for the natural gas motorcycle. The <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> prototype design was based upon the fundamental principles of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The aid of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD), pressure vessel code and threaded fastener standards were implied to design the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> prototype. The commercially available CFD code FLUENTTM was used to analyse and optimize the flow within the regulator. The structural design was based on the American Society of Mechanical Engineer (ASME) pressure vessel code. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) served as reference for threaded fasteners selection. The material selection achieved for the prototype design consists of stainless steel 304, TeflonTM and 3 ply elastomer as the selected material of choice. The final CFD evaluation provided an optimum opening of 3 mm between the obturator and valve seat. The <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> base has a wall thickness of 7. 5 mm while the bonnet cap has 11. 5 mm thickness. The loading element spring selected was a helical grounded type with 10 active coils and a wire diameter of 3 mm. The prototype designed was fabricated using Computer Numerical Configuration (CNC) machining as it is the best economically viable solution. The prototype performance was evaluated using the specially designed <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> test bench equipped with data acquisition and high pressure gas supply system.
