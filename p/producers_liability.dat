40|$|The article {{offers an}} analysis, {{on the one}} hand, of {{legislative}} decree 21 - 5 - 2004 no. 171, containing the law giving effect to directive 3 - 12 - 2001 no. 95 relating to general product safety and now incorporated in the consumer code, following legislative decree 6 - 9 - 2005 no. 206, and, on the other hand, attemps to give a full account {{of the system of}} consumer protection in regard to defective products by means of a comparison between the preventive protection offered by the penal provisions of 171 / 2004 and the compensatory regime contained in d. p. r. 24 - 5 - 1988 no. 224 on <b>producer's</b> <b>liability.</b> These two legal measures are complementary inasmuch as the law on general product safety does not turn on establishing damage, but rather imposes prior duties on the producer in terms of guaranteeing the safety of products brought onto the market and of measures (withdrawall, recall, etc.) to be undertaken once the product is on the market in order to counteract those risks not previously eliminated; penal and administrative sanctions are provided. The <b>producer</b> <b>liability</b> rules, by contrast, presuppose establishing damage and aim to make restitution by way of compensation, according to objective criteria. Judgments place particular importance on an appraisal of the risks to product safety arising from uses to which the goods can reasonables expect to be put, taking account of the kinds of consumers involved, especially minor and old people. The two regimes overlap, however, in terms of measures to eliminate those product risks that were unknown to producer when the product was put into circulation and of the obligation that arise once the consumer has adverted the producer, violation of which can lead to additional liability in the form of sanctions for illegal omission, not contemplated in d. p. r. 224 / 1988, where the wrongfull conduct has occasioned damage to the consumer...|$|R
40|$|The {{report of}} the National Commission on Product Safety stated that the American public is being exposed to many {{unreasonably}} hazardous products. Further, the post-accident remedies to compensate victims of product-related accidents are inadequate and encourage the continued production of unsafe products. It is believed that a shift in assignment of liability for accident costs from consumers to sellers would discourage sales of the more hazardous product grades thereby reducing the frequency and severity of home accidents. This conclusion cannot be derived from economic theory. Indeed, under fairly plausible conditions, a shift to <b>producer</b> <b>liability</b> {{can lead to the}} increased production of riskier product grades. The theory developed in this paper argues that the demand for a risky product is determined by the full price consisting of the price of the parent risky good plus the imputed expected damage costs. The consumer maximizes utility by demanding that product grade which minimizes his full price. In the concluding section of the paper, attention is directed to the welfare implications of the policy alternatives for the product safety problem. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{firms have}} private {{information}} {{on the quality of}} their own products, the warranty offered by a firm can convey information about product quality. Warranties also provide consumers with insurance should the product fail. Consumers face a trade-off: the desired insurance may not provide firms with incentives to reveal actual quality. In this thesis I derive price and refund schedules under which firms have no incentive to misrepresent quality, and characterize the price-refund-quality choice which maximizes expected utility when consumers have no source from which to infer quality other than prices and refunds.;The consumers 2 ̆ 7 problem is described in a model where firms have private {{information on the}} exogenously determined probability that a unit will fail. I then show that when firms can choose quality, and entry is free, competition will generate prices and refunds from which consumers can correctly infer quality. With identical firms and identical consumers, in equilibrium only one quality will be produced; product diversity emerges from consumer heterogeneity. If firms share a common technology, there exists a revealing price-refund pair for each possible quality; if technologies differ, and cost functions are also private, prices and refunds alone may not be sufficient to enable consumers to correctly infer quality, for particular levels of quality.;Both prices and refunds are increasing in quality, and refunds increase more rapidly. If utility is separable in income and the outcome of a purchase, higher income consumers pay higher prices, and receive better warranties, for more reliable goods. When consumers are risk averse in income, expected utility is lower than it would be were quality costlessly observable. If income and the good are perfect substitutes, the market outcome is independent of the distribution of information. This analysis provides a benchmark for assessing market outcomes. The cost to consumers of eliciting information in this fashion should be compared to that from other sources, both market instruments like advertising, which might be less costly, and mandated <b>producer</b> <b>liability</b> schemes...|$|R

40|$|A {{principle}} of extended producer’s {{responsibility in the}} law of waste management pursues the following aims of the waste management: 1) the maximum decrease {{in the amount of}} waste in any type of business and human existence, 2) the immediate reuse of production waste in a manufacturing process, 3) recovery of raw materials from collected waste, 4) application of processes to dispose of waste, 5) orderly waste storage ensuring the least damage to the environment. The overriding objective of this principle is application of legal instruments encouraging producers to undertake activities which will: prevent production of waste, decrease the level of using materials and energy at every stage of a product life cycle and encourage to introduce changes in the phase of a product design and during its manufacture. Broadly speaking, a {{principle of}} extended producer’s responsibility is connected with a <b>producer’s</b> financial <b>liability</b> for a product.

40|$|American courts, {{particularly}} during the last decade, have become increasingly {{aware of the need}} for protecting the consumer against dangers inherent in the use of defective goods. In few other fields of law has Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s advice to treat rules of law as 2 ̆ 2 tentative working rules 2 ̆ 2 been more heeded. Continuously and relentlessly our law has expanded contract and tort liability so as to satisfy public needs. Classical contract theory has undergone profound modifications in response to drastic changes {{in the structure of the}} distribution process. Our sales law and particularly the law of warranties likewise has changed. Where contract liability has been regarded as inadequate, it has been supplemented by tort law. There is an ever increasing tendency to permit the consumer injured by defective goods or services to reach the producer directly, if not with the help of contract law, then with the help of a revised law of torts. Not only has the decline of the rules of privity permitted the consumer to reach the <b>producer,</b> but product <b>liability,</b> in contrast to the tenets of classical tort law, is straining away from negligence. In a fascinating blending of tort and contract law, product liability increasingly is becoming strict liability. A theory of enterprise liability has emerged, frequently based on vague and unanalyzed notions of public policy and economics...|$|R
40|$|Contracts of {{adhesion}} {{are commonly}} criticized because of perceptions that such contracts lack {{the same quality}} of mutual assent that is present in fully-dickered agreements. This Article challenges such assent-based critiques {{in the context of}} Internet-based contracting. This challenge is based upon the proposition that even if producers provided extraordinary opportunities for consumer assent to contract terms, such assent would not meaningfully change the terms of producer contracts. Unlike mail or phone order transactional systems, internet-based contracting provides for the possibilities of rapid and low-cost changes to price menus for various contract options and the ability to price accurately contract terms that the parties may wish to include in their agreements. Thus, Internet-based contracting permits producers to offer consumers a la carte contract choices and to determine how to price those choices. Given sufficient information, producers could theoretically offer consumers meaningful choices over every term in a contract, provided that the consumer {{would be willing to pay}} for those choices. The resulting “selection assent” by the consumers would be for all intents and purposes largely indistinguishable from the type of assent rendered in a fully-dickered contract. But producers still control the prices at which they offer goods and services. Even though the hypothetical contract that would result from finely-grained selection assent could be highly-customized, so long as the producer retains power to set the prices of various contract terms consumers may be driven to the contract terms preferred by the producer. Thus, producers could charge prices that no rational consumer would pay if a particular consumer wanted to contract away from terms such as mandatory arbitration or a class action waiver. Even if some nonrational consumers chose to purchase customized terms, the lost network benefits would limit the <b>producer’s</b> exposure to <b>liability</b> from a few oddballs who bargained for the ability to litigate or to maintain a class action. Additionally, actual experience with clickwrap contracts shows that consumers almost never read the contracts and might be willing to accept without serious inspection an option simply to take the lowest cost terms offered by the producer even if they were given the power to select different terms for increased prices. Consequently, investments in improving the quality of consumer assent—even in the potentially superior context of selection assent to all possible terms of the contract—may not improve the quality of the resulting contract. These conclusions suggest that assent-based critiques of adhesion contracts lack persuasive force in the Internet-based contracting context, and that more powerful critiques should focus on the pricing of adhesion contracts and adhesive contract terms...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.
