5|$|The {{swell of}} the muzzle {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} of the <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> {{the very end of the}} chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a muzzle band.|$|E
5|$|Following the game's release, Kanon {{made several}} {{transitions}} into other media. Two manga series were serialized in Dengeki Daioh and Dragon Age Pure. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license {{was given to}} Funimation after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between Kanon and the musical term canon by using Pachelbel's Kanon D-dur, or Canon in D major, as a background <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> certain instances throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|After tearfully reuniting {{with his}} son and new daughter-in-law, Walter discovers the device uses a unique {{radioactive}} signature that they can track. The strongest source points to a used campground, where Peter discovers a key. He recognizes the key as from Walter's old home near Reiden Lake and travels there alone, and finds his biological father, Walternate, present. Walternate admits to being behind the End of Dayers group, as his revenge for Peter activating the doomsday device and destroying the parallel world that was his home. Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to the prime universe on a mission of mercy, one <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> a time. Peter realizes that Walternate is implying a threat to Olivia, and finds that Walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation. In Central Park, where Moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole, Olivia is helping to cordon off the breach when Walternate approaches and shoots her. Peter {{and the rest of}} Fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> the age of nineteen.|$|E
5|$|State Route 237 was {{assigned}} in 1928, during the mass numbering of state highways within Pennsylvania. The termini {{at the time}} were with State Route 37 and State Route 137, the former of which was the parent route. At the time, the entire highway was an unimproved gravel road. This lasted for four years, until 1932, when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the highway. The highway remained relatively unchanged until 1946, when the highway was decommissioned in a mass deletion of state highways within the commonwealth. The current alignment of former State Route 237 is now Pike County Quadrant Route 1012 from PA 590 to the Shohola Township border. The rest is locally maintained, with a <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> PA 434 designated Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454. The two state routes at the termini, State Routes 37 and 137, are now State Routes 434 and 590.|$|E

This piece is useful later to push pieces of fuel wood where needed. Once all of the kindling is burning, the fuel wood should be placed on top of it (unless, as in the rakovalkea fire-build, it is already there). For best results, two or more pieces of fuel wood should be leaned against each other, as in the tipi fire-build.|$|E

25|$|The {{object of}} the game is to remove all enemy pieces from the board. An enemy piece is removed when another piece ends at the same {{position}}. When the dice are added, only an enemy <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> the final position can be removed. Enemy pieces can be jumped, but are not removed thereby. Friendly pieces cannot be jumped at all. (Whether pieces jumped or at the final position are dalled or not is irrelevant here.) The game ends when one player has no pieces left.|$|E
25|$|At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it {{has also}} been {{observed}} that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock {{at the bottom of the}} pool and bringing it up one small <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> a time.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} saw the Lombard duke Faroald II of Spoleto, capture Classis, {{the port of}} Ravenna.

Perceiving that the Lombard threat would continue to fester and they would take imperial territory in Italy a <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> a time, in around 721 Gregory appealed to the Franks, asking Charles Martel to intervene and drive out the Lombards. Charles however, did not respond to the request. Imperial weakness in Italy encouraged further Lombard incursions, and in 725, they captured the fortress of Narni.|$|E

25|$|MacAdam is {{best known}} for her work with {{large-scale}} textile structures. She was inspired to create textile playground spaces for children after seeing children climbing in a three-dimensional textile sculpture that she was exhibiting. After this discovery, she began to observe the lack of parks and playground in Tokyo, where she was living at the time, and the negative effect that was having on children. In 1971, she created her first work intended for children, which was later donated to a Tokyo kindergarten designed by Hatsue Yamada. She exhibited her next <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto.|$|E
25|$|Cable needles are a {{specific}} design, {{and are used}} to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths. When in use, the cable needle is used {{at the same time}} as two regular needles. It functions by holding together the stitches creating the cable as the other needles create the rest of the stitches for the knitted <b>piece.</b> <b>At</b> specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.|$|E
25|$|A player's {{promotion}} zone is {{the enemy}} camp, consisting of the six farthest ranks that comprise the opponent's territory at setup (the original line of the opponent's chariots and beyond). If a piece moves within this promotion zone, including moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone, then that player may promote the <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} turn. (The general, sumo wrestler, and elephant do not promote, nor do pieces which have already promoted.) Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves. See the table above for what each piece promotes to. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over, revealing the name of its promoted rank.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2003, Ozawa was working for other AV companies as well as Try-Heart, including Max-A, Alice Japan, and VIP. In addition to her hardcore work in 2003, Ozawa also starred {{in the role of}} a school teacher in the softcore V-Cinema production , which was directed by Katsumi Nojiri and released by GP Museum. A DVD version came out in 2005. Also, in 2003, Ozawa teamed up with five other AV actresses, Saori Kamiya, Hitomi Hayasaka, Cocolo, Rei Itoh, and Natsuki, to film a 60-minute DVD showcasing their singing talent. The DVD, P.I.N. (Perfect Idol's Numbers), was released by Vega Factory in March 2003. Ozawa contributed to two numbers, a duet with Rei Itoh and the final ensemble <b>piece.</b> <b>At</b> the 2003 X City Grand Prix Awards held in December 2003, Ozawa was one of the actresses nominated for Best Actress.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Rachmaninoff {{approached}} by {{the makers of}} the British film Dangerous Moonlight to write a short concerto-like piece {{for use in the}} film, but he declined. The job went to Richard Addinsell and the orchestrator Roy Douglas, {{who came up with the}} Warsaw Concerto. In May 1940, Rachmaninoff underwent minor surgery which was followed by a summer's break at Orchard's Point, an estate near Huntington, New York on Long Island, which was met with a period of anxiety and stress over the concern of his daughter Tatiana following the German takeover in the Battle of France. Rachmaninoff's last completed work, Symphonic Dances, was the only piece he composed in its entirety while living in the U.S. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra premiered the <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> the Academy of Music on 7 January 1941.|$|E
25|$|The first {{skirmish}} {{establishing the}} Texas Revolution began in early October 1835, at the Battle of Gonzales. The Texians would be {{challenged by the}} Mexican army, {{when they tried to}} retake possession of an artillery <b>piece</b> <b>at</b> Gonzales, Texas. It was a small cannon, formerly given them by Mexico, which had been used for security against the Native Indians. Texians considered this action as an infringement of their right to bear arms and were determined to keep it. On October 2, they would show that determination. During this time, a meeting would be held at Salvador Flores Ranch that would organize a volunteer force of Texas ranchers that would favor the impending revolution. Soldiers continued gathering, immigrants, colonists, native Texans. The Texian Army would become a mixture of all peoples, interested in freedom from the oppressive policies of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna.|$|E
