40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} {{determining}} consensus of hierarchical incomplete ordered <b>partitions</b> <b>and</b> coverings of sets {{is presented in}} this chapter. Incomplete ordered <b>partitions</b> <b>and</b> coverings are often used in expert information analysis. These structures should be useful when an expert has to classify elements of a set into given classes, but referring to several elements {{he does not know}} to which classes they should belong. The hierarchical ordered partition is a more general structure than incomplete ordered partition. In this chapter we present definitions of the notion of hierarchical incomplete ordered <b>partitions</b> <b>and</b> coverings of sets. The distance functions between hierarchical incomplete ordered <b>partitions</b> <b>and</b> coverings are defined. We present also algorithms of consensus determining for a finite set of hierarchical incomplete ordered <b>partitions</b> <b>and</b> coverings...|$|R

5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw {{the emergence of}} a strong peasant faction.

Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian <b>Partition</b> <b>and</b> the Russian <b>Partition,</b> <b>and</b> saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E

5|$|Independence and {{partition}} inspired {{literary and}} other artistic creations. Such creations mostly describe the human cost of partition, limiting the holiday {{to a small}} part of their narrative. Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children (1980), which won the Booker Prize and the Booker of Bookers, wove its narrative around children born at midnight of 14–15 August 1947 with magical abilities. Freedom at Midnight (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that chronicled the events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947. Few films centre on the moment of independence, instead highlighting the circumstances of <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> its aftermath. On the Internet, Google has commemorated Independence Day since 2003 with a special doodle on its Indian homepage.|$|E
40|$|Minimizing the wirelength {{plays an}} {{important}} role in physical design automation of very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. The objective of wirelength minimization can be achieved by finding an optimal solution for VLSI physical design components like <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> floorplanning. In VLSI circuit partitioning, the problem of obtaining a minimum delay has prime importance. In VLSI circuit floorplanning, the problem of minimizing silicon area is also a hot issue. Reducing the minimum delay in <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> area in floorplanning helps to minimize the wirelength. The enhancements in <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> floorplanning have influence on other criteria like power, cost, clock speed, and so forth. Memetic Algorithm (MA) is an Evolutionary Algorithm that includes one or more local search phases within its evolutionary cycle to obtain the minimum wirelength by reducing delay in <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> by reducing area in floorplanning. MA applies some sort of local search for optimization of VLSI <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> floorplanning. The algorithm combines a hierarchical design technique like genetic algorithm and constructive technique like Simulated Annealing for local search to solve VLSI <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> floorplanning problem. MA can quickly produce optimal solutions for the popular benchmark...|$|R
40|$|Chain-based {{scheduling}} [1] is an e cient <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling {{scheme for}} nested loops on distributed-memory multicomputers. The {{idea is to}} take advantage of the regular data dependence structure of a nested loop to overlap and pipeline the communication <b>and</b> computation. Most <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling algorithms proposed for nested loops on multicomputers [1, 2, 3] are graph algorithms on the iteration space of the nested loop. The graph algorithms for <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling are too expensive (at least O(N), where N is the total number of iterations) to be implemented in parallelizing compilers. Graph algorithms also need large data structures to store the result of the <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling. In this paper, we propose compiler loop transformations and the code generation to generate chain-based parallel codes for nested loops on multicomputers. The cost of the loop transformations is O(nd), where n is the number of nesting loops and d is the number of data dependences. Both n and d are very small in real programs. The loop transformations and code generation for chain-based <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling enable parallelizing compilers to generate parallel codes which contain all <b>partitioning</b> <b>and</b> scheduling information that the parallel processors need at run time...|$|R

The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the <b>partition,</b> <b>and</b> {{that half of the}} country should not have been yielded to the communists.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{independent}} {{existence of the}} Commonwealth ended with the partitions of Poland in 1795, {{the institution of the}} sejmik continued, albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion. In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition. In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag). Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> Austrian partition, but they did not bear the name of sejmiks.|$|E
5|$|Kościuszko {{was born}} in February 1746, in a manor house on the Mereczowszczyzna estate in Nowogródek Voivodeship, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, {{a part of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His exact birthdate is unknown. At age 20, he {{graduated}} from the Corps of Cadets in Warsaw, Poland, but after the outbreak of a civil war involving the Bar Confederation in 1768, Kościuszko moved to France in 1769 to pursue further studies. He returned to Poland in 1774, two years after its First <b>Partition,</b> <b>and</b> took a position as tutor in Józef Sylwester Sosnowski's household. After Kościuszko attempted to elope with his employer's daughter and was severely beaten by the father's retainers, he returned to France. In 1776, Kościuszko moved to North America, where he took part in the American Revolutionary War as a colonel in the Continental Army. An accomplished military architect, he designed and oversaw the construction of state-of-the-art fortifications, including those at West Point, New York. In 1783, in recognition of his services, the Continental Congress promoted him to brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|At its heyday, the Commonwealth {{comprised}} the territories of present-day Poland, and {{large parts of}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia. It was engaged in the struggles along most of its borders, with only the Western border with the lands of the Holy Roman Empire being relatively peaceful. In its first decades, major conflicts included the Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, the interventions in Moldavia, the Danzig rebellion, and the War against Sigismund. Early 17th century saw {{a number of the}} Polish–Swedish wars, the Polish–Ottoman Wars, and the Polish–Russian Wars (Dymitriads, the Smolensk War). The Commonwealth also suffered from a number of Cossacks uprisings, culminating in the devastating Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648. That period also saw some of the Commonwealth's most talented military commanders: Stanisław Żółkiewski (1547-1620), Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1560-1621), Stanisław Koniecpolski (1593-1646) and Stefan Czarniecki (1599-1665). The Commonwealth managed to hold its weight in most of those conflicts, and scored a number of major victories on all fronts, such as the battle of Kircholm, the battle of Klushino, and had briefly garrisoned Moscow. However, the Chmielnicki Uprising, together with the Russo-Polish War and the Swedish Deluge, all taking place around the same period of the 1650s, proved devastating for the country, resulting in a loss of most of Ukraine to Russia in the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. In 1683 the Commonwealth scored its last major victory that resounded on the European scene, the relief of Vienna by king John III Sobieski. During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly during the Great Northern War. By the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies (the War of the Bar Confederation) led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers. The final attempts to preserve independence of the Commonwealth, including the political reforms of the Great Sejm, eventually failed on the military front, with the Commonwealth defeats in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, ultimately ending in Poland's final <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E
