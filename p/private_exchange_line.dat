These are normally operated clandestinely in third-world calling destinations as the [...] "black" [...] {{end of a}} [...] "grey route" [...] where conventional <b>private</b> branch <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> (such as T-carrier primary rate interface) are not available to VoIP operators due to a hostile local regulatory environment.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{bandwidth}} efficiency and low costs that VoIP technology can provide, businesses are migrating from traditional copper-wire telephone systems to VoIP systems {{to reduce their}} monthly phone costs.

50|$|While both <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> and {{benefits}} administration platforms leverage technology to simplify benefits {{and reduce the}} administrative burden on HR, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> take a consumer-driven approach to benefits.

5000|$|Carriers: Most {{national}} carriers {{developed an}} exchange-like “Medicare connector” offering {{during the years}} between 2005 and 2010 {{to compete with the}} emerging success of <b>private</b> Medicare <b>exchanges</b> that had entered the market. These connectors provided choice {{in the form of a}} number of plans from a single carrier, as opposed to the larger number of plans from several carriers available on the <b>private</b> <b>exchanges.</b> In the group market, numerous regional carriers have partnered with technology platforms to build <b>private</b> <b>exchanges,</b> and several of the large national carriers have also invested in their own technology. In 2014, Cigna launched a <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> for small employers. In 2011, United purchased Connextions, a technology services company in the healthcare industry. In 2011, WellPoint and two regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans purchased a majority stake in Bloom Health, a startup <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> platform. And in 2014, Aetna bought bswift, an exchange technology company.|$|R
50|$|A <b>private</b> <b>exchange,</b> {{also known}} as a <b>private</b> {{benefits}} <b>exchange</b> or <b>private</b> health care <b>exchange,</b> is an online store or health insurance marketplace where employees or retirees purchase health insurance and other benefits, typically using funds contributed by their employer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{and public}} exchanges, {{also known as}} public health {{insurance}} exchanges, both enable the purchase of benefits through an online marketplace. However, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> are offered by employers for use by active and/or retired employees and include health insurance {{and other types of}} benefits. Public exchanges, on the other hand, were established under the Affordable Care Act to give individuals the opportunity to purchase health insurance, often with a government subsidy if eligible. <b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> are operated by private entities such as brokers, carriers and technology companies, while public exchanges are operated by individual states or the federal government or via a federal/state partnership. Finally, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> typically offer varying degrees of decision support, or ways to guide employees through the benefits selection process, through education and system recommendations. <b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> may be accessed by employees throughout the year to review their benefits or make qualifying changes to their coverage, whereas public exchanges currently lack decision support and can only be accessed for Open Enrollment except {{in the case of a}} qualifying event.|$|R
5000|$|In {{overlapping}} markets, the co-existence {{of public}} and <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> plans can lead to confusion when speaking of an [...] "exchange plan." [...] In California, Anthem Blue Cross offers HMO plans through both the state-run Covered California <b>exchange</b> and the <b>private</b> CaliforniaChoice <b>exchange,</b> but doctor networks are not identical. Physicians advertising acceptance of Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs may misinform individuals enrolled in Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs through the <b>private</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|R
50|$|A defined {{contribution}} {{strategy is}} common on <b>private</b> <b>exchanges,</b> allowing employers {{to control costs}} by setting a defined budget and then letting their employees shop for benefits. In addition, <b>private</b> <b>exchanges</b> provide meaningful choice through multiple benefit type and plan offerings along with decision support to guide employees through the shopping experience.|$|R

50|$|A <b>private</b> health {{insurance}} <b>exchange</b> is an exchange {{run by a}} private sector company or nonprofit. Health plans and insurance carriers in a <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> must meet certain criteria defined by the <b>exchange</b> management. <b>Private</b> <b>exchanges</b> combine technology and human advocacy, and include online eligibility verification and mechanisms for allowing employers who connect their employees or retirees with exchanges to offer subsidies. They {{are designed to help}} consumers find plans personalized to their specific health conditions, preferred doctor/hospital networks, and budget. These exchanges are sometimes called marketplaces or intermediaries, and work directly with insurance carriers, effectively acting as extensions of the carrier. The largest and most successful <b>private</b> health care <b>exchange</b> is CaliforniaChoice, established in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{inherently}} four-wire, VoIP systems require hybrids {{when they}} interface to two-wire lines.

End-end VoIP needs no hybrids unless adaptation to a two-wire line is required.|$|R

Employers choose the plans and products they wish to offer on a <b>private</b> <b>exchange</b> and allocate funds that their employees or retirees can use to purchase benefits in the marketplace. Exchange users have the option to contribute additional funds beyond their employer contribution should they want to purchase more than the employer contribution covers.|$|R
