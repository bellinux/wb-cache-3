5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (<b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion)</b> – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E

5|$|Uranium's average {{concentration}} in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25km (15mi) down is calculated to contain 1017kg (2lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013kg (2lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its {{concentration in}} sea water is 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature.

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study.

5|$|Most helium on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion.</b> In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
50|$|Polonium only {{occurs in}} trace amounts on earth, via {{radioactive}} decay of uranium and thorium. It {{is present in}} uranium ores in concentrations of 100 micrograms per metric ton.

40|$|When {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) are detected in samples from drinking-water supply wells, {{it is important to}} understand what these results may mean to human health. As a first step toward understanding VOC occurrence in the context of human health, a screening-level assessment was conducted by comparing VOC concentrations to human-health benchmarks. One sample from each of 3, 497 domestic and public wells was analyzed for 55 VOCs; samples were collected prior to treatment or blending. At least one VOC was detected in 623 well samples (about 18 percent of all well samples) at a threshold of 0. 2 <b>part</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion.</b> Eight of the 55 VOCs had concentrations greater than human-health benchmarks in 45 well samples (about 1 percent of all well samples); these concentrations may be of potential human-health concern if the water were to be ingested without treatment for many years. VOC concentrations were less than human-health benchmarks in most well samples with VOC detections (fig. 1), indicating that adverse effects are unlikely to occur, even if water with such concentrations were to be ingested over a lifetime. Seventeen VOCs may warrant further investigation because their concentrations were greater than, or approached, human-health benchmarks. Well samples without VOC detections at a threshold of 0. 2 <b>part</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> (82 percent) Well samples with VOC detections greater than benchmarks (1 percent) Well samples with VOC detections less than or equal to benchmarks (15 percent) Well samples with VOC detections but no benchmarks to compare to concentrations (2 percent) Figure 1.

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>billion.</b> With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
