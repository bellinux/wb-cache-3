5000|$|The {{role of the}} incompetent {{perforator}} vein in {{varicose veins}} and venous disease is controversial. Prof Mark Whiteley showed an association between incompetent perforating veins and recurrent varicose veins in 2001 {{and in the same}} year developed the TRansLuminal Occlusion of Perforator (TRLOP) technique to treat them minimally invasively. The TRLOP technique was copied and renamed [...] "Percutaneous Ablation of Perforators" [...] (PAPs) in 2007 despite the five year results of TRLOP being published shortly afterwards. The apparent attempt to rename and hence take credit for describing the TRLOP technique surfaced in published form with a letter written by Professor Mark Whiteley to <b>Phlebology.</b> Regardless of the name given to the TRLOP technique, the controversy as to whether incompetent perforating veins need treating in patients with varicose veins continues and Professor Whiteley was invited to document his views in a published [...] "transatlantic debate" [...] in September 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Regulatory {{requirements}} for <b>phlebology</b> certification {{are different in}} Europe and the USA.

The test addresses knowledge of venous disease, clotting disorders, imaging modalities, pharmacokinetics, vascular malformations, lymphatics disorders and venous embryology. The American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine results in certification as a [...] "Diplomate of the American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine" [...] {{which is based on}} standards set by the American Board of Medical Specialities.

50|$|The term venous {{translucence}} (or translumination) {{has been}} used in <b>phlebology</b> since 1996 by surgeon Pedro Fernandes Neto during ambulatory clinical exams in Brazil. His results were published in the annals of the national and international congresses of angiology. Venous translucence is the process of reflective image visualization of veins by light, which reaches up to the superficial venous system. It is a non-invasive method. Since it is a simple, low-cost technique it can be repeated as needed, which is useful in disease-process monitoring. It is a new diagnostic procedure, still undergoing investigation; more analysis is necessary to hone its technical aspects. Venous translucence is based on optical physics. It is caused by the refraction, absorption and reflection of light (whose principle is the dispersion and absorption of light). The color which is not absorbed is reflected, and is the one that is seen. Therefore, venous translumination is based on the incidence of luminosity on the vein, where part of the light is absorbed and another reflected (supplying a silhouette of the vein in question).|$|E

40|$|A {{varicose vein}} or <b>phlebology</b> {{practice}} {{can be incorporated}} into an outpatient interventional radiology practice with some proper planning. For an established interventional radiology clinic practice, the barriers to entry into such a <b>phlebology</b> practice are actually fairly low. A critical component in this process is establishing a business plan. An intact business plan can provide the proper foundation for any business venture, including a successful <b>phlebology</b> practice. Key steps in any business plan include an evaluation of the proposed venture, proper planning, organization, implementation, and periodic review.

40|$|What is <b>phlebology?</b> Who are the phlebolo-gists? These could seem obvious {{questions}} but {{the answer}} {{may not be so}} simple. The peculiarity of <b>phlebology</b> is that this deals with a very common disease that crosses the expertise of many disciplines: vascular sur-gery, angiology, dermatology, general surgery, interventional radiology and many more. Also in different geographical areas <b>phlebology</b> is generally practiced by very different profes-sionals: in Central Europe or in the USA it has always been practiced mostly by dermatolo-gists as in many other countries is mainly practiced by surgeons. A peculiarity of <b>phlebology</b> is that with rela-tively little equipment you can make a high level <b>phlebology</b> that is highly profitable for those who practice it. Furthermore, most of the phlebological activities may be performed in an office set-ting, with a possible widespread diffusion. The gray aspect of <b>phlebology</b> is, at the opposite, that every physician making a sclerotherapy or a bandage may consider himself as an expert without a true and extended knowledge. This explains the stagecoach that we have seen to what until a few decades ago it was considered the Cinderella of vascular diseases. In this situation it is needed to respond appropriately to the questions with which I began this editorial. In US it was established in 2007 the American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine (ABVLM...|$|E
