5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant. Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange <b>Product</b> <b>Liability</b> {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E

The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning <b>product</b> <b>liability</b> case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

40|$|The {{threshold}} {{issue in}} American <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> litigation {{is whether the}} product was defective {{at the time it}} left the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s control. Traditionally, courts and scholars define “defect” in three functional categories: manufacturing defects, design defects and marketing defects. American <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> doctrine employs two major tests to determine whether a 2 ̆ 2 defect” exists: the seller-oriented risk-utility test and the buyer-oriented consumer expectations test. The Draft of the Restatement Third of Torts: <b>Products</b> <b>Liability,</b> like some American jurisdictions, rejects the “consumer expectations” test as an independent standard in defective warning and design cases. Ironically, this limitation of the use of the consumer expectations test in American <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> doctrine coincides with the European Community 2 ̆ 7 s adoption of the consumer-oriented test for European strict <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> cases. This article analyzes these contemporary developments. First, it considers the implications of the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s (EU) Council Directive No. 85 / 374 (European Directive) for American <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> law. It then analyzes the consumer expectations test in light of the purpose of <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> law. Reconsideration of the consumer expectations test suggests that, properly constructed and applied, the consumer-oriented test promotes considerations of safety, equity, and efficiency...|$|R

Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B.

The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award.

40|$|Modern {{civil law}} faces an {{extraordinary}} irony. Today, in the United States, civil law is in crisis. It is increasingly {{acknowledged that the}} crisis stems from the expansion of civil liability since the mid- 1960 s following the adoption in the U. S. of strict <b>liability</b> for <b>product</b> defects. The irony is that, just {{at the time that}} the devastating implications of the strict liability approach are becoming clear in the U. S., the European community has decided to impose strict <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> upon its member states. As Europe expands standards of civil liability, the United States, in response to the crisis, is engaged in massive retrenchment of civil liability. Since 1985, the legislatures of 39 of the 50 states have enacted some version of 2 ̆ 2 tort reform 2 ̆ 2 legislation. The most significant of these statutes is the 1987 New Jersey <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> act, which sharply halts the expansion of manufacturer liability in a state which had inspired and had led the post- 1960 s trend. Of even greater significance, within past months, the California Supreme Court, which in 1963 first introduced the concept of strict <b>products</b> <b>liability,</b> has itself recanted the strict liability approach. In Brown v. Superior Court (Abbott Laboratories), the California Supreme Court concluded that manufacturers of pharmaceuticals should be liable according to a standard no more rigorous than negligence because of the disastrous effects of strict <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> on the availability of drugs to consumers. This paper explores the crisis in the United States, the relationship of the crisis to the concept of strict <b>products</b> <b>liability,</b> and the modern U. S. retrenchment. There are many implications of the U. S. experience for the future of <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> law in Europe and in other nations, such as Israel, that have adopted strict <b>products</b> <b>liability.</b> Part I describes the civil law crisis in the United States.

It looks in particular at the original intent of the Founders of strict <b>products</b> <b>liability</b> to show how strict liability has departed from the original view in ways that have generated the current crisis in the U. S. Finally, Part III describes in more detail the counterrevolution of U. S. law and its implications for Europe and Israel...|$|R
