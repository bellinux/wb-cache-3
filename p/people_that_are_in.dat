We {{talk about it}} from time to time, but the business has changed so much. It's not {{like the old days}} when you just have a record deal and go in the studio and record with a producer and then start promoting." [...] In the same interview Ruth Pointer commented on the Pointer Sister's profile having dropped in recent years: [...] "We've performed a lot in Europe and Asia and Australia, and it's just that we haven't been very visible publicly in the [...] We still do a lot of corporate parties and private parties because I mean, let's face it, those are the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> our own age group and know our songs." ...|$|E

60|$|Why, {{there are}} some <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> chief the devil's sin-breeders in the towns and places where they live. The place, town, or family where they live, must needs be horribly verminous, as it were, eaten up with vermin. Now, let the Lord Jesus, in the first place, cleanse these great breeders, {{and there will be}} given a nip to those swarms of sins that used to be {{committed}} in such places throughout the town, house, or family, where such sin-breeding persons used to be.|$|E

Its introductory passage from scripture comes from Psalms 144: 14–15 – [...] "That there <b>be</b> no complaining <b>in</b> our streets.

60|$|Sixth, In a word, to hold {{communion with}} the open profane, is most pernicious and destructive. (1.) 'Twas the wicked {{multitude}} that fell a lusting, and that tempted Christ {{in the desert}} (Num 11:4). (2.) It was the profane heathen, of whom Israel learned to worship idols. They 'were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And served their idols; which were a snare unto them' (Psa 106:35,36). (3.) It is the mingled people that God hath threatened to plague with those deadly punishments of his, with which he hath threatened to punish Babylon itself; saying, When a sword is upon her liars, her mighty, her chariots, and treasures; a sword also shall be upon the mingled <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the midst of her.|$|E
60|$|For example, though I shall {{give you}} but a homely one; suppose {{a family to}} be very lousy, {{and one or two}} of the family to be in chief the breeders, the way, the quickest way, to clean that family, or at least to weaken the so {{swarming}} of those vermin, is, in the first place, to sweeten the skin, head, and clothes of the chief breeders; and then, though all the family should be apt to breed them, the number of them, and so the greatness of that plague there, will be the more impaired. Why, there are some <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> chief the devil's sin-breeders in the towns and places where they live. The place, town, or family where they live, must needs be horribly lousy, and, as it were, eaten up with vermin. Now, let the Lord Jesus, in the first place, cleanse these great breeders, and there will be given a nip to those swarms of sins that used to be committed in such places throughout the town, house, or family, where such sin-breeding persons used to be.|$|E
6000|$|Third. Not only thus, but, 1. God hath begotten believers {{again to}} Himself, to be His adopted and {{accepted}} children, {{in and through}} the Lord Jesus (1 Peter 1:3). 2. God hath prepared a kingdom for them before {{the foundation of the}} world, through Jesus Christ (Matt 25:34). 3. He hath given them an earnest of their happiness while they live here in this world. [...] "After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory," [...] and that through this Jesus (Eph 1:13,14). [These things are more fully laid down {{in that part of the}} book which containeth the discourse of the privileges of the new covenant]. 4. If His children sin through weakness, or by sudden temptation, they confessing of it, He willingly forgives, and heals all their wounds, reneweth His love towards them, waits to do them good, casteth their sins into the depths of the sea, and all this freely, without any work done by men as men--Not for your own sakes do I do this, O house of Israel, be it known unto you, saith the Lord, but wholly and alone by the blood of Jesus (Eze 36:23,23). 5. In a word, if you would see it altogether, God's love was the cause why Jesus Christ was sent to bleed for sinners. Jesus Christ's bleeding stops the cries of Divine justice; God looks upon them as complete in Him, gives them to Him as His by right of purchase. Jesus ever lives to pray for them that are thus given unto Him. God sends His Holy Spirit into them to reveal this to them, sends His angels to minister for them; and all this by virtue of an Everlasting Covenant between the Father and the Son. Thrice happy are the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> such a case! ...|$|E

50|$|During the {{termination}} stage, both <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the relationship decide {{to end their}} connection with one another. No longer are they both receiving a mutually satisfying outcome from being with one another. Neither {{one of them is}} happy and the relationship must come to an end. In this model, this step is unavoidable and relationships can terminate at any time. Termination can occur due to physical separation, growing socially or psychologically apart, or the death of one of the partners. Communication <b>in</b> this stage <b>is</b> marked by distance (an attempt to put psychological and physical barriers between partners) and disassociation (messages that prepare one or both parties for their life without the other).|$|R

5000|$|Air {{pollution}} is another environmental factor {{that has been}} proven to be an influence on health.

The more <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> these regions means the more resources required to sustain them. Air pollution comes in two forms; emission and transmission.
