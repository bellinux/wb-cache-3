"Silence," [...] Franklin writes, [...] "possesses {{striking}} similarities [...] {{aspects of}} life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments." [...] She argues that the technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes the sound as permanent as the Muzak that plays endlessly in public places without anyone's consent. For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the British enclosure laws which fenced off the commons for <b>private</b> <b>farming.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} strategy of General Velasco's government {{was shaped by}} a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea {{was to find a}} [...] "third way" [...] between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish cooperative ownership, rejecting both individual <b>private</b> <b>farming</b> and state farms. Promoting worker participation in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more fundamental plane, the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the change}} of the Soviet {{leadership}} in 1964, there were significant changes made to economic policy. The Government on 30 September 1965 issued a decree [...] "On improving the management of industry" [...] and the 4 October 1965 resolution [...] "On improving and strengthening the economic incentives for industrial production". The main initiator of these reforms was Premier A. Kosygin. Kosygin's reforms on agriculture gave considerable autonomy to the collective farms, giving {{them the right to}} the contents of <b>private</b> <b>farming.</b> During this period, there was the large-scale land reclamation program, the construction of irrigation channels, and other measures. In the period 1966–70, the gross national product grew by over 350%. The country produced 4 times more than the previous five-year period. Industrial output increased by 485% and agriculture by 171%. In the eighth Five-Year Plan, the national income grew at an average rate of 7.8%. In the ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975), the national income grew {{at an annual rate of}} 5.7%. In the 10th Five-Year Plan (1976–1981), the national income grew at an annual rate of 4.3%.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the birth}} of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China has {{undergone}} several economic transformations. Gradual reforms have shifted agricultural production in rural areas from <b>private</b> <b>farming</b> to collectivization and lastly back to household production. This is seen in two main policy eras: 1) Central planning from the 1950s until 1978, and 2) Decentralization after 1978.|$|E
50|$|Reform of Estonia's {{agricultural}} system began in December 1989 with {{adoption of the}} Law on <b>Private</b> <b>Farming.</b> The law allowed individuals to take up to fifty hectares of land for private planting and for growing crops. The land was heritable but could not be bought or sold. The goal of the reform was to stimulate production and return the spirit of <b>private</b> <b>farming</b> to a countryside worn down by decades of central planning. Six months after implementation, nearly 2,000 farms were set up, with several thousand waiting for approval. A year later, more than 3,500 private farms were operating. Starting in October 1991, farmers were allowed to own their land. This boosted the number of farms to 7,200 by early 1992. As {{of the first half}} of 1993, a total of 8,781 farms had been created, covering approximately 225,000 hectares, or a quarter of Estonia's arable land.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore how the {{modeling}} of effort as a factor of production affects the relative competitiveness of different economic organizations. We construct a simple model of privately-owned and labor-managed firms {{to show that the}} more important the role of effort in production, the greater the differences in the efficiency of the two types of firms even if monitoring is held fixed. Using data on cooperative and <b>private</b> <b>farms</b> in El Salvador, we show much greater differences in efficiency between cooperatives and <b>private</b> <b>farms</b> for coffee, an effort-intensive crop, than for maize and sugar, which are less effort intensive. In all cases, <b>private</b> <b>farms</b> elicit higher levels of effort than do cooperative farms. The results suggest that the way in which effort enters the production function may determine the number of organizational forms that can coexist in a competitive industry...|$|R
