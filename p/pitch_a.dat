5|$|Johnston {{rounded off}} his Ashes {{series with the}} Fifth Test at The Oval. English skipper Norman Yardley elected to bat on a rain-affected <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> {{decision}} many regarded as surprising. Precipitation {{in the past week}} rendered play before midday impossible. Former Australian Test batsman and leading commentator Jack Fingleton speculated that the tourists would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5000|$|While {{both the}} bangdi (pitched {{in the same}} range as western piccolo) and qudi (<b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> fourth or fifth lower than the bangdi) are the most predominant, other dizi include the xiaodi/gaoyindi (<b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> fourth of fifth higher than the bangdi), the dadi/diyindi (<b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> fourth or fifth lower than qudi), and the deidi/diyindadi (<b>pitched</b> <b>an</b> octave lower than qudi.) ...|$|R

50|$|Wellington College {{was founded}} in 1989 after Annadale Boys and Carolan Girls merged. The school is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The school moved to its current {{location}} on Carolan Road in 2002, which included 2 new rugby <b>pitches,</b> <b>a</b> gravel <b>pitch,</b> <b>an</b> astro <b>pitch</b> and <b>a</b> running track.|$|R
5|$|Barrow then {{bought the}} Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, {{managing}} {{them for the}} rest of the 1896 season. Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for $2,100 the next year ($ in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> few innings a game.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the land}} was {{required}} for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened by the Mayor of Birkenhead, Councillor George Proudman, on 9 March 1912. Their first match was played against Lancaster Town in the Lancashire Combination. There were stands (also known as bleachers) {{on both sides of}} the <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.|$|E
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} not unusual for him to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E

50|$|In {{his first}} game with the Philadelphia Phillies, Lee <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} game and took a 5-1 victory. He <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter into the sixth inning and batted two hits, including his first career double and a run scored. Through his first five games with the Phillies, Lee compiled a 5-0 record, 39 strikeouts in 40 innings <b>pitched,</b> and <b>a</b> 0.68 ERA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pitched</b> <b>a</b> few games professionally.|$|R
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> strong personal rivalry {{developed between}} Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted him to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Ebert, {{along with}} {{colleague}} Gene Siskel, guest-starred on {{an episode of}} the animated TV series The Critic. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film Sleepless in Seattle. The following year, Ebert appeared in <b>Pitch,</b> <b>a</b> documentary by Canadian film makers Spencer Rice and Kenny Hotz. He made an appearance as himself in a 1997 episode of the television series Early Edition, {{which took place in}} Chicago. In the episode, Ebert consoles a young boy who is depressed after he sees a character called Bosco the Bunny die in a movie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the club's owners {{announced}} a modernisation of Stamford Bridge {{with plans for}} a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> process completed by 2001.|$|E
50|$|Crosshaven RFC (Rugby Union Football Club) {{was founded}} in 1972, and has two <b>pitches,</b> <b>an</b> {{all-weather}} <b>pitch</b> and <b>a</b> gym located at Myrtleville Cross in Crosshaven.|$|R
50|$|On June 2, 1879, Richmond {{was paid}} $10 to pitch for Worcester of the National Baseball Association in an {{exhibition}} game against the Chicago White Stockings. He <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> seven-inning no-hitter and signed with Worcester after the game. On July 28, he <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter against Springfield.|$|R
50|$|When the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the White Sox {{he became}} the first pitcher in the Majors to be traded away in the same season that he <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter since Cliff Chambers <b>pitched</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Boston Braves in 1951.|$|R
5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> perfect game in {{baseball}} history. Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{throws a}} mix of four pitches. His main <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> four-seam fastball was once thrown in the mid-to-upper 90s, but now settles between 91 and 94mph. His main {{breaking}} ball is a hard slider in the upper 80s, occasionally even touching 90. He uses the slider less frequently against left-handed hitters, preferring to use a curveball in the low 80s. He also uses a two-seam fastball against lefties. His slider is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a whiff rate of 42% since 2007.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 2015, Hamels {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman in {{exchange}} for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff. Hamels became the first pitcher to be traded during a regular season after pitching a no-hitter in his final start with the team that traded him. Bert Blyleven had been the last pitcher to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter in his final start with the team that traded him; after pitching a no-hitter for the Rangers in his final start of the 1977 season, he {{was traded to}} the Pittsburgh Pirates that offseason.|$|E

He joins Sandy Koufax from the 1965 World Series and Justin Verlander from the 2012 American League Division Series as the only postseason pitchers to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> shutout and strikeout ten or more batters in a winner-take-all game.|$|E
5|$|The Kop Stand and the Tilton Road Stand, {{opened in}} 1994, form a {{continuous}} L-shaped single-tier stand, with seating capacity for nearly 17,000 spectators, round the remaining {{half of the}} <b>pitch.</b> <b>A</b> walkway separates back and front sections. The Kop seating includes the directors' box and a row of executive boxes, within the stand {{are a number of}} function rooms and hospitality areas, and there are electronic perimeter advertising boards in front.

5|$|The hockey {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter edges {{are called the}} side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd).

5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began work}} on the film that would become Monsters, Inc. in 1996 while others focused on A Bug's Life (1998) and Toy Story 2 (1999). Its code name was Hidden City, named for Docter's {{favorite}} restaurant in Point Richmond. By early-February 1997, Docter had drafted a treatment together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to <b>pitch</b> <b>a</b> refined {{version of the story}} on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant– whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)– suggested the title Monsters, Inc., a play on the title of a gangster film Murder, Inc., which stuck. The film marks the first Pixar feature to not be directed by Lasseter instead being helmed by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman who served as co-directors.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{the owner}} of the club, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research gave the project of {{building}} a new sports city to the Spanish company TriArena. They are constructing a main football stadium with a capacity of 16,000 spectators and an area of 71,150 m². The project also includes two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a fustal <b>pitch,</b> <b>a</b> handball court, a hotel, restaurants, and a covered swimming pool. Al-Talaba is defined as a sports club, not just a football one, and it has supported other sports at minor level only in the past. The foundation stone was laid by the former minister of higher education and scientific research, Ali al-Adeeb, in February 2014. The cost of the project is estimated to be $84 million and the duration of construction was expected to be 30 months, meaning that by 2017 the Al-Talaba Sports City should be open. Due to the financial crisis in Iraq, the project was scratched after spending $4 million on designs.|$|E
