2500|$|Based upon thermal stratification, lakes are {{classified}} as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the [...] layers of sediment {{at the bottom of}} a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, <b>polymictic</b> lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.|$|E

50|$|The lake is <b>polymictic</b> (water {{turns over}} more than twice a year), well oxygenated, and {{contains}} excessive nutrients (eutrophic) because of fertilizer runoff from the neighboring farms and nurseries. Because of the excessive nutrients, Laguna Catemaco {{is one of the}} more productive lakes in Mexico, up to 1,800 tons annually. Large netting is prohibited to assure the livelihood of more than a thousand registered fishermen. A perch like fish called Oreochromis aureus was introduced from Africa (Mojarra Tilapia), a sardine like Topote, and the snail Tegogolo are the most common catches. According to Miller and Conner (1997) there are 14 species of fish in Lake Catemaco. Two species, Micropterus salmoides Lacepède and Oreochromis aureus Steindachner have been introduced into the lake, and another two species, Vieja fenestrata Günther and Ophisternon aenigmaticum Rosen & Greenwood, are widespread throughout eastern Mexico and Central America. Of the remaining 10 species, five are endemic to the lake and five may represent undescribed species endemic to the lake (Miller and Conner 1997, Meyer and Schartl 2003). The high rate of endemicity suggests that Lake Catemaco has been biogeographically isolated for some time, possibly since its origin up to 2 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|Macrophyte Index (ESMI), {{a method}} {{compliant}} with the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) {{for assessing the}} ecological status of lakes based on macro-phytes. A description of the elaboration of macro-phyte metrics, relevant reference conditions and a classification system for two types of high-alkalinity lowland lakes (stratified and <b>polymictic),</b> and a customised field survey procedure based on belt transects are presented. The ESMI evaluates two aspects of macrophyte community: taxonomic composition (index of evenness J) and abundance (colonisation index Z), which are combined into one multimetric. ESMI values range from 0 to 1, where 1 denotes pristine conditions and 0, highly degraded habitats. The high/good class boundary (H/G) was set at the first quartile of ESMI values of reference lakes. For the other classes, boundaries were set by dividing the range of ESMI values between the H/G boundary and the minimum value recorded in the dataset in a loga-rithmic scale into four. The ESMI correlated best with water transparency (Pearson’s R= 0. 62 in stratified lakes and 0. 79 in <b>polymictic</b> ones), whereas the correlationswith phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were somewhat weaker (R=− 0. 48 to − 0. 57).

40|$|Methane-derived carbon {{has been}} shown to be an {{important}} carbon source for macroinvertebrates in several studies of lake ecosystems using stable isotopes. Furthermore, season and lake morphology appear to influence the importance of methane as a carbon source. However, rarely have the dynamics of the methane cycle been measured concurrently with the isotope signatures of chironomid larvae. We examined the methane dynamics in 2 lakes with contrasting mixing regimes (<b>polymictic</b> and dimictic), while monitoring corresponding changes in chironomid larval δ 13 C throughout an annual cycle. Both methane turnover rates and abundance of methane-oxidising bacteria were higher in the dimictic lake, where correspondingly lower mean larval δ 13 C values of – 44. 2 to – 61. 7 ‰ were recorded. In contrast, potential methane production and oxidation rates, as well as cell numbers of methane-oxidising bacteria were always lower in the <b>polymictic</b> lake; corresponding larval δ 13 C values ranged from – 32. 3 to – 29. 6 ‰. Furthermore, seasonal variation in larval δ 13 C was more pronounced in the dimictic lake (– 50. 1 ± 5. 9 ‰) compared to the <b>polymictic</b> lake (– 31. 1 ± 1. 2 ‰), reflecting the amplitude of turnover rates. This suggests strongly that lake characteristics have an influence on methane turnover rates and, in conjunction with season, affect the subsequent incorporation of methane-derived carbon into freshwater food webs via macroinvertebrates...|$|E

Major hypogene copper sulfi de mineralization {{is related to the}} second event. A late-ore mafi c dike swarm cross-cuts all rocks in the deposit. Two types of granodioritic porphyries can be distinguished from petrographic observations and geochemical data: granodiorite porphyry I (GP I) and granodiorite porphyry II (GP II), which resulted from two different trends of magmatic evolution. The concave shape of the rare earth element (REE) distribution pattern together with the weak or absence of negative Eu anomalies in mafi c dikes, dioritic and GP I porphyries, suggest hornblende-dominated fractionation for this magmatic suite. In contrast, distinct negative Eu anomalies and the fl at REE patterns suggest plagioclase-dominated fractionation, at low oxygen fugacity, for the GP II porphyry suite. But shallow mixing and mingling between silicic and dioritic melts are also likely for the formation of the GP II and <b>polymictic</b> breccias, respectively. Sr-Nd isotopic compositions suggest that the rhyolitic dome rocks were generated from a dominantly crustal source, while the GP I has mantle affi nity.

40|$|The Ordovician to Lower Silurian Forest Reefs Volcanics in the Cadia – Neville region, northeastern Lachlan Orogen, {{represent}} {{the product of}} at least two shoshonitic volcanic centres intercalated with a volcaniclastic apron. The two episodes of shoshonitic volcanism in the Forest Reefs Volcanics are separated by between 15 and 20 million years. The Forest Reefs Volcanics are informally divided into lower and upper parts, separated by an inferred unconformity that broadly coincides in age with a limestone-forming hiatus in volcanism (449 – 447 Ma) and emplacement nearby of medium-K calcalkaline dacitic intrusions (448 – 445 Ma). The lower part includes shoshonitic basaltic andesite, feldsparrich sandstone, volcanic lithic breccia and lesser black mudstone; <b>polymictic</b> volcanic conglomerate with sandstone matrix and calcareous sandstone are important near the top. The basaltic facies association occurs near the base of the lower Forest Reefs Volcanics and could represent a submarine basaltic volcano at least 12 km in diameter. A major change in provenance for the upper Forest Reefs Volcanics is reflected in the increased abundance of ferromagnesian crystals and coarse mafic volcanic fragments, particularly in the mafic volcanic sandstone, <b>polymictic</b> volcanic conglomerate with coarse volcanic matrix and <b>polymictic</b> hornblende andesite breccia. The trachyandesite facies association records another episode of shoshonitic volcanism that probably occurred late in the accumulation of the upper Forest Reefs Volcanics and could represent an intrusive complex or the initial, largely shallow intrusive stages of a cone volcano. Highly porphyritic basalt to basaltic andesite intrusions were emplaced as sills before the volcaniclastic succession was lithified. The final magmatic activity generated coarsely equigranular, mafic to intermediate intrusions. The trachyandesite facies association, the highly porphyritic basalt to basaltic andesite intrusions and the coarsely equigranular intrusions were emplaced successively in a relatively short time (about 443 – 439 Ma).

Treatment longevity based on declines in epilimnetic total P (TP) concentration averaged 11 years for all lakes (range of 0 – 45 years).
