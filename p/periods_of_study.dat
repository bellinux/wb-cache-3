2500|$|Goldberg {{was born}} to German parents in Danzig (Gdańsk), Royal Prussia, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Sometimes he is {{indicated}} as [...] "from Königsberg". On March 1727 he was baptized at St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk. Little is known for certain about his childhood, other than {{that he was an}} exceptionally talented performer, attracting the attention of Hermann Karl von Keyserlingk, the Russian ambassador to Saxony, around 1737. Goldberg was reported to have studied with both J.S. Bach and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, J.S. Bach's eldest son, though the <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> are not known; Goldberg may have studied with J.S. Bach as early as 1737, shortly after Keyserlingk recognized his talent in Danzig, and Goldberg may have studied with W.F. Bach at any time before 1745, since W.F. Bach was in Dresden throughout Keyserlingk's tenure there as ambassador.|$|E
2500|$|After {{qualifying}} as {{a medical}} doctor, Illingworth undertook a period as house physician at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. He then continued with further training in his chosen speciality of surgery, studying and working from 1922 in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with Harold Stiles and David Wilkie. By 1925, Illingworth had qualified FRCSEd (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh). In the period 1926–7, he studied abroad at the Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Missouri, USA (now the Barnes-Jewish Hospital): [...] "During the years 1926–27 the following men arrived for various prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> [...] C. F. W. Illingworth, of Edinburgh, Scotland, came here as {{a fellow of the}} Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland and stayed a year. He obtained his fellowship under the direction and help of Professor Wilkie of Edinburgh, who sent him here. He in turn was replaced by Bruce Dick, also of the University of Edinburgh, who came on a fellowship of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation and stayed eight months. Both Dr. Illingworth and Dr. Dick co-operated with Dr. Gopher in some experimental studies." [...] The following year (1928) Illingworth married Eleanor Mary Bennett, with whom he would have four sons.|$|E
2500|$|Horowitz taught seven {{students}} between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. [...] "Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.|$|E
