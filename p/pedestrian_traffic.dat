5|$|Downstream is the 10th Avenue Bridge, {{once known}} as the Cedar Avenue Bridge. Immediately {{upstream}} is the lock and dam at Saint Anthony Falls, where Minneapolis began. The first bridge upstream is the historic Stone Arch Bridge, built for the Great Northern Railway and now used for bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inspections by the Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Sir Joseph Bazalgette, {{following}} the purchase found that Battersea Bridge {{was in such}} poor condition that it was unable to be repaired safely. In 1883 it was restricted to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic</b> only, and in 1885 it was demolished {{to make way for}} a new bridge designed by Bazalgette.|$|E
5|$|North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane {{two-way street}} that is {{serviced}} by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect {{the area to}} the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also serviced by seasonal trolley service along the street, and {{the foot of the}} Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>traffic</b> abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Northeast of Brent Cross, at Henlys Corner, the North Circular briefly shares carriageways {{with the}} A1 which joins {{it from the}} left and leaves it {{to the right to}} head into Central London. The {{junction}} complex also serves the Finchley Road and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic,</b> and consequently is a major bottleneck on the route. Transport for London have invested in the junction, including a special hands free crossing for the local Jewish community, who can then cross the road on the Sabbath. The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards Friern Barnet and Muswell Hill. The road narrows to two lane single carriageway to pass under a railway bridge, and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the upper}} Caroline Street {{corridor}} and Key West Bight {{have been part}} of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and funded by a special property tax system. At the beginning of the project, the area, once dominated by commercial fishing, had been falling into disarray as its practical future became uncertain. The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor, including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to bicycle and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic.</b> As recently as February 2012, additional requests for improvements were lodged with $720,000 available for the project.|$|E
5|$|Settlements {{along the}} eastern shore of Lake Washington were {{established}} in the late 19th century by homesteaders, real estate developers, and industrialists. A ferry system was set up between towns on the lake and Seattle to the west in the 1880s. By 1913, the steam ferry Leschi was transporting automobiles, in addition to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic,</b> between Seattle and docks in Bellevue, Kirkland, and Medina. In 1940, the Lake Washington Floating Bridge was opened between Seattle and Mercer Island, carrying the Sunset Highway (later I-90) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed for the Eastside to rapidly develop into bedroom communities in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.|$|E

5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1994, creating a link in the trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built {{in what used to}} be the Standard Mill, while the North Star Lofts was a new use for the former North Star Woolen Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main and a number of condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{leading out}} of Mogadishu connect {{the city to}} other localities in Somalia {{as well as to}} {{neighbouring}} countries. The capital itself is cut into several grid layouts by an extensive road network, with streets supporting the flow of both vehicular and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic.</b> In October 2013, major construction began on the 23 kilometer road leading to the airport. Overseen by Somali and Turkish engineers, the upgrade was completed in November and included lane demarcation. The road construction initiative {{was part of a larger}} agreement signed by the Somali and Turkish governments to establish Mogadishu and Istanbul as sister cities, and in the process bring all of Mogadishu's roads up to modern standards. Following the treaty, the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) launched a citywide cleaning project in conjunction with the municipal cleaning department. The initiative saw around 100 rubbish collection vehicles and other equipment operated by TIKA clean the city's roads, with the Benadir municipality taking over operation of the cleaning project in March 2015.|$|E

50|$|In 1995-1999 {{the road}} was widened from the initial four to ten lanes, while all intersections became grade-separated, bridges were built to {{accommodate}} <b>pedestrians,</b> <b>traffic</b> lights were removed, and a solid concrete barrier was installed in the median. In 2001 all slow-moving vehicles were banned from entering the MKAD and the renovated road received a freeway designation from the mayor's office.|$|R
50|$|When making left turns, drivers {{will often}} drive over painted islands {{even though it}} is {{technically}} illegal. Some traffic islands may serve as refuge islands for <b>pedestrians.</b> <b>Traffic</b> islands are often used at partially blind intersections on back-streets to prevent cars from cutting a corner with potentially dangerous results, or to prevent some movements totally, for traffic safety or traffic calming reasons.|$|R

50|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{there has}} been a backlash against excessive human-made clutter in the visual environment, such as signposts, signs, and hoardings. Other issues that generate strong debate among urban designers are tensions between peripheral growth, housing density and new settlements. There are also debates about the mixing tenures and land uses, versus distinguishing geographic zones where different uses dominate. Regardless, all successful urban planning considers urban character, local identity, respects heritage, <b>pedestrians,</b> <b>traffic,</b> utilities and natural hazards.|$|R

50|$|In 1873 the Government {{considered}} {{moving the}} terminus to Once (the first stop after Del Parque) {{due to the}} growing population in the area between both stations. Rail tracks crossed along streets and avenues (such as Corrientes) with high vehicle and <b>pedestrians</b> <b>traffic.</b> In April 1878 the Municipality of Buenos Aires promulgated by decree the moving of the station to Once, also closing the Once-Del Parque section, though {{it did not take}} effect until 1883. In 1884 the Del Parque building became the Argentine Army's headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Turbo Esprit is a {{video game}} {{published}} by Durell Software in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was very detailed and advanced for its time, featuring car indicator lights, <b>pedestrians,</b> <b>traffic</b> lights, and {{a view of the}} car's interior controls. It may also feature the earliest example of a free-roaming city environment in a computer game. Turbo Esprit was the first free-roaming driving game, and has been cited as a major influence on the later Grand Theft Auto series.|$|R

25|$|Commuters {{were being}} {{encouraged}} by the city to walk or bike to work; many bridges were open to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>traffic,</b> including the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, and George Washington Bridge for commuters from New Jersey. <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>traffic</b> on the four bridges during the strike rose 20- to 50-fold compared to before the strike. On {{the third day of}} the strike, a firefighter was critically injured while biking to work when he and a privately operated bus collided. The mayor addressed this in a press conference later on in the day. Many commuters used the New York Water Taxi service from NY Waterway as an alternative to get to Manhattan from the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Hunts Point, South Amboy, and Jersey City. Other commuters simply stayed home from work.|$|E
