50|$|The Stannary Palace, {{also known}} as the Duchy Palace, circa 1265-1300, was a complex of {{buildings}} constructed by the Earls of Cornwall as the centre of their administration. The surviving exchequer hall is reputed to be the oldest non-ecclesiastical building in Cornwall. The much larger great hall, of which large parts remain, was built as a replica of Westminster Hall. Its original function was as a Court and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> dealing with the Cornish tin industry. The Earls of Cornwall and later, after 1337, the Dukes of Cornwall had their residence at Restormel Castle so the original name would have been the Stannary Hall or the Great Hall of Lostwithiel. After 1337 it was sometimes referred to as the Duchy Palace.|$|E

Method: We reviewed evidence {{on the role of}} excise taxes on alcohol in preventing alcohol problems and underage drinking. We analyzed historical German data on tax on alcoholic beverages and compared this with European data, finally calculating tax scenarios and their impact on underage binge drinking. Results: Germany applies lower taxes than many other European countries and alcohol beverage prices have decreased by 30 % relative to overall price levels during the last 40 years. Conclusion: An optimal tax rate for reducing underage drinking would be set between the European average tax rates and Scandinavian tax rate levels...|$|E

40|$|The issue {{regarding}} output taxation, input deduction {{and determination}} of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in VAT law is inextricably linked with a correct fact determination. This {{is also the case}} in relation to a delimitation of the individual tax subject including the question whether related subjects/units should be acknowledged as independent tax subjects, or whether they should qualify as one subject/ one unit in a legal VAT context instead. A coherent analysis of selected ECJ rulings of relevance for the delimitation of each tax subject shows that subject delimitation in national civil law also is the predominant basis in a legal VAT context unless the law contains explicit deviations from this or should be deviated from on the basis of either abuse of law or substance over form considerations. However, in this article it is proved that case C- 388 / 11, Crédit Lyonnais breaks with this basic premise, as the ECJ in this case ignores the subject delimitation in civil law without a convincing argumentation {{for the fact that the}} law dictates this and without referring to abuse of law or substance over form...|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{it is seen}} {{taxes are}} highly indexed to wages and {{therefore}} <b>places</b> <b>of</b> high <b>taxation</b> are geographically found in areas with higher per capita income. The problem with taxation indexed to wages {{is that it does}} not consider cost of living. In areas with higher per capita income, it is highly likely that the cost of living is also higher; for instance, this is the case in New York. The effect of not indexing to costs of living makes some states look wealthier compared to others. It is typical that states with low costs of living receive more in spending than states with high costs of living (Leonard and Walder, Page 19). After discounting income with costs of living, New York's poverty level increases a significant amount (Pear, Page 2). The significance level between high levels of poverty and high taxation may be arguable.|$|R

40|$|The {{deleterious}} effect of debt restructuring on banks’ balance sheets and, consequently, {{on the economy}} as a whole has been a key policy issue. This paper studies how post-default fiscal policy interacts with this sovereign-bank loop and shape the response of a model economy. Calibration of the model matches characteristics of the Greek economy at the time of the Bond Exchange. Debt restructuring in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> higher lump-sum <b>taxation</b> or non-productive government spending harms the economy even if no other cost of default is considered. However, the sovereign-debt loop is less costly to the economy than increases in labour or capital taxes to service debt. Even so, if fiscal policy is too responsive, a crowding-out effect inhibits the recovery of capital markets, hence a more conservative fiscal stance is desirable. Thus how diabolic the post-default sovereign-bank loop is depends to a large extent on the way fiscal policy respond...|$|R

2500|$|No chapel or {{church was}} {{mentioned}} in the Domesday survey, but the will of a later Count of Eu written in 1139 states that one existed on the present site in 1090, suggesting possible pre-Norman origins. [...] There were two other <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship in the parish at the time—a church in the manor of Filsham, and another chapel at Wilting. [...] Filsham was the more important manor, but its church (and the chapel at Wilting) had disappeared by the time Pope Nicholas IV ordered a census <b>of</b> all <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship for <b>taxation</b> purposes in 1291. [...] (Wilting's probably disappeared in the early 12th century, although a field and a wood in the area still bear the chapel's name.) [...] A suggested reason for {{the isolation of the}} chapel—which was about [...] from the nearest house until after World War II—was that the ownership of the manor transferred at an early date to the Lord of the Manor of nearby Crowhurst, who abandoned Hollington's manor house and the surrounding area because they were superfluous.

Supporters argue that [...] "theft" [...] {{must be considered}} {{in the context of the}} system <b>of</b> government in <b>place.</b> One justification <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> is contained in social contracts. The general view is that taxation is required to fund basic provisions that provide for infrastructure and enhance economic growth (i.e. law and order, transport/telecom/energy services). However, this view has been criticized by Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century lawyer and political philosopher, who argued in his essay No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation, because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract.No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can say this to him; because there is no such association or body of men in existence. If any one should assert that there is such an association, let him prove, if he can, who compose it. Let him produce, if he can, any open, written, or other authentic contract, signed or agreed to by these men; forming themselves into an association; making themselves known as such to the world; appointing him as their agent; and making themselves individually, or as an association, responsible for his acts, done by their authority. Until all this can be shown, no one can say that, in any legitimate sense, there is any such association; or that he is their agent; or that he ever gave his oath to them; or ever pledged his faith to them.|$|R
