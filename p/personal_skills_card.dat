The skill point of Special <b>Skill</b> <b>Cards</b> is marked with an Exclamation Point ("!"). Special Skills are activated when certain conditions have been met, such as pressing {{a move on}} the first count of the countdown, experiencing a tie, etc. There are also rare, [...] "upgraded" [...] <b>skill</b> <b>cards</b> with certain low-level beetles' Finishing Moves. If the right <b>skill</b> <b>card</b> is scanned with the right beetle, the result with be a [...] "Super Max" [...] Compatibility and will deal tremendous damage if used. The upgraded <b>skill</b> <b>cards</b> are moves used by beetles with a Base Power range of 100 to 120, which gives them an advantage against rarer, stronger cards with a higher Base Power rating.|$|R

Every <b>skill</b> <b>card</b> requires a certain skill point number; {{if the number}} {{is equal to the}} beetle's skill point level, the result will be a perfect compatibility. If the beetle's skill point is greater than the skill, it results in a [...] "good" [...] compatibility. If the beetle's skill point is less than the skill point of the card, it will worsen the effectiveness of the skill used by that beetle.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} value of the Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (<b>SKILL)</b> <b>Card</b> test, {{designed}} to measure vision at reduced contrast and luminance, among patients with previous optic neuritis. Materials and Methods: The <b>SKILL</b> <b>Card</b> test was administered to 295 patients participating in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) follow-up study, concurrent with measurement of visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was also assessed in a subset of patients using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire and an ONTTdeveloped questionnaire. Results: The <b>SKILL</b> <b>Card</b> difference score (high-contrast acuity score minus low-contrast acuity score) was only weakly associated with the other measures of vision function (rs absolute range, 0. 05 – 0. 31) and with the HRQL measures (rs absolute range, 0. 02 – 0. 15). In contrast, the light and dark component scores of the <b>SKILL</b> <b>Card</b> test had higher associations with the other vision measures (rs absolute range, 0. 27 – 0. 54) and with the HRQL measures (rs absolute range, 0. 10 – 0. 40). Conclusions: The <b>SKILL</b> <b>Card</b> difference score is not a meaningful measure for patients with optic neuritis; however, the test appears to have clinical usefulness as a method to measure high-contrast and low-contrast acuity...|$|R

Skills can be used when the Skill Gauge reaches a certain level.

Results from a two-wave field survey of 173 protégés in the People's Republic of China indicate that role modeling positively affects relational job learning and <b>personal</b> <b>skill</b> development. However, <b>personal</b> <b>skill</b> development rather than relational job learning {{was found to be}} positively related to WFE and to mediate the relationship between role modeling and WFE.

50|$|Cards {{fall into}} three categories: System <b>Cards,</b> <b>Skill</b> <b>Cards,</b> and Spell Cards. System Cards include bombs (like in Immaterial, knocks the enemy back), weather change, and other {{miscellaneous}} options. <b>Skill</b> <b>Cards</b> upgrade special attacks {{to do more}} damage, allow the player to gain alternate special attacks, or both. Spell Cards are powerful attacks that automatically work once activated. Proper assembly of card decks according to the player's style is key to mastering the game, since the decks limit what the characters can do during a match.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{graduates}} are under increasing pressure to demonstrate {{high levels of}} <b>personal</b> <b>skills.</b> The accreditation criteria of professional bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, Engineers Ireland and Engineers Australia, to name but a few, now include {{the development of a}} broad range of <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> (ABET, 2008; Engineers Australia, 2011; Engineers Ireland, 2007). Evidence of a ‘strong contribution’, a term used by Engineers Ireland, to the development of teamwork, lifelong learning, ethics, communication and self-direction is required in the programme to satisfy the accreditation criteria. Numerous anecdotes of intensive probing for <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> are relayed by graduates applying for their first job. Many employers devote significant time to assessing the level of <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> during the recruitment process. Government reports on skills needs often call for greater attention to be paid to the development of critical thinking, creativity and innovation in engineering programmes (Forfás, 2009). Today’s engineering students are experiencing the effects of curricula changing in response to this new outlook of graduate attributes. Achievement of high levels of many <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> is greatly facilitated by a concurrent growth in intellectual development – autonomy in learning, commitment to ethics, willingness to lead and display initiative are hallmarks of the relativistic thinker. The engineer whose intellectual development has not yet passed the dualistic and multiplistic stages and is still reliant on authority for direction and decision making will not score highly on <b>personal</b> <b>skills,</b> will be unattractive to employers, and has yet to realise his/her potential. <b>Personal</b> <b>skills</b> development will be facilitated by an engineering curriculum that promotes growth in intellectual development. Attention should be paid to the intellectual development of the students throughout the programme to optimise their progression from dualistic to relativistic thinking. Process facilitated student-centred learning can support this growth. Evidence of strong contribution to programme outcomes related to design and <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> should also come from measurements of levels of intellectual development among students...|$|R

We first extract personal connections with similar academic and business background (e. g. co-major, co-university, and co-corporation). We then extract skill connections between skills from the same person. To well integrate various kinds of connections, we propose a joint prediction factor graph (JPFG) model to collectively infer <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> with help of <b>personal</b> connection factor, <b>skill</b> connection fac-tor, besides the normal textual attributes.
