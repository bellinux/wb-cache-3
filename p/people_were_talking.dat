[...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about her in that dress. It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole was like when she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E

50|$|KPIX {{was also}} known for the locally {{produced}} morning <b>talk</b> show, <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>Talking,</b> which began in 1978 with Ann Fraser and Ross MacGowan, and ran until 1991 (the <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>Talking</b> format <b>was</b> also syndicated to other Group W stations during this period). On KPIX, the show pre-empted The Price Is Right for a few years; the game show aired instead on independent stations in the Bay Area such as KOFY-TV (channel 20). At one point, a more celebrity-driven People Are Talking in the Afternoon aired with a small house band. Prior to {{the launch of the}} <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>Talking</b> franchise, Ann Fraser hosted The Morning Show (essentially a half-hour version of People Are Talking), which replaced The Kathryn Crosby Show, another half-hour talk show hosted by Bing Crosby's wife, Kathryn.|$|R

2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E

He allowed Beverley (male) and Harriet to [...] "escape" [...] in 1822 at ages 23 and 21, {{although}} Jefferson was already struggling financially and would be $100,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) in debt at his death. He gave his overseer money to give to Harriet for her journey. Jefferson avoided publicity this way, but the gentry at the time noted the Hemingses' absences; Monticello overseer Edmund Bacon noted in his memoir (published after Jefferson's death) that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about Harriet's departure, saying that she was Jefferson's daughter.|$|E

60|$|There was a moment's silence, {{a silence}} with a {{background}} of strange noises. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> almost shouting to one another with excitement.

60|$|Freddie {{returned}} to the Albany {{in a state of}} gloom and uneasiness. Algy's remarks, coming on top of the Wally Mason episode, had shaken him. The London in which he and Derek moved and had their being is nothing but a village, and it was evident that village gossip was hostile to Derek. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about him.

60|$|Claus {{thought that}} none of the {{children}} would ever know where the toys came from which they found by their bedsides when they wakened the following morning.

60|$|They let him sleep late; {{and he had}} a {{dream of}} himself, which must have been caused by the nascent {{consciousness}} of the going and coming around him. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of him, and one said how old he was; and another looked at his long, white beard which flowed down over the blanket as far as his waist. He told them that he wore it so that they should not know him when he got home; and he showed them how he could take it off and put it on at pleasure. He started awake, and found his carriole driver standing over him.|$|E
