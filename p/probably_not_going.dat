5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made {{significant}} gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of}} the offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E

[...] (United Artists was revamped as a joint venture with Scientologist Tom Cruise, his business associate Paula Wagner, who is chief executive of the company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.) Marina Hyde of The Guardian called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer {{you have to ask yourself}} 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be very good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{exercise}} in fantasy. My task is to imagine what would happen if we simply abolished the institution of the contingent fee by statute. I cannot justify that task on grounds of urgency. Contingent fees are not about to be abolished, and they <b>probably.</b> are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be seriously restricted. My hope is that the exercise will be amusing in itself, and that in the process we might learn something about contingent fees as we now use them...|$|R

5000|$|During live podcasts, {{the format}} will {{typically}} follow a panel-style where the audience asks {{questions to the}} hosts and any special guests they might have featured. On establishing the live podcasts, Marnell stated [...] "Six months ago, Rick Nash approached me about co-hosting a wrestling comedy podcast -a niche market you might say. Here we are 20 episodes later and we are preparing to host our first live episode {{in front of an}} audience.

500|$|For either team {{to play in}} the {{national}} title game, that team had to end up ranked No. 1 or No. 2 {{at the end of the}} regular season. Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998, 9of the 14teams were unbeaten going into the championship game. [...] The only time {{the national}} champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss. [...] Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say [...] "There’ll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if you’re not one of them you’re <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be playing for the championship. So you’ve got to treat every game like it’s the Super Bowl. You only get one opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to be in a position}} to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Cohen, {{the writing}} team's {{approach}} when using pop culture references as an episode's main subject is to modify them into futuristic versions {{to avoid being}} dated, noting that being a science fiction show, [...] "some topics are <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be around {{by the time the}} show airs." [...] In particular, with [...] "Proposition Infinity", they paid specific attention to developing the plot {{in a way that would}} [...] "history-proof" [...] the episode and avoid being over-politicized or [...] "preachy." [...] When taking on [...] "real" [...] social issues in the show, Cohen stated that one of their methods of keeping controversy from overwhelming the episode is to [...] "futurize" [...] issues until the audience is unlikely to have developed a strong opinion one way or another about the presented conflict. [...] This was the method used for [...] "Proposition Infinity", as the team felt that most viewers would not have a strong opinion for or against robot and human intermarriage, thus lightening the potentially polarizing nature of the source material.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{announced}} in 2012 their departure from Rise Records, simultaneous with an announcement {{that they have}} completed ten songs, produced by John Feldmann, for another album, although Wetzel said on his formspring [...] "they're somewhere in Feldmann's hard drive" [...] for they [...] "would be too much work legally to get them released" [...] The band stated that they [...] "don’t have another record label or anything lined up and are <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> planning on <b>going</b> to another one.", also that Wetzel [...] "has his own label now Entertainment and will probably just use that" [...] The band headlined the This World Is Ours Tour with Escape The Fate and the Word Alive.|$|R

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the {{producers}} include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E

500|$|U2 manager Paul McGuinness confessed {{anxiety over}} initial ticket sales taking {{place during the}} late 2000s recession. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "Will we sell it out? Who knows? Will the {{economic}} situation have an impact? <b>Probably.</b> But that's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to stop us." [...] Bono said, [...] "I want to put on an extraordinary show, but I’d like to own my house when it's over." [...] The tour featured a tiered pricing system for tickets; the most expensive ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower. Playing larger capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones. In the US, field level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending on the market, $90–95 and $250. McGuinness said, [...] "We have {{worked very hard to}} ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great-priced ticket with a guaranteed great view." ...|$|R
5000|$|He didn't {{care about}} himself. I hope that {{audience}} would get that {{he cares about}} his son, but that doesn't mean I expected the audience to have sympathy for him. If they believe that he knows he made a mistake, that's good enough. I didn't want the audiences to say, [...] "What an asshole!" [...] I don't know if women in the audience care about Cary Elwes from the first Saw film. I think they still {{thought he was a}} bastard even if he didn't sleep with that woman. His mistake put him in that predicament and in real, if you mess around on your wife, you're <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> to <b>going</b> to end up chained up in the bathroom somewhere with a saw, but you can still make a mess out of things. What I kept zeroing in on with my character and his son is when I talk to my son, I tell him I love him every time I hang up the phone. I say, [...] "I love you," [...] when I drop him off at school, only because I {{want to make sure that}} the last things I say to him is something wonderful. That's one of the things we added to the script. That was one of the best moments for my character, to see what was the last thing he said to his son. When Jigsaw asks him that, that was something I had to have in that scene. If you are a parent, you will probably say to yourself, [...] "That's not good." [...] That's the thing that you have to live with.|$|R
2500|$|Dish {{has been}} sued and countersued dozens of times. In fact, Dish uses {{litigation}} as a profit center.

But you can play in the mud and the dirt, and you’re <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to get a disease either, because you get immune to it.

60|$|Sailors, {{slung over}} the ship's side on {{swinging}} seats, were placidly smearing it with paint at that last moment; the bulwarks were thickly set with the heads and arms of passengers who were making signs to friends on shore, or calling messages {{to them that}} lost themselves in louder noises midway. Some {{of the women in}} the steerage were crying; they were <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to Europe for pleasure like the first-cabin passengers, or even for their health; on the wharf below March saw the face of one young girl twisted with weeping, and he wished he had not seen it. He turned from it, and looked into the eyes of his son, who was laughing at his shoulder. He said that he had to come down with a good-by letter from his sister, which he made an excuse for following them; but he had always meant to see them off, he owned. The letter had just come with a special delivery stamp, and it warned them that she had sent another good-by letter with some flowers on board. Mrs. March scolded at them both, but with tears in her eyes, and in the renewed stress of parting which he thought he had put from him, March went on taking note, as with alien senses, of the scene before him, while they all talked on together, and repeated the nothings they had said already.|$|E

The project also received support from John Thurso, then the MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.
