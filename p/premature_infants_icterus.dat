40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the impact on}} mothers and families of caring for a <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> receiving home oxygen therapy (HOT). METHODS: Standard questionnaires were {{used to compare the}} functioning of mothers and families of 10 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving HOT, 10 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> who were discharged from hospital on HOT but who no longer required it and 20 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> who had never required treatment with HOT. RESULTS: After adjustment for gestational age, chronological age, birthweight and place of residence (urban/rural), the care required by <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving HOT had a significantly greater impact on their families than the care of infants not receiving HOT. Mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving HOT reported significantly less vitality and more mental health problems than mothers of infants not receiving HOT.

40|$|The study explores mothers’ of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> {{experience}} of how health centers especially adapted {{for families with}} <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> can help them to cope with everyday life after discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit. Background: Premature children are at higher risk for {{physical and mental health}} problems, which makes parenting demanding. The transition between hospital and home is a challenging period where parents may need extra support to cope with everyday life. Method: Nine mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> receiving follow-up care at a health center especially adapted for families with <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> were interviewed. Data were analyzed by Kvale and Brinkmann’s guidelines for text analysis. Findings: The study revealed that mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> need to adapt to a daily life with both challenges and joys. Mothers’ sense of coping in everyday life is affected by the public health nurse’s knowledge of and experience with <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Conclusion: Mothers of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> experience a challenging daily life after discharge from neonatal intensive care unit.

40|$|Background: Anthropometric {{indicators}} {{are difficult to}} interpret in very low birth weight (VLBW) <b>premature</b> <b>infants,</b> including both appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Therefore, {{the purpose was to}} describe the anthropometric indicators of growth and nutritional status in VLBW <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> AGA and SGA, hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Study design: The descriptive and prospective study design included 114 preterm infants, adequate for gestational age/small for gestational age hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Head, thigh, mid upper arm circumference, skin-fold measurements and weight/age, length/ age, and weight/length indices were obtained. Correlations were made among the anthropometric indices, and a multivariate regression analysis with weight/age as dependent variable was performed. Results: Weight/age in AGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> had high number of significant anthropometric correlations. The SGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> had few and weak correlations. The regression analysis showed that anthropometric indices better explain changes in the weight/age index in adequate for gestational age <b>premature</b> <b>infants.</b> Conclusion: Weight/age in the VLBW/AGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> could reflect growth, nutritional status and energy stored as fat, but in the VLBW/SGA <b>premature</b> <b>infants,</b> thigh circumference and mid arm circumference would be better indicators just of nutritional status...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the {{morbidity and mortality}} of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> born with oesophageal atresia (OA) and to evaluate historical changes in morbidity and mortality over time. Methods: Retrospective analysis {{of morbidity and mortality}} of all patients admitted for OA, with or without tracheo-oesophageal fistula, between 1982 and 2002. Results: The study group consisted of 197 consecutive patients, of whom 55 (28 %) were premature and 21 (11 %) very premature. Type A atresia was found more often in very <b>premature</b> and <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> than in those born at term (p = 0. 02). Type E atresia was not found in the premature group (p = 0. 004). At least one associated congenital anomaly was also present in 121 patients (61 %). Postoperative complications developed more often in very <b>premature</b> and <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> than in those born at term (p < 0. 001). Gastro-oesophageal reflux was diagnosed in 32 / 76 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> and in 41 / 121 term infants (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Summary Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{frequency}} of extubation failure in <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> using conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) after extubation in groups subjected to nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Method: Seventy-two <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> with respiratory failure were studied, with a gestational age (GA) &# 8804; 36 weeks and birth weight (BW) > 750 g, who required tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The study was controlled and randomized {{in order to ensure}} that the members of the groups used in the research were chosen at random. Randomization was performed at the time of extubation using sealed envelopes. Extubation failure was defined as the need for re-intubation and mechanical ventilation during the first 72 hours after extubation. Results: Among the 36 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> randomized to nIPPV, six (16. 6 %) presented extubation failure in comparison to 11 (30. 5 %) of the 36 <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> randomized to nCPAP. There was no statistical difference between the two study groups regarding BW, GA, classification of the <b>premature</b> <b>infant,</b> and MV time. The main cause of extubation failure was the occurrence of apnea. Gastrointestinal and neurological complications did not occur in the <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> participating in the study. Conclusion: We found that, despite the extubation failure of the group of <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> submitted to nIPPV being numerically smaller than in <b>premature</b> <b>infants</b> submitted to nCPAP, there was no statistically significant difference between the two modes of ventilatory support after extubation...|$|R

40|$|Hypertension is an {{uncommon}} but significant problem in high-risk neonates and infants, and {{the spectrum of}} potential causes is broad. Here, we describe an extremely <b>premature</b> <b>infant</b> (birth weight, 728 g; gestational age, 27 weeks) with multiple complications and hypertension. During admission, umbilical artery catheters were used {{for a period of}} time, and he suffered from respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, pericardial effusion, heart failure, repeated sepsis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, chronic lung disease, and progressive liver damage. He was treated with multiple medications, including erythropoietin, indomethacin, epinephrine, dopamine, aminophylline, multiple antibiotics, amphotericin B, and total parenteral nutrition. Hypertension was first noted when he was 41 days old, with spontaneous remission. It then recurred, reaching higher than 100 mmHg when he was almost 4 months old.
