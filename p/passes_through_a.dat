50|$|Exhaust {{gas from}} each gas turbine <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{individual}} CMI {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG). For Phase 1 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB 50WT hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. For Phase 2 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB WY21 TEWAC (air-water-cooled) turbogenerator. The Phase 1 generator {{is larger than}} Phase 2 so needs to be cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|R
5|$|North of downtown, {{the highway}} <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{residential}} area {{and out of}} the city.

5|$|As NY59 passes Spring Valley High School, {{it enters}} the village limits of Spring Valley. While in Spring Valley, NY59 has an overlap with CR35A for about {{a tenth of a}} mile and meets the Thruway at exit14. The route {{continues}} eastward into Nanuet, where NY59 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> heavy commercialized area. Before its busy intersection with CR33, NY59 passes The Shops at Nanuet to its south and the Rockland Plaza to its north.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E
5|$|CR101's {{southern}} segment {{begins at}} an intersection with Shelter Rock Road (CR8) and Herricks Road near Herricks High School. The route heads eastward as Searingtown Road, passing {{to the south}} of the high school and to the north of a small pond. One block east of Herricks Road, CR101 intersects with Old Searingtown Road, a former alignment of the current CR101 alignment. At this point, the highway curves to the northeast and <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> small area of trees nestled amongst a large, residential area bordering Williston Park. Old Searingtown Road rejoins CR101 at the northern edge of the forested area.|$|E
50|$|The {{first route}} to be {{considered}} was a branch line from Epuni, climbing {{the side of the}} hills in the Hutt Valley, and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel near the present hill road before dropping into the Wainuiomata Valley. The ruling grade would have been about 1:60, and would possibly have required a second short tunnel to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> spur.

50|$|From US 31, SR 18 heads east towards Converse <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{concurrency}} with State Road 19. SR 18 then heads through Converse, after Converse SR 18 has a concurrency with State Road 13. SR 18 turns southeast towards Marion <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> Sweetser. In Marion eastbound SR 18 is on a Fourth Street and westbound SR 18 is on Third Street and Second Street. East of Marion {{the one-way}} streets become a four-lane highway. SR 18 heads east towards Montpelier <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> interchange with I-69 and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 5 and State Road 3. East of Montpelier SR 18 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 1.

5|$|East of the swamp, {{the road}} enters Essa, where it intersects the Sunnidale Road (Simcoe County Road40). From there to Barrie, the highway <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> largely rural area. It intersects former Highway131, now Simcoe County Road27, then enters Barrie at Miller Drive, curving northeast. East of Ferndale Drive, the route crosses Highway400 at Exit96. Shortly thereafter, as it {{approaches}} the waterfront of Kempenfelt Bay, the route ends at High Street in downtown Barrie.|$|E
5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), a connector highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E

Water <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> heat exchanger in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.|$|E
5|$|M-60 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. It {{runs from the}} Niles area at a junction with US Highway 12 (US12) to the Jackson area where it ends at Interstate 94 (I-94). The trunkline <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> mix of farm fields and woodlands, crosses or runs along several rivers and connects several small towns of the southern area of the state. The westernmost segment runs along divided highway while the easternmost section is a full freeway bypass of Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Ticonderoga, NY9N <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> valley before curving to the east and {{entering}} the hamlet of Ticonderoga. For the most part, NY9N bypasses the community as it turns north onto Wicker Street, the westernmost north–south through street in the hamlet. Northwest of the former village's center, NY9N meets NY22 and NY74, the latter of which serves as a northerly bypass of Ticonderoga. NY22 joins NY9N here, following the route out of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Once in Petoskey, US31 intersects the {{northern}} end of US131 (Spring Street) and turns northward along Spring Street through downtown. The highway curves around to follow Mitchell Street to cross the Bear River and then follow Bay View Road. US31 runs along the Little Traverse Bay through the eastern end of Petoskey and into Bay View. From there, it intersects the southern end of M-119 and <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> pair of small towns, Conway and Oden, that border inland lakes like Round Lake and various bays of Crooked Lake.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Lackawanna County, PA106 {{continues on}} a southeastern trend, crossing through homes {{before returning to}} the deep forestry in Greenfield Township. The route continues further, passing through a lumber yard, where it turns southward and further southeastward into the community of Finch Hill. In Finch Hill, PA106 passes Our Mother of Sorrows Cemetery and intersects with PA247 (Lakeland Drive) {{in the center of the}} town. After PA247, PA106 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> small residential district before reaching the Homestead Golf Course. The route passes along the southern side of the golf course and turns eastward after passing to the north of Merli-Sarnoski Park.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
