She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after <b>positive</b> <b>identification.</b> The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for <b>positive</b> <b>identification.</b> The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make <b>positive</b> <b>identification</b> impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and {{the figure of the}} boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming. The system currently used provides <b>positive</b> <b>identification</b> of severe weather systems {{in a brief}} form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) {{signs and}} symptoms of aHUS overlap with those of STEC-HUS. Stool samples from patients with diarrhea or other GI symptoms should be tested for STEC and the presence of Shiga-toxin. However, a <b>positive</b> <b>identification</b> of Shiga-toxin, which is required to diagnose STEC-HUS, does not rule out aHUS. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, a <b>positive</b> <b>identification</b> of Shiga-toxin makes aHUS very unlikely.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., the Daubert Standard {{is a legal}} {{precedent}} set in 1993 by the Supreme Court {{regarding the}} admissibility of expert witness testimony during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that expert testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods. When multiple forensic artists produce approximations for {{the same set of}} skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete. Because of this, forensic facial reconstruction does not uphold the Daubert Standard, is not considered a legally recognized techniques for <b>positive</b> <b>identification,</b> and is not admissible as expert testimony.

40|$|Aim To {{describe}} the organization, field work, forensic anthropological examination, and DNA analysis conducted {{to identify the}} victims from a World War II mass grave found on the Dalmatian island of Daksa near Dubrovnik (Croatia) in 2009. Methods Excavation of the site was performed according to standard archeological procedures. Basic anthropological examination was made to determine the minimum number of victims, sex, age at death, and height. The bones with pathological and traumatic changes were identified. DNA was extracted from powdered bones and relatives’ blood samples. Y-chromosome and autosomal short tandem repeats (STR) were used to establish {{the relationship of the}} remains with the putative family members. Results The remains were found to belong to at least 53 distinctive victims. All were male, mostly with gunshot wounds to the head. DNA analysis and cross-matching of the samples with relatives resulted in 14 <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> using the Y-chromosomal STRs and 4 <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> using the autosomal STRs. Conclusions This study showed that even in cases of more than 50 -year-old, highly degraded human remains from mass graves, Y-chromosomal and autosomal STRs analysis can contribute to identification of the victims...|$|R

40|$|A radiometric {{procedure}} was {{compared with the}} conventional cystine tryptic agar (CTA) sugar fermentation method for identification of Neisseria species. Four different ATCC cultures of Neisseria were identified by both procedures with identical results. The only difference noted was that the radiometric procedure required 3 h for completion, whereas the conventional CTA sugar method required overnight incubation. The radiometric {{procedure was}} also compared with the fluorescent antibody (FA) and CTA methods for identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The organisms examined were gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci isolated from 49 clinical specimens sent to the laboratory for bacteriological analysis. Results obtained by both CTA and FA procedures were comparable. However, the radioisotope method appeared to be superior {{to the other two}} methods in that only one isolate identified as positive by both the CTA and FA methods was not identified radiometrically, whereas four isolates positive by the radiometric method were not identified by the other two procedures. Thus, a total of seven more <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> were made radiometrically than by either of the two other methods. All <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> were confirmed by a reference laboratory. These results indicate that the radiometric procedure is more rapid and reliable as compared with both the CTA and direct FA methods and, thus, may serve as a valuable addition to the methodology available for diagnostic microbiology...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{studies of}} case-parent trios, we define copy number {{variants}} (CNVs) in the offspring {{that differ from}} the parental copy numbers as de novo and of interest for their potential functional role in disease. Among the leading array-based methods for discovery of de novo CNVs in case-parent trios is the joint hidden Markov model (HMM) implemented in the PennCNV software. However, the computational demands of the joint HMM are substantial {{and the extent to}} which false <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> occur in case-parent trios has not been well described. We evaluate these issues in a study of oral cleft case-parent trios. Results: Our analysis of the oral cleft trios reveals that genomic waves represent a substantial source of false <b>positive</b> <b>identifications</b> in the joint HMM, despite a wave-correction implementation in PennCNV. In addition, the noise of low-level summaries of relative copy number (log R ratios) is strongly associated with batch and correlated with the frequency of de novo CNV calls. Exploiting the trio design, we propose a univariate statistic for relative copy number referred to as theminimum distance that can reduce technical variation from probe effects and genomic waves. We use circular binary segmentation to segment the minimum distance and maximum a posteriori estimation to infer de novo CNVs from the segmented genome. Compared to PennCNV on simulated data,MinimumDistance identifies fewer false positives on average and is comparable to PennCNV with respect to false negatives. Genomic wave...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the online localization of sick animals in pig houses. It presents an automated online recognition and localization procedure for sick pig cough sounds. The instantaneous {{energy of the}} signal is initially used to detect and extract individual sounds from a continuous recording and their duration {{is used as a}} pre–classifier. Auto–regression (AR) analysis is then employed to calculate an estimate of the sound signal and the parameters of the estimated signal are subsequently evaluated to identify the sick cough sounds. It is shown that the distribution of just 3 AR parameters provides an ade-quate classifier for sick pig coughs. A localization technique based on the time difference of arrival is evaluated on field data and is shown that it is of acceptable accuracy for this particular application. The algorithm is applied on continuous recordings from a pig house to evaluate its effectiveness. The correct identification ratio ranged from 73 % (27 % false <b>positive</b> <b>identifications)</b> to 93 % (7 % false <b>positive</b> <b>identifications)</b> depending on the position of the microphone that was used for the recording. Although the false negative identifications are about 50 % it is shown that this accuracy can be enough {{for the purpose of this}} tool. Finally, it is suggested that the presented application can be used to online monitor the welfare in a pig house, and provide early diagnosis of a cough hazard and faster treatment of sick animals...|$|R
