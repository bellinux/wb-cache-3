Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E

25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given <b>page,</b> <b>one</b> generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular 22 pages of story, each issue included extra material. Because the opening credit page was a two-page splash across the inside front cover and <b>page</b> <b>one,</b> an additional page needed to be inserted to make the story start on the recto side of the page.

Jess Nevins and Devin Faraci, among others, contributed essays and articles {{at the end of}} each issue about crime and misfortune among actors famous in the 1940s.

The second period of intensification began following the sinking of the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania by a German U-boat on 7 May 1915. The Rhodesia Herald ran an editorial soon after calling on the Company administration to intern all remaining German and Austrian residents and to close their businesses. A town assembly in Umtali sent the administrator a resolution asking him to confiscate all property in the colony owned by subjects of Germany and Austria within 48 hours [...] "in view of German barbarity". Most of Southern Rhodesia's remaining German and Austrian residents were soon sent to the camps in South Africa.|$|E
