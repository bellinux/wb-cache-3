The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class <b>platform</b> on the second floor, much shorter than the first class <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|After its closure in 1917, the bay <b>platform</b> was {{converted}} into rooms for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store rooms, an electrical sub-station and a war-time hostel. Since 1994, the branch's remaining <b>platform</b> at Holborn {{has been used}} to test mock-up designs for new <b>platform</b> signage and advertising systems.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple <b>platform</b> with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main {{sanctuary}} near the <b>platform</b> so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the <b>platform</b> to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the <b>platform</b> itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} <b>platform.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wynyard {{railway station}} <b>platforms</b> are still {{numbered}} from 3 to 6. <b>Platforms</b> 1 and 2 were tram <b>platforms</b> and the railway <b>platforms</b> were never renumbered when the tram <b>platforms</b> were removed.|$|R

5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second <b>platform.</b> A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second <b>platform</b> and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for <b>platform</b> extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new <b>platform</b> at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north <b>platform</b> was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on a second <b>platform</b> and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second <b>platform</b> is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever <b>platform</b> the convention adopted. That <b>platform</b> was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic <b>platform</b> of 1892. Most believed this meant the <b>platform</b> favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 <b>platform</b> favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
50|$|Brno {{railway station}} is combined. It has 4 through <b>platforms</b> with 6 lines and 2 {{terminal}} <b>platforms.</b> In total 6 <b>platforms.</b> Through <b>platforms</b> are 415 and 310 metres long and in ground plan are curved into the letter S. Terminal <b>platforms</b> are straight and 350 metres long. The width of <b>platforms</b> is 9 metres and more. Their covering is simple, historical.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Regional Rail Link, an {{additional}} two <b>platforms</b> were built {{to the north of}} the existing <b>platforms,</b> to separate Metro Trains Sunbury services from V/Line services to Ballarat and Bendigo. In January 2014, <b>Platforms</b> 1 to 4 were renumbered 3 to 6, with the new <b>platforms</b> commissioned as <b>Platforms</b> 1 and 2. At the same time, <b>Platforms</b> 3 and 4 were closed to be rebuilt as dedicated <b>platforms</b> for V/Line services, reopening in July 2014.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new <b>platform</b> face {{on the north side of}} <b>platform</b> 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new <b>platform,</b> <b>platform</b> 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of <b>platform</b> 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. <b>Platform</b> 1 was subsequently redesignated <b>platform</b> 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line <b>platform</b> {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island <b>platform.</b> The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island <b>platform</b> and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island <b>platform.</b> The disused <b>platform</b> is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E
50|$|The station {{consists}} of three elevated island <b>platforms</b> serving six tracks, with the station building located underneath. <b>Platforms</b> 7 and 8 are situated at {{the western end of}} <b>platforms</b> 1 and 2, and <b>platforms</b> 9 and 10 are situated at the western end of <b>platforms</b> 3 and 4 respectively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how quality incentives {{are related to}} the interoperability of competing <b>platforms.</b> <b>Platforms</b> choose whether to operate standardised or exclusively, prior to quality and subsequent price competition. We find that <b>platforms</b> choose a common standard if they can coordinate their quality provision. The actual investment then depends on the cost of quality provision: If rather high, <b>platforms</b> refrain from investment; if rather low, <b>platforms</b> maintain vertically differentiated <b>platforms.</b> The latter case is socially more desirable than exclusivity where <b>platforms</b> do not invest. Nevertheless, quality competition of standardised <b>platforms</b> induces the highest investment and maximum welfare. ...|$|R

50|$|Sydenham station now has side <b>platforms</b> at {{both the}} eastern and western {{extremities}} of the station (<b>platforms</b> 1 and 6 respectively) and two island <b>platforms</b> for the four inner tracks. <b>Platforms</b> 1 and 2 serve the Bankstown Line and <b>Platforms</b> 5 and 6 serve the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line. Prior to the oprning of the Airport line in May 2000, all East Hills line services operated via <b>platforms</b> 3 and 4. Most East Hills trains now run via the Airport line, although some peak hour services continue to travel via Sydenham using these <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Platform</b> E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The <b>platform</b> faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The <b>platform</b> once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The <b>platform</b> itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
5|$|Platforms 3 and 4 {{formed a}} narrow island <b>platform</b> without buildings. <b>Platform</b> 3 {{was used for}} {{terminal}} and reversal trains, as <b>Platform</b> 2. <b>Platform</b> 4 was a loop <b>platform</b> for <b>Platform</b> 5.|$|E
5|$|Platforms 7 and 8 formed another narrow island <b>platform,</b> {{somewhat}} {{shorter than}} the other platforms. <b>Platform</b> 7 was a loop <b>platform</b> for <b>Platform</b> 6. <b>Platform</b> 8 was the northbound East Lancashire through <b>platform.</b>|$|E

5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway <b>platform,</b> Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The <b>platform</b> was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The <b>platform</b> was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the <b>platform.</b> An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the <b>platform.</b> However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{northbound}} <b>platform,</b> {{currently a}} side <b>platform,</b> {{can serve as}} an island <b>platform</b> should passenger service return to the NECR track. The 2010 SCCOG report indicated that Amtrak wished Shore Line East to move its operations to Track 6, freeing the mainline tracks for through trains. In 2013, most Shore Line East trains began using Track 6. Most passengers use the low-level section of the <b>platform</b> south of State Street, but a short metal spur on the high-level <b>platform</b> provides handicapped accessible boarding for trains using the track. A low-level section of the northbound <b>platform</b> also remains north of the high-level section; {{it has not been}} used since the high-level section was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} <b>platform</b> is {{adjacent to}} the station building, and its high-level section requires crossing only a lightly used spur of State Street. However, access to the northbound <b>platform</b> requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. The footbridge to the planned Coast Guard Museum will allow access to the northbound <b>platform</b> without crossing tracks, which will improve safety and prevent passengers from being trapped on the <b>platform</b> by stopped trains.|$|E
