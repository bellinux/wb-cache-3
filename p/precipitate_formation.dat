[...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

30|$|Big {{efforts are}} pooled to obtaining the {{epitaxial}} GeSn films of instrumental quality [8, 9]. One {{of the serious}} problems is the Sn inclusion (<b>precipitates)</b> <b>formation</b> during GeSn layer growth [10, 11]. In addition to precipitation, Sn segregation is observed {{in the process of}} GeSn, GeSiSn layer growth, and GeSn film oxidation [11, 12]. Non-equilibrium growth techniques, such as the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), serve reliable methods of the precipitation and segregation suppression. To reduce the effect of Sn precipitation and segregation, the growth temperature decrease [13] or the deformation inclusion, or the addition of the third element, for example, Si, which reduces the local stress around the Sn atoms, can be performed.|$|R
30|$|The {{dotted lines}} at 1 [*]×[*] 1017 and 2 [*]×[*] 1018  cm- 3 oxygen {{concentrations}} encompass {{a region of}} optimum conditions for TD center generation. Outside of this region, the oxygen concentrations > 2 [*]×[*] 1018  cm- 3 lead to large SiO 2 <b>precipitates</b> <b>formation</b> (due to oxygen supersaturation), while the concentrations < 1 [*]×[*] 1017  cm- 3 are insufficient for TD formation. After the implantation through the 5 -nm screen oxide, the oxygen concentration is optimal in approximately 20 -nm thick region. For 1 -nm screen oxide, such region is only approximately 10 -nm thick. Therefore, at low (25  keV) implantation energy, the distribution of carbon atoms is roughly {{the same as for}} the oxygen recoils, thus stimulating the TD creation.|$|R

The Commissioner of Police, Charles Sutcliffe, ordered investigations to break the culture of corruption and this caused forty-odd Chinese officers to flee Hong Kong with more than HK$80 million cash (about HK$2 million each).Moreover, in 1973, a highly decorated officer, Chief Superintendent Peter Godber, became embroiled in a corruption scandal when Sutcliffe found him to have amassed HK$4.3 million in assets. Godber fled the colony after learning of his intended arrest, prompting a public outcry. These events <b>precipitated</b> <b>formation</b> of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in 1974, which the government gave wide-ranging powers to investigate and bring to justice corrupt elements in Hong Kong society.|$|R

To do this, an alkali first reacts with the unknown salt to produce a precipitate that is the hydroxide of the unknown salt. To identify the cation, the color of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted. Similar processes are often used in sequence - for example, a barium nitrate solution will react with sulfate ions to form a solid barium sulfate precipitate, indicating that it is likely that sulfate ions are present.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasons for}} the cold temperature-induced in vitro {{as well as the}} in vivo {{precipitation}} of the fibrinogen-containing complex is unknown. The fibrinogen involved in <b>precipitate</b> <b>formation</b> appears to have a normal structure. This separates cryofibrinogenemia from two pathological blood-clotting/bleeding diseases that can mimic cryofibrinogenemia but are due to structurally abnormal fibrinogen viz., dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Based on in vitro studies, three causes have been hypothesized for the precipitate formed in cryofibrinogenemia. 1) The blood and plasma of individuals with cryofibrinogenemia lack the fibrinolysis activity that normally degrades and thereby resolubilizes the precipitate. This hypothesis is based on the findings that some but not all individuals with the disorder have abnormally high levels of {{one or two of the}} agents, alpha-1 antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, which inhibit the naturally occurring fibrinolytic agent, plasmin. 2) The blood of individuals has an increased ability of the pro-coagulant thrombin to bind fibrinogen and thereby promote coagulation. 3) The blood of individuals, particularly those with cryofibriognemic disease associated with other severe disorders, has high levels of immunological elements such as immunoglobulins or immune complexes that interact with fibronectin to promote blood clotting. This hypothesis is base on findings that some patients with cyrofibrinogenemic disease improve when treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Further basic research into this area is required.|$|E
