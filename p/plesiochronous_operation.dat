The satellite switch must of course be synchronized with the TDMA burst transmissions of the terminals. This paper addresses this synchronization problem. It considers in particular the problem of achieving <b>plesiochronous</b> <b>operation</b> at the satellite/terrestrial network interface and discusses methods which can be used to accomplish such operation. In particular, two methods of implementation are discussed, the first involving control of an onboard clock by feedback from a cooperating earth station via telemetry and the second involving onboard demodulation of the TDMA frame synchronization burst...|$|E

40|$|The high demanded data {{throughput}} of data communication between {{units in the}} system can be covered by short-haul optical communication and high speed serial data communication. In these data communication schemes, the receiver has to extract the corresponding clock from serial data stream by a clock and data recovery circuit (CDR). Data transceiver nodes have their own local reference clocks for their data transmission and data processing units. The reference clocks are normally slightly different {{even if they are}} specified to have the same frequency. Therefore, the data communication transceivers always work in a <b>plesiochronous</b> condition, an <b>operation</b> with slightly different reference frequencies. The difference of the data rates is covered by an elastic buffer. In a data readout system in the experiment in particle physics, such as a particle detector, the data of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in all detector nodes are transmitted over the networks. The plesiochronous condition in these networks are non-preferable because it causes the difficulty in the time stamping, which is used to indicate the relative time between events. The separated clock distribution network is normally required to overcome this problem. If the existing data communication networks can support the clock distribution function, the system complexity can be largely reduced. The CDRs on all detector nodes have to operate without a local reference clock and provide the recovered clocks, which have sufficiently good quality, for using as the reference timing for their local data processing units. In this thesis, a low jitter clock and data recovery circuit for large synchronous networks is presented. It possesses a 2 -loop topology. They are clock and data recovery loop and clock jitter filter loop. In CDR loop, the CDR with rotational frequency detector is applied to increase its frequency capture range, therefore the operation without local reference clock is possible. Its loop bandwidth can be freely adjusted to meet the specified jitter tolerance. The 1 / 4 -rate time-interleaving architecture is used to reduce the operation frequency and optimize the power consumption. The clock-jitter-filter loop is applied to improve the jitter of the recovered clock. It uses a low jitter LC voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The loop bandwidth of the clock-jitter-filter is minimized to suppress the jitter of the recovered clock. The 1 / 4 -rate CDR with frequency detector and clock-jitter-filter with LC-VCO were implemented in 0. 18 µm CMOS Technology. Both circuits occupy an area of 1. 61 mm 2 and consume 170 mW from 1. 8 V supply. The CDR can cover data rate from 1 to 2 Gb/s. Its loop bandwidth is configurable from 700 kHz to 4 MHz. Its jitter tolerance can comply to SONET standard. The clock-jitter-filter has the configurable input/output frequencies from 9. 191 to 78. 125 MHz. Its loop bandwidth is adjustable from 100 kHz to 3 MHz. The high frequency clock is also available for a serial data transmitter. The CDR with clock-jitter-filter can generate clock with jitter of 4. 2 ps rms from the incoming serial data with inter-symbol-interference jitter of 150 ps peak-to-peak.
