40|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>bones</b> {{represent}} {{a major problem}} for processing and quality of fish products. Development of methods of removal requires better knowledge of the pin bones’ attachment to the muscle and structures involved in the breakdown during loosening. In this study, <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> from cod and salmon were dissected from fish fillets after slaughter or storage on ice for 5 days, and thereafter analysed with molecular methods, which revealed major differences between these species before and after storage. The connective tissue (CT) attaches the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> to the muscle in cod, while the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in salmon are embedded in adipose tissue. Collagens, elastin, lectin-binding proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are all components of the attachment site, and this differ between salmon and cod, resulting in a CT in cod that is more resistant to enzymatic degradation compared to the CT in salmon. Structural differences are reflected in the composition of transcriptome. Microarray analysis comparing the attachment sites of the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> with a reference muscle sample showed limited differences in salmon. In cod, on the other hand, the variances were substantial, and the gene expression profiles suggested difference in myofibre structure, metabolism and cell processes between the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> attachment site and the reference muscle. Degradation of the connective tissue occurs closest to the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> and not in the neighbouring tissue, which was shown using light microscopy. This study shows that the attachment of the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in cod and salmon is different; therefore, the development of methods for removal should be tailored to each individual species...|$|R
40|$|Post mortem {{storage is}} a {{necessary}} process for removal of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> without destruction of fillets, thereby avoiding volume and economic loss. However, the enzymes involved in loosening <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> during storage have not been studied to a great extent. In this study, the activities and localization of MMPs in the connective tissue (CT) of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> dissected from fillet of salmon and cod were investigated. Interestingly, the enzyme activity profile in these two species was different during post mortem storage of fish fillets. Adding MMP inhibitor (GM 6001) and serine protease inhibitor (Pefabloc) revealed different effects in the two species, suggesting different regulations in salmon and cod. In situ zymography with the same inhibitors verified MMP and serine protease activity in CT close to <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> at early post mortem (6 h) in salmon. However, MMP inhibition was not evident in cod in this area at that time point. Immunohistochemistry further revealed MMP 9 and MMP 13 were located more to the outer rim of CT, facing the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> and adipose tissue, while MMP 7 was more randomly distributed within CT in salmon. In contrast, all these three MMPs were randomly distributed in CT in cod. In summary, our study reveals different MMP enzyme profiles in salmon and cod in the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> area, influenced by serine proteases, and suggests that MMPs and serine proteases must be taken in consideration when studying the conditions for early <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> removal...|$|R

The {{data were}} subjected to linkage analysis for the detection and mapping of segregating quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing live weight, average daily gain and body measurements at weaning. Probability coefficients of inheriting allele 1 or 2 from the sire at specific chromosomal intervals were computed. The phenotypic data on progeny were regressed on these probability coefficients in a within-common-parent regression analysis. Fixed effects of sex, parity and season of birth as well as age as a covariate, were fitted in a linear model to the phenotypic data and subsequently analysed using QTL Express by generating an F-statistic through permutation tests at chromosome-wide significance thresholds over 10, 000 iterations at 1 cM intervals. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) segregating QTL for body measurements were detected on BTA 2 for hip width (1 cM) and chest depth (8 cM) in Sire Family 1 and <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3.

The goal with the thesis work is to further develop an existing prototype. In order to achieve the goal a pre-study of the prototype had to be made in order to define a customer demand specification. The thesis work is then continued by a function analysis which differs from a conservative one.  For each sub-function various sub solutions a made. The advantage of this method is that it results in various total solutions which after an evaluation one will be chosen for further development. To examine if the fully developed prototype achieved the given demands a test specification was made. The tests resulted in success, however later in the thesis it is recommended to perform tests on a real prototype to ensure that the given demands are fulfilled. These tests however are not a part of this thesis. The economic sub goal with the thesis was not properly fulfilled, however the remaining goals was fulfilled successfully.   The result of the thesis was an improved prototype, manufacturing documentation of the prototype and a suggestion of material change that could lead to reduced total costs. ...|$|R

40|$|High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can be {{used for}} the {{localized}} heating of biological tissue through the conversion of sound waves into heat. Although originally developed for human medicine, HIFU may also be used to weaken the attachment of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in fish fillets to enable easier removal of such bones. This was shown in the present study, where a series of experiments were performed on HIFU phantoms and fillets of cod and salmon. In thin objects such as fish fillets, the heat is mainly dissipated at the surfaces. However, bones inside the fillet absorb ultrasound energy more efficiently than the surrounding tissue, resulting in a “self-focusing” heating of the bones. Salmon skin was found to effectively block the ultrasound, resulting in a significantly lower heating effect in fillets with skin. Cod skin partly blocked the ultrasound, but only to a small degree, enabling HIFU treatment through the skin. The treatment of fillets to reduce the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> attachment yielded an average reduction in the required pulling force by 50 % in cod fillets with skin, with little muscle denaturation, and 72 % in skinned fillets, with significant muscle denaturation. Salmon fillets were treated from the muscle side of the fillet to circumvent the need for penetration through skin. The treatment resulted in a 30 % reduction in the peak pulling force and 10 % reduction in the total pulling work, with a slight denaturation of the fillet surface...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} section of the present paper, the authors were {{concerned}} with heritability estimates for body measurements, and genetic correlations among these traits in 600 daughter dam pairs sired by 20 different bulls, extracted from the recent files of Japanese Brown Cattle Society. In the second section, they were concerned with the heritability estimate for body weight and relations of body measurements to the body weight, using another data on 170 half sisters sired by 10 different bulls in the same breed. Heritability estimates for body measurements based on daughter dam relationships were 0. 42 for withers height, 0. 48 for hip height, 0. 40 for body length, 0. 39 for heart girth, 0. 30 for chest depth, 0. 25 for chest width, 0. 30 for rump length, 0. 39 for hip width, 0. 30 for thurl width, 0. 21 for <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width, and 0. 36 for fore shin circumference. While, higher and more variable estimates were obtained from half sib relationships. Considering the fact that there might be some uneven environmental conditions among half sister groups, the authors prefered the figures obtained from the daughter dam relationships as the more reliable estimates. Genetic correlations among body measurements, except of <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width, were fairly high. According to the facts, the authors suggested that there may be considerable difficulty to realize the current idea to enlarge body capacity with a restriction of height of withers or hip. Relatively low heritability of 0. 28 was estimated for body weight based on the half sib relationship. On the other hand, in partial correlations between body measurements and body weight, excluding the influence of withers height, the highest figure was obtained between heart girth and body weight. According to the fact, the authors suggested that the most reliable indicators in the body measurements to the selection for gain or weight may be the heart girth or traits related to chest size. 本報の第 1 部において著者らは,日本褐毛和牛登録協会発行の最近の登録簿から, 20 頭の種雄牛による 600 対の娘母牛群を抽出し,体尺測定値の遺伝率およびそれらの遺伝相関を評価した. 第 2 部においては, 10 頭の種雄牛による 170 頭の半姉妹牛群について,体重の遺伝率および体尺測定値と体重の関係について検討した. 娘母の関係から評価した体尺測定値の遺伝率は,体高 0. 42,十字部高 0. 48,体長 0. 40,胸囲 0. 39,胸深 0. 30,胸幅O. 25,尻長O. 30,腰角幅O. 39,寛幅 0. 30,坐骨幅 0. 21,管囲 0. 36 であつた. 一方半姉妹の関係から評価した遺伝率は,これらよりやや高く,さらに不斉一であつた. しかし半姉妹群の環境条件に多少とも斉一でない点があることを考慮して,著者らは娘母の関係から評価した数値を,信頼性が高いものとして採択した. 体尺測定値間の遺伝相関は,坐骨幅を例外とすれば,いずれもかなり高いことが認められた. この事実に墓ついて著者らは,体高を抑制して体積を増大しようとする現在の構想の突現には,かなりの困難が予想されることを示唆した,半姉妹の関係から評価された体重の遺伝率は比較的低く, 0. 28 であつた. 一方体高の影響を除いた体尺測定値と体重との偏相関では,胸囲と体重との間にもつとも高い数値が得られた. そこで著者らは,体重または増体量に関する選抜の指標としては,胸囲または胸部に関する測定値をとるのが妥当であることを示唆した...|$|R
