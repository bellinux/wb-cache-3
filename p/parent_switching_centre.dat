50|$|Throughout the 1960s, 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, Kingsway Trunk <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre</b> (as it became known) was a trunk <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> and {{repeater}} station with Post Office engineering staff totalling over 200 at its peak. Also located on site was the Radio Interference Investigation Group, whose function was to prevent television viewers and radio listeners in north and central London from suffering interference to their service from external {{sources such as}} thermostats, fluorescent tubes and injection moulding equipment. The country's first Radiopaging terminal was also installed on this site in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|It {{originally}} formed one of {{a network}} of 18 Zone <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> within the United Kingdom (UK) telephone system that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant UK subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of manual exchanges, {{outlying}} areas (eventually called dependent exchanges) were connected through progressively larger locations (eventually called group <b>switching</b> <b>centres)</b> into one of the main cities - Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, and Manchester. As automation began to be established in the network, this was refined into a system of approximately fifty tandem locations for Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres,</b> with an additional layer of perhaps a dozen Wide Area Tandems to provide for busy periods, emergency routing, etc. There were also some additional Local Tandems to handle traffic in the London Metropolitan Area without involving the GSCs, although this was a later development, as it required common control signalling for identification.|$|R

50|$|A group <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> (GSC) was a United Kingdom {{telephone}} exchange {{used to provide}} local and trunk routing to local exchanges within its own and if required, adjacent group areas. It formed {{a component of the}} trunk mechanisation hierarchy that was commenced in 1939. The concept of group <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> became important with the introduction in the United Kingdom of subscriber trunk dialling (STD) in 1958, initially from Bristol central {{telephone exchange}}. They were typically located towards the centre of their corresponding group area, usually in a large town or city, and serviced a group of local and dependent telephone exchanges within their home and adjacent group areas. From 1 January 1958, the British network was divided into 639 charging groups. These areas provided the basis for tariff calculations for telephone calls.|$|R
50|$|Another {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} mobile latency is the inter-network handoff; as a customer on Network A calls a Network B customer the call must traverse two separate Radio Access Networks, two core networks and an interlinking Gateway Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre</b> (GMSC) which performs the physical interconnecting {{between the two}} providers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} traffic routing in telephone networks. At present di mens i oni ng and traffi c routi ng are determi ned {{once a year}} {{in order to meet}} some predefi ned grade of servi ce requirements. For technological reasons, i. e. electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>centres,</b> call routing is now defined according to some fixed static procedure. In order to provide protection against important di sturbances, the network has then to be overdimensioned at the planning stage. The emergence of stored program control networks consisting of electronic <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> inter-connected by common channel signalling links is making possible a new strategy- adaptive traffic routing-, which allows real-time reaction to changes of the network state due to overloads or failures. Several adaptive traffic routing algo-ri thms are therefore descri bed and compared on a testbed network in order to improve network performances...|$|R
50|$|The Group <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> (GSC) for the Newport charge {{group was}} the Savoy {{exchange}}.

50|$|Group <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> were {{required}} {{because it was}} not cost effective to have direct circuits between every exchange in the country.

50|$|GSM {{consists}} of two components: the mobile radio telephone and Subscriber Identity Module. GSM is a cellular network, which is a radio network {{made up of a}} number of cells.

40|$|Abstract- When we dial land {{number or}} Mobile number on our phones, {{it gives a}} ring to the person we need to contact, this is {{possible}} by the concept of DUAL TONE – MULTIPLE FREQUENCY (DTMF). The DTMF is a popular signalling method between telephone and <b>switching</b> <b>centres.</b> It is also used for signalling between the telephone network and computer network. DTMF signals are the superposition of two sine waves with different frequencies. In this the key stroke we give is converted to frequency and this sine wave is decode by the decoder and <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> connects our line to the desired destination. In recent days when we call to customer care, instead of person of person computer is able to solve our query,this is possible by programming the sound card of computer with the frequencies generated by phone. This paper mainly deals about dtmf, their working, verification using mat lab and their application...|$|R
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the Strowger step-by-step system as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of International Direct Dialling (IDD), initially referred to as International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) within the UK, Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|R
