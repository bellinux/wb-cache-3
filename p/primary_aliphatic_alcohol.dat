To this end, we introduced the alkane hydroxylation system of Pseudomonas oleovorans into Pseudomonas putida PpS 81 (alcA 81). The resulting recombinant strain PpS 8141 can oxidize n-alkanes to the corresponding 1 -alkanols but is unable to utilize the alkanols, which therefore accumulate in the medium. PpS 8141 was grown in two-liquid-phase bioreactors. The different medium-chain-length alkanes formed a bulk organic phase, which constituted 20 % of the total volume. The aqueous phase contained the growth substrate citrate, octanoate, or pyruvate. PpS 8141 was able to grow well {{in the presence of a}} bulk apolar phase only when pyruvate was used as the growth substrate. Hexane was toxic to this strain and did not allow growth. The strain oxidized C 7 -C- 11 linear alkanes to 1 -alkanols with production rates superior to the wild-type P. oleovorans rates. With n-octane and n-nonane as organic phase and substrate, we found the highest production rates of 1 -alkanol. The growth rate in the exponential phase and the maximal 1 -alkanol production rate showed an inverse relationship, which we interpret to be the result of the metabolic burden of the conversion.

Observations on the {{reproductive}} {{behavior of the}} mite have shown a well-structured spatial allocation of its activity using the bee or cell wall for different behaviors. The resulting advantages for the parasite of this subdivision of the concealed brood environment suggests an important role for chemostimuli in these substrates. Extracts of the European honey bee cocoons induce a strong arrestment response in the mite, as indicated by prolonged periods of walking on the extracts applied on a semipermeable membrane and by systematically returning to the stimulus after encountering the treatment borders. Two thin-layer chromatography fractions of the cocoon extract eliciting arrestment were found to contain saturated C 17 to C 22 <b>primary</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> and C 19 to C 22 aldehydes. We analyzed extracts of the cocoon and different larvae, pupae, and adults of both worker and drone A. mellifera to determine the relative amounts of these chemostimuli in the different substrates employed by Varroa. Both aldehydes and alcohols were more abundant in the cocoon than in the cuticle of adult or developing bees. Mixtures of the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> and aldehydes at the proportions found in the cocoons acted synergistically on the arrestment response, but this activity disappeared when mixed in equal amounts. When these oxygenated chemostimuli were mixed with C 19 to C 25 alkanes at the proportions found in the cocoon extract, we observed a significantly lower threshold for the chemostimulant mixture.

40|$|Tetrazolium-dye-linked alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (TD-ADH) of Amycolatopsis methanolica could be resolved into three protein components, {{which have been}} purified. Each of the components {{has the ability to}} reconstitute TD-ADH activity when combined with the other two. Component I is identical to the previously characterized methanol :N:N'-dimethyl- 4 -nitrosoaniline oxidoreductase (MNO), a decameric protein with 50 -kDa subunits, each carrying a tightly bound NADPH. Component 2 is a high molecular mass (> 640 kDa) protein with subunits of 44 kDa and 72 kDa, and which possesses a low tetrazolium-dye-linked NADH dehydrogenase activity. The protein contains a yellow chromophore of unknown identity. Component 3 is a low molecular mass (15 kDa) protein containing a 5 '-deazaflavin and at least one other low-molecular-mass compound with properties similar, but not identical, to those of nicotinamide coenzymes, The results suggest that alcohol oxidation by the TD-ADH complex is carried out by component 1 (MNO), after which transfer of the reducing equivalents (mediated by component 3) occurs to component 2, which (in vitro) is linked to the tetrazolium dye. Fractionation of A. methanolica extracts showed that most of the 5 '-deazaflavin was present in component 3. Other gram-positive bacteria having a TD-ADH complex also produced 5 '-deazaflavin.

The isolated AOX cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1, 953 bp translating into a polypeptide of 651 amino acids displaying 51 to 53 % identity with other published fungal AOX amino acid sequences. The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of short-chain <b>primary</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> with a preference for methanol (Km = 2. 3 mM, kcat = 15. 6 s− 1). Using polyclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence staining, AOX was localized on liquid culture hyphae and extracellular slime in sections from degraded wood and on cotton fibers. Transmission electron microscopy immunogold labeling localized the enzyme in the hyphal periplasmic space and wall and on extracellular tripartite membranes and slime, while there was no labeling of hyphal peroxisomes. AOX was further shown {{to be associated with}} membranous or slime structures secreted by hyphae in wood fiber lumina and within the secondary cell walls of degraded wood fibers. The differences in AOX targeting compared to the known yeast peroxisomal localization were traced to a unique C-terminal sequence of the G. trabeum oxidase, which is apparently responsible for the protein's different translocation. The extracellular distribution and the enzyme's abundance and preference for methanol, potentially available from the demethylation of lignin, all point to a possible role for AOX as a major source of H 2 O 2, a component of Fenton's reagent implicated in the generally accepted mechanisms for brown rot through the production of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals...|$|R

These studies led to the first example of catalyst based on a hybrid (alkyl) aryl biaryl phosphine ligand that provides better results that its dialkyl- or diarylbiaryl analogues. The C-N coupling was efficient {{for a wide range}} of (hetero) aryl chlorides and bromides under mild conditions. Chapter 2 : This chapter relates the development of the Pd-catalyzed C-O coupling of primary alkyl alcohols. The reaction of <b>primary</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>alcohols</b> bearing [beta]-hydrogen atoms can lead to undesired [beta]-hydride elimination pathways instead of the target reductive elimination from the [LPd(Ar) OAlk] intermediate, especially when using electron-rich aryl halides. Additionally, aryl chlorides have been shown to be more challenging coupling partners than the corresponding aryl bromides. The use of catalysts based on commercially available ligand t-BuBrettPhos and a novel hybrid ligand, AdCyBrettPhos, have allowed the C-O coupling reaction to proceed effectively at room temperature, minimizing the side reaction. A variety of functionalized primary alcohols have been successfully coupled with (hetero) aryl bromides and chlorides giving rise to medicinally interesting products. Chapter 3 : This chapter is a compilation of the applications of Pd-catalyzed C-N coupling in various fields of chemical research since 2008.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{describes an}} aqueous, non-electrolytic, non-toxic, biodegradable, continuous single phase liquid anti-icing or deicing composition {{for use on}} the surfaces of, for example, aircraft, airport pavements, roadways, walkways, bridges, entrances, structures, canals, locks, components, vessels, nautical components, railroad switches, and motor vehicles. The anti-icing or deicing composition comprises: (a) water; (b) a non-toxic freezing point depressant selected from the group consisting of monohydric alcohols having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, polyhydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, monomethyl or ethyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 atoms or mixtures thereof, wherein the freezing point depressant present is between about 14 to 60 percent by weight; (c) a thickener which is present in between about 0. 01 and 10 percent by weight; and (d) optionally a corrosion inhibitor which is present in between about 0. 01 and 0. 1 percent by weight of the total composition. In one embodiment, the deicing composition further includes (e) a monohydric <b>primary</b> <b>aliphatic</b> unbranched <b>alcohol</b> {{as a means of}} forming a thin layer of the composition {{on the surface of the}} structure to be given ice protection, and/or as means of forming a homogenized foam with xanthan thickener; which alcohol is selected from the group consisting of alcohols having between 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably, 1 -dodecanol. Compositions of water, propylene glycol, and/or propanol and xanthan are preferred...|$|R
40|$|Policosanol is {{a mixture}} of higher <b>aliphatic</b> <b>primary</b> <b>alcohols</b> {{isolated}} from sugar cane wax, whose main component is octacosanol. An inhibitory effect of policosanol on platelet aggregation and cerebral ischemia in animal models has been reported. Thus, the objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of policosanol on cerebral ischemia induced by unilateral carotid ligation and bilateral clamping and recirculation in Mongolian gerbils. Policosanol (200 mg/kg) administered immediately after unilateral carotid ligation and at 12 - or 24 -h intervals for 48 h significantly inhibited mortality and clinical symptoms when compared with controls, whereas lower doses (100 mg/kg) were not effective. Control animals showed swelling (tissue vacuolization) and necrosis of neurons in all areas of the brain studied (frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and olfactory tubercle), show-ing a similar injury profile. In the group treated with 200 mg/k...|$|R
40|$|Policosanol, {{a mixture}} of {{long-chain}} <b>aliphatic</b> <b>primary</b> <b>alcohols,</b> {{is used as a}} cholesterol-lowering supplements. The effectiveness of policosanol is still questionable. To determine the lipoprotein-lowering effects of Cuban sugar cane-derived policosanol a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was performed. Sixtyeight primary hypercholesterolemic subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment or to the control group. The first group received sugar cane policosanol 20 mg daily for 8 weeks, while the control group was treated with placebo. All subjects followed a normocaloric diet. The content of policosanol in the supplement tablets was assessed by gas chromatography. A total of 32 subjects in the policosanol group and 31 subjects in the control group completed the study. Body mass index, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels did not change significantly in either group. In conclusion, sugar cane policosano...|$|R
