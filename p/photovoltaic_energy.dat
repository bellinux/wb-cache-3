However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E

2500|$|On August 16, 2006, Iris Ovshinsky, Stan's {{wife and}} partner of almost fifty years, died {{suddenly}} while swimming.

Nasheed was a strong critic of Maumoon’s government and its alleged overspending. [...] On these grounds president Nasheed refused to use Theemuge due to {{the high costs of}} maintaining it as a house of residence and stayed at his own house Yaagoothu’ge for {{the first few months of}} his presidency. However, on February 4, 2009, former president Nasheed moved to Mulee'aage once again declaring it the official residence of the Maldivian President. In 2011, Nasheed installed a solar <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>energy</b> system in the roof of the Mulee'aage with the aim of promoting sustainable energy and sending a global message on climate leadership. After the resignation of Nasheed on February 2012, the palace became vacant.|$|E
