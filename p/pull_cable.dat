New concrete anchorages {{with up to}} 30 ft long anchor rods were built by Cianbro. Crews installed continuous runs of strands on new saddles bolted and welded on new base plates atop cable bents and the main towers. Workers placed two groups of four strands 12 ft above each main cable to allow for pulls. Each strand weighs 4 tons (3.6 metric tons). A rope pull was walked across, connected to a 7/8 in <b>pull</b> <b>cable,</b> then winched back across and connected to the strand, which was fed through a tensioner holding back about 15000 lb to smooth the pull.|$|E

The nozzle is arranged at or in an end of the shaft in such a manner that it is tiltable around at least an axis, which does not coincide with the jet direction of nozzle and which extends through the nozzle. The shaft exhibits a round and/or an oval and/or a quadrangular and/or polygonal cross section and a joint. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The jet spray {{tool for the}} production of a jet of carbon dioxide snow for dry cleaning of tube cavity, comprises a shaft (11), carbon dioxide jet nozzle (13), an inlet line for carbon dioxide, which is attached to the nozzle and which runs along the shaft. The nozzle is arranged at or in an end of the shaft in such a manner that it is tiltable around at least an axis, which does not coincide with the jet direction of nozzle and which extends through the nozzle. The shaft exhibits a round and/or an oval and/or a quadrangular and/or polygonal cross section and a joint. The inlet line runs inside the shaft. A part or the whole length of the inlet line for CO 2 is a capillary. The inlet line is arranged spirally around a straight line defined by a swivel axis of the nozzle. The nozzle is freely tiltable at a level in defined angular region. The nozzle is tiltable over a push <b>pull</b> <b>cable,</b> which runs inside and/or along the shaft, and/or is tiltable over a drive, which is arranged {{at the end of the}} shaft exhibiting the nozzle and/or which is directly connected with the nozzle. The push <b>pull</b> <b>cable</b> is controllable by means of the drive- or supply unit (18) and that the nozzle is controllable by means of a drive. The material discharged by the shaft can be sucked off by means of at least a withdrawal duct. The shaft is rotatable around its axis and also exhibits a compressed gas supply line. Over the inlet line, supercritical CO 2 and/or liquid CO 2 and/or gaseous CO 2 and/or CO 2 -pellets are led to the nozzle. The feeding of the liquid CO 2 and/or gaseous CO 2 and/or CO 2 -pellets takes place under 50 - 400 bar, related to the inlet line. A defined leakage exists between the region of the compressed gas supply line and the suck-off region and/or the withdrawal duct. The leakages are aligned along the surfaces, which are movable relative to one another by movement of the shaft and/or the nozzle, and/or along the sealings. The nozzle is formed as a conical extension of the CO 2 -feed line, is accommodated in a nozzle needle, which is surrounded by a nozzle head, and is surrounded by a reinforcement nozzle connected with the compressed gas supply line for production of a stabilized jet. The shaft exhibits or consists of high-grade steel, other metals, plastics and/or ceramics. A supersonic jet is generatable with the reinforcement nozzle, which is Laval nozzle, which concentrically encloses the CO 2 -nozzle and which is formed as an intermediate space between the nozzle needle and the nozzle head. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for procedure for dry cleaning of tube cavity. USE - For dry cleaning of tube cavity (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Ensures high cleaning efficiency and cleans both particle and film-like contaminants in micrometer range. By a freely tiltable nozzle, a flexible adaptation of the cleaning cycle in the internal contour of the tube cavity is possible, so that an entire surface, dead zone-free cleaning of the tube can be achieved...|$|E
