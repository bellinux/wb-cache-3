2500|$|Evacuation of {{offshore}} oil platforms began {{as early as}} September29. The majority of the 2,000oil workers were evacuated on September30 and October1. Along the United States Gulf Coast, approximately 150,000people evacuated. The U.S. Office of Civil Defense and three companies of the Louisiana National Guard were assigned to areas of the coast expedite the evacuation <b>process.</b> <b>Areas</b> lining Lake Pontchartrain were almost entirely evacuated. Re-purposed boxcars were used to move 3,400evacuees northward from New Orleans and Franklin, Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation order was placed for a [...] section of the coast of St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, with shuttle buses assisting in evacuating refugees to Opelousas, Louisiana. The United States Red Cross transported 10,000cots to evacuation centers in Opelousas to serve the evacuees. Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana were sites of mass exodus with Hilda approaching the coast. Evacuation out of Cameron was disrupted {{by the lack of}} a bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway, and thus had to be conducted via ferry. Heads of cattle were among those evacuating from Cameron Parish in fears of a repeat of Hurricane Audrey, which had killed 35,000cattle. Similarly, all residents of Pecan Island, Louisiana were evacuated. In Grand Isle, Louisiana, approximately 80%of the population evacuated.|$|E

Requirement engineering (RE) activity consists of several activities like requirement elicitation by feasibility studies, requirement analysis, requirement validation and requirement management.

There is {{confusion in the}} minds of software personnel between the requirements management <b>process</b> <b>area</b> in CMMI and manage requirements activity in the requirement engineering. So they don’t consider requirement management <b>process</b> <b>area</b> as development improvement approach, they think that we don’t need anything which requires explicit methods to apply on existing process. Mistake leads to inefficient requirement engineering. The study gives an idea about importance of requirement management while gathering, analyzing and implementing the requirements which are given by the stakeholders. Sometimes stakeholders don’t know about their actual requirements and due to this, misunderstanding takes place which brings dissatisfaction of stakeholders and ultimately results poor reputation of organizations...|$|R

30|$|For {{sequential}} processing, the resistivity increases by electrical processing {{because of}} anodic oxidation. Then, {{it is possible}} to recover the conductivity of the electrically <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> because of removal of the oxide layer by mechanical processing without vibration. The protuberance composed of the oxidation layer processed by the electrical processing can be removed by an appropriate mechanical processing without vibration. The electric resistance of the mechanically <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> can then be increased because of oxidization by additional electrical processing. Repeatable changes of electrical resistance can be performed.|$|R

The distribution of deposited Pt, Ga from the ion beam itself, and C from the precursor gas was obtained at and nearby the deposited areas by micro-RBS spectra and RBS mapping. All of the beam <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> showed a uniform Pt distribution at the deposited areas. The amount of Pt atoms increased {{with the increase in}} ion or electron dose due to the decomposition of precursor gas. The thickness or Pt layer by EB is considerably less than that by FIB due to the reduced deposition rate. Ga atoms from the center of <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> partly redeposited at and nearby the FIB <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> within 3 mu m.
