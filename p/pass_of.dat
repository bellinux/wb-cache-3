After a 21-yard touchdown run on Tennessee's ensuing drive, the Titans entered the final quarter with a three-point lead. The Titans scored two touchdowns in the final quarter, and the Steelers were unable overcome two Roethlisberger fumbles and two interceptions throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Tech quarterback Sean Glennon's first <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the new possession, long throw downfield, {{was intercepted}} by Boston College defender Jamie Silva. The {{length of the}} pass meant that Boston College did not have good field {{position}} following the turnover. After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.|$|E

5|$|The Colts {{kicked a}} 36-yard field {{goal in the}} third quarter to tie the game at 17. A Steelers field goal in the final quarter gave them a three-point lead.

5|$|The Cornhuskers' offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:58 remaining in the third quarter. Nebraska began at its 39-yard line after the kickoff was returned 23 yards. Frost ran four yards, and Benning earned eight yards with two rushes, giving Nebraska a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Frost's first <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the drive fell incomplete, but Benning ran seven yards and Frost completed his second <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the drive for nine yards and another first down, this time to the Tech 33-yard line. Three more rushes created 10 more yards and another first down, but a bigger loss came to the Tech defense when Hokie All-American Cornell Brown was injured. Nebraska's offense inexorably pressed onward, aided by a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, and Nebraska capitalized on a six-yard rush by Benning, giving Nebraska a touchdown with 20 seconds remaining in the quarter. The extra point was good, and Nebraska {{returned to}} a 10-point lead, 3121.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{began the}} second quarter by having Tyler Lorenzen rush the ball for four yards.

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{possession}} of the game began at its 15-yard line after the Florida State kickoff. Hokie quarterback Marcus Vick completed his first <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the game, a nine-yard toss to Eddie Royal, and the Hokies picked up a first down on the next play. From there, however, things began to go downhill for the Virginia Tech offense. Vick was sacked on the next play, running back Cedric Humes was tackled for a five-yard loss, and the Hokies committed a five-yard false start penalty. The miscues prevented Virginia Tech from gaining another first down, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. Florida State recovered the kick at the 50-yard line and began its second offensive {{possession of}} the game. Although Weatherford completed his first <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the drive, both subsequent passes fell incomplete. The Seminoles punted the ball back to Virginia Tech, and the kick rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition against France in April 1792, Schmitt was a staff officer in the main Imperial army in the Austrian Netherlands. He distinguished himself in the defense of the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the Croix-aux-Bois (14 September 1792) and in the battles of Raismes and Vicoigne on (both on May 8, 1793). On 3 September 1793, after his promotion to colonel, he served under Field Marshal Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. In the autumn of 1794, Schmitt organized the retreat of the main Imperial Army, now under the command of Coburg's successor, Feldzeugmeister Count Clerfayt from their untenable positions in the Austrian Netherlands eastward to the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the <b>pass</b> <b>of</b> Thermopylae.|$|E
