We applied a performance evaluation system as an HR practice implemented over the MNC subsidiaries. Our research participants comprised of 903 Asian managers who worked for a leading Japanese multinational strategically expanding retail business markets in Asian locations: Japan, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Thailand. Our key results revealed that both procedural and transparent fairness perceptions of the HR practice significantly influenced job satisfaction of Asian managers as a whole group.

30|$|Considerations {{for future}} {{improvements}} are {{to bring the}} ideal principles into practice by organizing mutual collaborations before, during, and after the course. This will require that innovation organizers, i.e., teacher-researchers, are willing to distribute leadership and relinquish control of their ‘specialist’ functions thereby allowing more or equal participation from other actors in the planning, implementation, and research processes. While this particular project remained within the perspectives of both teacher-researchers and students for construction and assessment of the design, EARTH projects should include perspectives and assessments from every sector participant. The design is an ideal based on principles from two research fields and can potentially take many forms as the variance and quality of innovation performance depends on the actor relations in interactional spaces of knowledge, innovation, and consensus. Therefore, future prospects for supporting, e.g., collaborative leadership (Ranga and Etzkowitz 2013) may require that actors involved in the EARTH design establish mutual Triple Helix spaces that involve both student-centric and collective learning in an open space of knowledge that connects to spaces of innovation and consensus in project collaborations. Such collective and mutual leadership in the organizational field of the Triple Helix may require additional formalization between actors involved in terms of funding, contracts, written <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> of decision-making that allows for both linearity and non-linearity in a stabilized “institutional order” (Benner and Sandström 2000). In this view, the EARTH design may present a methodological step towards further institutionalizing the Triple Helix {{at the level of}} individuals on the basis of action research in innovation and entrepreneurship education.|$|R

First, the paper outlines the norms; then it argues that institutions are not sufficient in themselves to sustain liberty and freedom because new communication technologies (ICTs) impact on e-government and e-justice in ways that are not simply procedural.

40|$|A {{perspective}} is presented {{on the role}} of forest certification in general and concerning small-scale forestry in particular. Certification may be viewed as a tool to communicate with consumers, as a tool to influence forest management or as a game of power and money. Market studies indicate that the end consumers have little interest in certification; the process seems to be more of an issue for some large retailers of wood products. The impact of certification on forest management and thus on the environment has not been studied extensively, and the original objective to stop devastation of tropical forests has so far failed. Certification is a new type of regulation, not based on democratic institutions. Equal treatment, correct <b>procedures</b> for appeal <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> of decision processes are issues of governance yet to be addressed. The market penetration of certification is increasing, but its importance is an open question. One possible scenario is that large retailers and their large suppliers will adopt certification while the large number of smaller forest owners, wood processors and dealers abstain. Small-scale forest owners do well to develop their own standpoint vis-à-vis certification and marketing. Key words: forest certification, market communication, forest management...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{engages in}} the debate about how {{different}} ways of organizing relations between politicians and bureaucrats affect corruption. Research has established robust correlations between the political autonomy of bureaucracy and low corruption, on both national and regional levels, but there are few studies that explore the causal mechanisms linking these two phenomena. We do so by comparing public procurement processes in two similar Spanish cities, interviewing all important actors. We show that relatively independent bureaucrats—so-called trustees—can act as checks to prevent political moral hazard. Yet, in order for this to occur, other institutions must support the trustee, such as a merit-based human resources policy, rules, <b>and</b> standard operating <b>procedures,</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> independent watchdogs. There is thus no silver bullet to defend us against corruption, but having these mechanisms in place makes it much more costly for politicians to opportunistically bend public procurement processes to favour bribe-paying contractors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} evaluation of international ports in Thailand in terms of trade facilitation from the viewpoints of freight forwarders {{through the development of}} trade facilitation indices. The indices in this study are separated into imports and exports and were applied to evaluate seven multi-user ports for existing and future scenarios. Four main components of indices are 1) port infrastructure, 2) port management, 3) customs <b>procedures,</b> <b>and</b> 4) <b>transparency</b> in customs law enforcement. The weights of each main component and subcomponent are calculated by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique on questionnaires collected from 42 freight forwarder companies in Thailand. In the questionnaire, freight forwarders are asked to rank the importance of each component towards trade facilitation as well as to comment existing trade facilitation at each port. The results show that customs procedures are the most important component in trade facilitation and that most ports in Thailand just pass current expectation of freight forwarders and need some improvements to facilitate the future freight demand according to the implementation of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) agreements in late 2015. Subsequently, the indices are further estimated for future scenarios to show the level of trade facilitation if port infrastructure <b>and</b> customs <b>procedures</b> are improved according to the proposed development plans, or if AEC agreements are fully employed. These indices can point out trade facilitation components that would be upgraded and lead to recommendations for port-related stakeholders for better trade facilitation of Thai ports to serve the ASEAN Economic Community...|$|R

40|$|The thesis scrutinizes public {{utilities}} (network industries) with focus on electricity market regulation. In the first part, a public utility is defined, including its economic characteristics {{and need for}} regulation. Within their regulation various models are introduced - in terms of level, voluntary/mandatory, ex ante/ ex post and branch of government. Further, the basic prerequisites for successful regulation are derived from the theory (independence, information capacity and trustworthiness). The second part is concerned only with electrical power industry with its characteristics, business model and regulation (both in the Czech Republic and in the EU). In the third part, an evaluation scorecard is created, which allows us to examine the quality of electricity regulators. The criteria in the scorecard are based on prerequisites (enforcement power, scale of resources, independence, dispute settlement, appeal <b>procedure,</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> consistency) and results (competition support, renewable energy resources and consumer protection).

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of sustainable tourism strategies promoted by National Parks (NP) related stakeholders {{is a key}} concern for NP managers. To help them in their strategic evaluation procedures, {{in this paper we}} propose a methodology based on the Analytic Network Process and a Delphi-type judgment-ensuring procedure. The approach aims at involving stakeholders in a participatory and consensus-building process. The methodology was applied to Los Roques NP in Venezuela. The problem included three sustainable tourism strategies defined by the stakeholders: eco-efficient resorts, eco-friendly leisure activities and ecological transportation systems. Representatives of eight stakeholders participated in the methodology. 13 sustainability criteria were selected. Results provide some important insights into the overall philosophy and underlying participants' conception of what sustainable development of Los Roques NP means. This conception is broadly shared by stakeholders as they coincided in the weights of most of the criteria, which were assigned individually through the questionnaire. It is particularly noteworthy that tourists and environmentalists almost fully match in their assessments of criteria but not of the alternatives. Moreover, there is a great agreement in the final assessment. This suggests that the regular contact among the different stakeholders, i. e. tourists with inhabitants, authorities with environmentalists, tour operators with representatives of the ministry, etc. has led to a common understanding of the opportunities and threats for the NP. They all agreed that the <b>procedure</b> enhances participation <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> it is a necessary source of information and support for their decisions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

When such conditions are relaxed, banks may rely on both liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> in their risk management. However their decisions on liquid-ity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> may be socially suboptimal when banks (1) expect LOLR intervention, (2) believe that other banks take suboptimal liquidity or transparency decisions, (3) anticipate more systemic or more severe liq-uidity shocks. This creates a rationale for the CB to encourage prudent liquidity risk management by banks, on both liquidity <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> dimensions. However, while optimal liquidity can be imposed on banks by regulation, the regulatory lever on transparency choices may be smaller. We show that liquidity requirements may compromise bankstransparency incentives and can thus reduce social welfare, implying important challenges for optimal regulatory design...|$|R
