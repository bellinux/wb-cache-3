40|$|Abstract. Given a {{collection}} of contigs and mate-pairs. The Contig Scaffolding Problem is to order and orientate the given contigs {{in a manner that}} is consistent with as many mate-pairs as possible. This paper describes an efficient heuristic called the greedy-path merging algorithm for solving this problem. The method was originally developed as a key component of the compartmentalized assembly strategy developed at Celera Genomics. This interim approach was used at an early stage of the sequencing of the human genome to produce a preliminary assembly based on preliminary whole genome shotgun data produced at Celera and preliminary human contigs produced by the Human Genome <b>Project.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors: F. 2. 2 [Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity]: Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems—computations on discrete structures; J. 3 [Life and Medica...|$|E
40|$|In British Columbia, Earth Tech, a multi-disciplinary {{consulting}} engineering firm, provides services to four market sectors, water/wastewater, facilities, transportation and environment.

A detailed analysis reveals that Earth Tech’s reputation and brand recognition fall behind those of its competitors. The department suffers from lack of experienced project managers and high rates of staff turnover. These have direct effects on quality of services provided to the clients. The department should concentrate on its internal issues and close the gaps between required and existing capabilities {{to grow in the}} market. The cost-benefit analysis clearly indicates that to concentrate on two niche markets, benchmarking and municipals’ projects would be the best strategy...|$|E
