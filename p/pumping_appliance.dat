50|$|Essex Chief Fire Officer David Johnson {{reported}} that firefighting operations were hindered {{by the fact}} that the blaze was high up in the main structure of the station, which was also heavily smoke-logged.

40|$|Information on the {{existence}} of forest roads as well as their quality is important not only for planning forest management activities, but also for fire management, which includes fire risk assessment and fire suppression. In the case of fire, the level of forest opening-up has a significant influence on the attendance time of fire brigades. Not sufficiently developed road network is often reflected on the elongation of fire-fighting attack and exactingness of shuttle water relay. Therefore, the level of forest opening-up is an important indicator and factor affecting the promptness of fire-fighting activities and further fire spreading, because forest roads also represent a natural barrier against fire. A simple approach to the assessment of the level of forest opening-up has been introduced from the aspect of terrain accessibility for the available mobile fire apparatus with the use of GIS and GNSS technologies. First, the forest road network was mapped using the GNSS technology, and then the information on the quality of particular roads was collected. These data were processed in the ArcGIS 9. 3 environment and as a result the geodatabase was created. It was later used to process the opening-up analysis in IDRISI Taiga environment. The opening-up analysis was performed for the Hrabusice forest management district, located in the karst area of the Slovensky raj National Park and the available mobile fire apparatus â€“ <b>pumping</b> <b>appliance</b> CAS 32 on Tatra 148 chassis and forest special UNIMOG on Mercedes chassis. The objective of the opening-up analysis was to identify the zone where the terrain is accessible for mobile fire apparatus and where fire hose piping is admissible. It was based on computation of the maximum range of fire hose piping (maximum sidelong distance), road spacing and the index of forest opening-up. The results of this analysis are valuable as a support for decision making for foresters dealing with forest protection, road planning and construction, for fire brigades in planning fire attacks, as well as for risk managers and crisis managers...|$|E
5000|$|The New Zealand Fire Service {{operates}} around 850 fire <b>appliances,</b> including conventional <b>pumping</b> <b>appliances</b> and specialist appliances, and 330 support vehicles.

An example is [...] "Newlands 291" [...] - 29 indicates the appliance is resident at Newlands fire station in Wellington, and 1 indicates its function is a pump.|$|R

The set comprises a large cylinder charged with compressed air, linked to a demand valve combined into the face mask, secured with straps around the head. This type of BA set was simpler to use and service and rather than re-cycling the breathed air, discharged it directly to atmosphere, with a typical duration of 45 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} several 999 calls {{were made to the}} London Fire Brigade at 03:32 and {{received}} by the local fire station, A21, Paddington, who were ordered to the scene along with neighboring A22, Manchester Square and G26 Belsize, bringing the first attendance of 4 <b>pumping</b> <b>appliances</b> (2 were <b>pumps</b> - P, 2 were pump escapes - PE carrying the heavy but stable 50 foot (15m) wheeled escape ladders), a 100 ft (30m) turntable ladder - TL (aerial ladder) and an emergency tender - ET (for the breathing apparatus (BA) sets carried; BA wearing was then still a specialist skill).|$|R
5000|$|The final {{attendance}} involved 30 <b>pumping</b> <b>appliances,</b> 3 turntable ladders, 3 emergency tenders {{and other}} specialist vehicles such as hose layers for relaying water long distances, including the nearby Regents Canal at Little Venice.
