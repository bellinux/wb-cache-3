To obtain further information about collecting <b>rock</b> <b>shells,</b> we investigated the effects of environmental hormones on <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> collected from the kumamoto and Fukuoka coastal waters. The <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> with imposex were still found in Kumamoto coastal waters, even though the number of <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> with imposex showed {{a tendency to be}} decreased.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} practice using <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for environmental education. In this practice, the precise distinction of the sex of <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is very important. However, our preceding study demonstrated {{that there are many}} <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> that are difficult to determine the sex. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to obtain information about a suitable period for collection of female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in Kumamoto harbor, by examining the maturity of their ovary. As a result, the maturity of the ovary in female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> was observed during periods from beginning of June to the end of August. In addition, since imposex in female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in the Kumamoto coastal waters was not found, it is likely that the contamination of organotin compounds is improved...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the practice using imposex-exhibiting <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for environmental education. Thus, in the present study, to find the suitable points for collection of the <b>rock</b> <b>shells,</b> we investigated the sexual abnormalities of the <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in Kumamoto harbor. The imposex-exhibiting <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> were found in 9 of 17 harbors investigated. Furthermore, since a high occurrence of imposex {{was found in a}} several harbor of Kumamoto coastal waters, the contamination of organotin compounds may still remain at hazardous levels in the harbors...|$|R

The Kraken have completely dominated Trisk and they also maintain fortresses on Utheraal to collect tribute.|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the practice using <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for environmental education in lower secondary school. Thus, {{in the present study}} we examined if environmental education using <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for the sixth graders of elementary school. As a result, the investigation of <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> was found to be the content that the students are able to experiment with interest. Furthermore, the students appeared to recognize an importance of environmental problem through this practice. Therefore, it is conceivable that the environmental education using <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for the sixth graders of elementary school...|$|R

50|$|No further tribal council ties {{occurred}} on the show until six seasons later in Palau, which had several tie votes. The first two ties were resolved by a re-vote, while the other two had to be resolved by a fire-making duel (the first occurred when the Ulong tribe had only two members left and thus a tie vote was the only possible outcome, and the other occurred with the final four contestants). However, due to Paschal's elimination {{at the hands of}} the <b>purple</b> <b>rock,</b> future castaways that took part in the show between the Marquesas and Palau seasons believed that drawing rocks was the tiebreaker for all situations, including the final four. As a result, many contestants would change alliances late in the game in order to avoid another tie and another chance of drawing the <b>purple</b> <b>rock.</b> For example, in All-Stars, Jenna Lewis voted against her ally Rupert Boneham at the final four to avoid what she thought would be the <b>purple</b> <b>rock</b> tiebreaker.|$|R
