In rare cases, there can be three segments on one episode. Additionally, paternity tests and infidelity were added as topics to the show. As time went on with the paternity and infidelity stories, Wilkos would often <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>with</b> guests just to get laughs from himself, his guests and the audience, since paternity and infidelity aren't as serious an offense as abuse of any kind.|$|R

500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those <b>people</b> <b>make</b> <b>jokes</b> even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|R

While this {{attitude}} sometimes annoys Nate's associates, Nate takes Elena's advice to heart, and values her input above all others, always agreeing with her, as seen against Chloe in Shambhala and even Sully, {{when he wants to}} leave her again. Elena becomes a much better strategist {{over the course of the}} games, and instead of running into situations like she did in the first game, she is more prone to stand back, wait, and strike at the most opportune moment. She also helps Nate plan ways into sneaking into restricted areas and taking out opponents, seen with the Cargo Plane, even showing a higher level of intelligence in this regard compared to Nate, adding more to their combined arsenal.|$|R

40|$|In daily conversation, Javanese {{people tend}} to mix Javanese with Indonesian when they {{communicate}} with other persons. The mixing of Javanese and Indonesian not only happens in the daily communication, but also in Javanese wedding ceremony. There are two problems which the writer wants to answer: what codes are used in Javanese wedding ceremony and what the reasons of Javanese people in using those codes. In answering those two questions, the writer made an observation and interview in order that she could get the data for her study. The data which she got were analyzed based on the underline theories. The theories which were {{used in this study}} is the theory of Language use, Javanese Speech levels, Wedding Ceremony in Javanese, and the previous study. The results of the analysis leads to the findings of the study. Indonesian and Javanese are used in Javanese wedding ceremony. The use of those codes are mixed because Javanese people, especially the young generation of Javanese people do not master Javanese very well. Here are the reasons of using Krama Inggil in Javanese wedding ceremony: 1. 	Krama Inggil which is considred as a sacred language by Javanese people. Since wedding ceremony is a sacred event, Krama Inggil which is considered as the sacred code is used in Javanese wedding ceremony. 2. 	As it a tradition, Krama Inggil is used in Javanese wedding ceremony. 3. 	Krama Inggil is used in Javanese wedding ceremony because the relatives of the bride do not understand Indonesian well. 4. 	Krama Inggil [...] . to the audience since the speaker do not know the listeners very well. That is why, imperative verbs are not used here. 5. 	Krama Inggil is one of the culture of Javanese people. Therefore, {{in order to maintain the}} culture, Krama Inggil is still used in Javanese wedding ceremony. 6. 	Krama Inggil which is used in Javanese wedding ceremony is different from which is used in the daily conversation. In Javanese wedding ceremony the verbs always star with suffix ‘ha’ while in the daily communication the verbs do not start with suffix ‘ha’. 7. 	Krama Inggil is used in Javanese wedding ceremony because the bride and the bridegroom are considered as the king and a quessn in a day, so they make the situation is really like in a Central Javanese Royal Place. 8. 	Krama Inggil is used to describe the symbols which are used in Javanese wedding ceremony. Because, it is also used to utter he proverbs about the bride and the bridegroom. The writer also finds out the other code used in Javanese wedding ceremony. The code is Indonesian. The reasons of using this code are: 1. 	The bride, the bridegroom, and the guests do not understand Krama Inggil well. Therefore, the use of Krama Inggil is mixed with Indonesia. 2. 	Indonesian is used in Javanese wedding ceremony as a means of the translation of Krama Inggil. 3. 	Indonesian is used when the representatives of the bride and the bridegroom advise them. Instead of Krama Inggil and Indonesian which are used in Javanese wedding ceremony, Krama Madya and Ngoo are also used. The reasons why Krama Madya is used in Javanese wedding ceremony more or less are the same as the reasons why Krama Inggil is used in Javanese wedding ceremony. It is because the use of those codes is usually together. While Ngoko is used when the MC <b>makes</b> <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> the couple. Ngoko is used not only when the MC <b>makes</b> <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> the couple, it is also used in other events of Javanese wedding ceremony, for example in the event of injak telur and pangkon. The use of those mentioned codes above is moxed each other. The mixing which may happen is the mixing of Indonesian with Ngoko or Ngoko with Krama Inggil and Krama madya or Krama Inggil and Indonesian. From the explanation above the writer concludes that there are two codes used in Javanese wedding ceremony. They are Javanese and Indonesian Javanese itself has three variants: Krama Inggil, Krama Madya, and Ngoko. The use of those codes are mixed each other depends on the situation and topics which are spoken. Besides, the mixing of those codes has to consider the participants. Since the participants of the Javanese wedding ceremony are young generation of Javanese people, the use of those codes have to be mixed. Thus, this study is expected to be able to enrich the English students about the Javanese culture and happiness. Besides ii is also … language … from age to age along with demands of the needs of the environment and also tell to non-Javanese people that Javanese has three speech levels; Krama Inggil, Krama madya and Ngoko, in which the use of those three speech levels has to consider the participants, the topics and the situation...|$|R

Raknes felt that such subjects were unfit for someone who had set out to do something useful with his life, which he had. When he began to study philology after secondary school, he was hoping that the goals and literature which he would study were going to show him a field where he felt that he had a particular calling. However, as absorbing as many subjects seemed at first, none offered to him the labor which would consume him fully.

5000|$|Another kind of meta-humor is when <b>jokes</b> <b>make</b> fun of poor jokes by {{replacing}} a familiar punchline {{with a serious}} or nonsensical alternative. Such jokes expose the fundamental criterion for joke definition, [...] "funniness", via its deletion. Comedians such as George Carlin and Mitch Hedberg used metahumor of this sort extensively in their routines. Hedberg would often follow up a <b>joke</b> <b>with</b> an admission that it was poorly told, or insist to the audience that [...] "that joke was funnier than you acted." [...] These follow-ups usually get laughs superior {{to those of the}} perceived poor joke and serve to cover an awkward silence. Johnny Carson, especially late in his Tonight Show career, used to get uproarious laughs when reacting to a failed <b>joke</b> <b>with,</b> for example, a pained expression. Immediately following a failed joke about Lincoln's death, for instance, Carson remarked, [...] "A hundred years later, and you still can't do Abraham Lincoln jokes." [...] The latter remark got a better laugh. Similarly, Jon Stewart, when hosting his own television program, used to wring his tie and grimace following an uncomfortable clip or jab. Eddie Izzard often reacts to a failed joke by miming writing on a paper pad and murmuring into the microphone {{something along the lines of}} [...] "must <b>make</b> <b>joke</b> funnier" [...] or [...] "don't use again" [...] while glancing at the audience.|$|R
