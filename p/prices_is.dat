5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E

25|$|The Communication on {{the future}} of the CAP does not mention the cotton sector. Nevertheless, the most trade-distorting {{subsidies}} to cotton production have already been eliminated in the 2004 reform. The current EU cotton production corresponds to 1% of global cotton production and its effect on the evolution of world market <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> therefore negligible. On the other hand, the EU is by far the largest provider of development assistance to cotton. In the framework of the EU-Africa Partnership on Cotton the EU has made available more than €320million. The EU market for cotton is already duty-free and quota-free and there are no export subsidies for cotton.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} food is {{affected}} {{to a certain}} degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.|$|E
25|$|Home {{ownership}} in Sydney was less common than renting {{prior to the}} Second World War but this trend has since reversed. Median house prices have increased {{by an average of}} 8.6% per annum since 1970. The median house price in Sydney in March 2014 was $630,000. The primary cause for rising <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> the increasing cost of land which made up 32% of house prices in 1977 compared to 60% in 2002. 31.6% of dwellings in Sydney are rented, 30.4% are owned outright and 34.8% are owned with a mortgage. 11.8% of mortgagees in 2011 had monthly loan repayments of less than $1,000 and 82.9% had monthly repayments of $1,000 or more. 44.9% of renters for the same period had weekly rent of less than $350 whilst 51.7% had weekly rent of $350 or more.

30|$|The {{export prices}} of five major rice markets {{are used in}} this study which were taken from the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s Global Information Early Warning System (GIEWS) database. The <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> {{measured}} in a common currency, namely monthly FOB export prices in nominal US dollars. The Thai and Vietnamese <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> the five per cent broken rice prices, the American <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the two to four per cent broken price, the Argentinean <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the ten per cent broken price, and the Pakistani <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the twenty five per cent broken <b>price.</b> The <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> therefore seen as representing the higher quality indica grades of rice apart from the Pakistani price. While the higher quality Pakistani <b>price</b> <b>was</b> not available, it is assumed that the higher quality Pakistan price closely follows price movements in the lower quality Pakistani <b>price</b> since this <b>is</b> the case for Thai and Vietnamese rice export prices. The Uruguayan export <b>price</b> <b>is</b> probably a more important rice price for South American markets than the Argentinean <b>price,</b> however, data <b>was</b> only available from 2006 which would have severely cut the available number of observations included in the study therefore the study assumes that Argentinean <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> related to Uruguayan <b>price</b> movements and <b>are</b> therefore suitable for the analysis. Indian export <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> also available; however, due to the Indian government’s policy of temporal rice export bans there are many breaks in the price series therefore Indian <b>prices</b> cannot <b>be</b> included in the study.|$|R
25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements {{had very little}} to do with a normal distribution in which the bulk of the observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by herd behavior) is greater than what conventional wisdom wants us to believe. This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are based on the premise that the probability of extreme variations of asset <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> very low.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} corn {{has been declining}} steadily. Currently, {{the price of one}} bushel of corn is about one dollar less than the cost of growing it. In 2005, Iowa grain {{elevators}} were paying $1.45 per bushel ($57.10 per metric ton), while it was costing the farmer about $2.50/bu ($98/t) to grow it. This is a benefit for everyone except the corn farmer. While commodity prices are falling, the cost of production is rising. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, production costs increased $22 billion in 2007, and they are expected to keep rising this year. Unfortunately, commodity corn farmers have little control over the price they receive for their product. In order for corn farmers to generate any profit, they basically take whatever price they can get for their crop. A working farm needs a particular amount of income to maintain itself, and with falling corn prices the only choice for the corn farmer is to grow and sell more corn. This in turn leads to overproduction and even lower prices. Government policies used to protect corn prices from collapsing by establishing a target price based on the cost of production. Whenever the market price fell below that number, farmers were given the opportunity to take out a loan from the government using the crop as collateral, in turn allowing the farmer to store the grain until the market bounced back. In the mid-1970s this structure was removed and there was no longer an established floor price for a bushel of corn. Instead, subsidies were put in place that would reimburse the farmer for the difference between the market price and a target price. This encouraged corn farmers to grow as much as possible and to sell their crop at any price. Federal payments to corn farmers account for about half of their income, which translates to about 25% of the $19 billion taxpayers pay yearly on farmer’s payments. Contrary to what many people think, the current rise in food <b>prices</b> <b>is</b> doing little if anything to increase profit for the farmer. As retail prices for food increase, the share of the food dollar that returns to the farmer has fallen. Farmers are only seeing a very small fraction (between 2 and 25% depending on the product) of the retail price. The extra cost is instead going towards production, processing, transportation and marketing, which all cost significantly more today than in the past few years. Corn farmers continue to produce an undifferentiated commodity, and the profits are shifting to those who are benefited by overproduction and low crop prices: the companies who process, package and market the final products.|$|E
