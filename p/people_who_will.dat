It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the project brief in PRINCE2.

The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> have to make the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not.

He {{also said that the}} fundraising to help those who are penalized for taking part in the demonstrations should be held in the whole country, not only in Miskolc. The speaker mentioned that police officers informed him on Thursday that he will be held responsible for any atrocities committed in the city by the demonstrators; because of this he organized a committee of five <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> protect the demonstrators from provocators, remove the demonstrators who try to stir up trouble, and will try to prevent attacks against police officers.|$|E

500|$|In February 1930, Marshall {{published}} an essay, [...] {{after it was}} rejected by four magazines. This is now celebrated as a defense of wilderness preservation, and the essay expanded themes developed in his earlier article, [...] "The Wilderness as a Minority Right." [...] Published in The Scientific Monthly, the essay {{is considered one of}} Marshall's most important works. He argued that wilderness was worth saving not only because of its unique aesthetic qualities, but because it could provide visitors with a chance for adventure. Marshall stated: [...] "There is just one hope of repulsing the tyrannical ambition of civilization to conquer every niche on the whole earth. That hope is the organization of spirited <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> fight for the freedom of the wilderness." [...] The article became a much-quoted call to action and by the late 20th century was considered seminal by wilderness historians.|$|E

500|$|Comic book {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{criticized the}} story for using a supernatural element to retcon the marriage and not maturely dealing {{with the issue of}} divorce, arguing the writers had forgotten stories where Spider-Man dealt with his causing the death of Uncle Ben, drugs and child abuse. He wrote, [...] "I expect {{there are people who are}} professional comics writers and editors, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> someday become professional comics writers and editors, who are outraged that Marvel had Spider-Man make a deal with the devil. And these present and future writers and editors will be determined to undo it. We shall see whether it takes twenty years this time, or much less." [...] He found the story better than the Clone Saga in the respect that it altered an aspect of canon, instead of erasing it entirely. He also criticized the idea of a hero making a deal with one as evil as Mephisto, effectively the devil.|$|E
500|$|There is scant but solid {{evidence}} in Egyptian literature and art {{for the practice}} of oral reading of texts to audiences. The oral performance word [...] "to recite" [...] (šdj) was usually associated with biographies, letters, and spells. Singing (ḥsj) was meant for praise songs, love songs, funerary laments, and certain spells. Discourses such as the Prophecy of Neferti suggest that compositions were meant for oral reading among elite gatherings. In the 1st millennium BC Demotic short story cycle centered on the deeds of Petiese, the stories begin with the phrase [...] "The voice which is before Pharaoh", which indicates that an oral speaker and audience was involved in the reading of the text. A fictional audience of high government officials and members of the royal court are mentioned in some texts, but a wider, non-literate audience may have been involved. For example, a funerary stela of Senusret I (r. 1971–1926 BC) explicitly mentions <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> gather and listen to a scribe who [...] "recites" [...] the stela inscriptions out loud.|$|E
500|$|Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy {{explains}} to Kathy {{that he has}} been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> receive her organs; after all, [...] "we all complete".|$|E

500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{was assassinated}} in Memphis the next night. The Memphis Ministers Association {{organized}} {{a memorial service for}} King on the 5th. At the service, the ministers voted to march to Loeb's office that day and insist he address the workers' grievances and end the strike; led by Wax and William Dimmick, the dean of St. Mary's Cathedral, 250 clergymen marched in pairs to Loeb's office, where he was urged in front of television cameras to end the strike. In his sermon at Temple Israel, Wax told the congregation: [...] "This city shall witness a new spirit and the memory of this great prophet of our time shall be honored. There will be bigots and segregationists and the so-called respectable but unrighteous <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> resist. But in the scheme of history, God's will does prevail." [...] The strike was settled on , with the sanitation workers getting union recognition and other benefits. The only remaining impediment was a recommended ten-cent-an-hour raise on , followed by another raise on [...] The city budget did not have the estimated $558,000 (today $) required to pay the workers.

500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God wants you to say". They also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether [...] "people are going to like it". Ultimately, Hall [...] "absorbed" [...] the feedback their first record had received, using it as inspiration. Lifesong focuses mainly on the [...] "truth-can-be-a-tough-pill-to-swallow message" [...] that [...] "there are broken people within arm’s reach of the church, {{and if there is}} any hope of healing, it begins with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> be the hands and feet of Jesus". Hall responded to critics who felt the band's material was [...] "preaching to the choir" [...] by saying [...] "How can writing songs that challenge the church, songs that ask Christians to consider their actions, be a bad thing? After all, it’s the message that matters... Everybody is passionate about what ...|$|E
500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".|$|E
