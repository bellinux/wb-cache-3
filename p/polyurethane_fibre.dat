40|$|A special {{challenge}} for the polyurethane sandwich manufacturing process is that the material properties strongly depend on the manufacturing process. This has {{to be considered in}} the design of such sandwich structures. As part of the work presented, the basic material parameters were determined from sandwich structures produced using the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibre</b> spraying process. Furthermore, the critical failure modes were determined using 3 - nd 4 -point-bending tests. These results can be used to design and simulate such sandwich components with FEM...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work aims {{to develop an}} optimal design using Finite Element (FE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods to replace the traditional concrete and timber material by a Synthetic <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>fibre</b> glass composite material in railway sleepers. The conventional timber railway sleeper technology is associated with several technical problems related to its durability and ability to resist cutting and abrading action of the bearing plate. The use of pre-stress concrete sleeper in railway industry has many disadvantages related to the concrete material behaviour to resist dynamic stress {{that may lead to}} a significant mechanical damage with feasible fissures and cracks. Scientific researchers have recently developed a new composite material such as Glass Fibre Reinforced Polyurethane (GFRP) foam to replace the conventional one. The mechanical properties of these materials are reliable enough to help solving structural problems such as durability, light weight, long life span (50 - 60 years), less water absorption, provide electric insulation, excellent resistance of fatigue and ability to recycle. This paper suggests appropriate sleeper design to reduce the volume of the material. The design optimization shows that the sleeper length is more sensitive to the loading type than the other parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} on a silica gel phase {{has resulted in a}} method for analysis of dimethyl formamide (DMF), methylene bisphenyl isocyanate (MDI) and methylene bisphenyl amine (MDA) in air samples. The above mixture was used in the production of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibres.</b> For sampling purposes, silica gel coated with diethylamine was used. Since isocyanate is highly reactive, it must be rapidly converted into a stable derivative. This was achieved by reaction with diethylamine. After desorption of the mixture, compounds are separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Spectrophotometric detection was used for quantitative determination of the mixture components...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a novel}} woven textile with a fully integrated strain-sensitive yarn for application to the built environment as a structural health monitoring system to monitor and ascertain structural damage in real time. The paper presents {{the context of the}} use of textiles within the construction industry. It also discusses the strength of using designers as lead researchers in applied science projects, in place of engineers and scientists. The sensor, provided by Nanoforce from Queen Mary University of London, consists of thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibres</b> containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes extruded as a yarn. This was woven into multiple fabric samples using varying weaves and mix of yarns. The samples were tested for consistency in stability of the conduction of the data. The most stable samples were rewoven and set within a resin skin to form a composite material that could later be applied to a building structure. In this paper we evaluate our methodology firstly by analysing the data taken from the initial samples to establish stability of the data acquisition and ascertain the best weave pattern and choice of yarns. Secondly by applying the weave to a resin skin to explore a viable composite material that could be applied to a construction joint within the building industry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyurethanes</b> {{and glass}} <b>fibres</b> offer {{nowadays}} very interesting possibilities of their utilization {{related to the}} modification of the basic material. Possible combinations of these materials stem from their specific properties, e. g. acoustical properties, high resistance against mechanical stress, the ability to modify damping of transfer and decrease burning rate. <b>Polyurethanes</b> and glass <b>fibres</b> {{have been used in}} different forms in aviation, automotive industry and engineering. Materials for such application should {{be able to deal with}} moisture, random mechanical shocks, elevated or low temperature, dirt or fungi. Glass component at the polymer surface extends application possibilities. Particular application however demands certain ratio of fibrous or pulverous glass, i. e. density gradient of glass component in the polymer. Each application also calls for specific ratio of both compounds and/or their conditions. Eventually, economical aspect should be considered, as glass reinforced polymers should be available for reasonable price...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the production of}} macroporous monolithic ceramic from mortars prepared using aluminate cements, one or {{two different types of}} alumina powders, superfluidificant, water and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>fibres.</b> Some relevant parameters for the preparation process of the mortar are: (i) the weight ratio between cement powder and water, (ii) the weight ratio between superfluidificant and cement powder and (iii) that between superfluidificant and water. Thirty-six percent is the upper limit for the volumetric content of the fibres that can be introduced into the mortar without leading to a material that breaks up by handling after the successive thermal cycle. We also optimized the thermal cycle that may be used {{in order to avoid the}} spontaneous break-up of the material during the sintering treatment. Materials containing fine and coarse particles of alumina powders exhibit extended ruptures probably dependent on the thermal stresses that grow on cooling after the sintering process, whereas in materials containing only fine alumina powders the presence of ruptures is more limited so that the fired materials have a sufficient strength and can be handled without a particular care. The ageing time at the maximum temperature plays an important role on the microstructure of the sintered material since it has been seen that after 2 h at 1250 degrees C the residual porosity seems to be completely closed and the large grain size shows the presence of structures which can be due to the presence of aluminates.

40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} elastomeric fibres prepared using a wet-spinning {{process are}} promising materials for intelligent textiles, in particular as a strain sensing {{component of the}} fabric. However, these fibres, when reinforced with conducting fillers, typically result in a compromise between mechanical and electrical properties and, ultimately, in the strain sensing functionality. Here we investigate the wet-spinning of <b>polyurethane</b> (PU) <b>fibres</b> {{with a range of}} conducting fillers such as carbon black (CB), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and chemically converted graphene. We show that the electrical and mechanical properties of the composite fibres were strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the filler and the interaction between the filler and the elastomer. The high aspect ratio SWCNT filler resulted in fibres with the highest electrical properties and reinforcement, while the fibres produced from the low aspect ratio CB had the highest stretchability. Furthermore, PU/SWCNT fibres presented the largest sensing range (up to 60 % applied strain) and the most consistent and stable cyclic sensing behaviour. This work provides an understanding of the important factors that influence the production of conductive elastomer fibres by wet-spinning, which can be woven or knitted into textiles for the development of wearable strain sensors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} dynamic thermo-mechanical and impact properties of helical auxetic yarns (HAYs). A series of thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> (TPU) core <b>fibres</b> fabricated using an extrusion process have been wrapped with either ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wrap or stainless steel wire wrap to form helical auxetic yarns.

40|$|AbstractThe {{automated}} high-volume {{production of}} lightweight and intelligent composite parts {{is one of}} the key technologies for the automotive industry. Modern concepts introduce “intelligent” parts by integrating sensor networks into the composite. These networks record different physical signals and can even work as active components. A popular application scenario is the permanent structural health monitoring. This paper presents a novel high-volume production technology that addresses the integration of large piezoceramic sensor and actor elements in glass <b>fibre</b> <b>polyurethane</b> composite parts using the Multi-Fibre-Injection (MFI) spraying technology. By directly integrating the piezo fibres, this technology combines sensor production and part production into one single step. First experiments showed that such piezoceramic sensors are functional. Other experiments demonstrated the successful integration of different electronic components and batteries into composite parts...|$|R
40|$|For serial {{applications}} of intelligent composite structures, large-scale production technologies are required. Glass <b>fibre</b> <b>polyurethane</b> composites (GPC) are particularly {{suitable for the}} fabrication of intelligent lightweight parts with integrated sensor elements. Within the Collaborative Research Center / Transregio 39 "PT-PIESA" a novel Multi-Fibre-Injection (MFI) process based on the highly productive Long- Fibre-Injection (LFI) technology is developed. Piezoceramic and electronic functional elements are embedded in the composite structure to realise a piezoelectric functional element with sensory properties. Thus the previously separate production steps module manufacture and part fabrication are merged into one efficient production process. Theoretical and experimental studies pertaining to the elaboration of scientific and technological basics {{for the production of}} GPC with integrated sensor elements are presented. Manufacture of different piezoceramic components like fibres or pearls and the development of adapted electronic functional elements is introduced. In first processing studies the effects of process related loads on integrated piezoceramic and electronic functional elements are analysed. Therefore several modes of integration as well as different alignments of PZT-fibres and their interaction with the expanding und curing fibre matrix mixture are investigated...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to investigate three packing materials (polyurethane foam, sugar-cane bagasse, and coconut fibre) for biofiltration of a gaseous mixture containing hydrogen sulphide (H(2) S). Mixed cultures were obtained from two sources, aerated submerged biofilters and activated sludge, and were utilised as inoculums. Biofilters reached 100 % removal efficiency after two clays of operation. The empty bed residence time was 495 {{for each of the}} biofilters. The reactors were operated simultaneously, and the inlet concentrations of H(2) S varied between 184 and 644 ppmv during the long-term continuous operation of the biofilters (100 clays). Average removal efficiencies remained above 99. 3 %, taking into consideration the entire period of operation. Average elimination capacities reached by the biofilters packed with <b>polyurethane</b> foam, coconut <b>fibre,</b> and sugarcane bagasse were in the range of 17. 8 - 66. 6; 18. 9 - 68. 8, and 18. 7 - 72. 9 g m(- 3) h(- 1), respectively. Finally, we concluded that the packing materials tested in this work are appropriate for the long-term biofiltration of hydrogen sulphide. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the procedures followed {{to develop an}} optimization method {{for the design of}} a sandwich panel to be used in flooring applications. This sandwich panel is composed of <b>polyurethane</b> foam core, <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer bottom layer and webs, and a fibre reinforced mortar top layer. The possibility of adopting additional internal ribs to increase the flexural and shear stiffness was also considered. The panel was described using a standard stacking sequence, coded as a string, using continuous variables to describe the geometric, economic and environmental parameters, and discrete variables to describe the laminate stack architecture. The optimization procedure was based on a global approach strategy, divided into two steps: (i) firstly, the features of each individual panel solution were assessed by analytical procedures and a fitness was assigned using a ranking function; (ii) secondly, the multi-objective optimization problem was solved by using a genetic algorithm, which performs a random search from generation to generation and keeps the “best individuals”. Penalty criteria were also considered when any panel solution was not satisfying the restrictions and design requirements. Different solutions were obtained by imposing different restrictions to the design of the sandwich panel, namely considering: (i) the length; (ii) the width; and, (iii) the use of one or two types of fibres (carbon and glass). This paper discusses the results obtained, both regarding the performance of the optimization procedure developed and the optimal solutions obtained for each case studied.
