Ryan worked as a teacher at Skorovatn School from 1975 to 1977, after which he studied teaching at Levanger College and Alta College, graduating in 1980. He has also studied history at Bodø College and pedagogy at the University of Trondheim. He then started working as a teacher at Trones School in Namsskogan until 1987, when he was appointed principal. Among his pedagogical methods were starting a local radio station, run by the students, and establishing the zoo Namsskogan Familiepark, with the pupils as minority shareholders, and established a bakery run by the students. He returned as teacher in 1991, but chose {{to apply for the}} job as principal in Alvdal. He was awarded the job, but was elected mayor before starting the job. Ryan was also a board member of Namsskogan Familiepark from 1987 to 1991. He worked as mayor from 1991 to 1995, and from then until 1997 was regional director of the Norwegian <b>Public</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service.</b> In 1996, he applied for the job as chief-of-administration in Tromsø, but failed to get the job. He quit this job in protest against the state's unemployment policies, because he had been instructed to [...] "depopulate Indre Namdal", because the agency policies required people to be moved if they could not get jobs locally. From 1997 to 2001, he was the director of Indre Namdal Regional Council. From 2001 to 2009, Ryan worked as a full-time member of parliament. On 19 December 2008, Ryan was appointed County Governor of Nord-Trøndelag. He started on 1 November 2009, succeeding Oddbjørn Nordset, who had been acting for Inger Lise Gjørv since 2008.

The analysis is based on person-level administrative program records from four of the nine largest states between 1997 and 2003. Evidence suggests that three-quarters of new TANF leavers experience joblessness within three years, and one-quarter of the newly jobless apply for UI benefits. About 87 percent of UI applicants have sufficient prior earnings to qualify for UI benefits; however, only about 44 percent qualify based on their job separation reasons.
