Korean pop music was the first Korean media to enter Hong Kong's market. Since then, several Korean TV series such as Dae Jang Geum have been broadcast to numerous audiences. There are roughly 1,000 students that took Korean courses at the Chinese University of Hong Kong each year, including undergraduates as well as professionals who enrolled in continuing education programs. Roughly 3,000 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the Test of Proficiency in Korean since its introduction to Hong Kong in 2003. Surveys and statistics from course enrollments have shown that nine-tenths of the students studying Korean in Hong Kong are female.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, 2007, the Pacers {{announced}} {{the firing of}} coach Rick Carlisle, with the Pacers' first losing record in ten seasons being {{the main reason for}} the coach's dismissal. Pacers President Larry Bird noted that Carlisle had the opportunity to return to the Pacers franchise in another role. Later, Carlisle opted to leave and took a broadcasting job with ESPN before returning to coach the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 (where he would win a championship in 2011). On May 31, 2007, Jim O'Brien was named Carlisle's successor. O'Brien {{made it clear that he}} intended to take the Pacers back to the playoffs in the 2007â€“08 season, but he didn't, and didn't in his tenure. He also made it known that he favored a more up-tempo, fast-paced style as opposed to Carlisle's slower, more meticulous style of coaching. Many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> note that this style, while exciting at times, failed to produce a winning record and O'Brien's inability to change his style to better suit his talent available has hurt the team.|$|E

500|$|Disability {{advocates and}} others who previewed the film {{reported}} that the offensive treatment of individuals with mental disabilities was woven throughout the film's plot. Disability advocates urged people not to see the film, claiming it is demeaning to individuals with mental disabilities and would encourage bullying. Stiller defended the film, stating [...] "We screened the movie so many times and this didn't come up until very late ...in {{the context of the}} film I think it's really clear, they were making fun of the actors and actors who try to use serious subjects to win awards." [...] Co-writer Etan Cohen echoed Stiller's rationale: [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> this as making fun of handicapped people, but we're really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim." [...] He went on to state that the film lampoons actors who portray mentally retarded/autistic characters such as Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, and Sean Penn in I Am Sam. A DreamWorks spokesman did not directly respond to the criticism, claiming that Tropic Thunder [...] "...is an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses, makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations." [...] The film's advertising was altered, but none of the scenes in the film were edited {{as a result of the}} opposition. In response to the controversy, the director's cut of the DVD (but not the Blu-ray) includes a public service announcement in the special features that discourages use of the word [...] "retard".|$|E

I {{wanted to do something}} that at least people would talk about. Even if they hated it, they'd be talking about it." [...] Commenting on doing such an explicit love scene, Charbonneau said, [...] "Kissing Helen wasn't the hard part, really. The hard part was just walking out on the set naked and just standing there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul now begins {{into the}} main thrust of his letter. He begins by {{suggesting}} that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there will be wrath from God. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> God's invisible image and made him into an idol. Paul draws heavily here from the Wisdom of Solomon. He condemns unnatural sexual behavior and warns that such behavior will result in a depraved body and mind and says that people who do such things (including murder and wickedness [...] ) are worthy of death. Paul stands firmly against the idol worship system which was common in Rome. Several scholars believe the passage is a non-Pauline interpolation.|$|E

2500|$|Orellanine {{first came}} to people's {{attention}} in 1957 {{when there was a}} mass poisoning of 135 people in Bydgoszcz, Poland, which resulted in 19 deaths. Orellanine comes from a class of mushrooms that fall under the genus Cortinarius. Although not all the species in this genus are poisonous/contain orellanine, it was found that Cortinarius orellanus, rubellus, henrici, rainerensis and bruneofulvus contain orellaine. Poisonings pertaining to these mushrooms were predominately in Europe where foraging was a major source of nourishment, although there are cases of orellanine poisoing in North America as well. Orellanine has been found to cause acute renal failure and there are many cases where <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> this mushroom mistaking it for causing hallucinogenic effects.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Malaysia {{launch an}} amnesty {{programme}} with codenamed '6P' {{to reduce the}} number of illegal immigrants. The 'P' stands for six Malay words beginning with the letter which mean; [...] "Pendaftaran" [...] (registration), [...] "Pemutihan" [...] (legalisation), [...] "Pengampunan" [...] (amnesty), [...] "Pemantauan" [...] (supervision), [...] "Penguatkuasaan" [...] (enforcement) and [...] "Pengusiran" [...] (deportation). All illegal immigrants were given three weeks to take up the offer or face the law if they are arrested without any valid travel documents or work permits. However, some irresponsible <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> advantage of the loopholes of its implementation, thus, there is a call to strengthen the programme by monitoring management companies who have been appointed as intermediaries between employers and illegal foreign workers.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur {{reported}} to the Colonial Office secretary in London that the Aboriginal people [...] "already complained that the white <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> possession of their country, encroached upon their hunting grounds, and destroyed their natural food, the kangaroo" [...] and in a memo he proposed settling the Aboriginal people [...] "in some remote quarter of the island, which should be reserved strictly for them, and to supply them with food and clothing, and afford them protection ... on condition of their confining themselves peaceably to certain limits". He said Tasmania's northeast coast was the preferred location for such a reserve and suggested they remain there [...] "until their habits shall become more civilised". He pursued the proposal by issuing on 19 April 1828 a [...] "Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants" [...] that divided the island into two parts to regulate and restrict contact between blacks and whites. The northeast region was an area traditionally visited by many groups for its rich food reserves, and rivers, estuaries and sheltered bays {{as well as its}} mild climate. It was also largely unoccupied by colonists. But the proclamation partitioning the island also provided the first official sanction of the use of force to expel any Aboriginal people from the Settled Districts. Historian James Boyce observed: [...] "Any Aborigine could now be legally killed for doing no more than crossing an unmarked border that the government did not even bother to define." ...|$|E
