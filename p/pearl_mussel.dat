6000|$|Half awake, {{and entirely}} bewildered, Friedel dipped {{his finger in}} the <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> shell of holy water over their bed, and crossed his own brow and his brother's; then, {{carrying}} their shoes, they crossed their mother's chamber, and crept down stairs. Ebbo muttered to his brother, [...] "Stand thou still there, and pray the saints to keep her asleep;" [...] and then, with bare feet, moved noiselessly behind the wooden partition that shut off his grandmother's box-bedstead {{from the rest of}} the hall. She lay asleep with open mouth, snoring loudly, and on her pillow lay the bunch of castle keys, that was always carried to her at night. It was a moment of peril when Ebbo touched it; but he had nerved himself to be both steady and dexterous, and he secured it without a jingle, and then, without entering the hall, descended into a passage lit by a rough opening cut in the rock. Friedel, who began to comprehend, followed him close and joyfully, and at the first door he fitted in, and with some difficulty turned, a key, and pushed open the door of a vault, where morning light, streaming through the grated window, showed two captives, who had started to their feet, and now stood regarding the pair in the doorway as if they thought their dreams were multiplying the young Baron who had led the attack.|$|E

40|$|Growth and {{survival}} of juvenile <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> (Margaritifera margaritifera Linnaeus, 1758) "in-situ" indicates suitable habitats for their rearing and subsequent reintroduction. Six streams in Aš region (Rokytnice, Lužní potok, Pekelský potok, Újezdský potok, Perlový potok, Bockbach) including 15 profiles were evaluated {{throughout the season}} (1. 6. 31. 8. 2015). One year old <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> (n = 580) sized from 700 1400 ?m. Mean survival of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> was 63 % in all streams. Mean absolute growth increment attained 755 ?m throughout the season. Growth of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> (1 +) {{was positively correlated with}} the water temperature (R 2 = 0, 1084). Both the highest survival (70 %) and the highest absolute growth (1027 ?m and 997 ?m) of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> was determined on localities in Bockbach (Bockbach 11 and 1). In contrast to Bockbach 11 and 1 mean survival (28 %) and absolute growth (304 ?m) was the lowest in Lužní potok 2. Survival rate of two years old <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> was higher than that of one year old <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels.</b> Both of these age categories grew similarly...|$|R

50|$|The {{freshwater}} <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel,</b> {{which is}} completely protected in all European countries, {{has been the}} focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts. Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct, the culture of juvenile mussels, and the release of juvenile trout, which have been infected with glochidia, into small rivers, but mainly the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas. Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel,</b> the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel.|$|E

50|$|Afon Eden is a {{tributary}} river than {{runs into}} the Afon Mawddach in Gwynedd, Wales.It is a protected river because {{it is one of}} the few breeding grounds for freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Attached to {{the gills}} of a fish, the glochidia live and grow in this {{oxygen-rich}} environment {{until the following}} May or June, when they drop off. The juvenile must land on clean gravely or sandy substrates {{if it is to}} successfully grow. Attached to the substrate, juvenile freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> typically burrow themselves completely into the sand or gravel, while adults are generally found with a third of their shell exposed. Should they become dislodged, freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> can rebury themselves, and are also capable of moving slowly across sandy sediments, using their large, muscular foot.|$|R

50|$|Clean, fast-flowing {{streams and}} rivers are {{required}} for the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel,</b> where it lives buried or partly buried in fine gravel and coarse sand, generally in water at depths between 0.5 and 2 metres, but sometimes at greater depths. Clean gravel and sand is essential, particularly for juvenile freshwater pearl mussels, for if the stream or river bottom becomes clogged with silt, they cannot obtain oxygen and will die. Also essential {{is the presence of}} a healthy population of salmonids, a group of fish including salmon and trout, on which the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> relies for part of its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} one of the few {{remaining}} sites in the United Kingdom where freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> are found. The Environment Agency has taken land next to the banks of the river to prevent cattle entering the water and silting up the riverbed.|$|R
