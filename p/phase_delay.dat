2500|$|Current {{procedure}} for analysing tides follows {{the method of}} harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by William Thomson. It {{is based on the}} principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of sun and moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality. [...] At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured {{for a period of time}} sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> for each component. [...] Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.|$|E

In mice housed in constant darkness, light pulses applied during early subjective night induced <b>phase</b> <b>delays</b> of {{the rhythm of}} locomotor activity, whereas light pulses applied during late subjective night caused phase advanced. There was an overall reduction of light-induced phase shifts, with a more pronounced effect for delays, in mice pretreated with 500 mg/kg ip 2 -DG compared with mice injected with saline. Administration of glucose with 2 -DG prevented the reduction of light-induced <b>phase</b> <b>delays.</b> Furthermore, <b>phase</b> <b>delays</b> were reduced in fed mice pretreated with 5 IU/kg sc insulin and in fasted mice injected with saline or insulin compared with control fed mice.

40|$|Commercial {{technologies}} for the objective assessment of balance exist in clinical settings. Training requires integration of sensory information {{to produce a}} coordinated motor response related to balance. These systems have had measurable <b>phase</b> <b>delays</b> of up to 250 ms in the visual feedback provided to the patient. This provokes an unnatural response, requiring prediction from the subject. The proposed research investigates the impact of visual feedback <b>phase</b> <b>delays</b> {{on the performance of}} weight shift tracking tasks in a population of individuals with no known balance deficits. Visual feedback delays were investigated by simulating popular balance training software which utilizes force plates to measure center of pressure and display the results in a stimulus and response study. Ten healthy young-adult subjects with no known balance deficits were recruited to participate in this study. Subjects were asked to stand on a pair of force platforms that were linked to a computer. The system was designed to provide visual feedback corresponding to lateral weight shifts. A computer generated target provided a moving stimulus the subjects attempted to match. The stimulus files presented approximately 20 seconds of movement in a periodic (sinusoidal) or non-periodic pattern. Stimulus frequencies ranged between 0. 2 and 1. 0 Hz with amplitude sufficient to require the subject to move safely within 50 % of his/her base of support.
