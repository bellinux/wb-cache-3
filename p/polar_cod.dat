It also eats some molluscs, marine worms, squid, and crustaceans such as amphipods. It consumes [...] of food in a day on average. It is often seen carrying fish in its bill with the tail hanging out.|$|E
50|$|Narwhals have a {{relatively}} restricted and specialized diet. Their prey is predominantly composed of Greenland halibut, <b>polar</b> and Arctic <b>cod,</b> cuttlefish, shrimp and armhook squid. Additional items found in stomachs have included wolffish, capelin, skate eggs and sometimes rocks, accidentally ingested when whales feed near the bottom. Due {{to the lack of}} well-developed dentition in the mouth, narwhals are believed to feed by swimming towards prey until it is within close range and then sucking it with considerable force into the mouth. It is thought that the beaked whales, which have similarly reduced dentition, also suck up their prey.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many {{different}} animals {{that live in}} the sea water near polar regions. Squids are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male sperm whale. There is also a wide variety of fish in the <b>polar</b> regions. Arctic <b>cod</b> is a major species in the Arctic. Halibut, cod, herring, and Alaska pollock (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; {{there is a lot of}} the same kind. Antarctic silverfish and lanternfish are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|Boreogadus saida, {{known as}} the <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> or as the Arctic cod, is a fish of the cod family Gadidae, related to the true cod (genus Gadus). Another fish species for which both the common names Arctic cod and <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> are used is Arctogadus glacialis.|$|E
50|$|Fishes of {{the area}} include Arctic char, Greenland halibut, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> cuttlefish, wolf fish, sea {{scorpion}} and Greenland shark. Aquatic mammals are dominated by seals (ringed, hooded, harbor, bearded and harp seal) which feed on fish in winter (mostly <b>polar</b> <b>cod)</b> and crustaceans in summer. Larger species include Atlantic walrus, narwhal and sometimes beluga whale. Atlantic walrus feeds on mussels, fish and ringed seals that urges ringed seals to disappear from the area when walruses stay there for prolonged periods. Narwhals consume <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> Greenland halibut, cuttlefish and pelegaec crustaceans.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> {{is found}} further north {{than any other}} fish species. It frequents river mouths and feeds on {{plankton}} and krill. It is preyed on by narwhals, belugas, ringed seals and seabirds.|$|E
50|$|The {{food chain}} of the Beaufort Sea is {{relatively}} simple: It starts with phytoplankton and epontic algae (single-cell algae {{associated with the}} lower interface of sea ice), which provide energy to zooplankton, and epontic and coastal amphipods. The latter serve as a food for seabirds and fish, primarily as <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> and Arctic char. <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> is a major food of Arctic char, beluga, narwhal, seabirds and seals, which are dominated by the bearded seal (Erignatus barbatus) and ringed seal (Pusa hispida). Bearded seal and walrus also feed on benthic invertebrates. On top of the food pyramid stands polar bear, which feeds primarily on seals, but also on any large marine mammals when it has a chance, such as carcasses and whales trapped in ice fields.|$|E
50|$|During certain {{points in}} the year there is an inflow of warm, saline water into the Isfjorden, which results in the {{circulation}} of water layers that foster the growth of plankton, which sustains large number of crustaceans. The crustaceans attract fish like the capelin and <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> which in turn draw seabirds and mammals.|$|E
50|$|Arctogadus glacialis, known {{also with}} {{ambiguous}} common names Arctic cod and <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> is an Arctic {{species of fish}} in the cod family Gadidae, related to the true cod (genus Gadus). Arctogadus glacialis is found in icy water. They grow to about 30 cm long, and are favorite food of narwhals and other arctic whales.|$|E
50|$|This fish is most {{commonly}} {{found at the}} water's surface, but is also known to travel at depths greater than 900 m. The <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> is known to frequent river mouths. It is a hardy fish that survives best at temperatures of 0-4°C, but may tolerate colder temperatures owing {{to the presence of}} antifreeze protein compounds in its blood. They group in large schools in ice-free waters.|$|E
50|$|A {{partially}} endemic fauna, comprising mainly gammaridean amphipods, thrive at {{the underside}} of ice floes. Locally and seasonally occurring at several 100 individuals m-2, they are important mediators for particulate organic matter from the sea ice to the water column. Ice-associated and pelagic crustaceans are the major food sources for <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> (Boreogadus saida) that occurs in close association with sea ice and acts as the major link from the ice-related food web to seals and whales.|$|E
50|$|Themisto are {{important}} prey in many food webs. For example, Themisto gaudichaudii reaches high densities (up to 61 individuals/m3) in Kerguelen waters {{and is a}} major food item for blue petrels, thin-billed prions, Antarctic prions, common diving petrels, and southern rockhopper penguins. In the Barents Sea, Themisto libellula is very abundant in the Arctic waters and important food item for cod, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> and marine mammals near the ice edge, whereas Themisto abyssorum is important in Atlantic/boreal waters.|$|E
5000|$|Ringed seals eat a {{wide variety}} of small prey that {{consists}} of 72 species of fish and invertebrates. Feeding is usually a solitary behavior and their prey of choice includes mysids, shrimp, arctic cod, and herring. While feeding, ringed seals dive to depths of 35 to 150 ft. [...] In the summer ringed seals feed along edge of the sea-ice for <b>polar</b> <b>cod.</b> In shallow water they feed on smaller cod. Ringed seals may also eat herring, smelt, whitefish, sculpin, perch, and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|The sea shores and icefields host ringed seals (Phoca hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and {{walruses}} (Odobenus rosmarus) {{along with}} their predator, polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Birds include seagulls, uria and cormorants. Sea waters are often visited by bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros). Major fish species are grayling and Coregonus (whitefishes), such as muksun (Coregonus muksun), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and omul (Coregonus autumnalis). Also common are polar smelt, saffron cod, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> flounder and Arctic char.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 400 plant and tree {{species on the}} bay shores, {{including}} birch, willow, alder and plants adapted to salty soils, as well as lyme grass, mosses, and lichens. These serve as food for caribou and rodents, such as lemming. Resident fish species include <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> Arctic flounder (Pleuronectidae, Liopsetta), four-horned sculpin and capelin, whereas cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and rattail migrate from the Atlantic. The birds are represented by the little auk, snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, Arctic redpoll and guillemots. Most of them migrate to the south during the winter.|$|E
5000|$|In the summer, {{they eat}} more lipids to store as {{fuel for the}} winter. During the mid-winter, they eat copepods, such as Calanus finmarchicus. T. libellula is eaten by cod, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> and mammals at the ice edge. In the early 2000s, the {{population}} of the species began to decrease; these effects rippled through the food chain. The levels have since risen with cooling temperatures, and T. libellula have moved south of the Arctic Circle. They have been observed in [...] "mass mortalities", where millions of T. libellula wash up dead on the coast.|$|E
5000|$|Found {{primarily}} in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialized Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> {{making up the}} remainder of their diet. Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes. In the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to 1,500 m in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. Narwhals, like most toothed whales, communicate with [...] "clicks", [...] "whistles", and [...] "knocks".|$|E
50|$|Due to the North Atlantic drift, the Barents Sea {{has a high}} {{biological}} production compared to other oceans of similar latitude. The spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early close to the ice edge, because the fresh water from the melting ice makes up a stable water layer {{on top of the}} sea water. The phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton such as Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis, Calanus hyperboreus, Oithona spp., and krill. The zooplankton feeders include young cod, capelin, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> whales, and little auk. The capelin is a key food for top predators such as the north-east Arctic cod, harp seals, and seabirds such as common guillemot and Brunnich's guillemot. The fisheries of the Barents Sea, in particular the cod fisheries, are of great importance for both Norway and Russia.|$|E
50|$|The {{common murre}} can venture far from its {{breeding}} grounds to forage; distances of 100 km {{and more are}} often observed though if sufficient food is available closer by, birds only travel much shorter distances. The common murre mainly eats small schooling forage fish 200 mm long or less, such as <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> capelin, sand lances, sprats, sandeels, Atlantic cod and Atlantic herring. Capelin and sand lances are favourite food, but what the main prey is {{at any one time}} depends much on what is available in quantity. It also eats some molluscs, marine worms, squid, and crustaceans such as amphipods. It consumes 20 - 32 g of food in a day on average. It is often seen carrying fish in its bill with the tail hanging out.|$|E
50|$|Narwhals have a {{very intense}} summer feeding society. One study {{published}} in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate. The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979. The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet. A year later, the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed. Arctic cod represented 57%, and Greenland halibut 29% in 1979. The deep-water fish - halibut, redfish (Sebastes marinus), and <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> (Arctogadus glacialis) - are found in the diet of the males, which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than 500 m below sea level. The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages.|$|E
50|$|The sea hosts about 80 {{species of}} zooplankton, more than 70 species of phytoplankton, and nearly 700 species of polychaetes, bryozoans, {{crustaceans}} and mollusks, but their total volume {{is relatively small}} owing to the cold climate. Major fish species include <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> (Boreogadus saida), Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis), saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis), least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis), inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) and flatfish.The {{eastern part of the}} sea is a major habitat of beluga whales with an estimated population of 39,000. This population is stable and might even be increasing; it is not affected by the offshore oil exploration in the area. Belugas spend summer in the coastal area and Mackenzie River delta, which are free of ice then, and in winter migrate log distances to the polynyas of the deep sea. Genetic analyses have confirmed that belugas of the Beaufort Sea are clearly distinct from those of other Canadian and Alaskan waters, despite they often share a common wintering habitat.|$|E
50|$|Permanent mammal species include {{ringed seal}} (Phoca hispida), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), {{collared}} lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus), Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) wolf (Canis lupus), ermine (Mustela erminea), Arctic hare (Lepus timidus) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus), whereas beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) visit the region seasonally. The walrus of the Laptev Sea is sometimes distinguished {{as a separate}} subspecies Odobenus rosmarus laptevi, though this attribution is questioned. There are several dozens species of birds. Some belong to permanent (tundra) species, such as snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima), snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) and brent goose and other make large colonies on the islands and sea shores. The latter include little auk (Alle alle), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), uria, charadriiformes and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus). Amont other bird species are skua, sterna, northern fulmar, (Fulmarus glacialis), ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), Ross's gull (Rhodostethia rosea), long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), eider, loon and willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus). There are 39 fish species, mostly typical of braskish environment; the major ones are grayling and Coregonus (whitefishes), such as muksun (Coregonus muksun), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and omul (Coregonus autumnalis). Also common are sardine, Arctic cisco, Bering cisco, polar smelt, saffron cod, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> flounder and Arctic char and inconnu.|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|E
50|$|More {{than one}} hundred taxa of single-cell pelagic algae have been {{identified}} around the archipelago, the most common being Thalassiosira antarctica and Chaetoceros decipiens. The bloom takes place between May and August. Of the roughly fifty species of zooplankton, calanoids dominate, with Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus constituting the greater portion of the biomass. On the sea bottom there are 34 species of macroalgae and at least 500 species of macrofauna. Most common are crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimps, polychaetes and echinoderms, such as sea bristles. The ice scouring causes there to be little life in the littoral zone, but the sublittoral zone (2 to 25 m) is dominated by laminaria, most commonly Laminaria sachcharina, and red algae, such as Phycodrys rubens.There are 33 species of fish in the waters, none of which are abundant or commercially exploitable. The most common are <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> which reach lengths of 20 cm, and liparidae. There are no endemic species within the archipelago.

40|$|In 1970, 1971 and 1972 cruises were {{conducted}} in the Barents Sea during May and June. The main aim was to find fishable concentrations of <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> and to guide the Norwegian vessels fishing for this species. In 1970 only a small area, between 74 º 00 ' N and 75 º 40 ' N and 44 ° 00 ' E and 47 ° 10 ' E was investigated. Fairly dense concentrations of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> were found over most of this area.

40|$|Climate {{change in}} polar regions will likely disrupt the {{fine-tuned}} trophic interactions among organisms in Arctic marine ecosystems. Modifications in prey phenology and composition {{as well as}} increased competition and predation from boreal species expanding their range northward are expected to affect the key Arctic fish species <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> (Boreogadus saida) and thus have important repercussions on the Arctic marine food web. Aside from climate, the extreme seasonal light variations at high latitudes are important for phenology and foraging. Endemic Arctic organisms such as <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> may be adapted to these drastic light variations whereas, non-endemic species may be confronted with {{a new set of}} environmental variables that could limit their northward range expansion {{in the context of a}} warming Arctic climate. In order to assess the ability of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> to cope with future changes in marine Arctic ecosystems, it remains important to understand their dietary plasticity. The main goal of this study was to investigate the flexibility of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> feeding strategies across seasons by documenting its temporal position on the generalist-specialist spectrum. <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> were harvested on the western and northern coast of Svalbard in September, October, January, and May in fjords influenced by Arctic water masses and fjords influenced by Atlantic water masses. The organisms’ stomach contents were extracted and analysed and prey species were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Specimens were expected to experience marked seasonal variability in their feeding success and foraging strategy. <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> feeding success was observed to be seasonally heterogenous, with winter specimens dispalying a higher probability of having empty stomachs compared to specimens from the fall or the spring. Seasonality affected <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> diet in terms of ingested prey composition with fall specimen from Arctic domains feeding primarily on the hyperiid amphipod Themisto libellula. This suggests that larger demersal <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> ascended in the water column in the fall to forage on this pelagic prey. The important contribution of fish prey throughout sites in the winter highlighted a flexible size-biased diet and the potential ability to switch diet to a temporarily abundant resource. <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> adopted a population specialist strategy in the fall and an individual specialist strategy in the winter. Therefore, the opportunistic feeding strategy adopted by <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> is affected by seasonality insofar as diet is limited to a few preferred prey in the fall and diversified during the polar night likely as a results of visual constraints on selectivity of preferred prey...|$|E
40|$|In the Arctic Ocean, sea ice {{habitats}} {{are undergoing}} rapid environmental change. Because sea ice constitutes an important habitat for numerous species, {{these changes have}} a significant impact on ecosystem functioning, species distribution, and population sizes. In the Arctic Ocean, <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> is an ecological key species known to be associated with the underside of pack-ice. In spite of numerous studies in coastal shelf habitats, the under-ice distribution of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> in the Central Arctic Ocean has received little attention in the past. During 2012, we sampled <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> and other under-ice fauna with a novel under-ice trawl for the first time, covering large parts of the Eurasian deep-sea basins of the Arctic Ocean. To model the relationship of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> with sea ice habitat properties, we used a bio-environmental sensor array during under-ice fishing. The parameters measured included sea ice thickness, roughness and spectral light transmission of sea ice. The sensors enabled a real-time characterization of sea ice habitat properties over large (1 - 5 km) distances. Statistical modeling techniques (GLMs, GAMs) were used to model the association of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> with these habitat properties. We will present the progress of our group in linking biological and physical sea ice data as a tool to understand, and ultimately predict, ecological responses to a rapidly changing Arctic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} trophic {{responses of}} <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> Boreogadus saida (a key species in Arctic food webs) {{to changes in}} zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities (prey), we compared its stomach contents and body condition between three regions with different environments: the northern Bering Sea (NB), southern Chukchi Sea (SC), and central Chukchi Sea (CC). <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> were sampled using a bottom trawl, and their potential prey species in the environment were sampled using a plankton net and a surface sediment sampler. <b>Polar</b> <b>cod</b> fed mainly on appendicularians in the NB and SC where copepods were the most abundant in the environment, while they fed on copepods, euphausiids, and gammarids in the CC where barnacle larvae were the most abundant species in plankton samples on average. The stomach fullness index of <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> was higher in the NB and SC than CC, while their body condition index did not differ between these regions. The lower lipid content of appendicularians compared to other prey species is the most plausible explanation for this inconsistency...|$|E
40|$|The {{stock of}} <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> in the Barents Sea is quite large, {{probably}} between 1. 5 and 2 million tonnes. This resource {{has not been}} exploited to any noticeable degree since the early 1970 s. The distribution area {{and the size of}} the stock are mapped by acoustic methods during an annual ecosystem survey in autumn. It is not clear whether <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> found further north and east belong to the Barents Sea stock, which seems to spawn in two separate areas; east of the Spitsbergen archipelago and in the southeastern regions of the Barents Sea. The <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> plays an important ecological role in the area. It feeds on zooplankton and is eaten by other fish, seals, whales and birds...|$|E
40|$|Cod Gadus morhua are {{important}} predators in many ecosystems in the North Atlantic, but their ecological importance has diminished {{in many areas}} due to stock size reductions. In contrast, the Barents Sea cod stock is currently the world’s largest and at a high level. The goal of our study was to elucidate spatial aspects of cod−prey interactions in the Barents Sea during recent warm years (2004 to 2009). We used data on cod and prey distributions and cod diet collected during the Barents Sea ecosystem survey. Local prey use, feeding success, spatial displacement and spatial overlap between cod (> 2 yr) and prey (capelin, herring, <b>polar</b> <b>cod,</b> shrimp and macrozooplankton) were analysed. While prey species were found in spatially segregated habitats, cod were widely distributed, except the deepest parts of the Barents Sea where shrimps prevailed. Local diet reflected local prey availability. Cod abundance was higher in areas occupied by capelin and herring and lower in the northeastern areas occupied by <b>polar</b> <b>cod.</b> Feeding success increased with the local abundance of capelin and <b>polar</b> <b>cod.</b> Capelin were a targeted prey, and cod fed efficiently on capelin in the areas where they overlapped. Herring overlapped with cod, but feeding success did not increase with herring abundance, suggesting that herring might escape predation. Although feeding success increased with local <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> abundance, <b>polar</b> <b>cod</b> had a spatial refuge in the northeastern part, which cod did not enter. Our analyses imply that the cod were spatially constrained and that their prey differed in suitability...|$|E
