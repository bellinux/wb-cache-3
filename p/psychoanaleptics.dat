30|$|Today a {{wide range}} of {{evidence}} exists regarding the association of polypharmacia and the risk of falls. According to a meta analysis by Woolcott et al. (2009), the medication groups of psycholeptics, <b>psychoanaleptics,</b> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antihypertensives drugs increase the risk of falls. The influence of fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDS) on falls or fall-related injuries of elderly persons has been examined in a variety of studies including hip fractures (Guo et al. 1998), or focused on therapeutic groups such as psychotropic agents (Pierfitte et al. 2001; Thapa et al. 1995, 1998; Ziere et al. 2008; Milos et al. 2014). Other studies have criticized these results and state that fall-related injuries could also be caused by morbidity (Bauer et al. 2012). In addition extensive research was conducted into the field of disabilities and fall-related chronic diseases (Dunn et al. 1992; Gabbe et al. 2013; Haagsma et al. 2011; Pilotto et al. 2012; Stenhagen et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} draws the {{attention}} to the many species of plants possessing activity on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in fact, they cover the whole spectrum of central activity such as <b>psychoanaleptic,</b> psycholeptic and psychodysleptic effects, and several of these plants are currently used in therapeutics to treat human ailments. Among the <b>psychoanaleptic</b> (stimulant) plants, those utilized by human beings to reduce body weight [Ephedra spp (Ma Huang), Paullinia spp (guarana), Catha edulis Forssk (khat) ] and plants used to improve general health conditions (plant adaptogens) were scrutinized. Many species of hallucinogenic (psychodysleptic) plants are used by humans throughout the world to achieve states of mind distortions; among those, a few have been used for therapeutic purposes, such as Cannabis sativa L., Tabernanthe iboga Baill and the mixture of Psychotria viridis Ruiz and Pav and Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C. V Morton Plants showing central psycholeptic activities, such as analgesic or anxiolytic actions (Passiflora incarnata L., Valeriana spp and Piper methysticum G Forst.), were also analysed. Finally, the use of crude or semipurified extracts of such plants instead of the active substances seemingly responsible for their therapeutic effect is discussed.

50|$|Some of amphetamine's {{substituted}} derivatives {{occur in}} nature, {{for example in}} the leaves of Ephedra and khat plants. These have been used since antiquity (at least 1000 years ago) for their pharmacological effects. Amphetamine was first produced {{at the end of}} the 19th century. By the 1930s, amphetamine and some of its derivative compounds found use as decongestants in the symptomatic treatment of colds and also occasionally as psychoactive agents. Their effects on the central nervous system are diverse, but can be summarized by three overlapping types of activity: <b>psychoanaleptic,</b> hallucinogenic and empathogenic. Various substituted amphetamines may cause these actions either separately or in combination.|$|R
30|$|According to a {{meta-analysis}} antihypertensives (C 02), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (M 01 A), hypnotics and sedatives (N 05 C), antidepressants (N 06 A), psycholeptics and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> combination (N 06 C) were named as FRIDS (Woolcott et al. 2009). Diagnoses coded by ICD- 10 as injury or poisoning (S 00 - T 14) {{were regarded as}} falls. Excluded were diagnoses relating to bites from animals, injuries caused by knives or burns and sequelae of injuries (war). A fall was defined as recurrent falls, if different ICD- 10 codes were recorded or the same ICD- 10 code was recorded after {{three quarters of a}} year (274  days), to avoid counting duplicated events with long lasting recovery. A possible connection between the intake of FRIDS and a diagnosis of fall was assumed if the diagnosis was made within one month after the prescription, with the consideration that the patient would be prescribed FRIDs for an acute disease.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{drug use}} in pregnancy, and compare drug use of pregnant women with non-pregnant women with respect to possible teratogenicity. Study design: A cross-sectional study based on pharmacy records from 1997 to 2001 was performed. Pregnant women and matched non-pregnant women (same physician and age) were identified. Prescriptions were set against the Australian risk classification. Results: Thirty-five percent of all prescriptions for non-pregnant women were safe in pregnancy (Australian classification A), in 14 % the risk was unknown (B 1, B 2), 49 % were potentially harmful drugs (B 3, C, D, X), and in 3 % no classification was available. For pregnant women these figures were 86, 3, 10 and 2 %, respectively. In non-pregnant women the highest percentages of prescriptions for unsafe drugs were for psycholeptics (99 % not classified as safe), <b>psychoanaleptics</b> (100 %), anti-inflammatory/antirheumetic products (100 %), antihistamines (94 %), antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (81 %), antiepileptics (100 %), beta-blockers (100 %), systemic antimycotics (100 %), antiprotozoals (97 %), diuretics (100 %) and immunosuppressives (100 %). In pregnant women this pattern was comparable, except for antihistamines (22 %) and antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (3 %). Conclusion: We conclude that many drugs used by non-pregnant women should be avoided in pregnancy, and that pregnant women indeed do so. However, for some drug groups the available safe alternatives are limited. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods: Cluster analysis using a data-driven recursive partitioning algorithm was employed using baseline data from two pooled one-year randomized exacerbation trials (n= 3, 255) of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol or vilanterol alone to identify distinct patient groups at greatest risk of pneumonia or serious (hospitalization or death) pneumonia. Results: Five clusters were identified. Patients at greater risk of first pneumonia had more severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity < 46 %) and either a body mass index < 19 kg/m 2 (hazard ratio 7. 8, 95 % confidence interval 4. 7 – 13. 0; n= 144) or a pneumonia history and greater comorbidities (hazard ratio 4. 8, 95 % confidence interval 3. 0 – 7. 7; n= 374) relative to the cluster with the lowest pneumonia risk (reference; n= 1310). Multiple comorbidities and use of <b>psychoanaleptics</b> also contributed to an increased risk of pneumonia in more obstructed patients. Independent of cluster, use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with pneumonia (hazard ratio 1. 89, 95 % confidence interval 1. 25 – 2. 84) and serious pneumonia (hazard ratio 2. 92, 95 % confidence interval 1. 40 – 6. 01). Conclusion: Cluster analysis can identify patient populations at risk for serious safety outcomes and inform risk management strategies to optimize patient management. The greatest risk for pneumonia was in subjects with multiple pneumonia risk factors.

40|$|The fatal {{toxicity}} index (FTI) {{is the absolute}} number of fatal poisonings caused by a particular drug divided by its consumption figure. Consequently, it is a useful measure in evaluating toxicity of the drug and its relevance in fatal poisonings. In this study, we assessed the FTI of medicinal drugs in 3 years (2005, 2009, and 2013) in Finland. As the measure of drug consumption, we used the number of defined daily doses (DDD) per population in each year. There were 70 medicinal drugs in Finland for which the mean FTI expressed {{as the number of}} deaths per million DDD over the three study years was higher or equal to 0. 1. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system was used for the classification of the active ingredients of medicinal drugs according to the organ or system which they act on. Of these 70 drugs, 55 drugs (78. 6 %) acted on the nervous system (denoted by ATC code N), 11 (15. 7 %) on the cardiovascular system (C), three (4. 3 %) on the alimentary tract and metabolism (A), and one (1. 4 %) on the musculoskeletal system (M). The nervous system drugs consisted of 20 psycholeptics, (ATC code N 05), 20 <b>psychoanaleptics</b> (N 06), eight analgesics (N 02), six antiepileptics (N 03), and one other nervous system drug (N 07). The highest individual FTIs were associated with the opioids methadone, dextropropoxyphene, oxycodone, tramadol, and morphine; the antipsychotics levomepromazine and chlorprothixene; and the antidepressants doxepin, amitriptyline, trimipramine, and bupropion. Buprenorphine {{was not included in the}} study, because most of the fatal buprenorphine poisonings were due to smuggled tablets. A clearly increasing trend in FTI was observed with pregabalin and possibly with bupropion, both drugs emerging as abused substances...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{pharmacological}} treatment of hospitalized older patients represents {{a challenge for}} prescribing physicians. In particular, hospitalized older adults are usually 'frail' and present with acute diseases, which may require multiple treatments and increase their susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Patterns of medication use among in-hospital patients have rarely been investigated. Objective: to describe patterns of medication used among hospitalized older adults in Italy participating to the CRiteria to assess Appropriate Medication use among Elderly complex patients (CRIME) project. Methods: we performed a cross-sectional multicentre study {{based on data from}} the CRIME project, a study performed in geriatric and internal medicine acute care wards of 7 Italian hospitals. The only two exclusion criteria were: age < 65 years old and unwillingness to participate to the study. Participants were assessed at hospital admission and followed until discharge. Results: mean (Standard Deviation) age of 1123 participants was 81. 5 (7. 4) years, women were 629 (56 %) and 572 participants (51 %) were admitted from Emergency Room. Mean length of stay was 11. 2 (6. 7) days. Mean number of drugs used greatly varied before (6. 2, SD 3. 2), during (10. 6, SD 5. 6) and after (7. 1, SD 3. 1) hospitalization. No difference in the number of drugs used during stay was observed across age groups. During hospital stay, drugs for acid related disorders (77. 9 %) and antithrombotic agents (76. 8 %) were the most commonly used drugs, followed by agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (58. 0 %) and diuretics (57. 1 %). Very common was the use of psycholeptics (34. 3 %) and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> (22. 4 %). Conclusion: Use of multiple drug treatments is common in hospitalized older adults and hospitalization is associated with a substantial increment in the number of drugs used, with no differences across age groups. Understanding patterns of drug use may be useful to design and implement effective drug utilization programs aimed to influence prescribing attitudes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies showed}} a {{bidirectional}} association between {{type 2 diabetes}} and psychiatric disorders in adults. There is limited information available about the association of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) and psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Objectives: To assess the extent of psychiatric medication use {{before and after the}} onset of T 1 D in children and adolescents compared with a reference cohort without T 1 D. Methods: A population-based cohort study was conducted in the Dutch PHARMO Record Linkage System. All children and adolescents < 19 years) with at least two insulin dispensings between 1999 and 2009 were identified as a T 1 D cohort (N= 925) and matched with an up to four times larger diabetes-free reference cohort (N= 3591) by age and sex. The period prevalences of psychiatric medication use (psycholeptics (ATC N 05) and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> (ATC N 06)) were calculated by dividing the number of patients with at least one dispensing by the number of patients available in the cohort during that time. Prevalences were calculated from 5 years before until 5 years after the onset of T 1 D (the index date in both cohorts) and stratified by age, sex, medication subgroup, and before/after the onset of T 1 D. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 10. 1 years and 51 % were boys. The 5 -year prevalence of psychiatric medication use before the index date was significantly higher in the T 1 D cohort than in the reference cohort (7. 2 vs. 4. 7 %, respectively, p= 0. 002). The same pattern was observed for the period after developing T 1 D (10. 4 vs. 7. 9 % in the T 1 D and reference cohort respectively, p= 0. 015). In both cohorts adolescents (15 - 19 years) and boys had higher prevalences of psychiatric medication use. This increased prevalence of psychiatric medication use {{both before and after the}} index date in T 1 D cohort was mainly driven by an increased use of psycholeptics (mainly anxiolytics). Conclusions: Children with T 1 D were more likely to use psychiatric medication in the years before and after the onset of type 1 diabetes. This increased use was mainly driven by psycholeptics both before and after onset of T 1 D...|$|E
40|$|Dose {{adjustment}} of psychotropic drugs {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis may be important as most of these drugs are predominantly eliminated by the liver {{and many of them}} are associated with dose-dependent adverse reactions. As no surrogate parameter is available to predict hepatic metabolism of drugs, dose adjustment according to pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs is proposed. Psychotropic drugs (antiepileptics, antiparkinsonian drugs, psycholeptics such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sedatives and hypnosedatives, and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> such as antidepressants, psychostimulants and antidementia drugs) marketed in Switzerland in 2006 were therefore classified according to their hepatic extraction and/or bioavailability to predict their kinetic behaviour in patients with cirrhosis. The expected changes in hepatic metabolism predicted by pharmacokinetic properties were compared with the results from kinetic studies carried out in patients with liver disease. These studies were identified using MEDLINE searches. Of the 116 psychotropic drugs available on the Swiss market by the year 2006, only 12 were predominantly eliminated through the kidney. For five substances, no Q(0) value (the dose fraction metabolized or excreted extra-renally) could be determined because of lack of pharmacokinetic data. Of 99 drugs with predominant hepatic metabolism, 29. 3 % were categorized as high, 25. 2 % as intermediate and 38. 4 % as low extraction drugs, while seven substances could not be classified. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with liver disease were available for 55 of these 99 drugs eliminated predominantly by the liver (Q(0) -value < or = 0. 5). Only a few kinetic studies in patients with liver disease were found for antipsychotics, antiparkinsonian drugs and antidepressants, except for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and some newer antidepressants. The expected changes in pharmacokinetics were generally in good agreement with the changes reported in pharmacokinetic studies. For 12 drugs, the observed changes in pharmacokinetics from clinical studies were different from the changes expected based on their classification. However, for low extraction drugs metabolized by cytochrome P 450 isozymes, clearance may be reduced by up to 50 %. In conclusion, the classification of drugs according to their hepatic extraction and/or bioavailability is a useful tool for dose adjustment, if information from clinical studies is lacking. There is a gap in information about pharmacokinetic changes in patients with liver cirrhosis for a large number of centrally acting drugs. Kinetic studies for centrally acting drugs with predominant hepatic metabolism should be carried out in patients with liver disease to allow precise dose recommendations for enhanced patient safety...|$|E
40|$|The lack of Croatian {{studies which}} could {{determine}} the justifiability of excessive psychopharmaceutical utilization was an encouragement to conduct this research. Furthermore, regarding the conduction of this study, {{it would be}} possible to determine whether the trend of drug utilization has increased, decreased or perhaps stabilized. The data on the outpatient utilization of psycholeptics and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> were collected from all Zagreb pharmacies, 2006 - 2009. Based on the collected data for all N 05 and N 06 groups of drugs, the defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per thousand inhabitants per day (DDD/TID) have been calculated using the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical classification (ATC) for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. To indicate the quality of drug prescription the Drug Utilization 90 % (DU 90 %) method was used. Moreover, in order to determine a more precise quality of individual drug group prescriptions, the indicators have been calculated by determining the proportion of the total utilization of individual therapeutic and pharmacological therapeutic subgroups in DDD/TID a day. The utilization of anxiolytics (N 05 B) accounts for most of the psycholeptic utilization in the City of Zagreb throughout the entire study period. In the study period, the utilization of antidepressants has slightly increased, by 10. 5 %, taking the first and the last years of the period into account. In 2006, 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 5 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin) were found in the DU 90 % segment. In 2009, the DU 90 % segment also comprised 5 benzodiazepines and the hypnotic zolpidem, as well as 6 SSRIs and 1 third generation antipsychotic (olanzapin). In the City of Zagreb, a general insight into the quality of psychopharmaceutical prescriptions indicates stability in comparison to earlier studies. The ratio index of the first generation antipsychotic utilization, compared to the third generation antipsychotics, shows an increase in the quality of prescription. Also, the ratio index of total tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and SSRI utilization indicates improvement in quality of prescription. The ratio index of the entire outpatient utilization of anxiolytics and antidepressants expressed in DDD/TID unfortunately shows a very mild increase of prescription quality. Benzodiazepines accounted for more than 50 % of the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals throughout the study period, which proves the need for precise guidelines as the most significant means of drug rationalization and utilization. It is necessary to identify priorities and problems in order to solve them successfully, by monitoring drug utilization and prescription on a national level. Results demonstrate that within the primary health care system, there is a need for constant education on rational prescription of this drug group...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Medication {{errors are}} widely {{reported}} for hospitalised patients, but limited {{data are available}} for medication errors that occur in community-based and clinical settings. Epidemiological data from poisons information centres enable characterisation of trends in medication errors occurring across the healthcare spectrum. AIM: The objective {{of this study was}} to characterise the epidemiology and type of medication errors reported to the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC) of Ireland. METHODS: A 3 -year prospective study on medication errors reported to the NPIC was conducted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 inclusive. Data on patient demographics, enquiry source, location, pharmaceutical agent(s), type of medication error, and treatment advice were collated from standardised call report forms. Medication errors were categorised as (i) prescribing error (i. e. physician error), (ii) dispensing error (i. e. pharmacy error), and (iii) administration error involving the wrong medication, the wrong dose, wrong route, or the wrong time. RESULTS: Medication errors were reported for 2348 individuals, representing 9. 56 % of total enquiries to the NPIC over 3 years. In total, 1220 children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 1128 adults (>/= 18 years old) experienced a medication error. The majority of enquiries were received from healthcare professionals, but members of the public accounted for 31. 3 % (n = 736) of enquiries. Most medication errors occurred in a domestic setting (n = 2135), but a small number occurred in healthcare facilities: nursing homes (n = 110, 4. 68 %), hospitals (n = 53, 2. 26 %), and general practitioner surgeries (n = 32, 1. 36 %). In children, medication errors with non-prescription pharmaceuticals predominated (n = 722) and anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, anti-bacterials, and cough and cold preparations were the main pharmaceutical classes involved. Medication errors with prescription medication predominated for adults (n = 866) and the major medication classes included anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, <b>psychoanaleptics,</b> and psychleptic agents. Approximately 97 % (n = 2279) of medication errors were as a result of drug administration errors (comprising a double dose [n = 1040], wrong dose [n = 395], wrong medication [n = 597], wrong route [n = 133], and wrong time [n = 110]). Prescribing and dispensing errors accounted for 0. 68 % (n = 16) and 2. 26 % (n = 53) of errors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Empirical data from poisons information centres facilitate the characterisation of medication errors occurring in the community and across the healthcare spectrum. Poison centre data facilitate the detection of subtle trends in medication errors and can contribute to pharmacovigilance. Collaboration between pharmaceutical manufacturers, consumers, medical, and regulatory communities is needed to advance patient safety and reduce medication errors...|$|E
40|$|Prevalence {{of vitamin}} B 12 {{deficiency}} {{is very common}} in elderly people and can reach values as high as 40. 5 % of the population. It can {{be the result of}} the interaction among several factors. Vitamin B 12 deficiencies have been associated with neurological, cognitive deterioration, haematological abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases that have an important influence on the health of the elderly and their quality of life. It is necessary to approach the problems arisen from the lack of data relative to them. The main objective of this thesis was to analyse the evolution of vitamin B 12 status and related parameters, lipid and haematological profiles and their relationship to health risk factors, and to functional and cognitive status over one year and to determine the effect of an oral supplementation of 500 μg of cyanocobalamin {{for a short period of}} 28 days. An additional objective was to analyze the possible effects of medicine intakes on vitamin B status. Three studies were performed: a) a one year longitudinal follow-up with four measure points; b) an intervention study providing an oral liquid supplement of 500 μg of cyanocobalamin for a 28 days period; and c) analysis of the possible effect of medication intake on vitamin B status using the ATC classification of medicines. The participants for these studies were recruited from nursing homes for the elderly in the Region of Madrid. Sixty elders (mean age 84 _ 7 y, 19 men and 41 women) were recruited for Study I and 64 elders (mean age 82 _ 7 y, 24 men and 40 women) for Study II. For Study III, baseline data from the initially recruited participants of the first two studies were used. An informed consent was obtained from all participants or their mentors. The studies were approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Granada. Blood samples were obtained at each examination date and were analyzed for serum cobalamin, holoTC, serum and RBC folate and total homocysteine according to laboratory standard procedures. The haematological parameters analyzed were haematocrit, haemoglobin and MCV. For the lipid profile TG, total cholesterol, LDL- and HDLcholesterol were analyzed. Anthropometric measures (BMI, skinfolds [triceps and subscapular], waist girth and waist to hip ratio), functional tests (hand grip, arm and leg strength tests, static balance) and MMSE were obtained or administered by trained personal. The vitamin B 12 supplement of Study II was administered with breakfast and the medication intake was taken from the residents’ anamnesis. Data were analyzed by parametric and non-parametric statistics depending on the obtained data. Comparisons were done using the appropriate ANOVAs or non-parametric tests. Pearsons’ partial correlations with the variable “time” as control were used to define the association of the analyzed parameters. XIII The results showed that: A) Over one year, in relationship to vitamin B status, serum cobalamin decreased, serum folate and mean corpuscular volumen increased significantly and total homocysteine concentrations were stable. Regarding blood lipid profile, triglycerides increased and HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly. Regarding selected anthropometric measurements, waist circumference increased significantly. No significant changes were observed for the rest of parameters. B) Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was high in the elderly studied, ranging from 60 % to 90 % over the year depending on the cut-off used for the classification. LDL-cholesterol values were high, especially among women, and showed a tendency to increase over the year. Results of the balance test showed a deficiency and a tendency to decrease; this indicates that the population studied is at high risk for falls. Lower extremity muscular function was deficient and showed a tendency to decrease. A highly significant relationship was observed between the skinfold of the triceps and blood lipid profile. C) Low cobalamin concentrations correlated significantly with low MMSE scores in the elderly studied. No correlations were observed between vitamin B 12 status and functional parameters. D) Regarding vitamin B 12 status, holo-transcobalamin seems to be more sensitive for diagnosis; 5 - 10 % of the elderly had a deficiency using serum cobalamin as a criterion, and 45 - 52 % had a deficiency when using serum holotranscobalamin as a criterion. E) 500 μg of cyanocobalamin administered orally during 28 days significantly improved vitamin B 12 status and significantly decreased total homocysteine concentrations in institutionalized elderly. No effect of the intervention was observed on functional and cognitive parameters. F) The relative change (%) of improvement of vitamin B 12 status was higher when using serum holo-transcobalamin as a criterion than serum cobalamin. G) Antiaenemic drug intake normalized cobalamin, urologic drugs and corticosteroids serum folate, and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> holo-transcobalamin levels. Drugs treating pulmonary obstruction increased total homocysteine concentration significantly. H) The daily mean drug intake was 5. 1. Fiftynine percent of the elderly took medication belonging to 5 or more different ATC groups. The most prevalent were psycholeptic (53 %), antiacid (53 %) and antithrombotic (47 %) drugs...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Medication {{use among}} older people has {{received}} increased attention {{in recent years}} because the prevalence of multiple medication use in the older population has increased. There {{is some evidence that}} some medications can cause mental illness such as depression, anxiety, and mood disorders. However, there is limited evidence of the association between medication use and mental health outcomes, in older women. Aims: This thesis has six interconnected aims: 1) To describe medications used by women in the ALSWH who were born in 1921 - 1926 (1921 - 1926 Cohort). 2) To examine the cross-sectional association between medication use and mental health scores, in women aged 76 - 81 years, who completed Survey 3 (2002) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. 3) To examine, longitudinally, the association between medication use and poor mental health, in ALSWH participants who completed Survey 3 (2002), Survey 4 (2005), Survey 5 (2008) and Survey 6 (2011). 4) To assess the association between various classes of medication and mental health among ALSWH participants aged 76 - 81 years, who completed Survey 3 in 2002. 5) To examine, longitudinally, the association between classes of medication used and poor mental health, across surveys 3 - 6, clarifying, and expanding upon the findings of aim four. 6) To systematically review current literature of studies assessing the association between selected classes of medication and mental health outcomes, in older adults without mental illness. Methods and Results: To reach these aims, secondary data analyses of ALSWH data and four systematic reviews (in 2014 and 2015) were conducted. Women at greater risk of poor mental health who used medications, had more co-comorbid conditions, more symptoms, {{were more likely to be}} obese, and to be a smoker. Two analyses were conducted in order to evaluate aims two and three. First, cross-sectional analyses were undertaken, using a multivariable linear regression, to examine the association between medication use, in terms of two measures, and mental health scores, among women aged 76 - 81 years, at Survey 3 in 2002. A weak linear association between the number of different medications or number of different therapeutic medication groups used, and mental health scores, was found. A second set of analyses examined longitudinal associations between two measures of medication use and poor mental health, by using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models. From these analyses, it was found that poor mental health was associated with higher medication use (number of different medications and number of different therapeutic medication groups used). However, the association did not persist after adjusting for physical function and bodily pain. Unadjusted univariate analyses, using linear regression to assess the associations between various classes of medication and mental health scores, among similar women who completed Survey 3, showed statistically significant associations between the use of medications for the nervous system (Class N), blood (Class B), alimentary tract and metabolism (Class A), musculoskeletal system (Class M), and cardiovascular system (Class C), and lower mental health scores, among older Australian women, aged 76 - 81 years. GEE models were then used to explore associations between these four classes of medication (nervous system, alimentary tract and metabolism, musculoskeletal system, and cardiovascular system medications) and poor mental health, during ten years of follow-up and adjusting for other factors. The evidence from these analyses suggests that there is not a clear association between use of these four classes of medications and poor mental health, in older Australian women. Additional analyses (sensitivity analyses) were also conducted, as part of the fifth aim, excluding women who were using psycholeptics (N 05) and <b>psychoanaleptics</b> (N 06) medications for anxiety and depression, during 2002 - 2011. These analyses concluded that using Class A, Class M, and Class C medications were associated with lower risk of having poor mental health, for older women, during 2002 - 2011. While using Class N medications such as analgesics, antiepileptics, anti-Parkinson and other nervous system medications, was not significantly associated with poor mental health. Following these analyses, four systematic reviews considered whether there is any other published evidence to suggest an association between medications in each of these four classes, and mental health outcomes, in adults aged 65 years and over, without mental illness. These reviews indicated that adverse mental health outcomes such as anxiety or depression, were suspected, for some Class N medications (e. g. tiagabine, topiramate, rasagiline), some Class A medications (e. g. esomeprazole lansoprazole, cimetidine), some Class M medications (e. g. celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib), and some Class C medications (e. g. indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride, metoprolol). Conclusion and Implications: This thesis has added to the evidence base examining the associations between medication use and mental health, and provided a comprehensive approach to examining these associations by using six different medication measures. The study findings presented in this thesis provides evidence that the number of different medications or the number of different therapeutic medication groups are not clearly associated with poor mental health after controlling for physical functioning or bodily pain, which themselves are strongly associated with poor mental health. Using Class A, Class M and Class C medications was associated with lower risk of having poor mental health, in older women, after excluding N 05 and N 06 medications. With a growing proportion of older people in our society, prescribers should be aware of the advantages that these medications have, for improving mental health. Future well designed studies in different population groups are required to confirm and extend these results, and to especially examine the association between using other common classes of medication, and poor mental health, over time. Four reviews provide evidence that some specific medications in Class N, Class A, Class M and Class C, may play a role in the development of mental illness, in older adults. Future research might include well-designed studies, where the aim is to assess the effects of individual medications, and determine their long-term effects on mental health, and whether these effects are different for older women. The results of this thesis contribute insights to the body of existing knowledge and provide justification for on-going research in this area, especially regarding mental health outcomes, for women. The findings enable clinicians and health professionals to be aware of the possible side effects of using various types of prescription medications, so they can better support this population, especially those at risk of poor mental health. It may be informative for other researchers, by providing an understanding of medication use over the life course, and pre-empting the potential long-term hazards of using medications, in terms of compromising mental health...|$|E
