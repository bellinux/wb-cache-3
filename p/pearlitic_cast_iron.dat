40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} and properties of {{grey cast iron}} castings are considerably influenced by the cooling rate during solidification. In order to obtain grey cast iron parts with a hard superficial layer (wear resistant), external metallic coolers are placed on those surfaces during casting. This {{is the case of}} cam pushers, camshafts, driving shafts, metalworking rolls, etc. Cast iron coolers or steel coolers are mostly used in practice. The cooling rate during solidification is influenced by the thermo-physical characteristics of the coolers. This paper presents the results obtained by simulation and experimental research on coolers material influence on the {{structure and}} hardness of the surface layer of a <b>pearlitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> sample.

It was studied the influence of cooler material on structure of the superficial layer, on thickness of the hardened layer, on superficial hardness, on the temperature field and cooling rates. Conclusions are drawn regarding these influences and the possibility of using external coolers in industrial practice...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCopper, {{manganese}} {{and essentially}} tin {{are used as}} alloying elements for obtaining <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> with a fully pearlitic matrix in the as-cast state. Addition of tin, {{at a level of}} about 0. 10 - 0. 15 mass%, seems to be the only practical way for avoiding growth of ferrite in the stable eutectoid reaction and to fully transform the matrix of the material to pearlite in the metastable eutectoid system. While the role of copper and manganese has been previously rationalized, the way tin affects the eutectoid transformation in <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is still a matter of debate. The present work makes use of an assessment of the Fe-Sn system and of experimental data in the Fe-C-Sn system to evaluate the effect of tin on phase equilibria in this latter system.

40|$|Recently the {{superior}} natures {{have been required}} in mechanical properties, especially strength and toughness, as machine members. 　Cast iron {{is one of the}} casting materials which have been popularly used as engineering materials, on account of its good castability. But generally speaking, cast iron is weak and brittle by the existance of flake graphite in it. 　In this paper, applying quench-tempering to a <b>pearlitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> the structual changes caused in it were first observed by an optical microscope. And the changes of tensile strength and hardness by quench-tempering were examined. Then aspects of fracturing of the quench-tempered cast iron were precisely investigated in bending, tension and rotating bending fatigue fracture,and the mechanism of improving mechanical properties by such heat treatment was considered. And following results were obtained:　(1) Heated at 900 ℃ for more 1 hour, flake graphites grow remarkably and simultaneously their edges grow round and their surface smoothes. Even if the heating time at the quenching temperature becomes longer, noticeable change can not be found in the matrix among large flake graphites. A thin layer of ferrite wraps each graphite. 　(2) The highest tensile strength is obtained by heating at 900 ℃ for 3 hours, oil quenching, and tempering at 400 - 500 ℃. The specimen treated above is 1. 45 times strong as the material as cast. This is caused chiefly by the change of state of graphite shown above in (1) and the change of matrix itseif. 　(3) From the results it is explained that when quench-tempered cast iron is statically stressed, the chance of initiation and propagation of crack is reduced by the state of graphite and the properties of matrix. But when subjected to the repeated stress, the propagation of crack is affected by the structure of matrix rather than graphite...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{transport}} {{properties of}} cast iron are important in high temperature applications, where the temperatures should be kept low and the thermal gradients within the component small. Dimensional and microstructural changes, thermally induced stresses and even failure might be catastrophic consequences of intense and/or unevenly distributed temperatures. Enhanced material properties are required {{in the future to}} enable a more efficient and complete combustion in heavy truck and marine engines necessary to encounter global environmental demands. The development is a requirement to meet customer needs together with present and future legislation. The purpose of this work is to correlate the thermal conductivity {{of cast iron}} to the microstructure. Initially, an analytical work including numerical calculations and simulations using the finite difference method, FDM, is discussed where the effects of e. g. the thermal conductivity and the wall thickness on the temperature distribution of cast iron components operating at elevated temperatures are evaluated. A literature survey is presented, covering {{a great deal of the}} existing works dealing with the influences from chemical composition, microstructure constituents and graphite morphology on the thermal conductivity of cast iron. Additionally, some modelling approaches are discussed. In the work, the effects of solidification rate, carbon content and inoculation of grey iron, graphite morphology of various grades of cast iron and graphite growth direction on the thermal conductivity are examined experimentally.

40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} {{mechanisms by}} liquid aluminum of three industrial materials have been studied: unalloyed steel (UAS), and ferritic and modified <b>pearlitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> (FCI and PCI, respectively). The behavior {{of these materials}} when in contact with liquid aluminum is different. Aluminum diffuses deep into the UAS and forms intermetallic compounds with iron at the surface and in the steel matrix. At the surface, only Fe 2 Al 5 and FeAl 3 are found. In the matrix, FeAl 2 also is formed {{in agreement with the}} equilibrium Fe-Al diagram. From the matrix to FeAl 2, the Al content in the ferrite increases progressively until Al saturation is reached. At this step, black elongated precipitates (Al 4 C 3 and/or graphite) appear. Graphite lamellas present in both FCI and PCI constitute an efficient barrier to the Al diffusion. The high silicon content of the FCI leads to the formation of a phase free from Al and saturated in Si. For the PCI, a thin layer rich in Al and Si, which is formed between the matrix and Fe 2 Al 5, limits the diffusion of atoms. The effects of Cr and P added in the PCI also are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{morphology}} of the graphite phase largely controls the resulting properties of cast iron. For instance, in flake graphite cast irons the mechanical properties are low while the thermal conductivity is high. This {{is in contrast}} with spheroidal graphite cast irons where the mechanical properties are high and the thermal conductivity is low. These differences are due to the different graphite morphologies and must be accounted for in the design work and material selection of cast iron components. In this work {{the influence of the}} graphite phase on the elastic and plastic deformation behaviour of cast irons has been studied. The material grades studied originate from castings for marine diesel engine piston rings with different chemical analyses. Two groups of <b>pearlitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> materials were studied; one with differences in graphite morphology and one with grey irons that differed in graphite content. For these different material grades the mechanical properties were correlated to microstructural parameters. In addition to standard uniaxial tensile tests, acoustic emission measurements were used for the study of deformation. When studying the modulus of elasticity of the cast iron {{it was found that the}} modulus of elasticity of the inherent graphite phase depends on the roundness of the graphite particles and is due to the strong anisotropy of the graphite phase. A linear correlation between nodularity and the modulus of elasticity of the graphite phase was derived. This correlation made it possible to account for the anisotropy of the graphite phase in the model used. By applying the linear function when modelling the effective modulus of elasticity, a high accuracy between experimental and theoretical values was achieved. Another factor affecting the elastic response when subjecting a cast iron component to tensile load was found to be the plastic deformation that actually occurs at very low strains for all of the studied cast iron grades. It was observed that the plastic deformation in the low strain elastic region, quantified by using acoustic emission measurements, increased linearly with decreasing modulus of elasticity. These measurements showed that the amount of plastic deformation in the elastic region was largely controlled by the graphite morphology. It was concluded that as the roundness of the graphite particles increases, the plastic deformation activity in the elastic region decreases. The plastic deformation activity continued linearly into the pronounced plastic region of the tensile tests. A decrease in roundness or increase in graphite fraction resulted in an increase of the amount of plastic deformation and the strain hardening exponent. A dependence between strength coefficient and graphite fraction was observed. Models for the flow curves for pearlitic cast irons were developed and shown to accurately reproduce the observed experimental curves. The surveys performed and conclusions from this thesis will be helpful in the design of new cast iron materials...|$|E

Proper design of heavy section ductile iron castings requires a database of information about microstructures and mechanical properties that nowadays is missing or is very poor. In this paper, we presented the mechanical characterization of ductile irons with solidification times up to 20 h, carried out to identify the metallurgical and the process parameters that most affect the improvement in fatigue strength.

This technique uses only one abrasive particle with known geometry and the {{abrasive wear}} event can be isolated, providing fundamental {{information on the}} interaction between the particle and the material. The testing conditions selected were equivalent to those usually found on ore processing or dirt excavation machine components. Under these testing conditions high contact stresses and high deformation rates imposes extremely high strains on the material. The abrasion resistance was measured through the specific energy variation as a function of scratch depth that varied between 30 and 150 m, corresponding to weight losses between 1 and 12 mg. The results demonstrated that the material response depends on the mechanical properties, on the microstructure and on the depth of penetration.

40|$|Abstract. In this {{experimental}} study, six <b>pearlitic</b> grey <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> {{with different}} Cu and Cr content, different section thicknesses and different eutectoid cooling {{rates have been}} examined. The eutectoid cooling rate was approximated by casting simulation analysis. The purpose of the experiments was to study {{the effect of the}} matrix structure on the overall mechanical properties. An emphasis is put on the pearlite interlamellar spacing because this controls the resulting mechanical properties to a large extent. By keeping the graphite structure constant, the effect of the matrix structure was able to be studied. This was achieved by shake-out at temperatures above the eutectoid transformation range followed by subsequent cooling in air, mould or in a furnace. The pearlite interlamellar spacing ranged from 90 to 330 nm for the matrices studied. Comparing the strength of the fine structured and coarse structured materials, the tensile and yield strength was reduced by almost 50 %. Regarding the elastic deformation, a weak increase in the tangent modulus with increasing alloying content was observed. It was also observed that lower cooling rate decreased the tangent modulus. The tangent modulus ranged between 70 and 110 GPa. Analysing the plastic deformation of the materials, in terms of strain hardening exponent, n, and strength coefficient, K, a strong dependence on the pearlite coarseness was observed. It was concluded that the effect of graphite particle length on tensile strength was negligible and the major improvement on the strength was due to refinement of the pearlite...|$|R

The work aims to extend and improve existing conduction limited laser surface treatment techniques (laser transformation hardening and laser surface meltingrý) by applying a simple analytical model to design laser experiment using customised beat source profiles. A general methodology for optimising the laser surface treatment by customising the heat source profile was proposed. Through identifying surface property to be achieved, analysing the required microstructural changes, examining the necessary surface temperature distribution and applying a custornised heat source profile, a desired surface mechanical property can be obtained. A simple analytical model was used to design the heat source profiles and to calculate the temperature distribution {{within and outside the}} beam illumination region.

40|$|<b>Pearlitic</b> flake-graphite grey <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> {{have long}} been widely used for the {{manufacture}} of diesel-engine combustion-chamber components. Nonetheless, very few pertinent high-temperature data {{are to be found}} in published work. The investigation described attempts to enlarge current knowledge on the high-temperature behaviour of grey <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> in view of requirements highlighted by high thermal ratings. A general considera-tion of the problem showed that the often quoted Eichelberg material-quality factor is largely irrelevant and an alternative assessment formula is proposed. This is broadly confirmed by a systematic examination of the mechanical and physical properties of 166 plain and alloyed <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and a limited number of engine com-ponents. Different engine components impose different demands upon the material properties but for economic reasons a single cast-iron melt capable of meeting most of the requirements of all components is needed. It is shown that this situation is best met with an alloyed iron containing 1. 3 per cent of copper-nickel and 0. 4 per cent of molybdenum. The scatter in properties obtained from production casts was found to be typical for such irons. For components having safety factors of 2 or less, a prerequisite of economic engineering design, the service reliability is crucially dependent upon the scatter of material properties. Thus, there are advantages in reducing this scatter and it is shown that th is can be achieved by attention to the cleanliness of the matrix and tight control of the chemistry of the melt. In general, the absolute values of mechanical and physical properties of flake-graphite <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> appear to be governed mainly by the form and size of the graphite flakes and the chemistry of the matrix (i. e.

40|$|In recent decades, {{significant}} {{requirements of}} changes in composition of brake friction materials in order for faster and more reliable transportation {{as well as their}} environmental friendly characterizations attracted attentions. However, the relation between performance and formulation/composition is not clear since friction processes are accompanied by many complex problems such as instability in the coefficient of friction, noise, vibration and wear. Creep-groan is a low frequency vibration which could originate in different part of the system (vehicle). The resulting resonant vibration in the passenger compartment causes discomfort and often leads to complaints of customers and related increase of warranty costs covered by manufacturers. In spite of relatively large amount of publications addressing the creep-groan phenomena, there is not an universal solution addressing the engineering aspects of brake/vehicle design. In addition, Relevance of wear occurring in brake materials increased particularly with relation to the released chemicals and corresponding health and environmental hazards. It is well known that humidity can considerably modify the adhesion of rubbing counterfaces by creating menisci and increasing the contact area. The chemistry, morphology and phase composition of the friction layers (third body) generated on the friction surfaces could play a determining role when amounts of adsorbed water on brake surfaces is concerned. The friction layer is typically a complex mix of numerous materials and, as a rule, contains the agglomerated or sintered nanoparticles. Hence, quantum effects could further modify the adsorption of water. This work addresses the impact of humidity on wear and creep groan of two commercial brake material types: the so called i) 2 ̆ 2 non-asbestos organic 2 ̆ 2 (NAO) and the ii) 2 ̆ 2 semi-metallic 2 ̆ 2 (SM) brake materials rubbed against <b>pearlitic</b> gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> rotors typically used in the passenger vehicles.

High niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was prepared by adding pure niobium to a commercial <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Coarse primary niobium carbide crystals were observed in the microstructure of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The effect of the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as an inoculant on the grain size of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels was examined in various experimental conditions. When the amount of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> inoculant more than 3 mass% was added into the steel melt, fine equiaxed grains were observed and grain size was significantly reduced to 210 μm. The results indicate that the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is effective as a grain refiner for the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. From the dissolution rate measurement, the grain refining mechanism was proposed. 9 th International Symposium on Science and Processing of <b>Cast</b> <b>Iron,</b> SPCI- 9; Luxor; 10 November 2010 through 13 November 201...|$|R
