5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> her in the Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's death {{for the rest of}} her life because, at the time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> him for help in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E

25|$|This period {{yielded a}} great deal of success for Mullá Husayn and Quddús, Bábí {{communities}} sprouted throughout Khorasan Province, including converts from a wide array of economic backgrounds. In Mullá Husayn's hometown of Boshruyeh, a group of 60 active Bábís had emerged, with thousands turning out to attend Mullá Husayn's sermons or <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> him. Widespread Shakyi sympathies among the local clerics seem to have laid a fertile ground for the growth of Bábism.|$|E
25|$|Mary Eunice {{thinks the}} communion wine has been pilfered and {{delivers}} some to Jude, who notices {{she is wearing}} bright red lipstick. Mary Eunice tells her Arden gave it to her, saying it is Jude's favorite color (alluding to the red lingerie Jude wears). Mary Eunice visits and tries to seduce Arden. He rebuffs her and she laughs at him. She later enters the suspicious female patient's room to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> her, stabs her while she is kneeling, and takes her body outside to the Raspers.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, the two Bichier women {{moved to}} the family's country home in Béthines called La Guimetière. While living there, Elizabeth began to feel {{the loss of the}} Eucharist in her life, as the local church was being served by a juring priest, for which it was {{rejected}} by the local people. From her childhood she had been attracted to contemplation and she had consecrated herself to the Virgin Mary. Her wish was to consecrate her life to God in an enclosed religious order, but she did not tell her mother. During this period she used to gather people and <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} {{of students in the}} school transfer from Israeli institutions focusing on post-high school full-time Judaic studies, where most have studied for multiple years. The school has a Yeshiva program, in conjunction with the associated Beis Medrash L'Talmud, for full-time Judaic studies for students who are either pre- or post-college. In accordance with school policy, all students are required to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> the school's prayer services thrice daily. All students must also attend the morning program of Talmud studies, usually from 9:00am until 2:20pm, each Sunday through Friday, with a break for lunch (the schedule varies by day). Following afternoon prayers at 2:20pm, academic classes start, Monday through Thursday, lasting until 7:00pm or so for most students. Night Seder (evening Judaic studies) from 8pm until 10pm is also officially mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The spirit {{can lead}} Legios to acquire robes of yellow, {{a range of}} blues, purple, green, red, brown and other colours that are {{associated}} with various spiritual gifts and patron saints. Black is for ordained male priests (padri, pl. pate) and church mothers (madha, padri madhako, pl. mathe, pate mamon). Legio priests and church mothers wear black robes at requiem masses and at graveside services held in family compounds. At happier times, black prayer beads are worn or carried by church mothers and priests as a metonym of power and ordained status. A few non-ordained men and women said they had the black beads on their house altars because a dream had directed them to get the beads and <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> them at home. The dream-bestowed black beads were a source of quiet pride to these Legios.|$|E
25|$|Tutu {{was also}} {{appointed}} as the Anglican chaplain to the neighbouring University of Fort Hare. In an unusual move for the time, he invited female students become servers during the Eucharist alongside their male counterparts. He joined Anglican student delegations to {{meetings of the}} Anglican Students' Federation and the University Christian Movement. It was from this environment that the Black Consciousness Movement emerged {{under the leadership of}} figures like Steve Biko and Barney Pityana; although not averse to working with other racial groups to fight apartheid, Tutu was supportive of their efforts. In August 1968, he gave a sermon comparing the situation in South Africa with that in the Eastern Bloc, likening anti-apartheid protests to the recent Prague Spring. In September, Fort Hare students held a sit-in protest at the university administration's policies; after they were surrounded by police with dogs, Tutu waded into the crowd to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> the protesters. This {{was the first time that}} he had witnessed state power used to suppress dissent, and he cried during public prayers the next day.|$|E

25|$|His {{simplified}} teachings {{were designed}} to appeal primarily {{to the poor and}} the peasants. He attempted to win supporters by cutting down on ceremonies and complex doctrines, eschewing the use of temples. He won over followers by offering free consultations and performing purported miracle cures with simple herbs and acupuncture, and preaching at street corners and canal intersections. He quickly built up a following in the southern Mekong Delta and was looked to by his disciples for guidance in their daily lifestyles. In a time of colonial occupation, a native religion appealed to the masses who were displaying nationalist sentiment. Unlike Gautama Buddha or Jesus, Sổ was Vietnamese. As a result, Sổ became a nationalist icon and became a wanted man for the French colonial authorities, having gained 100,000 followers in less than a year. He predicted that politics would be the cause of his premature death.The cult must stem much more from internal faith than from a pompous appearance. It is better to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> a pure heart before the family altar than to perform gaudy ceremonies in a pagoda, clad in the robes of an unworthy bonze.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism has {{incorporated}} {{many kinds}} of prayer (Sanskrit: prārthanā), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as devtas, trinity or incarnation of either devtas or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also {{for the benefit of}} others. Ritual invocation was {{part and parcel of the}} Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, Brahman, that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the Hindu pantheon. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called Brahma, preserver god called Vishnu and destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> their hands (the palms) joined together in pranam. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting namaste.|$|E

His confession would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel would know then what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But God had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the white form, <b>praying</b> <b>with</b> his darkened eyes, <b>praying</b> <b>with</b> all his trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost creature, <b>praying</b> <b>with</b> whimpering lips.|$|R
500|$|Smart's {{behaviour}} {{was probably}} influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to [...] "Pray without ceasing" [...] and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which {{argues that a}} constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident that Smart later described in Jubilate Agno: [...] "For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91).|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{argues that}} non-permanent {{relationships}} involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term psychological pain {{and that one}} should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the Greek myth of the suitors of Penelope, in which Penelope, whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists {{a large number of}} marriage proposals until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that selfless service {{is an important part of}} marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question [...] "How will I know when a relationship is from God?" [...] and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a [...] "team... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective." [...] She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.|$|E
500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief <b>pray</b> <b>with</b> Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
