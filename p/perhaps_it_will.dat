The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the bidding}} process and {{leading up to}} the vote at the 117th IOC Session, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, {{particularly}} as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for 1992 and 2008). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On 1 July 2005, IOC president Jacques Rogge, when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 June 2005, the IOC {{released}} its evaluation reports {{for the five}} candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations. On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, [...] "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote.

2500|$|Carl L. Brown in Foreign Affairs writes: [...] "This book {{offers a}} {{historical}} overview {{in the form}} of a personal memoir, tracing developments since the 1970s as Carter experienced and understood them. He may thus be said to be both a source for the historian and himself a historian of the Israeliâ€“Palestinian confrontation. This little book merits a reading on both counts. Carter concludes that [...] "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land." [...] That statement, so out of line with the way mainstream American political figures (even those retired from public office) frame the issue, ensures that the book will be attacked by many. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be read as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|To date, Duchamp's {{production}} {{had been}} too spars and differed considerably from one painting to the next. Apollinaire hesitated to make any broad generalizations, noting rather Duchamp's apparent talent and his abandoning of [...] "the cult of appearances". To free his art from all perceptions, Duchamp wrote the titles on the paintings themselves. [...] "This literature, which so few painters {{have been able to}} avoid, disappears from his art, but not poetry. He uses forms and colors, not to render appearances, but to penetrate the essential nature of forms and formal colors... <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be the task of an artist as detached from aesthetic preoccupations, and as intent on the energetic as Marcel Duchamp, to reconcile art and the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|A re-evaluation of Dee's {{character}} and significance {{came in the}} 20th century, {{largely as a result}} of the work of the historians Charlotte Fell-Smith and Dame Frances Yates. Both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic, science and religion held in the Elizabethan Renaissance. Fell-Smith writes: [...] "There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand." [...] As a result of this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book-collector, a devoted Christian (albeit during a very confusing time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day. His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country (before it was vandalized), and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of De Thou. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the colonisation of North America and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.|$|E
