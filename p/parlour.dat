5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and <b>Parlour.</b> In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the <b>Parlour</b> was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the <b>Parlour</b> also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round <b>Parlour.</b> As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
5|$|This {{was added}} to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small {{intimate}} room where the family could eat in private away from the servants. Above it is the small Oriel Bedroom, probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room. At {{the same time that the}} oriel room and bedroom were added, rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall: the Great <b>Parlour</b> with Great Chamber above, and the Little <b>Parlour</b> with Little <b>Parlour</b> above. John Lyte, the builder, placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger {{in favour of}} Ray <b>Parlour</b> and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, <b>Parlour,</b> Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and <b>Parlour</b> were given one-match suspensions.|$|E

5000|$|Although Thailand {{is known}} for Thai massage, its non-sexual, {{traditional}} style of massage, known as nuat phaen boran, some massage <b>parlours</b> provide customers erotic massage at additional cost including handjobs, oral sex, and sexual intercourse. The Federation of Thai Spa Associations (FTSPA) in 2016 urged authorities {{to clamp down on}} sexual services being offered at some massage <b>parlours.</b> The FTSPA maintains that influential figures have used legal loopholes to open [...] "pretty spas" [...] or massage <b>parlours</b> where tourists can buy sexual services. The difference between this type of massage and ab ob nuat is that not all massage <b>parlours</b> offer sexual services.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2003, indoor {{prostitution}} in New Zealand was {{governed by}} the Massage <b>Parlours</b> Act 1978, which allowed brothels {{to operate in the}} guise of massage <b>parlours.</b> However, the act defined massage <b>parlours</b> as public places, so laws against soliciting in a public place applied to workers in <b>parlours,</b> and they were sometimes raided and entrapped by police posing as clients. Workers in the <b>parlours</b> were also required to provide their names and addresses to the police. Advertising the sale of sex ("soliciting"), running a brothel, and living off the earnings of prostitution were illegal. These laws were changed by the Prostitution Reform Act, passed in June 2003. The decriminalisation of brothels, escort agencies and soliciting, and the substitution of a minimal regulatory model created worldwide interest; New Zealand prostitution laws are now some of the most liberal in the world (see also Prostitution and the law).|$|R

5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray <b>Parlour,</b> Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré.

Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E

The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} <b>parlour</b> and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

Lauren, Martin Keown, Patrick Vieira and Ray <b>Parlour</b> were all suspended for between one and four matches: Lauren received a four-game ban – half of the potential ban he could have received – and a £40,000 fine; Keown was suspended for three matches and had to pay a £20,000 fine; Vieira and <b>Parlour</b> were given one-game bans and had to pay £20,000 and £10,000 respectively. Jens Lehmann was originally charged but this was later dropped. Ashley Cole was not suspended but was given a £10,000 fine. Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo both {{pleaded not guilty to}} their involvement in the incident, but after a five-hour hearing in December 2003, Giggs was handed a £7,500 fine and Ronaldo a £4,000 fine and both were warned about their future conduct.|$|E

5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer <b>parlour,</b> {{projecting}} from {{the north end of}} the range, where members of the community received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior's rooms were probably located above the outer <b>parlour,</b> as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister and the outside world. The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor level below that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.|$|E

During the same month, Chuwit sold three of his <b>parlours,</b> saying that police harassment had made operations difficult for him.|$|R

5|$|The Great Hall {{was built}} in the mid-15th century, and in the early 16th century the {{entrance}} porch and oriel room was added to {{the eastern side of the}} hall, and the great <b>parlour</b> and little <b>parlour</b> to the south of the hall, with bedrooms above. Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755, tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair. In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range 'had lately been destroyed and a farm house built on the site', (this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared.|$|E

A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' <b>Parlour</b> allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house.

Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south-east corner is the Master Gunner's House, comprising a <b>parlour,</b> hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic on the floors above. The <b>parlour</b> and hall would have originally been separated by a screen; the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel-vaulted chambers, its massive, original roof still intact.|$|E
