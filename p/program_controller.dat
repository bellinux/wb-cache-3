40|$|Abstract:- Intelligent {{robotics}} {{presents a}} number of interesting challenges for machine learning. In this paper {{we look at the}} specific task of finding a mapping from stimuli to response for robots controlled by reactive behaviors. The mapping will be represented by association rules which is a technique commonly used in data mining but so far not very common in robotics. The approach for learning the association rules is to record training data for a manually <b>programmed</b> <b>controller.</b> The data is then used to generate a set of association rules that replaces the manually <b>programmed</b> <b>controller</b> and manages to reproduce the demonstrated behavior. Techniques to deal with overlapping rules and no firing rules are suggested and evaluated. The method is demonstrated with two examples: One simple wall follower behavior and one more complex road sign problem with a mix of two wall following behaviors. The results show that association rules are a very powerful and practical way to implement rule based controllers for reactive robots...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the architecture of}} Jacobium processing elements. The Jacobium is a dataflow processor aiming at high speed execution of algorithms where Cordic operations play a dominant role. To achieve high throughputs the processing elements are equiped with a deep floating point Cordic pipeline, on-chip multiport memory to buffer operands and results, and several high speed communication busses for communication between processing elements and the host. Communication and processing takes place on finite stream basis. This keeps control and communication overhead low and control logic small. To reduce control overhead even more, the memory is made accessible by abstract instructions from the <b>program</b> <b>controller</b> which do not involve physical addresses. To reduce flow irregularity effects, data as well as instructions are queued before being consumed, and the pipeline is able to compress bubbles in the pipe.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of {{humanoid}} falling witha decoupled strategy consisting of a pre-impact and a post-impact stage. In the pre-impact stage, geometrical reasoningallows the robot to choose appropriate impact points in thesurrounding environment and to adopt a posture to reach themwhile avoiding impact-singularities and preparing for the post-impact. The surrounding environment can be unstructured andmay contain cluttered obstacles. The post-impact stage usesa quadratic <b>program</b> <b>controller</b> that adapts on-line the jointproportional-derivative (PD) gains to make the robot compliant–to absorb impact and post-impact dynamics, which lowerspossible damage risks. This is done by a new approach incor-porating the stiffness and damping gains directly as decisionvariables in the QP along with the usually-considered variablesof joint accelerations and contact forces. Constraints of the QPprevent the motors from reaching their torque limits duringthe fall.

40|$|Inductor {{current sensing}} is {{becoming}} {{widely used in}} current <b>programmed</b> <b>controllers</b> for microprocessor applications. This method exploits a low-pass filter in parallel with the inductor to provide lossless current sense. A major drawback of inductor current sensing is that accurate sense the dc and ac components of the current signal requires precise matching between the low-pass filter time constant and the inductor time constant (L/RL). However, matching accuracy depends on the tolerance of the components and on the operating conditions; therefore it can hardly be guaranteed. To overcome this problem, a novel digital autotuning system is proposed that automatically compensates any time constant mismatch. This autotuning system has been developed for voltage regulator module (VRM) current <b>programmed</b> <b>controllers.</b> It {{makes it possible to}} meet the adaptive voltage positioning requirements using conventional and low cost components, and to solve problems such as aging effects, temperature variations, and process tolerances as well. A prototype of the autotuning system based on a field-programmable gate array and a commercial dc/dc controller has been designed and tested. The experimental results fully confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing an improvement of the current sense precision from about 30 % up to 4 %.
