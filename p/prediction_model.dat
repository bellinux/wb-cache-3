5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression had a broad circulation and organized deep convection. It was located over very warm water temperatures, although the upper-level environment was not conducive for significant intensification. Easterly wind shear was forecast, but the NHC anticipated the depression strengthening to 45mph (75km/h) before making landfall in Louisiana. Under {{the influence of a}} mid-level ridge to its north, the depression was forecast to track generally northwestward. Early on August11, the convection diminished significantly due to the entrainment of dry air and vertical wind shear from a nearby upper-level low. The circulation became difficult to locate; however, conditions favored the redevelopment of the thunderstorm activity. One tropical cyclone <b>prediction</b> <b>model</b> forecast significant intensification to a minimum pressure of 968mbar, and other models forecast the depression would reach hurricane status upon making landfall. As it continued to the northwest, the circulation remained broad and disorganized, and convection remained minimal. Late on August11, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the depression was no longer a tropical cyclone, and in post-analysis, the NHC determined that the depression was only a tropical cyclone for 12hours. Redevelopment was not anticipated.|$|E

The HCT-CI modifies and adds to a well-validated comorbidity index, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (Charlson et al.)

500|$|Since the 1990s, {{ensemble}} forecasts {{have been}} used operationally (as routine forecasts) {{to account for the}} stochastic nature of weather processes ndash& that is, to resolve their inherent uncertainty. [...] This method involves analyzing multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model by using different physical parametrizations or varying initial conditions. Starting in 1992 with ensemble forecasts prepared by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental <b>Prediction,</b> <b>model</b> ensemble forecasts {{have been used}} to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System, uses singular vectors to simulate the initial probability density, while the NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as vector breeding. The UK Met Office runs global and regional ensemble forecasts where perturbations to initial conditions are produced using a Kalman filter. There are 24 ensemble members in the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS).|$|E
500|$|A General Circulation Model (GCM) is a {{mathematical}} model {{that can be used}} in computer simulations of the global circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean. [...] An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is essentially the same as a global numerical weather <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> and some (such as the one used in the UK Unified Model) can be configured for both short-term weather forecasts and longer-term climate predictions. [...] Along with sea ice and land-surface components, AGCMs and oceanic GCMs (OGCM) are key components of global climate models, and are widely applied for understanding the climate and projecting climate change. [...] For aspects of climate change, a range of man-made chemical emission scenarios can be fed into the climate models to see how an enhanced greenhouse effect would modify the Earth's climate. [...] Versions designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were originally created in 1969 by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. [...] When run for multiple decades, computational limitations mean that the models must use a coarse grid that leaves smaller-scale interactions unresolved.|$|E

During the writing process, Lichtman focused his efforts on outlining a thesis explaining why Trump was vulnerable to being removed from office, due to concerns about links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and possible conflicts of interest tied to his global financial dealings. Whereas his September 2016 prediction of a Trump win in the US presidential election {{was based on a}} tested <b>prediction</b> <b>model,</b> his basis for the impeachment thesis was more of a qualitative analysis.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is {{a highly}} toxic heavy metal for both plants and animals. The {{presence}} of Cd in agricultural soils is of great concern regarding its transfer in the soil-plant system. This study investigated the transfer of Cd (exogenous salts) {{from a wide range}} of Chinese soils to corn grain (Zhengdan 958). Through multiple stepwise regressions, <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> were developed, with the combination of Cd bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Zhengdan 958 and soil pH, organic matter (OM) content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Moreover, these <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> from Zhengdan 958 were applied to other non-model corn species through cross-species extrapolation approach. The results showed that the pH of the soil was the most important factor that controlled Cd uptake and lower pH was more favorable for Cd bioaccumulation in corn grain. There was no significant difference among three <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> in the different Cd levels. When the <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> were applied to other non-model corn species, the ratio ranges between the predicted BCF values and the measured BCF values were within an interval of 2 folds and close to the solid line of 1 : 1 relationship. Furthermore, these <b>prediction</b> <b>models</b> also reduced the measured BCF intra-species variability for all non-model corn species.
