500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, {{if they ever}} want to tear it up, they can hold me but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of <b>part</b> <b>performance).</b> The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1998, the United Kingdom has fixed a {{national}} minimum wage, and sets outer limits on working time for virtually all workers. Direct wage and working time regulation is a comparatively recent phenomenon, {{as it was}} traditionally left to collective bargaining to achieve [...] "a fair day's wage for a fair day's work". The Truck Acts were the earliest wage regulations whose provisions have survived, requiring workment to be paid in money, and not kind. Now, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 stipulates that employers can only dock employees’ wages (e.g. for missing stock) if the employee has consented to deductions in writing. This, however, does not cover industrial action, so following 18th century common law on <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> of work, employees who refused to 3 out of 37 hours a week in minor workplace disobedience, had their pay cut for the full 37. From the Trade Boards Act 1909, the UK had set minimum wages according to {{the specific needs of}} different sectors of work. But this system was eroded through the 1980s and eventually repealed in 1993. One wages council that survived was the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948, however it was abolished in England in October 2013, though boards still operate for Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{approach for}} {{the characterization of}} Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes is presented in this paper. Design of Experiments (DOE) and ANalysis of VAriance (ANOVA), both based on Nested Effects Modeling (NEM) technique, are adopted to assess the effect of different laser exposure strategies on physical and mechanical properties of AlSi 10 Mg parts produced by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Due to the wide industrial interest in AM technologies in many different fields, it is extremely important to ensure high <b>parts</b> <b>performances</b> and productivity. For this aim, the present paper focuses on the evaluation of tensile properties of specimens built with different laser exposure strategies. Two optimal laser parameters settings, {{in terms of both}} process quality (<b>part</b> <b>performances)</b> and productivity (<b>part</b> build rate), are identified. © 2017 by the authors...|$|R

50|$|The Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} Daulia Ltd's appeal. They {{held there}} was a unilateral contract for disposition of land, and therefore {{it could not be}} effective because it did not comply with s.40(1). Furthermore there was no act of <b>part</b> <b>performance,</b> which could lead to a binding contract. In the course of his decision Goff LJ said that had there been <b>part</b> <b>performance,</b> it would be a duty of the offeror to not prevent full performance (see also, Errington v Errington). Goff LJ's judgment went as follows.|$|E
50|$|A Statute of Frauds defense {{may also}} be {{affected}} by a showing of <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> by proving the existence of one of two different conditions. If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement, {{as in the case}} Riley v. Capital Airlines, Inc., the court held that <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> does not take an executory portion of a contract out of the Statute of Frauds. Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute of Frauds and was enforceable to the extent it is executed. However, the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable. As a result, only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered, and the doctrine of <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> does not remove the contract from the Statute. On the other hand, the court, in Schwedes v. Romain, held that partial performance and grounds for estoppel can make the contract effective.|$|E

50|$|It was {{one thing}} to create an {{exception}} that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute’s operation. The thrust of the Statute was that contracts concerning land could not be proved by parol evidence alone. Thus, <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven by parol evidence. In developing the “part performance” exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required. An important factor in the case law became that the <b>part</b> <b>performance</b> must be “unequivocally” related to the alleged contract.|$|E
