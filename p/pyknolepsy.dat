2500|$|Childhood absence {{epilepsy}} (CAE), {{also known}} as <b>pyknolepsy,</b> is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy which occurs in otherwise normal children. The age of onset is between 4–10 years with peak age between 5–7 years. Children have absence seizures which although brief (~4–20 seconds), they occur frequently, sometimes in the hundreds per day. The absence seizures of CAE involve abrupt and severe impairment of consciousness. Mild automatisms are frequent, but major motor involvement early in the course excludes this diagnosis. The EEG demonstrates characteristic [...] "typical 3Hz spike-wave" [...] discharges. Prognosis is excellent in well-defined cases of CAE with most patients [...] "growing out" [...] of their epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>pyknolepsy,</b> {{childhood}} absence epilepsy (CAE) represents up to 10% of all childhood epilepsies. It first manifests in childhood {{between the ages}} of 4 and 8 as brief periods of unconsciousness (absence). Mutations in the calcium channel α subunit encoding gene CACNA1H and the GABA receptor γ subunit encoding gene GABRG2 yield susceptibility for CAE.|$|E

40|$|Occipital {{intermittent}} rhythmic delta activity (OIRDA) {{is considered}} good prognostic factor in typical absences (TA). We report electroclinical evolution in 14 patients with TA and OIRDA, which performed video-EEG. Seven patients were female; 9 had childhood absence epilepsy {{and the others}} did not present electroclinical characteristics for syndromic classification according to ILAE's classification (1989). <b>Pyknolepsy</b> was referred to in 13; TA was the only seizure type in 13; one had generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and three had myoclonic jerks during TA. VPA monotherapy controlled seizures in 11, diVPA and ESM, in one each. After seizure control EEG normalized in 10 while in three, spike-wave complexes (SWC) persisted, accompanied by OIRDA in one. Finally in another, seizures were not controlled and SWC and OIRDA persisted. In conclusion, we observed in this series of TA and OIRDA with onset before 10 years, <b>pyknolepsy</b> as common finding and few GTCS. VPA controlled seizures in most cases and EEG normalized in 76. 92 %. We suggest that OIRDA could be considered good prognostic factor in TA associated with SWC and of epileptiform nature leading to appropriate investigation...|$|E
