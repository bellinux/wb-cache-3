The structure of shear stress in the sediment layer under consideration isdiscussed {{in terms of a}} theory of debris flows which has been developed by theauthors. This brings about the differential equations for velocity and particleconcentration <b>in</b> the <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> of sediment. These equations are solvedanalytically, assuming a linear profile of sediment concentration, and also analysednumerically. No significant differences are found between the results obtained bythe two; the approximate solution and the numerical solution. A bed load equation, which should be called a "sediment load formula", isdeveloped by using the formulas for the velocity profile of sediment layer and theflow depth of sediment layer.

40|$|Centrifugation {{accompanied}} by flocculation of fine biosolids is often utilized in wastewater treatment. Unfortunately, commonly used laboratory jar tests often over-estimate {{the size of}} the flocculated solids (flocs) that can be realized in-situ in the centrifuge as the fragile flocs can be easily broken by shear and turbulence during feed acceleration in the centrifuge. Currently, there is no satisfactory method to predict in-situ floc size in the centrifuge, despite the floc size is critical to separation and solids recovery. The difficulty in making predictions also leads to inaccuracy in predicting solids recovery by decanter centrifuge and scale-up between centrifuges of different sizes, designs, and operating conditions, which is an even more serious issue. This study attempts to address these hurdles. In this study, first the flow pattern in a decanter centrifuge <b>in</b> form of <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> at the pool surface is demonstrated by two different experiments. Second, a model on separation of suspended flocs <b>in</b> the <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> a centrifuge is developed. Further, a two-parameter model is proposed to represent the floc size distribution wherein the first parameter represents the minimum floc size (primary particle without coagulation or flocculation) and the second parameter represents the median floc size. A closed form analytical solution for the model is obtained with results expressed by the ratio of minimum-to-median floc size and a dimensionless Leung number which measures feed rate to the clarification rate of the centrifuge. Third, a Buckingham-π analysis has been conducted on separation <b>in</b> a <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> under centrifugal field confirming these two governing dimensionless parameters can also be derived independently from the more basic dimensionless π groups. Fourth, by matching the solids recovery obtained from field tests with the model prediction, the median floc size can be inferred. In this matching process, the minimum floc size is assumed to be equal to {{the size of the}} primary, unflocculated solids. Fifth, four sets of tests (over 20 runs) have been carried out using two decanter centrifuges of different sizes and designs operating, respectively, under different pool depths, feed rates, polymer dosages and rotation speeds in a wastewater treatment plant processing mixed sludge with 48 % primary sludge and 52 % waste activated sludge. The median floc size inferred from the present method is in the range of 4 – 9  mm from the three series of tests (14 tests). The improved feed acceleration design with speed matching closely that of the rotating pool results in less pool turbulence, larger flocs, and lower polymer dosage (7  kg polymer/ton sludge); while the poorer feed acceleration with more pool disturbance from the under-accelerated feed results in smaller flocs, and higher polymer dosage (9  kg/t). Sixth, an important application of the model is to predict solids recovery using an estimated median floc size and this approach has predicted the solids recovery reasonably well on the fourth set of tests (9 tests). Seventh, the scale-up for predicting solids recovery of flocculated suspension from decanter centrifuges of different sizes, designs, and operating conditions has been demonstrated using the dimensionless Leung number and the minimum-to-median floc size ratio.

40|$|The {{use of the}} biharmonic {{operator}} for deforming a mesh in an arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation is investigated. The biharmonic operator has {{the advantage}} that two conditions can be specified on each boundary of the mesh. This allows both the position and the normal mesh spacing along a boundary to be controlled, which is important for two-fluid interfaces and periodic boundaries. At these boundaries, we can simultaneously fix {{the position of the}} boundary and ensure that the normal mesh spacing is continuous across the boundary. In addition, results for deforming surfaces show that greater surface deformation can be tolerated when using biharmonic equations compared to approaches using second-order partial differential equations. A final advantage is that with the biharmonic operator, the integrity of a grid <b>in</b> a <b>moving</b> boundary <b>layer</b> can be preserved as the boundary moves. The main disadvantage of the approach is it’s increased computational expense.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{addressing}} some of the limitations present in the spectral synthesis technique introduced by Zhang to render dynamic textures resembling falling snow. We improved the speed and the memory requirements of the rendering process by replacing the 3 D inverse Fourier transform used in the rendering technique by a sequence of 2 D inverse Fourier transforms. One of the issues with the rendering technique was that it didn't {{take into account the}} variations across the motion field that are visible when the observer undergoes non-lateral motion. In order to incorporate the motion field effects caused by egomotion (i. e. the motion of the observer) we devised a tiling technique which involved dividing the view field into square image tiles, rendering each tile with a unique direction of motion and speed range (depending on the underlying motion field) and then blending the tiles together. The tile boundaries are not visible in this case because of certain constraints present in the human visual system (HVS) with regard to processing such motion gradients or discontinuities. Finally, based on the constraints present in the HVS <b>in</b> processing multiple <b>moving</b> <b>layers,</b> we show that the original model which renders a large number of overlapping transparent layers is an overkill and demonstrate a simplified model which renders just a limited number of layers...|$|R

40|$|Received; accepted] Enabling {{a digital}} actor to move {{autonomously}} {{in a virtual}} environment is a challenging problem that has attracted much attention in recent years. The systems proposed in several researches {{have been able to}} plan the walking motions of a humanoid on an uneven ter-rain.

Based on our previous work, we add two additional motion abil-ities: leaping and moving obstacles into the system. In previous work, the order of moving obstacles is deter-mined first, and then the corresponding paths for the pushing/pulling motions are generated. In this work, we take a unified approach that accounts for all types of motions at the same time.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the density wave instability of fermionic dipoles aligned by an external field, and <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> equidistant <b>layers</b> at zero temperature. Using a conserving Hartree-Fock approximation, {{we show that}} correlations between dipoles in different layers significantly decrease the critical coupling strength {{for the formation of}} density waves when the distance between the layers is comparable to the inter-particle distance within each layer. This effect, which is strongest when the dipoles are oriented perpendicular to the planes, causes the density waves in neighboring layers to be in-phase for all orientations of the dipoles. We furthermore demonstrate that the effects of the interlayer interaction can be understood from a classical model. Finally, we show that the interlayer correlations are important for experimentally relevant dipolar molecules, including the chemically stable 23 Na 40 K and 40 K 133 Cs, where the density wave regime is within experimental reach.

40|$|A {{very common}} {{situation}} in the pharmaceutical arena is that {{a small amount of}} cohesive drug substance needs to be distributed in a large bulk of free-flowing filler such as lactose. The key topic of attention is that aggregates of a cohesive drug substance need to be sufficiently broken up in an acceptable time-frame. This implies that there is need for a better mechanistic understanding of the blending process and the reduction in size of the aggregates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain more insight in the mechanisms that lead to the break up of assemblies of <b>powder</b> particles <b>in</b> a <b>moving</b> <b>powder</b> bed. The break up of aggregates was studied by application of so-called brittle Calibrated Test Particles (bCTPs). These are well-defined aggregates with brittle fracture properties. The dominant mechanism of the break up of these aggregates is abrasion by multiple impacts. There is evidence of a relationship between strength (expressed as porosity) of the bCTPs and rate of abrasion. This is often a slow process and the rate is determined riot only by the (mechanical) properties of the agglomerates and process conditions, but also by the particle size distribution of the bulk filler.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{two-phase flow}} framework for fluid-sediment flow simulation {{in the surf}} and swash zones was described. Propagation, breaking, uprush and backwash of waves on sloping beaches were studied numerically {{with an emphasis on}} fluid hydrodynamics and sediment transport characteristics. The model includes interactive fluid-solid forces and intergranular stresses <b>in</b> the <b>moving</b> sediment <b>layer.</b> <b>In</b> the Euler-Euler approach adopted, two phases were defined using the Navier-Stokes equations with interphase coupling for momentum conservation. The k-epsilon closure model and volume of fluid approach were used to describe the turbulence and tracking of the free surface, respectively. Numerical simulations explored incident wave conditions, specifically spilling and plunging breakers, on both dissipative and intermediate beaches. It was found that the spatial variation of sediment concentration in the swash zone is asymmetric, while the temporal behavior is characterized by maximum sediment concentrations at the start and end of the swash cycle. The numerical results also indicated that the maximum turbulent kinetic energy and sediment flux occurs near the wave-breaking point. These predictions are in general agreement with previous observations, while the model describes the fluid and sediment phase characteristics in much more detail than existing measurements. With direct quantifications of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, sediment concentration and flux, the model provides a useful approach to improve mechanistic understanding of hydrodynamic and sediment transport in the nearshore zone.

40|$|Abstract We study a 2 × 2 {{system of}} balance laws that {{describes}} {{the evolution of a}} granular material (avalanche) flowing downhill. The original model was proposed by Hadeler and Kuttler [13]. The Cauchy problem for this system is studied by the authors in the recent papers [2, 16]. In this paper, we first consider an initial-boundary value problem. The bound-ary condition is given by the flow of the incoming material. For this problem we prove the global existence of BV solutions for a suitable class of data, with bounded but possibly large total variations. We then study the “slow erosion (or deposition) limit”. We show that, if the thickness of the <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> remains small, then the profile of the standing layer depends only on the total mass of the avalanche flowing downhill, not on the time-law describing at which rate the material slides down. More precisely, in the limit as the thickness of the <b>moving</b> <b>layer</b> tends to zero, the slope of the mountain is provided by an entropy solution to a scalar integro-differential conservation law...|$|R
