50|$|Bulk heterojunctions have an {{absorption}} layer {{consisting of}} a nanoscale blend of donor and acceptor materials. The domain sizes of this blend are {{on the order of}} nanometers, allowing for excitons with short lifetimes to reach an interface and dissociate due to the large donor-acceptor interfacial area. However, efficient bulk heterojunctions need to maintain large enough domain sizes to form a <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> that allows the donor materials to reach the hole transporting electrode (Electrode 1 in Figure 4) and the acceptor materials to reach the electron transporting electrode (Electrode 2). Without this <b>percolating</b> <b>network,</b> charges might be trapped in a donor or acceptor rich domain and undergo recombination. Bulk heterojunctions have an advantage over layered photoactive structures because they can be made thick enough for effective photon absorption without the difficult processing involved in orienting a layered structure while retaining similar level of performances.|$|E

The talc used was either conventional micron sized (conventional talc) or submicron sized particles (micro-talc). In the case of micro-talc, several talc fractions were studied, ranging between 3 and 30 wt. %. The nanocomposite crystallinity was characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). It was found that talc acted as a nucleating agent, and that only the alpha-phase was detected. Though the quantification on a Wilchinsky diagram, the talc particles were found to lie in the sample plane, the PP crystalline lamellae being orthotropically distributed perpendicularly to the talc particles. The mechanical properties of the composites were tested in different directions by tensile and compression tests. The mechanical behaviour of the composites confirms the microstructural model. For low talc loadings, the composite moduli could not be well fitted by a law of mixtures. The large difference between the observed and predicted moduli was attributed to the formation of a mixed <b>percolating</b> <b>network,</b> including talc particles and PP crystalline lamellae. At high talc loadings, that is when the mixed <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> is completely formed, the reinforcement can well be described by a parallel coupling, which indicates a classical reinforcement mechanism. Finally, the value of the critical talc fraction, at which the mixed <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> is formed, is discussed in function of the talc...|$|E

As we decrease the rotational diffusion coefficient, the state diagram is slowly transformed. Specifically, the liquid-gas coexistence region is gradually replaced by a highly dynamic <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> state.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The nonisothermal {{crystallization}} of {{low-density polyethylene}} inside <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> of ZnO nanoparticles (LDPE/ 60 vol % ZnO) was investigated via {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), and {{compared to that of}} LDPE bulk (pristine LDPE and LDPE/ 1. 15 vol % ZnO). The results revealed that crystallization behavior of LDPE inside ZnO <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> was quite different from that of LDPE bulk. The former showed 4 C higher crystallization onset temperatures contrasting to the latter, demonstrating nucleation effect of ZnO on LDPE crystalli-zation. On the other hand, much longer half-crystallization times were observed for the former, illustrating that crys-tallization of LDPE is retarded by the continuous ZnO net-work to some extent. Moreover, LDPE embedded inside ZnO network has by far larger crystallization activation energy and smaller specific free energy of the folding sur-face in contrast to LDPE bulk.

Here, we demonstrate {{a new strategy}} in which poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is distributed as a <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> within a PSA film formed from a polymer colloid. A diblock copolymer composed of PAA and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) blocks was synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and adsorbed onto soft acrylic latex particles prior to their film formation. The thin adsorbed shells on the particles create a <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> that raises the elastic modulus, creep resistance and tensile strength of the final film. When the film formation occurs at pH 10, ionomeric crosslinking occurs, and high tack adhesion is obtained in combination with high creep resistance.

This structure size and shape corresponds to the titanium dioxide crystallites that build up the TiO 2 network. In the next level, a superstructure with a radius of gyration of Rg =  32  nm {{as well as a}} fractal dimension of P =  2.5 is found. It corresponds to agglomerates of TiO 2 crystallites arranged in a 3 D order. The radius of gyration of Rg =  32  nm is in good agreement with the TiO 2 domain size of ~ 30  nm found in the TEM and ESI analysis and the presence of a percolating TiO 2 network that was already observed in these measurements is confirmed by GISAXS. Due to the GISAXS results, we verified that this <b>percolating</b> <b>network</b> exists on the macroscopic scale.

40|$|Glass matrix {{composites}} {{containing a}} conducting filler such as antimony tin oxide (ATO) or silicon carbide whiskers (SiCw) {{have the potential}} for applications such as transparent electrodes, heating elements, and electromagnetic shielding. For these applications, the composite performance is highly dependent on the microstructure of the composite and the interactions the added filler has with one another. In this research, borosilicate glass-matrix composites were fabricated using a processing method that creates segregated <b>percolated</b> <b>networks</b> at low concentrations of conducting fillers. The conducting fillers were hot pressed with the glass microspheres at temperatures near the glass transition temperature (550 °C) using various pressures. Upon hot-pressing at these low temperatures, the glass microspheres deformed into faceted polyhedra and the fillers were displaced to the edges of the glass particles, resulting in percolation. The processing method used in this study was able to bypass many of the current composition and densification issues associated with the creation of <b>percolated</b> <b>networks</b> in glass composites. In some cases, the formation of these <b>percolated</b> <b>networks</b> resulted in a 12 - 13 orders of magnitude decrease in the resistivity. Using a non-destructive electrical measurement technique, ac impedance spectroscopy (IS), the changes in the electrical properties were tracked as the conducting networks developed.

40|$|Investigating {{microstructure}} of suspensions with particles having anisotropic {{shape that}} share complex interactions is a challenging task leading to competing claims. This work investigates phase behavior {{of one such}} system: aqueous Laponite suspension, which is highly contested in the literature, using rheological and microscopic tools. Remarkably, we observe that over {{a broad range of}} Laponite (1. 4 to 4 weight %) and salt concentrations (0 to 7 mM), the system overwhelmingly demonstrates all the rheological characteristics of the sol-gel transition leading to a <b>percolated</b> <b>network.</b> Analysis of the rheological response leads to fractal dimension that primarily depends on the Laponite concentration. We also obtain the activation energy for gelation, which is observed to decrease with increase in Laponite as well as salt concentration. Significantly, the cryo-TEM images of the post-gel state clearly show presence of a <b>percolated</b> <b>network</b> formed by inter-particle bonds.

For solutions with relatively high concentrations, linear viscoelasticity deviates from the single Maxwell behavior. The concentration dependence of characteristic relaxation time and moduli {{is different in}} high and low concentration cases.

We expect that densely connected (well <b>percolated)</b> <b>networks</b> are formed in high-concentration solutions, whereas sparsely connected (weakly <b>percolated)</b> <b>networks</b> are formed in low-concentration solutions.

Our models incorporate the spatial correlation effect of micellar cores and average number of elastically active chains per micellar core (the network functionality). Our models can reproduce non-single Maxwellian relaxation and nonlinear rheological behavior such as the shear thickening and thinning. They are qualitatively consistent with experimental results. In our models, the linear rheological behavior is mainly attributable to the difference of network structures (functionalities). The nonlinear rheological behavior is attributable to the nonlinear flow rate dependence of the spatial correlation of micellar core positions. Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Phys.
