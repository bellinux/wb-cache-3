25|$|Weigmanâ€™s first {{experience}} with <b>phreaking</b> was by accident. He was on a party line when he discovered that by pressing the star and pound keys, he could {{gain access to the}} numbers of all the callers on the party line.

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{the signal}} {{radiated}} from the electron guns, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely {{and used to}} reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called Van Eck <b>phreaking.</b> Special TEMPEST shielding can mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal, however, occurs also with other display technologies and with electronics in general.|$|E

25|$|Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were {{exclusively}} {{used for}} distributing cracked software, <b>phreaking,</b> and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to {{upload and download}} files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt {{to prove that they}} were not a law enforcement officer or a lamer. The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the slang known today as leetspeak.|$|E
25|$|In cryptography, {{electromagnetic}} {{attacks are}} side-channel attacks performed {{by measuring the}} electromagnetic radiation emitted from a device and performing signal analysis on it. These attacks are a more specific type of what is {{sometimes referred to as}} Van Eck <b>phreaking,</b> with the intention to capture encryption keys. Electromagnetic attacks are typically non-invasive and passive, meaning that these attacks are able to be performed by observing the normal functioning of the target device without causing physical damage. However, an attacker may get a better signal with less noise by depackaging the chip and collecting the signal closer to the source. These attacks are successful against cryptographic implementations that perform different operations based on the data currently being processed, such as the square-and-multiply implementation of RSA. Different operations emit different amounts of radiation and an electromagnetic trace of encryption may show the exact operations being performed, allowing an attacker to retrieve full or partial private keys.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1990 piece [...] "Crime and Puzzlement: {{in advance}} of the law on the {{electronic}} frontier", Barlow wrote about his first-hand experience with Phiber Optik (Mark Abene) and Acid Phreak (Eli Ladopoulos) from the hackers group Masters of Deception, and mentions Kevin Mitnick, all of whom were engaged in phone <b>phreaking.</b> The title alludes to Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.|$|E

2500|$|Phishing on AOL {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the warez community that exchanged unlicensed software and the black hat hacking scene that perpetrated credit card fraud and other online crimes. AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because '<><' is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of <b>phreaking</b> it was adapted as 'Phishing'. AOHell, released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an instant message to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password. In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as [...] "verify your account" [...] or [...] "confirm billing information". Once the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as AOHell. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: [...] "no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an ISP simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).. In late 1995, AOL crackers resorted to phishing for legitimate accounts after AOL brought in measures in late 1995 to prevent using fake, algorithmically generated credit card numbers to open accounts. Eventually, AOL's policy enforcement forced copyright infringement off AOL servers, and AOL promptly deactivate accounts involved in phishing, often before the victims could respond. The shutting down of the warez scene on AOL caused most phishers to leave the service.|$|E
