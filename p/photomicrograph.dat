25|$|The {{study of}} whole sets of {{chromosomes}} is sometimes known as karyology. The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a <b>photomicrograph)</b> {{in a standard}} format known as a karyogram or idiogram: in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size.|$|E
25|$|Amateur Microscopy is the {{investigation}} and observation of biological and non-biological specimens for recreational purposes. Collectors of minerals, insects, seashells, and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items. Other amateurs {{may be interested in}} observing the life found in pond water and of other samples. Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium. Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional tasks that augment the spectrum of tasks of the amateur. There are even competitions for <b>photomicrograph</b> art. Participants of this pastime may either use commercially prepared microscopic slides or engage in the task of specimen preparation.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Virtual {{microscopy}} is {{used for}} teaching medical students and residents and for in-training and certification examinations in the United States. However, no existing studies compare diagnostic accuracy using virtual slides and <b>photomicrographs.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to compare diagnostic accuracy of dermatopathologists and pathologists using <b>photomicrographs</b> vs. digitized images, through a self-assessment examination, and to elucidate assessment of virtual dermatopathology. METHODS: Forty-five dermatopathologists and pathologists received a randomized combination of 15 virtual slides and <b>photomicrographs</b> with corresponding clinical photographs and information in a self-assessment examination format. Descriptive data analysis and comparison of groups were performed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy in dermatopathology using virtual dermatopathology or <b>photomicrographs</b> was similar: 0. 70 vs. 0. 73 respectively, p = 0. 465. Order of administration of virtual dermatopathology and <b>photomicrographs</b> did not affect diagnostic accuracy. The vast majority (93...|$|R

40|$|The major {{challenges}} of automatic track counting are distinguishing tracks and material defects, identifying small tracks and defects of similar size, and detecting overlapping tracks. Here we address the latter issue using WUSEM, an algorithm which combines the watershed transform, morphological erosions and labeling to separate regions in <b>photomicrographs.</b> WUSEM shows reliable results {{when used in}} <b>photomicrographs</b> presenting almost isotropic objects. We tested this method in two datasets of diallyl phthalate (DAP) <b>photomicrographs</b> and compared the results when counting manually and using the classic watershed. The mean automatic/manual efficiency ratio when using WUSEM in the test datasets is 0. 97 +/- 0. 11. Comment: 31 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
