50|$|When Abba Shaul was 20 years old, Attiya {{selected}} him to {{be tested}} by Rabbi Eliezer Silver, a prominent American rabbi who was visiting Israel together with a <b>prospective</b> <b>donor.</b> Attiya had heard that in another yeshiva which this philanthropist had visited, only one boy was able to answer the rabbi's question, and only after 20 minutes. Silver asked Abba Shaul a difficult question in the obscure Talmudic order of Tohorot (laws of ritual purity). When Abba Shaul gave his answer, Silver remarked in astonishment that he had {{asked the same question}} of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (author of Ohr Sameach and Meschech Chochma) 40 years earlier, and that that sage had given the same answer. Abba Shaul later confided to Attiya that he had had a second answer to the question as well, but since the first answer secured the donation, he didn't want to show off.|$|E
50|$|Social {{proof is}} also one of Robert Cialdini's six {{principles}} of persuasion, (along with reciprocity, commitment/consistency, authority, liking, and scarcity) which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them. One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign, who found that if a list of prior donators was longer, the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well. This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> knew, such as friends and neighbors. Cialdini's principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically, so {{people are more likely to}} be persuaded by a colleague than a superior.|$|E
40|$|It was {{reported}} earlier that {{the production of}} antibody by rabbit lymph node cells which had been incubated in vitro with Shigella antigen and transferred to recipient rabbits could be markedly reduced by the prior injection into the recipient rabbits of leucocytes of the <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> rabbits (1). A number of observations made in the system suggested that {{the suppression of the}} transferred lymph node cells thus produced was a result of the active induction of an immunologic response in the tissues of the recipient animal to the transplantation antigens of the donors ' cells (2). The suppressive effect could be transferred adoptively: if leucocytes of <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> rabbits were injected into other rabbits (not the prospective recipients) and at suitable intervals cells were obtained from the draining lymph nodes, these cells could confer on the recipient rabbits the suppression of antibody formation by antigen-incubated lymph node cells obtained from the donors (3).

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} living kidney {{donation}} (LKD) is ethically justified, despite the donor’s exposure to its inherent risks and harm, because permitting justified cases of LKD upholds the autonomous {{decision of the}} donor to pursue his/her life values and direction. Consideration of the psychological and emotional benefits of LKD and the harm from being prevented to donate allows a more comprehensive perspective of LKD. Medical and psychosocial evaluations of prospective donors function as procedural safeguards. These evaluations aim to protect the well-being of donors by minimizing the risks to the donor, while recognizing the donor’s interest in donation and rights of autonomous decision making. Evaluations also reveal pertinent information to transplant professionals to help them weigh {{the risks and benefits}} of LKD specific to individual prospective donors. For the LKD to move forward, a <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> must meet established medical and psychosocial criteria. In Singapore, the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) charges a medical social worker with performing the psychosocial evaluation of the <b>prospective</b> <b>donor,</b> and this evaluation is regarded as the expert review which a nationally-appointed transplant ethics committee relies upon in authorizing applications for living kidney donations and transplants. The thesis presents assessment domains for this psychosocial evaluation of the donor, connects these domains to normative principles purporting to justify their inclusion, and highlights those domains that may raise ethical challenges. The thesis discusses the psychosocial evaluation process as currently undertaken in Singapore, and how the inclusion of a collateral person, as contemplated by the HOTA, can be ethically problematic. While social workers are well-suited to conduct the psychosocial assessment because of their training, experience and the normative commitments of their profession, their involvement also raises some ethical concerns that are discussed. ...|$|E

Data from a higher education call center in the Western United States was used to conduct a standard linear regression analyses. The amount of time spent building rapport was found to significantly influence payment type and amount of a philanthropic donation. A greater amount of time spent building rapport lead to both a more desired method of payment and a higher donation by the prospect.

40|$|A major seal of diamond {{thin film}} {{technology}} {{research has been}} the reproducible production of p-n junctions. which are the basic units of many electronic devices. While p-type conductivity is relatively easily attained by boron doping, n-type conductivity has proved much harder to achieve. The experimental and theoretical results on <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> impurities are reviewed. In analogy with classical semiconductors, we will discuss the possibility of obtaining n-type diamond by using substitutional impurity atoms (nitrogen and phosphorus) and interstitial atoms (Li and Na). New methods of forced diffusion and ion assisted doping during growth are discussed. Methods of forced introduction of impurities into the diamond lattice have an important advantage over traditional ion implantation methods. Ion implantation introduces structural defects (vacancies, vacancy +interstitial, and their combinations) {{that are difficult to}} cure. Both methods, forced diffusion and ion assisted doping during growth, introduce no additional structural defects, except that inherent to the impurity itself. Ker. n. ords.

40|$|Small {{push pull}} {{molecules}} attract much attention as <b>prospective</b> <b>donor</b> materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). By chemical engineering, {{it is possible}} to combine a number of attractive properties such as broad absorption, efficient charge separation, and vacuum and solution processabilities in a single molecule. Here we report the synthesis and early time photophysics of such a molecule, TPA- 2 T-DCV-Me, based on the triphenylamine (TPA) donor core and dicyanovinyl (DCV) acceptor end group connected by a thiophene bridge. Using time-resolved photoinduced absorption and photoluminescence, we demonstrate that in blends with [70]PCBM the molecule works both as an electron donor and hole acceptor, thereby allowing for two independent channels of charge generation. The charge-generation process is followed by the recombination of interfacial charge transfer states that takes place on the subnanosecond time scale as revealed by time-resolved photoluminescence and nongeminate recombination as follows from the OSC performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of TPA-DCV-based molecules as donor materials for both solution-processed and vacuum-deposited OSCs...|$|E
40|$|In India, {{as in most}} {{countries}} where {{trade in human organs}} is legally prohibited, policies governing transplantation from living donors are designed to identify and exclude <b>prospective</b> <b>donors</b> who have a commercial interest in donation. The effective implementation of such policies requires resources, training and motivation on the part of health professionals responsible for organ procurement and transplantation. If professionals are unconvinced by or unfamiliar with the ethical justification of the relevant laws and policies, they may fail to perform a robust evaluation of <b>prospective</b> <b>donors</b> and transplant candidates, and to act on suspicions or evidence of illicit activities. I comment here on a recent paper by Aggarwal and Adhikary (2016), in which the authors imply that tolerance of illicit commercialism in living kidney donation programmes is not unreasonable, given the insufficiency of kidneys available for transplantation. I argue that such tolerance is unethical {{not only because of the}} harmful consequences of kidney trafficking, but because professional tolerance of commercialism undermines public trust in organ procurement programmes and impairs the development of sustainable donation and transplant systems...|$|R
