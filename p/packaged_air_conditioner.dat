40|$|Water-cooled <b>packaged</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> {{systems are}} gaining renewed {{recognition}} {{from the perspective}} of preventing the urban heat island phenomenon. Up to now, however, there have been no reliable methods for optimizing equipment capacity. For this reason, in telecommunications buildings, which demand high levels of reliability, there are cases of excessively redundant configurations, which not only result in reduced space efficiency, but also invite reduced operating efficiency due to partial load operations. In a previous report, we constructed a model for evaluating water-cooled <b>packaged</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> systems, and demonstrated {{that it was possible to}} study equipment configurations based on these reliability evaluations. In this report, using this reliability evaluation model, we showed the equipment configurations required for each level of reliability. Furthermore, we proposed a design process using the reliability evaluation methods in this research, taking into account reduced capacity of the cooling tower resulting from the passage of time...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of fault detection and diagnostics tools for air conditioning systems in the market, a fair and reliable evaluator, which tests the tools with a large array of data points {{from a variety of}} conditions and types of units, is needed. However, the number of data points necessary for reliable evaluation is too large to be generated through physical experiments. Also, existing forward models are difficult to employ for this application because of the requirement to have knowledge of many difficult-to-obtain component parameters and because of very long computation times. To address the issue, a gray box modeling approach is being developed to account for the effects of both operating conditions and faults on performance. This gray-box approach uses experimental data and inverse modeling to determine the values of parameters for each component of a vapor compression cycle. This has led to a fast and robust component-based model that is trained with a limited set of experimental data from normal and faulted conditions, and a few readily available geometrical measurements. Existing component modeling approaches have been simplified {{to reduce the number of}} parameters and computational costs. During parameter training for each component, optimization of a cost function is carried out to minimize residuals between experiments and simulation. This paper presents the models, training approaches, and validation results for individual components for a 3 -ton R 410 A <b>packaged</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Component models constructed included compressor, condenser, evaporator, fixed orifice expansion device, and refrigerant pipes.

Single unit systems are purchased and used in small commercial buildings and dwellings.

Larger air cooling towers are used in medium to larger commercial and industrial buildings. The demand for cooling and heating services in these sectors is increasing rapidly, and as PACs run on electricity, the most greenhouse-intensive energy form, this leads to high growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The lifetime electricity cost represents a large component – in most cases the major part – of the cost of owning and operating air conditioning systems. It would be expected that purchasers would give at least equal weight to energy consumption as to capital cost in the purchase of such systems.

If virtual sensors were calibrated using laboratory data, {{the amount of the}} calibration data could be minimized using design of experiment techniques. However, these techniques are not applicable to data from field operating equipment since most of the operating conditions are not controllable (e. g., ambient temperature, loads). In this paper, an algorithm to minimize the data collection period for calibration of steady-state virtual sensors is developed based on sensor accuracy, reliability and applicability. Application of the method is demonstrated for calibration of hourly electricity consumption virtual sensors for 3 <b>packaged</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioners</b> that are serving a small commercial building, and the method terminated the calibration process after about 3 weeks of data collection for all units with very accurate estimates of electricity consumption.

40|$|The use of {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) {{has been}} widely restricted. They have been replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) {{in order to protect}} the ozone layer. However, the leakage of refrigerant into air from active or end-of-life <b>air</b> <b>conditioners</b> has been a serious environmental issue owing to the high global warming potential (GWP). It has therefore been widely recognized that the replacement of HFCs with low-GWP refrigerants is a reasonable solution of the problem. In Japan, the low-GWP refrigerants such as R 1234 yf, R 1234 ze, and R 32 are considered as candidate alternatives for conventional HFC refrigerants. However, these low-GWP refrigerants are often flammable. When refrigerants leak into a space, they tend to accumulate at the floor if they are heavier than air and ventilation is inadequate. If the refrigerant concentration is higher than the lower flammable limit (LFL), there is an ignition source, and the air velocity is lower than the burning velocity, the refrigerant may ignite. When leakage occurs from an <b>air</b> <b>conditioner,</b> there is always a region where the refrigerant concentration is higher than the LFL because the refrigerant concentration is about 100 % near the outlet from the <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> Thus, it is important to understand the diffusion phenomena of the low-GWP refrigerants when acquiring sufficient information for the safety standards to assess the risks in the usage of these refrigerants. Numerical analysis is an effective tool because it is very difficult to measure the diffusion of a refrigerant in a large space. In this study, diffusion phenomena were numerically analyzed when a refrigerant leaked from a room <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (RAC), a <b>package</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (PAC) or a chiller into a large space where these were equipped.

50|$|<b>Packaged</b> {{terminal}} <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (PTAC) {{systems are}} {{also known as}} wall-split air conditioning systems. They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.|$|R

This project reviews various types of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system that is currently available in building designs. For a typical large office building, the Environmental Research Building at Boise State University was selected and modeled by the Sketch up; the building was approximately scaled to the actual size.

40|$|The multi-year {{research}} study was initiated {{to find solutions}} to improve packaged equipment operating efficiency in the field. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), with funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Building Technologies Office (BTO) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) conducted this research, development and demonstration (RD&D) study. Packaged equipment with constant speed supply fans {{is designed to provide}} ventilation at the design rate at all times when the fan is operating as required by building code. Although {{there are a number of}} hours during the day when a building may not be fully occupied or the need for ventilation is lower than designed, the ventilation rate cannot be adjusted easily with a constant speed fan. Therefore, modulating the supply fan in conjunction with demand controlled ventilation (DCV) will not only reduce the coil energy but also reduce the fan energy. The objective of this multi-year research, development and demonstration project was to determine the magnitude of energy savings achievable by retrofitting existing <b>packaged</b> rooftop <b>air</b> <b>conditioners</b> with advanced control strategies not ordinarily used for packaged units. First, through detailed simulation analysis, it was shown that significant energy (between 24 % and 35 %) and cost savings (38 %) from fan, cooling and heating energy consumption could be realized when <b>packaged</b> <b>air</b> conditioning units with gas furnaces are retrofitted with advanced control packages (combining multi-speed fan control, integrated economizer controls and DCV).

This {{is especially true for}} <b>packaged</b> (rooftop) <b>air</b> <b>conditioners</b> where preventative maintenance may not be frequent or only reserved for emergencies. Automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools for outdoor-air dampers and economizers have been proposed in the past to reduce the effort and cost for this kind of maintenance and are even required by some new building standards (CA - Title 24 2013). While qualitatively, the effects of stuck damper faults are understood, much less has been written about these faults’ impacts on cooling cycle performance and actual operating costs. An investigation of incorrect outdoor-air fraction on cooling capacity, efficiency, sensible heat ratio (SHR), and run-time is presented. An evaluation of the commanded damper position based on economizer controller logic is used to capture impacts of stuck damper faults at the full range of position and under different ambient conditions. Using experimental data, these models are validated for a 4 -ton rooftop air-conditioner (RTU) with integrated economizer. The combined effect of these impacts are analyzed based on air-side virtual sensors outputs and modified version of an economic performance degradation index (EPDI) first proposed by Li and Braun (2006). This performance index estimates fault impacts on operation costs as well as the added equipment costs due to the need to operate the air-conditioner longer. These economic performance impact outputs can be used in an optimal maintenance scheduling tool in future work...|$|R
