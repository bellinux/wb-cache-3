40|$|To explore {{experiences}} with {{and views of}} general practitioners (GPs) on a physician communication training method in primary care and its applicability and implementation in daily practice, we performed a semi-structured qualitative study of GPs’ experience of training in and implementing a communication skills training program for managing lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) which included a seminar, simulated patient consultation together with providing and receiving feedback on ones own transcript, and a seminar in a structured approach to the LRTI consultation. Seventeen out of 20 eligible GPs {{who had participated in}} the IMPAC 3 T trial and were allocated to receiving enhanced physician communication training for managing lower respiratory tract infection participated. GPs’ {{experiences with}} the physician communication training method and its specific components were positive. The method gave GPs additional tools for managing LRTI consultations and increased their sense of providing evidence-based management. During the study, GPs reported using almost all <b>communication</b> <b>items</b> covered in the training, but some GPs stated that the communication skills diluted over time, and that they continued to use a selected set of the skills. The general <b>communication</b> <b>items</b> were most regularly used. Implementation of the method in daily practice helped GPs to prescribe fewer antibiotics in LRTI with the only perceived disadvantage being time-pressure. This study suggests that GPs felt positive about the physician communication training method for enhanced management of LRTI in primary care. GPs continued to use some of the <b>communication</b> <b>items,</b> of which general <b>communication</b> <b>items</b> were the most common. Furthermore, GPs believed that implementation of the communication skills in daily practice helped them to prescribe fewer antibiotics.

A route since antiquity, it was constructed into a coherent highway by the Maurya Empire in 300BC.

After invading India over 1,500 years later, Mughals extended the Grand Trunk Road westwards from Lahore to Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan) crossing the Khyber Pass. The road was later improved and extended from Calcutta to Peshawar by the British rulers of colonial India.

40|$|Usage data is {{increasingly}} {{regarded as a}} valuable resource {{in the assessment of}} scholarly <b>communication</b> <b>items.</b> However, the development of quantitative, usage-based indicators of scholarly impact is still in its infancy. The Digital Library Research & Prototyping Team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Research library has therefore started a program to expand the set of usage-based tools for the assessment of scholarly <b>communication</b> <b>items.</b> The two-year MESUR project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, aims to define and validate a range of usage-based impact metrics, and issue guidelines with regards to their characteristics and proper application. The MESUR project is constructing a large-scale semantic model of the scholarly community that seamlessly integrates a wide range of bibliographic, citation and usage data. Functioning as a reference data set, this model is analyzed to characterize the intricate networks of typed relationships that exist in the scholarly community. The resulting characterizations guide a program for the definition and validation of usage-based impact metrics. This lecture will provide an overview of MESUR's progress so far, followed by a discussion of the architecture and standards that MESUR has adopted. The results of a preliminary analysis of the generated model will be discussed. The lecture will conclude with an overview of MESUR's future activities and expected outcomes.

No doubt the separation from ordinary society was a relief, and the freedom from calls to irregular clerical duty at Auckland was an immense gain; but the lack of the close intercourse with the inner circle of his friends was often felt, and was enhanced by the lack of <b>postal</b> <b>communication</b> with Norfolk Island, so that, instead of security of home tidings by every mail, letters and parcels could only be transmitted by chance vessels touching at that inaccessible island, where there was no harbour for even the 'Southern Cross' to lie.|$|R

30|$|The {{processing}} of an application from Morocco and Turkey with insurance periods in Europe only is facilitated by full informatization of insurance records {{in most of}} these countries. As a result, applications to the east corridor countries once received by <b>postal</b> <b>communication</b> can be responded in normal cases, by Austria and Germany, with a preliminary approval within days and a definite approval within weeks. If additional written records are required (as may be the case in the western corridor countries), the weeks will become months. If insurance periods were acquired in the sending countries before or after returning home, then their collection and verification can be time-consuming, particularly if the date of birth or name is unclear. If benefit information from the sending country is required to establish totalization or the level of top-ups when residing in the host country, the delay can be substantial as is the loss of benefit disbursement or delayed payment of top-ups.|$|R

40|$|British {{presence}} has had {{a profound}} influence on economic development in British and independent India, and {{the debate on the}} nature of this influence has been raging for decades. At one end is the imperialist view that India benefitted from British rule and at the other is the nationalist view that India is still struggling from the burden of misrule. This debate has been enriched by in-depth research on the railways, among other topics; yet the closely related postal network has received no attention. Since part of the disagreement in this debate stems from different perceptions of intention, I approach the question by asking what effects the British intended the post to have. I use economic theory to propose, a priori, three motives for a state establishing <b>postal</b> <b>communication</b> - political, commercial and welfare, and some postal characteristics that serve as evidence for each. The railway literature too attributes the construction of railway lines to these three motives. Using newly collected and digitised data on post office locations and policy, I show that the British did indeed have these three motives for establishing and expanding <b>postal</b> <b>communication</b> in India. Presentation of evidence is divided in two - Poona district in Bombay province, and the whole Indian subcontinent. I compare the allocation of post offices in Poona in 1881 with a hypothetical benevolent social planner's network, which ensures that post offices are as near as possible to as many people as possible. Differences that emerge are easily explained by the three motives. A probit model shows what village characteristics are strongest predictors of the presence of post offices. A detailed qualitative discussion of the evidence for the subcontinent permits an evaluation of the relative importance of the three motives. Since the British engaged in trade with India and also governed India, the political and commercial motives were important and linked. The welfare role of the post, though genuine, came later as a by-product of the network already established for political and commercial reasons. The service-for-the-people role of the post was secondary to its tool-for-governance role, both temporally, and in terms of importance...|$|R
50|$|As {{assessed}} by Jose Montero y Vidal, a Spanish historian who wrote {{much about the}} history of the islands, Pasqual Enrile was one of the most intelligent and industrious who have ever ruled the Philippines.

The administration of the country is indebted to him for regulations and procedures that are scientific and orderly, in all the branches that have contributed to the development of the general welfare, making considerable increase in the public wealth. Agriculture, commerce, and navigation likewise experienced the beneficial results of this illustrious governor's judicious management. His term of office was the source of the rapid progress which has been made from that time by these most important factors of the general welfare, thanks to the impulse received from the measures, dictated by him, which conduced to the natural development of those industries.|$|R
