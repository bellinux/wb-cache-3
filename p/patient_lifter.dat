40|$|A major {{criterion}} {{for the application}} of rehabilitation robots in gait therapy is the question to what extent the machine is able to facilitate physiologically correct muscle activation patters in the patients leg muscles in order to achieve an optimal gait training effect The EMG data presented in this paper is based on intermediate results of a study with 8 healthy subjects (5 male, 3 female) to evaluate the end-effector based gait rehabilitation robot HapticWalker in position controlled mode. The study investigated two different walking trajectories (floor, upstairs) at three different cadences (45, 60, 90 steps/min) in three different modes (free walking, HapticWalker with vertical CoM motion, HapticWalker without vertical CoM motion). Results show that muscle EMGs measured from all relevant leg muscles have the same phasic and rhythmic muscle activation patterns on the HapticWalker as with free walking. Even though there are differences in patterns of dedicated muscles, the authors observed reduced amplitudes and slightly delayed activation on the HapticWalker compared to free walking. No differences in EMGs were observed between the two different HapticWalker modes (with vertical CoM motion, cancelled CoM motion), which might eliminate the need for an active trunk suspension system in the latter case. A passive <b>patient</b> <b>lifter</b> would significantly reduce the complexity of the machine construction, all advanced training modes (e. g. dynamic body weight reduction) could then be accomplished via compliant behavior of the freely programmable footplates. Numerous EMG measurements with healthy subjects and non-ambulatory stroke patients were performed on the predecessing electromechanical Gait Trainer GT I and showed that physiologically relevant findings from healthy subjects (e. g. correct phasic muscle activation) can be transferred to a certain extent to stroke patients, but nevertheless studies with stroke patients on the robotic gait trainer HapticWalke.

40|$|Ten {{athletes with}} distal biceps tendon {{ruptures}} {{that had been}} anatomically repaired with a double-incision technique were reviewed to determine their functional recovery. All of the patients were men, {{with an average age}} of 40 years (range, 25 to 49). Eight of the 10 <b>patients</b> were weight <b>lifters</b> or body builders, and 7 had participated on a competitive level {{at some point in their}} athletic careers. Six injured their dominant extremity, and 4 their nondominant extremity. Isokinetic muscle testing of supination and flexion was performed in 8 patients and the results were compared to a control group. Followup averaged 50 months (range, 12 to 105). Patients uniformly graded their subjective results a...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} equipment handling problems of nurses on the Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Department {{and training of}} new nurses for equipment handling. New nurses are therefore overloaded with lots of new information concerning nursing care, documentation, instruments, team etc. This dissertation consists of two parts ? theoretical and empirical one. The theoretical part deals with ARD description, monitoring, technical equipment, work of nurse on ARD and her adaptation process. The empirical part used a qualitative research method. Information was gathered from a semi-structured interview. The current state in context of nurse work with technical equipment on ARD was analysed {{in the first period}} of research. Tutorial material was created on the basis of gathered information which was applied in practice. Feedback on created tutorial material was found in the last period. The focus group was created by 10 respondents who work as general nurses on ARD in selected hospitals. Four goals and five research questions were stated during the investigation. The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with; the second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out; the third goal was to create training material concerning technology, not only for new nurses on ARD; and the fourth goal was to find out feedback on provided tutorial material from nurses on ARD. Research questions were: 1. What technical equipment do nurses operate on ARD? 2. How are new nurses on ARD trained? 3. What means are used during the training of new nurses? 4. According to nurses, what information regarding technology should a handbook for nurses on ARD contain? 5. What opinion do nurses on ARD have of created training material?The first goal was to map what technical equipment nurses on ARD are working with. From research results it is evident that nurses on ARD operate lots of equipment ? monitors, infusion pumps, linear pumps, ventilators, dialysis, suction bottles, defibrillators, laminar boxes, ICP monitors, <b>patient</b> <b>lifters,</b> medical heaters and coolers, nebulizers, plasmaferesis, PICCO, LIDCO, Vigileo, enternal pumps, anti-decubitus mattresses, anaesthetic equipment, EKG, haemoglobinmeters, glucometers, ABR analyser, bronchoscopes and Level. The second goal was to find out how the training of new nurses on ARD is carried out. Research results are different in this area. Every respondent undertook a different form of adaptation process in variously long intervals. The third goal was to create training material concerning technology not only for new nurses on ARD. Training material was created on the basis of discussion analysis with respondents and didactic principles had been kept during its creation (visualisation, connection theory with practise, scientism, adequacy, actuality, feedback, consciousness and activity, individualization and orderliness). The fourth goal was to find out feedback on provided tutorial material from nurses on ARD. Training material was given to all respondents for approximately 14 days and afterwards feedback was obtained. The result was that all respondents liked the training material very much. Research results will be provided to head nurses on ARD from chosen hospitals where the research was carried out. The created training material will be provided to ARD in hospital Pelhrimov, p. o. Specific training material for individual workplaces and equipment will be created for other hospitals on the basis of declared wishes of respondents. We anticipate that the training material will not only be beneficial for new nurses on ARD...|$|R
