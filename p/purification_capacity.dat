50|$|Kolkata is {{an example}} of how natural {{wetlands}} are sometimes being utilized in developing countries. Using the <b>purification</b> <b>capacity</b> of wetlands, the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) has pioneered a system of sewage disposal. Built to house one million people, Kolkata is now home to over 10 million, many living in slums. But the 8,000-hectare East Kolkata Wetlands Ramsar Site, a patchwork of tree-fringed canals, vegetable plots, rice paddies and fish ponds - and the 20,000 people that work in them - daily transform one-third of the city's sewage and most of its domestic refuse into a rich harvest of fish and fresh vegetables. For example, the Mudially Fishermen's Cooperative Society is a collective of 300 families that lease 70 hectares into which wastewater from the city is released. Through a series of natural treatment processes - including the use of Eichhornia crassipes and other plants for absorbing oil, grease and heavy metals - the Cooperative has turned the area into a thriving fish farm and nature park.|$|E

To improve microorganism nutritional equilibrium and hence to enhance the <b>purification</b> <b>capacities,</b> a Biological Activator Formulated Material (BAFM) was developed, which {{is a mixture of}} solid nutrients dissolving slowly in a liquid phase. This solid was previously validated on mineral pollutants: ammonia and hydrogen sulphide. To evaluate the efficiency of such a material for biodegradation of some organic compounds, a simple experiment using an activated sludge batch reactor was carried out. The pollutants (sodium benzoate, phenol, p-nitrophenol and 2 - 4 -dichlorophenol) were in the concentration range 100 to 1200 mg L(- 1). The positive impact of the formulated material was shown. The improvement of the degradation rates was in the range 10 - 30 %. This was the consequence of the low dissolution of the nutrients incorporated during material formulation, followed by their consumption by the biomass, as shown for urea used as a nitrogen source. Owing to its twofold interest (mechanical resistance and nutritional supplementation), the Biological Activator Formulated Material seems to be a promising material.

This rate can be increased in an air diffusion system by subjecting the culture to high shear and high pressure. A study {{of the effects of}} high pressure and high shear on the reaction rates in an {{activated sludge}} system is presented in this thesis. These effects were determined by varying the pressure and shear levels while keeping the other parameters constant. The following tests were performed to compare the results obtained at the different operating conditions : 1. Oxygen uptake rates. 2. Biological growth rates. 3. Type of biota present. 4. BOD and COD removal efficiencies. The conclusions drawn from these test results are as follows: 1.

A major disadvantage however, is the inability of protein A to bind certain subclasses of IgG as well as IgG from certain species; a pitfall that can be overcome with the display of either protein G in combination with protein A, or with protein L which binds a range of immunoglobulin based on light chain interactions. Here we display both the binding domain of protein A with the binding domain of protein G on a single platform; the surface of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolyester granules.

The binders tested were phenolic resin, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate and clay. We also tested the influence of using a solvent. The SEM analysis indicates that the monoliths are made of filaments that can be considered activated carbon fibres. The type of binder influences the fibre orientation, degradation and materials shrinkage, the worst results being obtained {{from the use of}} polymethylmethacrylate and polystyrene in toluene. The best results are obtained when the monoliths were produced only with acrylic fibre and with phenolic resin as binder.

40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrated}} {{the efficacy of}} mangrove retaining nutrients and, in particular, {{the ability of the}} mineral component of the buffer in its high soil phosphorus levels. In general, the mangroves have been considered as important sinks of nutrients due to its high <b>capacity</b> <b>purification</b> of effluents. However, depending on the geochemical conditions exist, these soils can act as a source of phosphorus to other environments and / or coastal waters. Given that the geochemical behavior of phosphorus and its role in eutrophication of water bodies, is best measured by the behavior of its different fractions, this paper aims at a fractionation of the different forms of phosphorus in wetlands impacted by different effluent. The objective of this project is to study three areas in order to assess how activities impacting interfere in the process of nutrient cycling (with special emphasis on the dynamics of phosphorus forms) and, as the marsh supports the stress caused by these activities. Also, if you evaluate the potential for eutrophication of each human activities. Taking into consideration the impact that these environments suffer as a result of separate activities, were established the following areas of study: a marsh impacted by effluents from shrimp, a marsh impacted by effluents, and a control area located in a preserved area that still finds is little affected by human impacts. The samples were determined pH, Eh, salinity, grain size and the total content of C and P. In addition, extraction was performed sequentially phosphorus which allows differentiation of fractions 7 : P exchangeable (NaCl-P), P associated with iron oxides (Fe-P); organic P (AH-P), the bound phosphorus hydroxides Al (Al-P), P associated with compounds of calcium (Ca-P); phosphorus associated refracting matter (P-RES) and unreacted phosphorus (P-NR). The results indicate that the discharge of effluents in mangrove increases the amount of phosphorus in these environments, especially in organic form, the phosphorus bound to carbonate is the major inorganic fraction in these environments...|$|R
