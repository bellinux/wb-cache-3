50|$|Various duties include {{shipping}} and receiving, assembling, testing, operating, protecting, inspecting, storing, {{and maintenance of}} all types of conventional munition systems. Munitions Systems specialists also operate and maintain a wide variety of equipment and electronic gear, from <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks,</b> 40 ft tractor-trailer combination vehicles, all-terrain 10,000 pound forklifts, and 100,000 pound forklifts. The Munitions Storage Area (MSA) can be responsible for munitions from small arms ammunition (for rifles and pistols) up to large-scale guided bombs.|$|R
5000|$|Electric forklifts - {{powered by}} {{lead-acid}} batteries or sometimes lithium-ion batteries, {{several types of}} forklifts are electric: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks.</b> Electric forklifts are primarily used indoors on flat, even surfaces. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in food-processing and healthcare sectors.|$|R
2500|$|Handling {{goods on}} pallets was a {{significant}} improvement over using hand trucks or carrying sacks or boxes by hand and greatly speeded up loading and unloading of trucks, rail cars and ships. [...] Pallets can be handled with <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks</b> or forklift trucks which began being used in industry in the 1930s and became widespread by the 1950s. [...] Loading docks built to architectural standards allow trucks or rail cars to load and unload at the same elevation as the warehouse floor.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> {{also known}} as a pallet truck, pallet pump, pump truck, dog, [...] or jigger is a tool used to lift and move pallets. Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a {{forklift}} and are intended to move heavy or light pallets within a warehouse.|$|E
50|$|DOD Unit loads {{generally}} use 40 x 48 in pallets, {{are less}} than 4000 lb, weatherproof, and stack 16 ft high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. The standard describes tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention, and disassembly.|$|E
5000|$|A {{unit load}} {{combines}} individual items or items in shipping containers into single [...] "units" [...] {{that can be}} moved easily with a <b>pallet</b> <b>jack</b> or forklift truck. A unit load packs tightly into warehouse racks, intermodal containers, trucks, and boxcars, yet can be easily broken apart at a distribution point, usually a distribution center, wholesaler, retail store, etc.|$|E
50|$|Pallets make {{it easier}} to move heavy stacks. Loads with pallets under them can be hauled by {{forklift}} trucks of different sizes, or even by hand-pumped and hand-drawn <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks.</b> Movement is easy on a wide, strong, flat floor: concrete is excellent. The greatest investment needed for economical pallet use is in the construction of commercial or industrial buildings. Passage through doors and buildings must be possible. To help this issue, some later pallet standards (the europallet and the U.S. Military 35 Ã— 45.5 in) are designed to pass through standard doorways.|$|R
50|$|I.D. Systems' {{industrial}} vehicle management systems {{are used by}} manufacturers, distributors, retailers, government entities, and other organizations with powered industrial trucks (forklifts, tow tractors, <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks,</b> etc.) to monitor and evaluate fleet operations, track vehicle movement, and manage vehicle operators. The system consists of four elements: a wireless computer installed on the vehicle, wireless communication nodes placed within the facility, system software hosted either on site or in a remote data center, and user software configured in either a client-server or thin-client (Internet browser-based) architecture. Data may be transmitted by any combination of Wi-Fi, cellular or UHF wireless technologies.|$|R
50|$|The jack is steered by a 'tiller' like lever {{that also}} {{acts as the}} pump handle for raising the jack. A small handle on the tiller {{releases}} the hydraulic fluid, causing the forks to lower. The front wheels inside {{the end of the}} forks are mounted on levers attached to linkages that go to levers attached to the jack cylinder. As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. The pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. Oftentimes, <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks</b> are used to move and organize pallets inside a trailer, especially when there is no forklift truck access or availability.|$|R
5000|$|Material {{handling}} {{methods and}} equipment {{are independent of}} waving. Each set of methods (e.g., order picking, batch picking, bulk picking) and equipment (e.g., conveyor and sorter, ASRS, order picker, <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> fork lift) will yield a different expected productivity rate for management to use in determining the number of staff-hours to assign to each function by wave.|$|E
5000|$|Pallets {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used means to store and move product in a distribution center. There are many specialized devices (material handling equipment or MHE) used to handle pallets - see forklift truck, <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> pallet inverter, and unit load .....Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS). Pallets are stored on the floor, may be stacked, and may be stored in pallet racking.|$|E
50|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory {{team has}} built a {{portable}} Mini Muon Tracker (MMT). This muon tracker is constructed from sealed aluminum drift tubes, which are grouped into twenty-four 4 ft planes. The drift tubes measure particle coordinates in X and Y with a typical accuracy of several hundred micrometers. The MMT can be moved via a <b>pallet</b> <b>jack</b> or a fork lift. If a nuclear material has been detected {{it is important to}} be able to measure details of its construction in order to correctly evaluate the threat.|$|E
40|$|A {{warehouse}} management system is {{a key part of}} the supply chain and controls the movement of goods within a warehouse. Usually the state of a warehouse is managed in a central database, which must be updated for every storage and retrieval activity. The entire process is prone to errors, because it relies on manual activities performed by employees. This paper presents a technique to monitor the manual transportation processes of goods in a warehouse, in order to update the database automatically. In the proposed scenario, transport vehicles such as forklift trucks or <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks</b> are equipped with wireless sensor nodes and every storage and retrieval activity is reported to the {{warehouse management}} system. Tracking of transport vehicles is performed with nanoLOC sensor nodes, which offer range measurement capabilities. This radio positioning system determines the range between two devices by measuring the signal propagation delay. The paper describes the tracking of tr ansport vehicles with range measurements and trilateration using the Extended Kalman Filter. It presents experimental results of tracking a forklift truck in a warehouse...|$|R
40|$|For Use Indoors vs. Outdoors- If {{the lift}} {{will be used}} indoors, you will {{probably}} want an electric forklift. Electric lifts produce no harmful emissions and are quieter. Outdoors, you will generally want an internal combustion (IC) forklift. Whether gas or diesel, these machines are less expensive than electric lifts with a similar capacity. They're also waterproof, unlike electric models. For use on uneven ground, rough terrain forklifts use large pneumatic tires and an extendable lifting arm. If you're going back and forth, or using the lift in a semi-enclosed area like a loading dock, a liquid propane (LPG) forklift {{might be the best}} choice. They produce less exhaust than other types of IC lifts, so they can be used indoors, but can also operate safely outdoors. If for indoor warehouse use- There are many specialized types of forklifts designed for the crowded conditions inside warehouses. These machines are all electric powered. ï¿½ Walkies and riders are simply motorized <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks.</b> They are great for moving palletized loads around a warehouse, but don't provide {{much in the way of}} safety or lifting heights. These are the least expensive type of lifts...|$|R
40|$|Ergonomic job analysis, {{intervention}} design, {{and intervention}} implementation are essential components of an ergonomics {{program designed to}} reduce worker exposure to risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. As part of a 4 -year study to reduce overexer-tion injuries in the service parts division of a major automaker, intervention case studies were identified {{that could be used}} at multiple facilities across the division. Interventions were developed and implemented. The three case studies include 1) self-elevating powered vehicle for transporting parts throughout the facility and for reaching to high bin loca-tions; 2) lift and tilt <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks</b> for packing small parts into large bin-like containers; and 3) single-level telescoping conveyor used for delivering hand-held totes for subsequent sorting operations. Several analysis methods were used to assess worker exposure before and after intervention implementation (biomechanical analysis, posture analysis, worker interviews, and activity analysis). Following implementation, a decrease in exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders was documented. Worker interviews revealed accep-tance and agreement that risk factors associated with the targeted tasks were reduced. Each case study includes a description of the implementation hurdles and can serve as both pri...|$|R
5000|$|Intermediate bulk {{containers}} are stackable containers {{mounted on}} a pallet designed to be moved using a forklift or a <b>pallet</b> <b>jack.</b> IBCs have a volume range that is situated between drums and tanks, hence the term [...] "intermediateâ€œ. The most common sizes are 1040 L and 1250 L (the 1040 liter IBCs are often listed as being 1000 liters). Cube-shaped IBCs give a particularly good utilization of storage capacity compared to palletized drums - one 275 gallon IBC is equivalent to five 55 gal drums, and a 330-gallon IBC is equivalent to six 55 gallon drums.|$|E
5000|$|Proper {{handling}} of panel paintings specifically {{are similar to}} that of paintings and other two-dimensional works. Planning the move (including using the proper amount of staff), communication within the handling staff during the move, the use of nitrile or other recommended gloves, the use of painting carts and other proper tools (e.g. using a <b>pallet</b> <b>jack</b> or furniture dolly when moving a panel painting within a crate), handling with two hands or in tandem, etc. are recommended. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material provide general handbooks that discuss the proper handling and care of paintings.|$|E
50|$|A pallet , {{sometimes}} inaccurately {{called a}} skid (a skid has no bottom deck boards), is a flat transport structure that supports goods {{in a stable}} fashion while being lifted by a forklift, <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> front loader, work saver, or other jacking device, or a crane. A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load which allows handling and storage efficiencies. Goods or shipping containers are often placed on a pallet secured with strapping, stretch wrap or shrink wrap and shipped. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the wooden box and the wooden barrel, as it works well with modern packaging like corrugated boxes and Intermodal containers commonly used for bulk shipping.|$|E
40|$|The {{bells of}} Iowa State {{are among the}} most iconic symbols of the university. Alumni and fans enjoy {{listening}} to the Campanile, but because they may be located throughout the nation, most are unable to come to campus to hear them. Design is currently underway to build a one-fifth scale travelling Campanile-Carillon to visually reflect the landmark and will be playable just as the original. The carillon will be more accessible in comparison to the Campanile so the general public can operate it and see how the bell mechanisms work. This will instill an interest and appreciation for music, engineering, and the history of this antique instrument. It will also be used to attract more students to continue their higher education at Iowa State University. But in order for this model to safely and reliably travel across the country, logistics need to be established. All potential trailers and <b>pallet</b> <b>jacks</b> were analyzed to determine the best suited option. Additionally, the setup, teardown, and trailer loading procedures have been developed to maintain a safe environment and increase efficiency. The hope of this project is to bring the bells of Iowa State to the rest of Iowa and the nation...|$|R
50|$|The pods ascend and descend at 45-degree angles, using a cogway on the truss. A {{hinge point}} {{at the top of}} the pod permits a level floor at all times. A small ramp at a station permits access by a wheelchair, bicycle or <b>pallet</b> <b>jack.</b> Access to wheelchairs meets {{statutory}} requirements for disabled access. Access to pallet jacks permits revenues from pallets of light cargo, which in some cities can be quite profitable. Only a two by seven metre (7x20 ft.) area on the ground is needed for a minimal station. High traffic stations are possible by parking several pods at an angle to the street. These larger stations need only a five by fifteen metre area (16x50 ft.) to park five pods.|$|E
5000|$|Powered pallet jacks, {{also known}} as {{electric}} pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets. Some contain a platform for the user to stand while moving pallets. The powered <b>pallet</b> <b>jack</b> is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Some contain a type of dead man's switch rather than a brake to stop the machine should the user need to stop quickly or leave the machine while it is in use. Others use a system known as [...] "plugging" [...] where in the driver turns the throttle from forward to reverse (or vice versa) to slow and stop the machine, as the dead man's switch is used in emergencies only.|$|E
50|$|Another {{standard}} for unit loads is MIL-STD-1660, a {{standard for}} ammunition unit loads. DOD unit loads generally use 40 x 48 in pallets, which unfortunately do not pack efficiently into ISO containers. They weigh less than 4000 lb to limit the stresses on handling equipment. They are weatherproof, and stack 16 ft high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. MIL-STD-1660 mandates that loads must never be less than {{the width of a}} pallet, while permitting some overhang. The markings are LOGMARS bar codes and standard inventory numbers. The standard describes major parts of the logistic path, including storage, ship, air, truck, forklift and sling (i.e. ship-to-ship and parachute). There are auxiliary standards for ship-to-ship transfers, and amphibious transfers. There are tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention (i.e. weather), and safe disassembly.|$|E
5000|$|References to {{the early}} modern pallets types are slim {{with a string of}} patents showing parts of the development. The {{earliest}} may be a U.S. patent on a skid from 1924 describing Howard T. Hallowell's [...] "Lift Truck Platform". In the late 1930s, pallets became more commonplace with the newer forklift types. George Raymond filed for a patent in 1938 (granted US Patent 2178646 in 1939 [...] ) for a pallet designed to complement a new <b>pallet</b> <b>jack</b> design; the essential features of both are still in common use today. A 1939 patent from Carl Clark shows type of pallet with steel stringers. War time developments were often just patented after the war, so there is a patent from Robert Braun on a four-way pallet in 1945, and a patent from Norman Cahners (a U.S. Navy Supply Officer) shows a disposable pallet type in 1949. The complete construction principle of a modern four-way pallet is described by Darling Graeme in 1949.|$|E
50|$|Hand trucks (including {{carts and}} dollies), the {{simplest}} type of industrial truck, cannot transport or stack pallets, is non-powered, and requires the operator to walk. A <b>pallet</b> <b>jack,</b> which cannot stack a pallet, uses front wheels mounted inside {{the end of}} forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes {{referred to as a}} forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and stack pallets and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding {{in order to reduce the}} truckâ€™s turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to explore {{intervention}} concepts aimed at addressing the workers â€™ needs in grocery distribution centers. Worker interviews indicated {{that many of the}} items that they handle are heavy, including cases of meat (up to 80 lbs), juice, water, and detergent. Management and safety personnel who participated in a brainstorming focus group session indicated key ergonomic issues include the weight of the meat cases, extended reaching, and even more specifically, overhead reaching. Intervention ideas discussed during the brainstorming indicated a need for mechanisms that reduce reach distances by keeping product close to the order picking aisle and mechanisms that relieve the physical burden of handling heavy product from their storage slots onto the order-pickerâ€™s <b>pallet</b> <b>jack...</b>|$|E
