While it is possible to generate multiples of the supply frequency such as 150 Hz using a standard induction motor driving an AC generator, there are limitations. This type of generator featured rotor mounted windings which limited the <b>peripheral</b> <b>speed</b> of the rotor due to the centrifugal forces on these windings.

40|$|Investigating {{high-speed}} {{grinding up}} to 500 m/s had to await {{new developments in}} wheel design, machine design and a balancing system. An efficient realisation of cutting speeds up to 500 m/s requires wheel diameters from 200 mm to 350 mm and spindle speeds of 30. 000 r. p. m. Recording of the vibration behavior of available high-frequency spindles revealed that balancing of the spindle/ grinding wheel system is practical only at operating speed. Power measurements at different <b>peripheral</b> <b>speeds</b> and with various wheel diameters have shown that {{a sharp increase in}} the power losses can be measured particulary in the supersonic range. This occurs because of increasing air friction losses at the surface of the rotating wheel. The smallest possible wheel diameter should always be selected. In addition, there are power losses due to the use of a coolant and wheel cleaning. Our test results show that the flow rates and pressures of the coolant wheel flushing fluid are far more important than in the p ast. The grinding forces were reduced by up to 50 % during surface grinding of 16 MnCr 5 steel by increasing the wheel speed to 340 m/s.

5000|$|In 1908 Westinghouse {{engineer}} Rudolph Goldschmidt devised {{an intricate}} method to enable an alternator to generate high frequency without requiring excessive speeds. [...] His technique was to exploit resonance and the nonlinear saturation {{characteristic of the}} iron rotor to use the alternator as a frequency multiplier {{as well as a}} generator. [...] By attaching tuned circuits called [...] "reflector" [...] circuits to the stator and rotor windings, Goldschmidt found that an alternator could be made to produce output power at a multiple (harmonic) of its fundamental rotational frequency PU. [...] The output frequency of the Goldschmidt alternator waswhere N was a small integer, the harmonic number. N was limited to 4 in most practical machines, as losses due to leakage flux increased rapidly with increasing N. Thus a 100 kHz Goldschmidt machine with P = 300 poles would require a rotor speed of only U = 5000 RPM, one-fourth that of an equivalent Alexanderson machine. 80% efficiency could be achieved, but {{in order to keep the}} leakage flux low enough to achieve this the machine required a very narrow clearance of 0.8 mm between the stator and rotor, which could weigh 5 tons and be moving at a <b>peripheral</b> <b>speed</b> of 200 meters per second. [...] Another challenge was that to reduce hysteresis losses in the iron rotor at radio frequencies, it had to be made of very thin foil laminations, [...]05 mm (.002 in) thick, separated by paper sheets, so the rotor was more than 1/3 paper. No rotor of this construction had ever been used in a large machine. The limit of output frequency for Goldschmidt alternators, as well as other alternator technologies, was about 200 kHz.|$|E

Control-space diagrams reveal that speed ratio has little effect on the flow structure when S 0 and aspect ratios are small (except near S = 1).

40|$|The {{experiment}} proposed aims {{to evidence}} and {{to measure the}} deflection of light rays induced by the source speed upon emission, and to discern it from the aberration of light rays induced by the observer speed. The method stands in creating a speed asymmetry between that of the source {{and that of the}} observer, and relies on the centrifugation of a light source at ultrahigh speed. When source and observer have the same speed, such as when being both on the same inertial system, the deflection and the aberration compensate and their net effect is null. So, in order to circumscribe the odds of inertial systems and to isolate these speed-induced effects it has instead been appealed to a centrifugal system, since it allows infringing symmetry between the source and the observer speeds. Three cases are considered. (a) Centrifugation of the source fixed {{at one end of the}} rotor arm, while the detector is fixed on the rotor axis. This configuration of the experiment aims to unveil that due to the <b>peripheral</b> <b>speed</b> of the source the beam is deflected forward, so it impinges on the centric detector slightly shifted from its position when the system was not rotating. (b) The positions of the source and the detector are interchanged, so the source <b>peripheral</b> <b>speed</b> is then null and thus no speed-induced deflection ensues, but due to the observer <b>peripheral</b> <b>speed</b> there is a speed-induced aberration since during the beam time-of-flight the detector has slightly moved side-way. However, this time the spot shifts in opposite direction and hence the effect of centrifugation is not reciprocal. (c) The source and the detector are fixed at the two ends of the rotor arms. In this case the beam deflection and aberration add, since their speed vectors have opposite directions and each shift of the spot on the detector is double since the time-of-flight is double.
