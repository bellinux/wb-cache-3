5|$|The University of Virginia has a {{large number}} of social fraternities. This list {{includes}} active all-male fraternities and coeducational fraternities that identify themselves primarily as social organizations, as opposed to <b>professional,</b> <b>service,</b> or honor organizations. Several of these fraternities were founded much earlier in the university's history, but went inactive and were reestablished later on. In these cases, the establishment date reflects the date that the fraternity's original charter was granted.|$|E

5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in <b>professional,</b> <b>service,</b> and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E

Aim: Compare aspects of clients’ experiences with social networks to experiences with <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> and discuss the implications of the findings for service delivery.

5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSIn today‟s {{competitive}} marketplace, marketing {{activities are}} used to influence the buyer‟s perception of a <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm and therefore the brand image. To compete, <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms could leverage intangible assets such as brand image to improve perceptions, create differentiation and positively influence the procurement process. The purpose {{of this research was}} to explore which of the marketing activities as specified in the literature are most effective in influencing client perceptions of the brand, or brand image, a driver of brand equity, for <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms. The research first evaluated the relative importance of brand among criteria used when procuring <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> and then identified which marketing activities were perceived as most effective for developing the brand image of <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms. The research method employed in this study was qualitative in nature and utilised in-depth interviews of 12 senior executives of major businesses based in Johannesburg. The study revealed that brand is considered among the most important criteria when purchasing <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> only when the client requires a <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm to complete an assignment that incorporates a high level of interaction or results in a high level of interaction with key stakeholders. However, direct relationships and direct experience could easily engender the same level of trust if the <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm has adequate opportunity to engage with key stakeholders through appropriate marketing activities. The most effective marketing communication activities for developing the brand image of <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> are those that provide a degree of direct experience. The research found that marketing activities that provided a focused personal experience were recommended and {{were also more likely to}} have higher levels of participation. For emerging <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms, a focused approach to a specific segment of client firms in an industry, using marketing activities that provide select client staff with an experience of the <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm, is likely to yield favourable result...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{case study}} was {{to address the problem}} that little research has specifically explored social media marketing in <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms. Many <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms {{do not know how to}} best use social media to achieve their business development goals. Some firms may believe social media entails a risk to their reputation, and improper use of social media could lead to negative business outcomes if time and resources are wasted. This is a problem because <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firms are widely known to have unique characteristics differentiating them from other industries; therefore, general knowledge of social media marketing remains a challenge. To address this problem, this research sought to generate a rich description of the use of social media marketing by one global <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm. The research was guided by three research questions: How have social media affected the marketing of <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> in one <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm? How has one <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm responded to the rise of social media,and with what effects on its business outcomes? What lessons arise from the case of one <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> firm with regard to success strategies for leveraging social media in marketing? The study examined KPMG&rsquo;s use of foursocial media platforms (blogs, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) to enhance its brand, create a unified web identity, and drive traffic to its website.

25|$|The University of Virginia has {{a number}} of Greek {{organizations}} on campus, encompassing the traditional social fraternities and sororities as well as coeducational <b>professional,</b> <b>service,</b> and honor fraternities. Social life at the university was originally dominated by debating societies. The first fraternity chapter founded at UVA was Delta Kappa Epsilon in 1852, and it was quickly followed by many more; the University of Virginia was the birthplace of two national fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha, which exist at the university to this day. Through the twentieth century, the Greek system at UVA evolved to encompass social sororities, professional fraternities and sororities, service fraternities, honor societies, black fraternities and sororities, and multicultural fraternities and sororities. Roughly 30% of the student body are members of social Greek organizations, with additional students involved with service, professional, and honor fraternities.

25|$|The {{development}} of ambulance services in Germany {{started in the}} late 19th century. Typically volunteer aid organizations, some private companies in larger cities and so called rescue corps provided ambulance services mostly with very little training or medical background. After World War II, prehospital care in Germany was in its infancy; in most predominately rural areas the German Red Cross provided an ambulance service. In West Germany the Fire Departments provided 24/7 service as a <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> in some cities and urban centres or towns. With the increase in individual motorized traffic {{at the beginning of}} the 1950s, road accidents also increased, leading to greater numbers of both injuries and fatalities. This encouraged the formation of several other emergency services, for example the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe e.V., a subsidiary of the German Order of St.John. Still, the EMS role was primarily done on a voluntary basis by individuals with only minimal training in emergency health care, using simple transport vehicles with almost no medical equipment. However, more and more it became evident, that not only transport saves live of patients, but treating them on-scene.|$|E
