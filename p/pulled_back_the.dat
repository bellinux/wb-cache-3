5|$|Early {{in the wet}} stage, a {{group of}} nine riders broke away, only to be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> peloton, with a second group of {{nineteen}} also failing. An unsuccessful move from Tony Martin was followed by an attack by Vincenzo Nibali over the Col de Grimone {{and the formation of}} an elite five-strong group on descent with Rui Costa, Alejandro Valverde, and Tony Gallopin. This attack reduced the main group of chasers and caused the abandonment of several riders. The advantage of the break was over three minutes as they climbed the Col de Rousset, with Nibali briefly escaping on the subsequent descent.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Canadian Division {{had made}} an attempt to capture the {{northern}} half of Hill 145 at around 3:15pm, briefly capturing the peak before a German counterattack retook the position. The Germans occupying the small salient on the ridge soon found themselves being attacked along their flanks by continuously reinforced Canadian Corps troops. When {{it became obvious that}} the position was completely outflanked and there was no prospect of reinforcement, the German troops <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> German forces were evacuated off the ridge with German artillery batteries moved west of the Vimy–Bailleul railway embankment or to the Oppy–Méricourt line. By nightfall of 10 April, the only Canadian objective not yet achieved was the capture of the Pimple.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 World Championships in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner {{won three}} gold and two silver medals. She claimed silver, {{alongside}} Andrea Henkel, Arnd Peiffer and Michael Greis, {{in the opening}} mixed relay. On 5 March 2011, Neuner won the sprint race courtesy of a clean shooting performance. She {{finished second in the}} pursuit and fifth in the individual subsequently. On 12 March 2011, Neuner won her second title in the mass start despite of four shooing errors. The following day she also claimed gold in the women's relay, together with Andrea Henkel, Miriam Gössner and Tina Bachmann. Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5seconds off the lead, but she <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> entire time and moved in front on the last lap. Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of Biathlon World Championships.|$|E

25|$|Markov {{was forced}} to deploy six battalions to cover his right flank against Dupont's {{threatening}} advance. Meanwhile, Bernadotte attacked in front as it began to get dark. Despite tough fighting, Dupont's flank attack began to make headway and Markov ordered a withdrawal. Around this time, General Anrep arrived and announced that cavalry reinforcements were coming. He was soon hit and carried off, fatally wounded. As they <b>pulled</b> <b>back,</b> <b>the</b> Russians resisted fiercely. Nevertheless, Dupont drove off the two regiments in his front and closed in on Georgenthal.|$|E
25|$|Marcognet led his {{division}} at the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814. The Franco-Italian army advanced and blundered into Count Heinrich von Bellegarde's Austrian army, resulting in a confused meeting engagement. Eugène and Grenier advanced across the Mincio River {{on the right and}} center, pushing back the Austrians in front of them. The divisions of Rouyer and Quesnel led the attack with cavalry on both flanks, supported by Marcognet and Teodoro Lechi's Italian Guard. Meanwhile, Jean-Antoine Verdier's troops were barely holding out against greatly superior Austrian forces on the left flank. As Eugène directed Rouyer and Quesnel to the left to help Verdier, he brought Marcognet into the first line. In the end, the French advance was halted by a mass of Austrians and both sides <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> French suffered 3,000 killed and wounded plus 500 captured, while inflicting losses of 2,800 killed and wounded and 1,200 captured on the Austrians.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{uncertainty}} {{about what happened}} during the remaining hours of 23 December; for example, whether the house arrest for the People's Deputies was cancelled. Between 5 and 7 pm there was a cabinet meeting in which Ebert failed to inform the USPD members of the approaching army units. The three USPD members of the Council then left the Chancellery. At some point, the Volksmarinedivision found out about the advancing troops for they also marched towards the Chancellery and got there first. Dorrenbach met Ebert and asked him to remove the army troops. At the same time, the officers of these units arrived in Ebert's office and asked him for his orders and whether they should open fire. Nothing is known about the ensuing conversation, except that Ebert promised to resolve the situation on the next day by a Kabinettsbeschluss (cabinet decision). The result was that both sides <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> Volksmarinedivision returned to the Marstall, the army to the Tiergarten. However, at 2 am Ebert did order the troops to attack the Marstall in the morning.|$|E

During the morning hours, the Americans repulsed the 1st Light Infantry Battalion and two companies of Hessian Jägers. It was necessary to commit British and Hessian grenadiers before the Americans <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> British suffered most of the 140 casualties lost during the action.

Menchov finished nine seconds further back in eighth place, which helped the squad move {{to the top of the}} teams classification. Cobo moved up to eighth overall after the stage 10 individual time trial, thanks to a decent showing – 23rd; the team's second best behind Menchov, who was 13th – and the fact that several riders ahead of him in the classification were less proficient in time-trialling; a performance that left Cobo satisfied after the stage. Duarte was part of a 19-man breakaway on stage 11, but faltered on the final climb and eventually finished 27 seconds behind the main race favourites, including Cobo, but finished in the same time as Menchov, Sastre and Blanco. A 20-man escape group made a successful breakaway on stage 13, with three of the riders – de la Fuente, Blanco and Sastre – being members of the squad, and de la Fuente earned fourth place in the final sprint to the line, with Blanco also breaking into the top ten positions, with eighth place.|$|E
2500|$|The cruiser {{tank was}} late and Vaughan as delayed the move for fifteen minutes, dawn broke but despite this, the Axis troops {{appeared}} to have been surprised. The 24 vehicles of the KEO passed the Axis gun line, turned and charged. At the guns the squadron divided, each troop went round a flank and the infantry made a bayonet attack, scattering the crews of the twelve guns and supporting infantry. The Indians then remounted and drove off, having suffered [...] including at least two men killed. The 2nd Armoured Division headquarters also failed to appear at the start line and the others waited. As the Germans and Italians recovered from the surprise attack, the cruiser tank set off, the PAVO flank guards moved outwards to widen the gap and brigade headquarters followed. The cruiser charged at the guns, engaged them, was soon knocked out and the crew was killed. Zero hour for the Axis attack arrived and as Vaughan and the brigade headquarters group got going, guns to the east, south-east and south opened a rapid fire. Machine-gun fire raked the break-out route and German tanks approached from the south and east. The attack by the cruiser and clouds of dust raised by the movement of vehicles obscured the view and Vaughan, the headquarters and much of the PAVO broke out as the Axis attackers closed in. The troops {{at the head of the}} main body approached the jumping-off point but stopped when they saw tanks ahead and <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> wind blew harder as the sun rose and swirling dust clouds made it impossible for the men inside the perimeter to see enough to know when to go.|$|E
2500|$|While Gribbe's {{artillery}} {{continued to}} shell No.1 redoubt, the Russian columns under Levutsky, Semyakin, and Skyuderi {{began to move}} into the North Valley. Although the Heavy Brigade had <b>pulled</b> <b>back,</b> <b>the</b> British did send forward their available artillery to assist the Ottoman forces on the Causeway Heights. Captain George Maude's troop of horse artillery, I Troop, unlimbered its four 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns between redoubts 2 and 3, whilst Captain Barker's battery, W Battery, of the Royal Artillery, moved out of Balaclava and took its position on Maude's left. However, the artillery duel was a very one sided affair. The heavier Russian guns (some 18-pounders), particularly No.4 battery under Lieutenant Postikov, together with the riflemen of the Ukraine regiment, took their toll on both men and ordnance. Running short of ammunition and taking hits, Maude's troop was forced to retire (Maude himself was severely wounded). Their place taken by two guns from Barker's battery. As the British artillery fire slackened, Semyakin prepared to storm No. 1 redoubt, personally leading the assault together with three battalions of the Azovsky Regiment under Colonel Krudener. [...] "I waved my hat on both sides," [...] recalled Semyakin. [...] "Everybody rushed after me and I was protected by the stern Azovs." [...] The Ottoman forces on Canrobert's Hill resisted stubbornly. Although the attack had begun at 06:00, it was not until 07:30 when No.1 redoubt fell. During that time the 600 Ottoman defenders had suffered from the heavy artillery bombardment; in the ensuing fight in the redoubt and subsequent pursuit by the Cossacks, an estimated 170 Ottomans were killed. In his first report of the action for The Times, William Russell wrote that the Turks 'received a few shots and then bolted', but afterwards admitted that he had not been a witness {{to the start of the}} battle, confessing, 'Our treatment of the Turks was unfair … ignorant as we were that the Turkish in No.1 redoubt lost more than a fourth of their number ere they abandoned it to the enemy'. Later Lucan and Campbell too acknowledged the firmness with which the assault on No 1 redoubt, which was not visible from their vantage point, had been resisted; it was not until this had been overwhelmed did the defenders abandon redoubts 2, 3 and 4. Of the estimated 2,500 Russians who took part in the assault the Azovsky Regiment lost two officers and 149 men killed.|$|E
