25|$|Admission to the {{university}} is based upon holistic review of a candidate’s academic record, with the strongest consideration being given {{to those who have}} a combined ability score of 140 or higher. The combined ability score is calculated by adding the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in the applicant's graduating class that the applicant outranks and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> the applicant outscored on a nationally standardized test (usually the ACT, although the SAT is also accepted). Admissions decisions are also based, however, on a mandatory application essay, the applicant's resume, and the applicant's high school and extracurricular record. According to the Princeton Review, Truman has a selectivity rating of 88, a 68% acceptance rate, with applicants having a 3.79 average high school GPA, and an 88% retention rate after freshman year. All applicants must have 4 credits of English, 3 credits of math, 3 credits of science, 2 credits of foreign language, 2 credits of social studies, and 1 credit of fine art.

40|$|One {{major concern}} when {{developing}} {{a response to}} intervention (RTI) program is to select effective practices that will be successfully implemented and sustained with adequate organizational guidance and support. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore patterns <b>of</b> <b>student</b> tier placement data as a school-based case example of the nature and utility of RTI in an applied setting. Specifically, this study aimed to explore the extent that the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> placed in a three-tier program based on student oral reading fluency (ORF) level and growth trajectories reflect the standard RTI tier placement (80 %, 15 %, and 5 %) at fall, winter, and spring in a school setting. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> the total <b>student</b> population tier placement were explored with ORF data from third- and fourth-grade students (N = 429) at two schools in fall, winter, and spring. Results showed that school and ORF data reflected the standard <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>student</b> populations within each tier in fall, winter, and spring. However, slope data showed greater <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in the more intensive tiers. Moreover, flexible grouping, or movement between tiers occurred for few students when movement occurred based on school or ORF level data. No significant differences were found between the school and ORF student tier placements in fall, winter, and spring. A significant difference was found in spring between placement methods with a larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in Tier 1 based on the school assignments and a larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>students</b> in Tier 2 and Tier 3 based on ORF slope assignments...|$|R

40|$|The school-to-prison {{pipeline}} metaphor {{represents an}} educational environment that allows {{public schools to}} push many at-risk children {{out of school and}} into the juvenile justice system or even worse, the adult criminal justice system (Wald and Losen, 2003; Lynn, 2010; Tuzzolo and Hewitt, 2006). The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a school-to-prison pipeline exists in eastern Oklahoma, and if so, to better understand the characteristics of the public schools that may be contributing to it. The school-to-prison pipeline metaphor guided three research questions regarding whether certain public schools in eastern Oklahoma referred greater <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> their <b>students,</b> special needs students, and special needs population to the Oklahoma Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA), the juvenile authority in Oklahoma. To answer these questions a survey was conducted during the 2011 and 2012 academic school year that measured public school referrals <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> particularly special needs students, to the OJA in ten eastern Oklahoma counties. Further data were collected from the Oklahoma Department of Education on nine specific demographic variables to create a profile of each of the 154 schools in the sample population. Multiple regression analysis indicate that greater <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> referred by public schools to the OJA are related to (1) higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> African Americans, (2) higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> Native Americans, (3) higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> receiving a free or subsidized lunch, (4) higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> male <b>students,</b> and (5) higher <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> special needs <b>students</b> in the public school.
