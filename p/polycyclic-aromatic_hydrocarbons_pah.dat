The AKARI/IRC Mid-InfraRed (MIR) multiband photometry is used to trace their star-forming activities with the <b>Polycyclic-Aromatic</b> <b>Hydrocarbon</b> (<b>PAH)</b> emissions, which {{is also used to}} distinguish star-forming populations from AGN dominated ones and to estimate the Star Formation Rate (SFR) derived from their total emitting IR (TIR) luminosities.

50|$|Decomposition of polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>PAHs).</b> Triethylamine (TEA) was {{utilized}} to solvate and extract the polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>PAHs)</b> found in crude oil. By solvating these PAHs, TEA can attract the PAHs to itself. Once removed, TiO2 slurries and UV light can photocatalytically degrade the PAHs. The figure shows the high {{success rate of}} this experiment. With high yielding of recoveries of 93-99% of these contaminants, this process has become an innovative idea that can be finalized for actual environmental usage.
