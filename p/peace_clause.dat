5000|$|According to {{a survey}} of 188 constitutions across the world made by Osamu Nishi (...) , an emeritus {{professor}} at Komazawa University, 158 (84%) of these constitutions also contain a <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> (平和条項).

This has had broad implications for foreign, security and defense policy.

The EU and the USA however consider {{that it may not}} lapse until mid 2004 or even, for some products, until October 2004, since this corresponds with nine years after notification to the WTO of the measures concerned. For the EU the renewal of the 'peace clause' is seen as a precondition for any continuation of WTO negotiations, whereas for most developing country governments this is a non-starter, unless substantial concessions are made in exchange. Comment: The question of the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> is central to the issue of negotiating leverage. Without a renewal of the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> the EU would find its agricultural regime open to challenge at the WTO on several fronts. Should a renewal be agreed prior to the negotiation of a new agreement on agriculture, pressure on the EU to move beyond the reforms already agreed as part of the on-going process of CAP reform will be reduced. However for the ACP a rash of new challenges to the CAP could lead to a range of hasty changes, which might disregard the interests of ACP countries.

40|$|Negotiations on {{agriculture}} were successfully {{launched in the}} WTO early in 2000. In the initial phase, negotiating proposals have been submitted by member countries and are being discussed in special sessions of the WTO Committee on Agriculture. A stock-taking exercise {{will be held in}} March 2001 to establish the next steps in the process. Many developments will influence the shape and dynamics of the negotiations, particularly the possibility of a comprehensive trade round. The first part of this paper examines the policy setting for the negotiations. The ongoing integration of economies and accompanying agricultural policy reforms provide an environment for further trade liberalization. Expansion of regional trade agreements and EU enlargement negotiations add urgency to the multilateral negotiating process. Newer trade issues and nontrade concerns, often connected to the food business, focus attention on the agricultural talks but may also retard them. A further factor that will add urgency is the anticipated expiry of the <b>Peace</b> <b>Clause</b> in 2003. The paper reviews the main agricultural issues for negotiation and the initial negotiating positions. Substantial progress in improving access is essential for the negotiations to succeed. The issues of export subsidies, other forms of export competition, unfair pricing practices, and dumping are receiving much attention. There are pressures to reduce or eliminate all forms of trade-distorting domestic support. Many non-trade concerns are being introduced, and legitimate trade issues will need to be addressed. The developing countries are determined to extract a better deal for their agriculture. The paper concludes that the elements for progress in further agricultural trade liberalization are coming to the negotiating table but much uncertainty remains both within and outside agriculture. agricultural negotiations, <b>peace</b> <b>clause,</b> non-trade concerns, subsidies, WTO, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

30|$|In {{discussing}} multi-level bargaining, Visser {{sees the}} key distinguishing characteristic {{to be one}} of articulation, which is defined as the extent to which additional bargaining on pay is under control of the union, and regulated and defined by the sectoral (or central) agreement and subject to a <b>peace</b> <b>clause.</b> So the critical issue here is said to be governance capacity. Two-tier systems are seen as operating within Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. (Single-level multi-employer bargaining models, where as a rule no local bargains are assumed to obtain, include Austria, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.) Again, {{on the basis of a}} ranking exercise, Visser’s conclusion with regard to systems with a systematic second bargaining round—the so-called institutionalized two-tier bargaining—is that while multi-level bargaining has increased over time, fully articulated bargaining is rare. The contemporary poorly articulated counterparts of Britain and Italy in the 1970 s and 1980 s are identified as Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Spain.|$|E
40|$|The WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture remain deadlocked {{after four years}} of discussion, and efforts to find a solution at Cancún failed. Analysis shows that the recent draft Cancún text offers more flexibility than earlier proposals, and such flexibility most likely implies a lower level of ambition overall. However, developing countries are less {{able to take advantage of}} this flexibility and their bound tariff will be reduced to levels at or below applied rates. The reduction in levels of intervention and the expiry of the <b>Peace</b> <b>Clause</b> make it more likely that there will be greater resort in the future to safeguards and countervailing measures. Analysis of the various proposals using the UNCTAD/FAO Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM) shows that most of the benefits from liberalisation accrue to developed countries, which currently have the highest levels of intervention. The group of developing countries, which include both exporters and imports of agricultural products, gain from liberalisation, but those gains are small and unevenly distributed. In fact, net-food importing developing countries tend to lose because of higher world prices. Within developing countries, producers tend to gain from higher world prices at the expense of consumers.

40|$|Because of the Agreement on Agriculture’s (AoA) Article 13, {{dubbed the}} “Peace Clause,” the challengeability of {{agricultural}} subsidies has been limited; Article 13 {{had the power}} to prevent several types of legal challenges. The <b>Peace</b> <b>Clause</b> has expired, and now many agricultural subsidies can be challenged under substantive provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). However, there has been some uncertainty, because the new arrangement of agricultural subsidies’ challengeability is being defined by the interpretation and correlation of three different WTO agreements. This study verified, using a two-pronged method, that there is no conflict among the GATT 1994, the SCM Agreement and the AoA, and for this reason, they have to be applied together to regulate agricultural subsidies. This does not mean that all SCM Agreement provisions are automatically applied to agricultural subsidies, with a consequent free ride for challenges to agricultural subsidies. A successful challenge still has to overcome the SCM Agreement’s higher thresholds for challengeability compared with those of the GATT 1994 period. This condemnation became more difficult after the implementation of the WTO. Consequently, the goals established in the AoA of substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection still have to be accomplished...|$|E

The authors argue that border measures 2 ̆ 014 both import restrictive measures and export subsidies 2 ̆ 014 contemplated in US climate bills and the climate policies of other countries stand a fair chance of being challenged in the WTO.

The paper begins with an explanation of the background to the debate of the links between food security and WTO agricultural and trade negotiations and the interim solution (the <b>peace</b> <b>clause)</b> agreed upon at Bali. Then it discusses some economic issues that frame the discussion about food security stocks, noting the new context of higher (in nominal terms) and perhaps more volatile food prices, in part associated with expanding links among energy markets and food production, supply and prices, and greater weather variability associated with climate change. The paper analyzes potential approaches to solving the problems related to the use of public stocks for food security reasons and suggests specific language that may solve the current debate. The paper also notes the more complex political economy of the future negotiations, which, among other things, will require greater flexibility among WTO Member s and deeper awareness of the evolving negotiating landscape.

40|$|A {{review of}} the WTO {{agricultural}} negotiations and their implications for developing countries {{is the subject of}} a report published in March 2003 by Tim Ruffer (Oxford Policy management) and Alan Swinbank (University of Reading). The report, which was based on a DfID financed study, summarises the most important issues arising for developing countries in the WTO agricultural negotiations in the context of the Harbinson drafts. It looks at issues under five headings: market access; domestic support; export subsidies; the peace clause; and support for developing countries. Its main conclusions are that: market access liberalisation will 'reduce the preferences margins that some developing countries currently enjoy'. Accordingly the authors make a number of recommendations, the most significant of which is for the extension of special safeguard mechanisms for key food commodities for developing countries; concerning domestic support, the blue box should be eliminated, and there should be no extension of the green box as this could harm the interests of developing countries; developing countries should push for the elimination of export subsidies; developing countries should hold back on approval of the extension of the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> until firm assurances have been received on their areas of concern. Comment: In calling for the elimination of the 'blue box' and the maintenance of 'green box' provisions within current limits the analysis ignores the reality of the EU position which will require an extension of the green box provisions if it is to accept the elimination of the 'blue box'. It needs to be recognised that the EU is only likely to accept a timetable for the elimination of export subsidies which is consistent with the internal process of CAP reform designed to eliminate the need for export refunds.

40|$|As {{far back}} as David Ricardo 2 ̆ 7 s {{shattering}} insight as to comparative advantage in 1817, agriculture has enjoyed special favor in trade. The unique place of farming was so well established {{by the time the}} 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (2 ̆ 2 GATT 2 ̆ 2) was negotiated that GATT 2 ̆ 7 s tight disciplines on government interference with free trade not only exempted government protections to growers, but in fact were drafted to be fully consistent with the agricultural policies of the major signatories. While it would be an exaggeration to argue that GATT 2 ̆ 7 s first half century was without impact on agricultural benefits, the sector at any rate took center stage during negotiations to create the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) because by the time these talks began in 1986, subsidy-induced overproduction had led to widespread displacement of efficient producers from their traditional markets. Many felt this result was far from realization of David Ricardo 2 ̆ 7 s compelling economic case for the smallest possible government intervention. While widely hailed for bringing agriculture, at last, under the GATT/WTO umbrella, 19952 ̆ 7 s Agreement on Agriculture (2 ̆ 2 Agreement on Agriculture 2 ̆ 2) more than lived up to the promise of Article 20 that 2 ̆ 2 substantial [...] . reductionsin support and protection resulting in fundamental reform is an ongoing process. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Both as to export subsidies [...] those contingent upon export performance and, thus, with the most direct impact on export prices and trade [...] and the remaining domestic subsidies, the Agreement on Agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s ambitions are so modest that many experts believed its generous exemptions and undefined terms rarely would permit successful reining in by dispute settlement panels of the nearly 1 billion a day developed nations provide to their farmers. Two decisions issued by WTO dispute settlement panels on September 8, 2004, belie that prediction. Brazil, an agricultural superpower in its own right, was a complainant in both cases. In the first case, a Panel found United States subsidies to upland cotton were sufficiently in excess of those granted by the UNITED STATES during the baseline 1992 marketing year to be actionable under the Subsidies Agreement, despite the protection of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>Peace</b> <b>Clause</b> 2 ̆ 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture. The Cotton Panel went on to find that these subsidies caused serious prejudice to Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s cotton growers within the meaning of the Subsidies Agreement. In the second case, which involved the EU 2 ̆ 7 s Common Agricultural Policy, a Panel held that the EU had exceeded its agreed commitments on sugar in both the amount of exports and the level of subsidies. This paper will analyze the major holdings of the Sugar and Cotton decisions from both a legal and an economic perspective, assess the WTO implications of those holdings on other crops and on Doha Round agriculture negotiations, and examine the effects on other United States exports of the failure of the United States to implement the decisions separate from Doha Round negotiations...|$|E
40|$|In {{an article}} by R. H. Steinberg and T. E Josling in the Journal of International Economic Law the {{vulnerability}} of EU and US agricultural subsidies to legal challenge in the WTO once the current 'peace clause' lapses is assessed. The paper concludes that 'when the 'peace clause' expires, many commodity specific EC and US agricultural subsidies will be vulnerable to legal challenge under Article 6. 3 (a) -(c) and 6. 4 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures'. This would require such subsidies to be withdrawn or for steps {{to be taken to}} remove their adverse effects. The paper argues that non-subsidising countries can be expected to bargain in the shadow of this threat to secure a reduction in EU and US agricultural subsidies and a shift over to genuinely non-trade distorting forms of support. The paper notes that 'green box' measures have been except from challenge under the 'peace clause' and that the extent to which 'blue and amber box' measures can be challenged has also been restricted. It notes that export subsidies are the most 'actionable'. The paper expresses the belief that the ending of the 'peace clause' will not open up the flood gates of challenges to 'green box' measures. Nevertheless the article explores in detail the various legal bases for challenging all forms of EU and US agricultural subsidies. It shows that the major problem faced is demonstrating 'causation', that is proving that the specific subsidies under attack cause the economic losses claimed by the challenging party. The article explores various models for demonstrating causation. It concludes, however, {{that in the case of}} challenges following the expiry of the 'peace clause' 'large subsidising members might simply ignore adverse dispute settlement decisions'. It cites the EU position in response to the issue of hormones in beef as a case in point, noting how the larger offenders can prefer to accept the sanctions following an unsuccessful defence rather than to change their policy. Against this background the paper argues that 'if &# 133; the expiry of the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> is seen as a significant threat to the subsidy policies of major countries, then there will be more incentive for competing exporting countries&# 133; to bargain in the shadow of its expiry'. However it needs to be borne in mind that the 'peace clause' could be renewed, since both the EU and Japan are arguing strongly for this. Some renewal of the 'peace clause' would appear possible if the major offenders were seen to be making significant concessions in areas of interest to potential complainants. Comment: It should be noted that the EU has dramatically reduced its reliance on the most actionable forms of agricultural support (export subsidies), although the variable pace of reform and currency movements is increasing the EU's need for such measures in certain sectors. ACP countries will need to identify what interests they want to bargain around in the shadow of the potential challenges which could arise with the expiry of the 'peace clause'.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] Japan is a vibrant democracy, but its {{citizens}} have never been given, nor have they ever taken, full responsibility for authoring their own constitution—until now, that is. By the late 1990 s, public opinion had shifted. A majority favor changing their constitution. And today both the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), are preparing drafts for its revision. Japan {{is in the midst}} of one of the most consequential tests of its democratic institutions. Although the contemporary revision debate encompasses such weighty issues as the role of the emperor, description of Japanese national character, reorganization of local government, separation of powers, and basic rights of citizens, one passage in particular continues to cast a shadow over the entire enterprise: Article Nine, the famous “peace clause” renouncing the possession and use of force for settling international disputes. Long the primary target of revisionist fervor, Article Nine was at the center of the first serious revision debate in the 1950 s and controversies arising from its application helped to ignite the contemporary revision movement after the Gulf War in 1991. There are many reasons why revision proponents have sought to change Article Nine. For some it is an impediment to the realization of national autonomy. The postwar constitution was drafted under the U. S. occupation, and Article Nine, whatever its exact origins, was one of three nonnegotiable demands imposed on the Japanese by General Douglas MacArthur. It is thus no surprise that revisionists often qualify Article Nine with the adjective “U. S. -imposed. ” For others the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> is an impediment to national muscularity. As we shall see, interpretations of the article’s sweeping language have placed constraints on Japan’s military and its ability to use force in foreign affairs. At times these constraints have complicated Japan’s relationship with its only alliance partner, the United States, as well as efforts to increase Japanese influence in the United Nations. Finally, some favor revision because they see Article Nine as an impediment to national honesty. Following major reinterpretations in the early 1950 s, Article Nine has been endlessly parsed in ways both large and small as the domestic and international political landscapes have shifted. As a result, it may be argued, Japanese security policy no longer reflects a strict interpretation of the <b>peace</b> <b>clause,</b> and the constitution should thus be brought into line with reality. These arguments are not new. Revision proponents have advanced various versions since the 1950 s. This raises two important questions. First, why has Article Nine survived so long without amendment? Second, why has the Article Nine issue returned to the political agenda with such force in recent years? More specifically: why does the LDP finally seem to have congealed on the issue, and why has the major opposition party joined in calling for constitutional revision? To address these questions, we examine evidence from the two strongest revisionist movements in postwar Japanese history: the immediate postwar period (1947 – 64) and the post-Cold War period (1990 –present). Based on these cases, we locate the primary source of Article Nine’s longevity in domestic politics. Specifically, Article Nine has found critical support from a diverse coalition driven by two very different motivations, pragmatism, and pacifism. Pragmatism refers to a particular set of beliefs used to calculate the postwar national interest in exceedingly practical (cost/benefit) terms. Applying these beliefs to the conditions facing Japan, pragmatists generated and maintained the postwar strategy of reliance on the United States to guarantee Japan’s security. Pacifism, by contrast, refers to adherence to the doctrine of nonviolence. This belief spread as part of an identity movement that redefined postwar Japan as a “peace nation” (heiwa kokka). The policy implications of this redefinition were exemplified in a preference for “unarmed neutrality. ” Although the relative strength of these two forces has varied over the years, each in its own right has been a formidable obstacle to significant change in Article Nine. Despite this long track record—and although revision is by no means a foregone conclusion—the tripartite political dynamic among pacifists, pragmatists, and those who sought to revise Article Nine has recently shifted in ways that make amendment far more likely than ever before. There has been a tremendous rise in revisionist sentiment in the political parties, the Diet, and the public. And, the pragmatist/pacifist coalition has been greatly weakened. We trace the rise of revisionism primarily to three factors: the failure of leftist parties to redefine themselves in a shifted political landscape; national and party-level institutional reforms that have strengthened the role of the prime minister within the LDP and in the policymaking process; and the leadership of the current prime minister, Koizumi Junichirô. In short, changes in partisanship, institutions, and leadership have been critical drivers behind the rise of revisionism over the last decade. International development since the early 1990 s provided the revisionists with further opportunities to challenge the constitutional status quo. The rise of revisionism has enabled the Japanese government to undertake certain major policy changes as, for example, in the overseas dispatch of troops and in its Iraq policy, which is clearly a major turning point in Japan’s postwar security policy. Despite the rise in revisionist sentiment, revision of Article Nine still faces serious challenges including the failure to reach consensus among conservatives and within the LDP on many central issues relating to Article Nine, the presence of Kômeitô in the coalition government, the politics of the main opposition party DPJ, and public opinion which is still deeply divided over collective self-defense. Consequently, the present Article Nine debate could have several possible outcomes: formalization of the informal status quo; major parties reaching an agreement on allowing a restricted form of collective self-defense; formal recognition of the right to collective self-defense without any restriction (least likely); and finally the possibility of complete failure. The study then briefly explores the likely implications of constitutional revision of the right to collective self-defense for Japanese politics, U. S. -Japan security relations, and for Japan’s regional relations. In conclusion the study argues that the debate over Article Nine has shifted in ways that makes major constitutional change possible although it neither sets the future course of change nor guarantees its occurrence. Whatever the outcome, the debate will be an important, and hopefully, affirmative experience in Japanese democracy...|$|E
40|$|A revised draft Cancun ministerial {{text was}} {{circulated}} on 24 August by the Chair of the WTO General Council, Carlos Pérez del Castillo. Based {{to a large}} extent on the US- EC paper circulated on 13 August (see below), the revised text provides the WTO countries with a framework for establishing modalities in agriculture with respect to the three pillars (market access, domestic support and export competition). For each pillar, the revised text incorporates a number of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions that were absent in the first draft. In terms of domestic support, the document (viz. Annex A, sections 1. 6 and 1. 7) proposes S&D provisions including: applying lower reductions of trade-distorting domestic support and longer implementation periods (cf. Article 6. 2. of the Agriculture Agreement); exempting developing countries from the requirement to reduce their de minimis levels. As far as the market access pillar is concerned, the Chair recognises that 'developing countries shall have additional flexibility [!;] to designate Special Products' with smaller tariff reductions and no new commitments on Tariff Rates Quotas (cf. section 2. 6). For developing countries, the tariffs reduction would be based either on a three-band Uruguay Round approach or a blend of the Uruguay Round and Swiss formulas, without a zero duty category. The draft text proposes that these Special Products should be determined under certain conditions but these are not elaborated. With regard to the agricultural safeguard mechanism for developing countries, the Chair also says that it would be 'subject to conditions and for products to be determined'. The Chair emphasizes that members would also 'take account of the importance of preferential access for developing countries'. With respect to export competition, the Chair takes up the US-EC proposal to remove export subsidies on some products 'of particular interest for developing countries'. In terms of S&D provisions, developing countries would have the right to exempt certain transport and marketing subsidies from export subsidy reduction (Article 9. 4 of the Agriculture Agreement) until all export subsidies have been phased out by all Members. Furthermore, the text mentions that appropriate provision in favour of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Net Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs). Other substantial issues are also mentioned in this draft text: recognition of the importance of trade preferences; the sectoral initiative on cotton; the issue of long-term decline and sharp fluctuations in the price of commodities. The Chair also indicates a list of 'issues of interest but not agreed' as introduced by the US-EC proposal including the Green Box criteria, the safeguard measure for developed countries, the implementation periods, the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> and non-trade concerns. Comment: In terms of reactions to the draft text, some developing countries (except the Cairns Group) recognise that some progress has been made even if additional S&D provisions are still needed. The EC along with Japan criticise the text saying it goes too far and does not adequately recognise non-trade concerns and the diversity of agriculture. Critics from the Cairns group emphasise that the text does not include the definite elimination of export subsidies or reductions on domestic support by product. Last but not least, the US along with the EC are claiming that less generous level of S&D provisions should apply for advanced developing countries, especially the major net food exporters (including Thailand and India). Even if the revised Cancun ministerial text goes further than the framework given in the US-EC proposal - especially putting the emphasis on the importance of S&D for developing countries - there are still blanks to fill in especially regarding the level of future undertakings (including schedules and figures).

40|$|Proposals for the EU's {{agricultural}} {{offer in}} the WTO negotiations were {{submitted by the}} European Commission to EU agricultural ministers and the Article 133 Committee on December 16 th 2002. The EU proposal suggests the following actions be taken over a six-year period for developed countries and a ten-year period for developing countries: a 55 % cut in trade-distorting farm subsidies; the rolling back of budget expenditures on export refunds by about 45 % on average with the complete dismantling of export refunds on cereals oilseeds, olive oil and tobacco, provided that all other forms of export subsidy are also abandoned for these products (in this context the EU is calling for stronger disciplines to be introduced on export credits, state-run trading enterprises and abuses of food aid); a further opening of agricultural markets by reducing agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average, with a cut of at least 15 % per dutiable item. In addition the EU is proposing that: other developed economies and advanced developing countries should introduce 'Everything but Arms' style treatment for LDCS; there should be support for a 'food security box' involving a special safeguard instrument to ensure food security; there should be recognition of its right to protect the European model of agriculture and the EU position on geographical designations of origin. Securing support for the European model of agriculture includes securing acceptance of the exclusion of internal non trade-distorting rural development support measures from the support reduction commitments. It also involves {{an extension of the}} <b>peace</b> <b>clause,</b> which prevents existing support measures from being challenged in the WTO. The EU sees its proposals as a more practical way of moving the agenda forward rather than the 'extreme and unrealistic position' of the USA and the Cairns Group. In response to the EU proposals the Cairns Group felt that they contravened the Doha commitment to 'reductions of, with a view to phasing out' all forms of export subsidies. The Group also pointed out that the EU make no proposals for phasing out the 'blue box', which allows partly de-coupled payments under production limiting programmes. The Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile described the EU offer as 'too little too late'. The US described the EU proposal as 'lacking ambition'. Comment: All of the major elements of the EU proposal demand careful scrutiny. For example what is meant by 'trade-distorting subsidies'? The OECD has raised questions as to whether all of the subsidies which the EU describes as non trade-distorting are in fact trade neutral. Second, the EU's commitments on export refunds needs to be seen against the background of the shift to direct aid payments which is allowing the gap between EU and world market prices to be closed. This is doing away with the need for export refunds. During the first round of reform EU export-refund expenditures fell by 45 %. Further reductions in the EU intervention price under the Agenda 2000 reforms have further closed the gap between EU and world market prices. The depreciation of the Euro against the US$ further reduced the need for export refunds (although the recent 10 % appreciation has increased the objective need for export refunds in the last year). It will require detailed calculations based on current price trends and expected exchange rates to determine whether the EU's offer will have any actual impact on the planned level of export-refund expenditures in the coming years Third, the EU's offer to reduce agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average cannot be considered in isolation from the downward trend in EU agricultural market prices driven by the process of CAP reform. With the gap between EU and world market prices closing, the need for tariff protection is diminishing. Here again a detailed consideration of market prices and expected exchange rates is necessary in order to ascertain whether the EU's offer will have any material impact on the agricultural trade position of developing countries. It is possible that the EU is in fact offering very little more than the current trajectory of CAP reform will easily allow, whilst securing benefits in terms of wider recognition of the EU's right to make use of certain support instruments and to secure exclusive use for EU enterprises of some widely recognised geographical labels. Proposals for the EU's agricultural offer in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A report {{based on}} the {{hearings}} of the International Development Committee of the UK House of Commons on December 4 th 2003 is now available on the internet. The report which is entitled ‘Trade and development at the WTO: learning the lessons of Cancun to revive a genuine development round' reviews what happened in Cancun, the lessons to be drawn, {{and what can be}} done to revive a genuine ‘development round'. It makes a number of recommendations on the WTO process in the light of the new alliances which have emerged. On issues of substance it notes that ‘without agreement on agriculture, there will be no development round' and maintains that ‘the developed world failed to offer sufficiently radical or quick reforms of its agricultural policies' and that ‘the EU's failure on agriculture was an own goal resulting from a lack of coherence between its policies on trade, development and agriculture'. It argues that ‘the developed world must accept that if its agricultural policies harm developing countries – and trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies clearly do - then they must be changed'. It notes that ‘if agricultural subsidies keep farmers in business, and their products are exported, then these subsidies are trade distorting'. It was also critical of ‘the condescending refusal of the USA to negotiate on cotton'. The committee maintains that the lesson of Cancun is simple: ‘developing countries' concerns should be listened to carefully and taken seriously'. On specific issues linked to agriculture the report argued that ‘the <b>peace</b> <b>clause</b> should not be extended'. It welcomed the ‘EU-inspired proposal to remove export subsidies for products of particular interest to developing countries'. It maintained, however, that ‘the farmers of developing countries who suffer the effects of the dumping of agricultural products, are poorly served by the EU's agreement on CAP reform'. It observed that ‘the reform may be substantial in terms of EU politics, but that does not mean that it will make a substantial difference in developing countries'. It argued that ‘partially decoupled agricultural support will still keep European farmers in business at the expense of farmers in developing countries. If agricultural subsidies keep farmers in business, and their products are exported, then those subsidies are trade distorting'. The report observes that ‘agricultural negotiations at the WTO revolve around definitions', noting that ‘unfettered use of green-box measures is crucial for the EU; moving agricultural support from the amber box and the blue box to the green box is central to maintaining progress with CAP reform and consequentially with multilateral negotiations. ' It records Pascal Lamy's' view that capping the green box would be a disincentive to further CAP reform and as such, according to both the Commission and the UK government, it is not politically realistic. However, as the Committee report notes, for the G 20 and others ‘if green-box subsidies keep farmers in the business of exporting their produce then they are trade distorting and should be subject to limits and reduction commitments'. Against this background the Committee report poses the question ‘is the green box a stepping stone or a stumbling block towards fundamental development-friendly agricultural reform, within the EU and internationally?' It notes that Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy dismissed questions about whether green-box support is trade distorting as ‘a very interesting academic question'. However the Committee report argues that for ‘poor farmers in developing countries and to exporters in less poor but still developing countries, it is more than academic'. The report calls for an independent review of the trade-distorting nature of green-box measures based on objective criteria ‘rather than political bargaining' and suggests that the World Bank could conduct such a review. The report's section on agriculture concludes that development-friendly agricultural trade rules cannot be built simply on what is ‘politically feasible from an EU perspective', since multilateral rules are meant to be about creating a level playing field. In this context the Committee calls on the UK government to move beyond ‘an exercise which tries to hide trade-distorting subsidies in a different coloured box'. Comment: The report constitutes a radical critique of the process of CAP reform to date, questioning as it does the definitions of the trade-distorting nature of different forms of support. It postulates and supports the basic premise that if agricultural aid, in whatever form, affects farmers' production decisions and allows them to grow more than they would otherwise grow in the absence of such aid, and if this production is then traded, then these forms of aid are effectively trade-distorting. This strikes at the heart of the process of CAP reform, which is designed to enhance the price competitiveness of EU agricultural and value-added food-product exports through shifting patterns of EU aid between different types of ‘boxes' of support which are subject to different WTO disciplines. In this context it remains to be seen whether any of the report's recommendations will be taken up by the UK government, other member states, and subsequently the European Commission. Looking beyond the report itself, it also remains to be seen whether policy developments that the report welcomed, such as the Commission's offer to remove export subsidies on all products of export interest to developing countries, would include export subsidies on such EU products as sugar or whether they would not be allowed onto any list of products important to developing countries.
