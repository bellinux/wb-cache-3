5|$|The <b>preference</b> for sons over {{daughters in}} India {{is rooted in}} social, {{economic}} and religious reasons.

One {{of the main reasons}} behind the <b>preference</b> of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters.

40|$|Many gender {{differences}} {{are thought to}} result from interactions between inborn factors and sociocognitive processes that occur after birth. There is controversy, however, over the causes of gender-typed <b>preferences</b> for the colors pink and blue, with some viewing these <b>preferences</b> as arising solely from sociocognitive processes of gender development. We evaluated <b>preferences</b> for gender-typed colors, and compared them to gender-typed toy and activity <b>preferences</b> in 126 toddlers on two occasions separated by 6 to 8 months (at time point one, age range = 20 - 40 months, mean = 29 months). Color <b>preferences</b> were assessed using color cards and neutral toys in gender-typed colors. Gender-typed toy and activity <b>preferences</b> were assessed using a parent-report questionnaire, the Preschool Activities Inventory. Color <b>preferences</b> were also assessed for the toddlers’ parents using color cards. A gender difference in color <b>preferences</b> was present between 2 and 3 {{years of age and}} strengthened near the third birthday, at which time it was large (d > 1). In contrast to their parents, toddlers’ gender-typed color <b>preferences</b> were stronger and unstable. Gender-typed color <b>preferences</b> also appeared to establish later and were less stable than gender-typed toy and activity <b>preferences.</b> Gender-typed color <b>preferences</b> were largely uncorrelated with gender-typed toy and activity <b>preferences.</b> These results suggest that the factors influencing gender-typed color <b>preferences</b> and gender-typed toy and activity <b>preferences</b> differ in some respects. Our findings suggest that sociocognitive influences and play with gender-typed toys that happen to be made in gender-typed colors contribute to toddlers’ gender-typed color <b>preferences.</b> postprin...|$|R

40|$|Orientation : Research {{has shown}} that total rewards models {{structured}} according to individual <b>preferences,</b> positively influence efforts to attract, retain and motivate key employees. Yet, this is seldom done. Structuring total rewards models according to the <b>preferences</b> of employee segments is {{a viable alternative to}} accommodate individual <b>preferences.</b> Research purpose : The primary aim {{of the study was to}} determine the relationship between personality types and reward <b>preferences.</b> The secondary aim was to determine the reward <b>preferences</b> for different demographic groups. Motivation for the study : An enhanced understanding of reward <b>preferences</b> for different employee segments will enable employers to offer more competitive reward options to their employees. This may, in turn, have a positive impact on retention. Research design, approach and method : Two measuring instruments, the MBTI ® Form GRV and the Rewards <b>Preferences</b> Questionnaire, were distributed electronically to 5 000 potential respondents. The results from 589 sets of questionnaires were used in the data analyses. Primary and secondary factor analyses were done on the items in the Rewards <b>Preferences</b> Questionnaire. Main findings/results : The study confirmed that individuals with certain personality types and personality <b>preferences,</b> have different <b>preferences</b> for certain reward categories. There was a stronger relationship between reward <b>preferences</b> and personality <b>preferences</b> than for reward <b>preferences</b> and personality types. <b>Preferences</b> for reward categories by different demographic groups were confirmed. The significant difference in reward <b>preferences</b> between Black and White respondents in particular was noteworthy, with Black respondents indicating significantly higher mean scores for all reward categories than White respondents. Finally, a total rewards framework influenced by the most prominent <b>preferences</b> for reward categories, was designed. Practical/Managerial implications : This study confirms that there are significant differences in the reward <b>preferences</b> of different segments. Management can more effectively structure reward models according to these <b>preferences</b> without increasing overall costs. Contribution/value-add : The existing body of knowledge on the reward <b>preferences</b> of people with different personality types and personality <b>preferences</b> are enhanced. In addition, the study on the reward <b>preferences</b> of different demographic groups within a South African context adds considerably to the existing body of literature. Based on research results, a total rewards framework, on employee <b>preferences,</b> was designed. Furthermore, an increased understanding of the reward categories that contribute towards. the attraction, retention and motivation of employees as well as <b>preferences</b> for certain reward categories, have been obtained. </p...|$|R

The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
