5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware the most difficult <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E

25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that they are a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|E
25|$|Mariella, {{the first}} of five ferries to reach {{the scene of the}} accident, arrived at 02:12. MRCC Turku failed to {{acknowledge}} the Mayday immediately and Mariellas report was relayed by Helsinki Radio as the less urgent pan-pan message. A full-scale emergency was only declared at 02:30. Mariella winched open liferafts into the sea onto which 13people on Estonias rafts successfully transferred, and reported the location of other rafts to Swedish and Finnish rescue helicopters, {{the first of}} which arrived at 03:05. The former took survivors to shore, while the latter—Finnish border guard helicopters Super Puma OH-HVG and Agusta Bell 412 OH-HVD—chose the riskier option of landing on the ferries. The pilot of OH-HVG stated that landing on the ferries was the most difficult <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> rescue operation; despite that, this single helicopter rescued 44people, more than all the ferries.

25|$|Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which {{received}} {{support from the}} ruling authorities, took place, {{the result was a}} reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> invisible church, but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters, namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.|$|E

500|$|The Berlin Wall, {{like the}} much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was {{designed}} with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards {{to detect and}} stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the [...] wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a [...] "death strip" [...] some [...] to [...] wide. [...] It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. [...] The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and {{that the use of}} deadly force was required to deal with them: [...] "Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used". [...] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was [...] "a dead refugee is better than an escaped one". At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was sought to be prevented. Because of this, border guards often pulled people down into the car-moat that was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall.|$|E
500|$|After much research, Nolan's {{brother and}} co-writer, Jonathan, {{suggested}} the Joker's first two appearances, {{published in the}} first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics. Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as [...] "essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, [...] "the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him– maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." [...] Nolan reiterated to IGN, [...] "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," [...] because [...] "the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." [...] Nolan suggested [...] influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as [...] "sort of an inspiration" [...] for his aim [...] "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": [...] "If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there.
