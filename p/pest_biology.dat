ACP was found in Florida in 1998, and has since spread across the southern US into Texas. This disease was found in Florida citrus groves in 2005. Management methods to reduce the spread of this disease and psyllid populations depend on an integrated pest management approach using insecticides, parasitoids, predators, and pathogens specific to ACP. Due to the spread of citrus greening worldwide and the growing importance of psyllid-spread diseases, an International Psyllid Genome Consortium was established.

40|$|There is a {{scarcity}} of laboratory and field-based results showing {{the movement of the}} diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) across a spatial scale. We studied the population growth of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) under six constant temperatures, to understand and predict population changes along altitudinal gradients and under climate change scenarios. Non-linear functions were fitted to continuously model DBM development, mortality, longevity and oviposition. We compiled the best-fitted functions for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which we stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. Three temperature-dependent indices (establishment, generation and activity) were derived from a logistic population growth model and then coupled to collected current (2013) and downscaled temperature data from AFRICLIM (2055) for geospatial mapping. To measure and predict the impacts of temperature change on the <b>pest's</b> <b>biology,</b> we mapped the indices along the altitudinal gradients of Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) and Taita Hills (Kenya) and assessed the differences between 2013 and 2055 climate scenarios. The optimal temperatures for development of DBM were 32. 5, 33. 5 and 33 °C for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Mortality rates increased due to extreme temperatures to 53. 3, 70. 0 and 52. 4 % for egg, larvae and pupae, respectively. The net reproduction rate reached a peak of 87. 4 female offspring/female/generation at 20 °C. Spatial simulations indicated that survival and establishment of DBM increased with a decrease in temperature, from low to high altitude. However, we observed a higher number of DBM generations at low altitude. The model predicted DBM population growth reduction in the low and medium altitudes by 2055. At higher altitude, it predicted an increase in the level of suitability for establishment with a {{decrease in the number of}} generations per year.

40|$|The goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is an {{invasive}} wood-boring beetle that aggressively attacks native {{oak trees}} in southern California, U. S. A. Native to Arizona, this beetle was initially {{detected in the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Diego County, California in 2004, but was likely introduced accidentally several years earlier through movement of infested oak firewood. Prior to its introduction and subsequent invasiveness in southern California, A. auroguttatus was rarely collected and very little information was known about this insect. The continuing ecological and economical damage caused by A. auroguttatus in southern California has made {{the development of a}} classical biological control program for this invasive pest a high priority. However, the implementation of an effective classical biological control program for any invasive species requires the knowledge of several critical components such as the <b>pest's</b> <b>biology,</b> area of origin, natural enemies (in the home and introduced range), and life history traits. Consequently, in order to acquire the basic information needed to initiate a classical biological control program for A. auroguttatus in California, this dissertation research had the following four objectives: 1) determine the fecundity and longevity of A. auroguttatus under varying diet and mating treatments, 2) assess the dispersal capabilities of A. auroguttatus adults in the laboratory using computerized flight mills, 3) use molecular methods to identify the area of origin for the California population of A. auroguttatus, and 4) survey for natural enemies of this beetle by deploying A. auroguttatus egg masses into the native and introduced range. Findings of this work showed that a carbohydrate-enriched diet increased longevity and fecundity, and the nutritional status and body size of A. auroguttatus adults had a significant influence on overall flight performance. The area of origin was not determined conclusively, although data suggests the Dragoon Mountains in Cochise Co., Arizona as a possible source for the California population of A. auroguttatus.

Pesticides regardless of rating as highly toxic or least toxic should not necessarily be the first choice for solving a pest problem. The new environmentally responsible approach to pest control with less reliance on pesticide use is known as integrated pest management (IPM), involves the safe prevention, reduction or elimination of unwanted organisms. It takes advantage of all pest management options such as biological, mechanical, cultural, or chemical. By combining multiple control measures versus relying on pesticide alone, IPM can reduce pesticide use and thus reduce the potential for harmful exposure to human health and the environment.

40|$|Pest insects {{represent}} {{a major threat}} to public health, to food security {{as well as to the}} economy. Constant effort is being made to develop or improve control strategies in the framework of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM aims to maintain pests at low levels that do not represent risks for health or economy, while satisfying environmentally respectful toxicological and ecological requirements. Planning of efficient control strategies requires in-depth knowledge of the <b>pest's</b> <b>biology</b> and ecology. In particular, it is essential to have accurate estimates of parameters of biological and ecological relevance like population size and distribution, dispersal capacity, as well as good understanding of the underlying processes governing the dynamics of the population in time and space. The aim of this thesis is to provide a mathematical framework for the development of efficient IPM control strategies. This mathematical framework is based on a dynamical system approach and comprises the construction of mathematical models, their theoretical study, the development of adequate schemes for numerical solutions and reliable procedures for parameter identification. The first objective of this the- sis is to develop mathematical methods and practical protocols to estimate a pest population size and distribution. The second objective is to predict the impact of a specific control strategy on a pest population and identify how full control of the population can be achieved. Typically, the only data available on the field is trapping data. Further, to increase the capture of insects, those traps are often combined with a chemical attractant. The first objective of this thesis is addressed by constructing a generic 2 -dimensional spatio-temporal Trap-Insect-Model (TIM) based on biological and ecological knowledge of the pest. This model is formulated by Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equations which account for the dispersal capacity of the insects, their attractive- ness towards the traps and their demography and trapping. The unknown insect population size and distribution is the initial condition of the model. Usually, the dispersal capacity as well as the parameters related to the traps are also unknown and may vary in time. A major outcome of this thesis is a protocol to identify a set of parameters using trap data collected over a short period of time during which the parameters can be assumed constant. To address the second objective, we consider a model for the control of crop- pest insects via mating disruption, using a female pheromone, and trapping. Here, males are diverted from females compromising their insemination. The model uses compartmental structure taking into account the specific behaviour of the different groups in the population. It is formulated as a system of ODEs. The theoretical analysis of the model yields threshold values for the dosage of the pheromone above which extinction of the population is ensured. The practical relevance of the results obtained in this thesis shows that mathematical modelling is an essential supplement to experiments in optimizing control strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Infective juveniles recovered from larvae and pupae when infected with S. feltiae produced maximum infective juveniles at 20 °C temperatures than all other isolates. H. bacteriophora produced higher number of IJs in larvae and pupae than all other nematode isolates at 25 °C. This paper indicates the application of nematodes with the knowledge of insect <b>pest</b> <b>biology</b> represents a possible new strategy for O. sulcatus larvae and pupae...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of pheromone traps {{is affected by}} trap placement and <b>pest</b> <b>biology,</b> {{as well as by}} the trap and lure design. We evaluated the effect of trap height and placement in relation to surfaces on tobacco moth catches using release-capture experiments. Six traps were mounted vertically in a 9 × 15 × 4. 2 - 5. 8 m shed on a wall at heights of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m. More catches were obtained near the ceiling and at 1 m above the floor in the dark. Catches at 1 m were negligible when light shone through the upper windows. In a 42. 3 × 36. 5 × 4 m tobacco warehouse, the respective efficacies of aerially suspended traps and surface-mounted traps were examined. The number of catches obtained using traps mounted on pillars was significantly higher than that obtained in traps suspended from poles. These results suggest practical considerations for monitoring in warehouses. We recommend eliminating any night lighting and placing traps on surfaces, such as walls and stored commodities, at higher positions that are within reach (1 m) to facilitate convenient inspection...|$|E
40|$|Our project {{focuses on}} modern remote sensing {{technologies}} for surveillance and monitoring organisms that threaten plant biosecurity across broad spatial scales. The future of {{effective and efficient}} biosecurity surveillance programs, and pest management in general, will require {{a higher level of}} automation and technical sophistication and an increased dependence on affordable technologies. Reliable yet effective sampling efforts are imperative to the future of plant biosecurity and food security in general. Our team is investigating sensitivities and capacity of emerging unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and imaging technologies, including multi- and hyperpsectral sensors, for biosecurity surveillance in viticulture, horticultural and grains industries. The overarching aim is to investigate the use of these technologies to support claims of pest freedom and low pest prevalence compared to commonly deployed surveillance practices and utility to inform pest management decisions for established species. The project focuses on the use of science-centric data (e. g., using <b>pest</b> <b>biology</b> to identify areas most likely to be infested) to inform surveillance decisions (e. g., when and where to deploy a UAS equipped with multi-spectral cameras) made by biosecurity personnel and pest managers. This project aims to determine for the first time, how such technologies could improve detection rates and/or surveillance efficiency at the regional, field/orchard or plant level...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>pest</b> control technology, <b>biology</b> and economics is reviewed. The problem of resistance is considered in economic terms. Pest susceptibility {{is defined as}} a resource and {{because of a lack of}} property rights, there is a bias towards its rapid depletion. A lack of property rights for conserving technologies results in their under provision. As the costs of depletion are largely external costs, there is a divergence between decision-making at the individual and societal level. The options for dealing with the problem are identified and evaluated. In the New Zealand apple industry, the basic problem has been exacerbated by an independent approach to fruit grading and pest control research, and by a failure of the latter to identify the economic aspects of resistance. The apple-pest system is interpreted as being on the verge of a resistance episode which could have serious national economic repercussions. The available options are identified and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} rodent control {{programs}} in New York State is reviewed, beginning with state-funded efforts in August, 1967. In 1969, Federal rodent control grant funds {{were used to}} establish four Model Cities programs. At its peak in 1970, programs were active in 18 counties, eight cities and villages, and in six Model Cities areas. The program encompasses all the major metropolitan areas of the state, serving some nine million persons. As {{part of the state}} program, the Rodent Control Evaluation Laboratory was established to investigate chemosterilants as a means of rodent control and to develop knowledge of <b>pest</b> rodent <b>biology.</b> Since then, the investigations program has turned to the problem of rodent resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides both in New York and other states in the eastern United States. Initial rat infestations, which ran 24. 4 percent statewide in 1969, have been decreased 84 percent by late 1973. Similarly, in the same time period, unapproved refuse storage deficiencies were decreased 55. 6 percent and exposed garbage conditions declined 44. 7 percent. Rat bites showed a 40 percent decrease during these same years. By all measures, then, the program has been a success. Most programs have relied heavily upon anticoagulant rodenticides in the chemical control or rodent populations. Zinc phosphide, red squill, and norbormide are also used. Harborage removal and environmental improvement are stressed through active cleanups and educational efforts. During the four-year period, 1969 - 1972, some 177, 000 tons of rat harborage were removed from 66, 000 premises in the state...|$|R
40|$|Major {{locations}} for stored product research in North America are in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and Manhattan, Kansas, USA. Recent personnel changes and research areas are reviewed. One of the pressing research {{areas in the}} U. S. is reducing the need for fumigations in flour mills and evaluating alternative treatments. Long-term studies are beginning to show efficacy of better IPM practices, including use of aerosol treatments, for reducing the need for fumigation. Heat treatment {{as an alternative to}} fumigation continues to be refined through research. Models have been developed for optimizing heat treatments and fumigations. Studies at grain elevators are optimizing insect management at these large storage facilities, including better sampling methods and computer programs that aid in decision making. Recent studies are beginning to look at insect populations in feed mills and their association with microbes. A number of studies have investigated the biology and control of psocids, which are emerging pests of stored products in the U. S. There have been major research efforts in both Canada and the U. S. to develop better sampling and detection methods, including thermal imaging, automated digital x-rays, molecular methods, and development of better attractants and improved interpretation of trap catches. The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is the first agricultural pest to have its genome sequenced, and mining the genome has produced vast knowledge of various physiological processes that might be exploited for control of this and other pests. Expected future research trends are on aerosol treatments of structural facilities, improved methods for detecting internal insect <b>pests,</b> psocid <b>biology,</b> improved attractants, improved interpretation of trap catches for making pest management decisions, and application of genomic technologies for insect control...|$|R
