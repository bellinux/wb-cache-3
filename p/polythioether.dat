First, by changing molecular structure, {{the feasibility of}} forming certain molecular weight of polythioethers was studied. Experiment show that most terminal dienes can react with dithiol generating certain molecular polythioethers. Then, analysis show that the linear polythioethers owning high degree of molecular regularity usually have rather low glass transition temperature (Tg), below - 50 oC, however, those polythioethers are very easily to crystalize. If they are not liquid at room temperature {{they can be used}} as raw rubber. If main chain of <b>polythioether</b> contains benzene ring, 5 % weight loss temperatures will be improved, however, Tg will increase a lot, which cannot allow them to be used at low temperature. At last, using those polythioethers which are liquid at room temperature as raw rubber and Manganese Dioxide (MnO 2) as curing agent, prepare kinds of sealants. The result shows that <b>polythioether</b> sealant prepared by reaction product of 1, 6 -Hexanedithiol and diethylene glycol divinyl ether(DGDE) has the highest tensile strength, which is 5. 84 MPa.

However, simple nucleophilic substitution reactions on halogenated monomers remains relatively unexplored.

RAFT polymerization of BEA generated well-defined homopolymers and block copolymers over a range of molecular weights. The alkylbromine-containing homopolymer and block copolymer precursors were readily substituted by a range of nucleophiles in good to excellent conversion under mild and efficient reaction conditions without the need of additional catalysts.

An ideal drug delivery system should not only be responsive to these signals but also should not elicit an unfavourable host response. This study presents an innovative platform for drug delivery where a natural/synthetic composite system composed of collagen type I and a synthesized <b>polythioether,</b> ensures a dual stimuli-responsive behaviour. Collagen type I is an extracellular matrix constituent protein, responsive to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) cleavage per se. Polythioethers are stable synthetic polymers characterized {{by the presence of}} sulphur, which undergoes a ROS-responsive swelling switch. A <b>polythioether</b> was synthesised, functionalized and tested for cytotoxicity. Optimal conditions to fabricate a composite natural/synthetic hollow sphere construct were optimised by a template-based method. Collagen-polythioether hollow spheres were fabricated, revealing uniform size and ROS-triggered nanoporation features. Cellular metabolic activity of H 9 C 2 cardiomyoblasts remained unaffected upon exposure to the spheres. Our natural/synthetic hollow microspheres exhibit the potential for use as a pathological stimuli-responsive reservoir system for applications in inflammatory diseases.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{efficient}} method to obtain self-healing epoxy resins is discussed. This method {{is based on}} the use of a thiol-disulfide oligomer obtained by partial oxidation of a multifunctional thiol using a hypervalent iodine (III) compound as oxidant. The oligomer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The oligomer was a joint component of the thiol-ene system along with a tetra-allyl-functionalized curing agent. The kinetics of the photopolymerization of diglycidylether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) revealed that conversions of the epoxy groups as high as 80 % were achieved in only 15 minutes by increasing the concentration of the thiol-ene system in the formulation. The disulfide bonds introduced in the copolymer using the thiol-disulfide oligomer allowed the repairing of the test specimens in as little as 10 minutes when the specimens were heated at 80 °C or for 500 minutes at room temperature. The analysis of the mechanical properties using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed that the specimens displayed a healing efficiency up to 111 % compared with the unhealed specimens, depending on the amount of <b>polythioethers</b> present in the copolymer...|$|R
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis {{is to develop a}} {{fluorescent}} probe for imaging the subcellular distribution of kinetically labile copper pools that might {{play a critical role in}} copper homeostasis. Various copper-selective sensors were designed by combining 1, 3, 5 -triaryl- 2 -pyrazoline fluorophores with <b>polythioethers</b> as receptor moieties. A series of donor-substituted 1, 3, 5 -triaryl- 2 -pyrazoline fluorophores were synthesized and characterized in terms of their photophysical and electrochemical properties. Interestingly, the aryl substituents attached to the 1 - and 3 -position of the pyrazoline ring influence the photophysical properties of the fluorophore in distinctly different ways. The excited-state equilibrium energy is primarily influenced by changes of the substituent in the 1 -position, whereas the reduction potential of the fluorophore is determined by the 3 -aryl group. Results from computational analyses agree well with the experimental data. A pyrazoline fluorophore library was synthesized, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied. The compounds cover a broad range of excited state energies and reduction potentials, and allow for selective and differential tuning of these two parameters. A series of thiazacrownethers and tripodal aniline copper(I) receptors were synthesized and their copper binding stoichiometries, stability constants, and copper-self-exchange kinetics were investigated. The measured self-exchange activation parameters revealed for all studied ligands a negative activation entropy, suggesting a predominant associative exchange mechanism. With detailed knowledge of the fluorophore platform and copper receptors, sensor CTAP- 1 was designed, synthesized and characterized. The probe shows a 4. 6 -fold emission enhancement and reaches a quantum yield of 14 % upon saturation with Cu(I). The sensor exhibits excellent selectivity towards Cu(I) and is insensitive towards millimolar concentrations of Mg(II) or Ca(II). Mouse fibroblast cells (3 T 3) incubated with the sensor produced a copper-dependent perinuclear staining pattern, which colocalizes with the subcellular location of the mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. The subcellular topography of copper was further determined by synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence (SXRF) microscopy. Furthermore, microprobe x-ray absorption measurements at various subcellular locations showed a near-edge feature that is characteristic for low-coordinate monovalent copper. The data provide a coherent picture with evidence for a kinetically labile copper pool, which is predominantly localized in the mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. Ph. D.

40|$|Our {{studies in}} the area of single {{electron}} transfer (SET) photochemistry have led to the discovery of efficient processes, in which regioselective formation of carbon-centered radicals takes place by nucleophile assisted desilylation of α-trialkylsilyl substituted ether, thioether, amine and amide centered cation radicals.

40|$|This {{research}} has been directed at the study of organosulfur frontier orbital interactions with transition metal d-orbitals. Two novel thioether complexes tricarbonyl(1, 4, 7 -trithiacyclononane) molybdenum(O) and tricarbonyl(2, 5, 8 -trithianonane) molybdenum(O), have been prepared and structurally characterized by single crystal x-ray crystallography. The facial configuration of the carbonyl ligands provides a unique point of reference for describing the two <b>polythioether</b> ligands {{in terms of the}} free ligand's frontier orbitals. The relative carbonyl stretching frequencies of the two metal complexes indicate that 1, 4, 7 -trithiacyclononane is a poorer donor than 2, 5, 8 -trithianonane. This result is explained in terms of mechanical constraints placed on the mesocyclic <b>polythioether</b> which are absent in its acyclic analogue. The coordinatively unsaturated species (n⁵-C₅H₅) MO(NO) (SC₆H₅) ₂ has been characterized by x-ray crystallography and its electronic structure has been modeled using Fenske-Hall molecular orbital calculations. The monomeric nature and chemical inertness of (n⁵-C₅H₅) MO(NO) (SC₆H₅) ₂ are attributed to dπ-pπ bonding between the thiolate ligands and an empty molybdenum dπ orbital. The dπ-pπ interaction simultaneously strengthens the metal thiolate bond and makes the complex less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by raising the energy of the LUMO. The rotational orientations of the thiolate ligands observed in the solid state support this electronic model. For (n⁵-C₅H₅) Fe(CO) ₂SR, the dπ-pπI antibonding interaction between the thiolate ligand and the metal has been modeled using Fenske-Hall molecular orbital calculations and experimentally investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy. The calculations predict that the HOMO is metal-sulfurn-antibonding and largely sulfur 3 p in character. The observed HOMO ionization energies of (n⁵-C₅H₅) Fe(CO) ₂SC₆H₄-p-Z; Z = OMe, H, Cl, CF₃, N 0 ₂; correlate with several chemical properties including the rate of electrophilic attack on the sulfur by alkyl halides to give the thioether complex [(n⁵-C₅H₅) Fe(CO) ₂(SR₂) ]X and by electron-deficient alkynes to give the heterometallacycle (n⁵-C₅H₅) (CO) FeS(R) -C=C=C= 0. The latter reaction is compared to the similar reaction of alkenes and alkynes with (n⁵-C₅H₅) Fe(CO) ₂PR₂ to give (n⁵-C₅H₅) (CO) FeP(R) ₂-C=C-C= 0.
