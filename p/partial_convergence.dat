40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an alternative}} model of infinitary term rewriting. Instead of a metric, a partial order on terms is employed to formalise (strong) convergence. We compare this <b>partial</b> order <b>convergence</b> of orthogonal term rewriting systems {{to the usual}} metric convergence of the corresponding B{"o}hm extensions. The B{"o}hm extension of a term rewriting system contains additional rules to equate so-called root-active terms. The core result we present is that reachability w. r. t. <b>partial</b> order <b>convergence</b> coincides with reachability w. r. t. metric convergence in the B{"o}hm extension. This result is used to show that, unlike in the metric model, orthogonal systems are infinitarily confluent and infinitarily normalising in the partial order model. Moreover, we obtain, as in the metric model, a compression lemma. A corollary of this lemma is that reachability w. r. t. <b>partial</b> order <b>convergence</b> is a conservative extension of reachability w. r. t. metric convergence...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} one primary aim: to analyze whether there exists {{evidence}} {{in favor of}} inflation convergence, complete convergence, or common trends, <b>partial</b> <b>convergence,</b> within the European Union (EU). The analysis is done in a bivariate and multivariate framework, for traded and non-traded inflation rates, using sequential unit root tests, common trends analysis, and cointegration tests that allow for structural breaks. The results {{suggest that there is}} a di¤erent behavior between traded and non-traded inflation rates. In the bivariate framework, there is much stronger evidence of complete convergence for traded inflation rates than for non-traded inflation rates. In the multivariate framework, the complete convergence is only presented in the most tradeable inflation rate and there is a small number of common trends for the rest of traded inflation rates that suggests evidence of <b>partial</b> <b>convergence</b> in terms of long-run relationships.

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} {{politician}} behavior predict complete or partial policy convergence, whereby electoral competition compels partisan politicians to choose positions more moderate than their most-preferred policies. Alternatively, if politicians cannot overcome {{the inability to}} make binding pre-commitments to policies, the expected result is complete policy divergence. By exploiting a regression discontinuity (RD) design inherent in the Congressional electoral system, this paper empirically tests the strong predictions of the complete divergence hypothesis against the alternative of <b>partial</b> <b>convergence</b> {{within the context of}} Representatives' roll call voting behavior in the U. S. House (1946 - 1994). The RD design implies that which party wins a district seat is quasi-randomly assigned among elections that turn out to be 'close'. We use this variation to examine if Representatives' roll call voting patterns do not respond to large exogenous changes in the probability of winning the election, the strong prediction of complete policy divergence. The evidence is more consistent with full divergence and less consistent with <b>partial</b> <b>convergence,</b> suggestive that the difficulty of establishing credible commitments to policies is an important real-world phenomenon. ...|$|E

In fact, our bounds are tight whenever the over-relaxation parameter ranges in $(0, 2]$.
