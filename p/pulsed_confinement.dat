5000|$|B-65, {{completed}} in 1957, was built {{using the new}} [...] "racetrack" [...] layout. This {{was the result of}} the observation that adding helical coils to the curved portions of the device produced a field that introduced the rotation purely through the resulting magnetic fields. This had the added advantage that the magnetic field included shear, which was known to improve stability. B-3, also {{completed in}} 1957, was a greatly enlarged B-2 machine with ultra-high vacuum and <b>pulsed</b> <b>confinement</b> up to 50,000 gauss and projected confinement times as long as 0.01 second. The last of the B-series machines was the B-66, completed in 1958, which was essentially a combination of the racetrack layout from B-65 with the larger size and energy of the B-3.|$|E
40|$|The 2 XIIB mirror {{confinement}} experiment makes unique {{demands on}} its vacuum system. The confinement coil set encloses a cavity whose surface {{is comprised of}} both simple and compound curves. Within this cavity and {{at the core of}} the machine is the operating vacuum which is on the order of 10 $sup - 9 $ Torr. The vacuum container fits inside the cavity, presenting an inside surface suitable for titanium getter pumping and a means of removing the heat load imposed by incandescent sublimator wires. In addition, the cavity is constructed of nonmagnetic and nonconducting materials (nonmetals) to avoid distortion of the <b>pulsed</b> <b>confinement</b> field. It is also isolated from mechanical shocks induced in the machine's main structure when the coils are pulsed. This paper describes the design, construction, and operation of the 2 XIIB high-vacuum vessel that has been performing successfully since early 1974. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Electrosurgery, {{one of the}} most-often used {{surgical}} tools, is {{a robust}} but somewhat crude technology that has changed surprisingly little since its invention almost a century ago. Contin-uous radiofrequency is still used for tissue cutting, with thermal damage extending to hundreds of micrometers. In contrast, lasers developed 70 years later, have been constantly perfected, and the laser-tissue interactions explored in great detail, which has allowed tissue ablation with cellular precision in many laser appli-cations. We discuss mechanisms of tissue damage by electric field, and demonstrate that electrosurgery with properly optimized waveforms and microelectrodes can rival many advanced lasers. Pulsed electric waveforms with burst durations ranging from 10 to 100 s applied via insulated planar electrodes with 12 m wide exposed edges produced plasma-mediated dissection of tissues with the collateral damage zone ranging from 2 to 10 m. Length of the electrodes can vary from micrometers to centimeters and all types of soft tissues—from membranes to cartilage and skin could be dissected in liquid medium and in a dry field. This technology may allow for major improvements in outcomes of the current surgical procedures and development of much more refined surgical techniques.
