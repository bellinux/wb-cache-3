40|$|Transport plays a {{controversial}} role and highly related to almost {{all sectors of}} human activities. It {{plays an important role}} in stimulating economy and promoting the well being and quality of human life. However, its negative impact on the environment in the form of pollution is increasing at a high rate, and thus becoming a serious threat to plant, animal and human life. In the recent decades, goods transport has been intensified and its contribution to the environmental deterioration is steadily increasing. Transport of agricultural produce, means of production, food and wood is a significant component of goods transport as a whole in Sweden, and the trend of intensification is analogous with other sectors. The paper addresses the transport-induced environmental constraints with especial emphasis on goods transport in agricultural sector. Brief analysis is made on the causes and effects of goods transport intensification. Global and national awareness on the amelioration of the most pervasive environmental problems such as pollution, global warming and ozone depletion are presented. A brief account is given on goods flow within farms, to and from farms and the tendencies in <b>production,</b> <b>holdings,</b> and transport demand in each sub-sector is discussed. The paper presents also the general visions and strategies to reach the goal of the development of environmentally sustainable goods transport. It emphasized the role of Information Technology to attenuate the intensity of transport and its consequence on environment. Finally, the role of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and its sectoral responsibility in agricultural transport is highlighted and some plausible proposals are forwarded to facilitate research and education to promote the environmentally sustainable goods transport in the sector...|$|E

40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for ornamental purposes. Another group is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to <b>production</b> <b>holdings.</b> Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like balcony and patio plants, some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low plant density. Overhead sprinklers induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower nurseries, potted plant nurseries are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species. Even if they are specialised in one plant type, different plant stages are present at the same time, like with Kalanchoë and Chrysanthemum...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{production}} {{is an integral}} part of Ghana’s agricultural economy and a major source of livelihood for many rural households in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana. In Ghana, animals are raised under the extensive, semi-intensive and/or intensive system. However, the extensive system is the commonest method and it is practiced most especially in rural communities. Animal <b>production</b> <b>holdings</b> are commercially, family or individually owned. Commercial farmers normally keep poultry, and mostly under the intensive system. Different animal species are reared in Ghana purposely for local consumption. This paper provides an analysis of animal and meat production in Ghana within a 10 year period. Between 2001 and 2010 the average of live animal production was 3, 958, 560 for goats, 3, 269, 460 for sheep, 1, 373, 700 for cattle, 404, 600 for pigs, and 33, 252 for chickens. In general, the increase in goat and sheep production was higher than the increase in cattle, pigs and chicken production within this period. Averages of meat production in Tonnes were 34, 427, 24, 491, 13, 535, 12, 336 and 12, 056, for chicken (chicken meat), beef (cattle meat), pork (pig meat), chevon (goat meat) and mutton (sheep meat), respectively. The increase in chicken meat was the highest within this period. Total meat production in Tonnes was 177, 723 in 2001, 176, 086 in 2002, 181, 686 in 2003, 186, 470 in 2004, 188, 537 in 2005, 191, 021 in 2006, 198, 093 in 2007, 220, 243 in 2008, 232, 516 in 2009 and 244, 742 in 2010. Opportunities for increased animal and meat production in Ghana still exist since the country imports animal and meat from abroad. This overview provides reference data of animal and meat production in Ghana. It is expected that the Government and other stakeholders will use this data in planning and making of policies, and to monitor changes that may occur overtime...|$|E

The intensity of emigration has altered the demographic structure and reproductive base of the rural population, along with the income of rural households. The rural and agricultural labour market faces a mismatch with respect to the unfavourable age, education and spatial distribution of the total labour force. A reduction in the participation of women in the agricultural labour force is a new feature. The overall transformation is apparent in the income structure of rural households. An increase of the share of households with mixed income sources notably stems from households that receive remittances and foreign currency funds from family members abroad.

Their study uses the ratio of per capita income derived from crops to the sum of all other incomes as an indicator of livelihood diversification for the years 1989 and 1994. Their study focuses only on drought-prone areas during the survey years. The aim of the present study is to explore further the demographic and economic determinants of the dynamics of income diversification using survey data. The data used in this study cover larger and more representative sample and was colleted from rural Ethiopia during 1994 and 1997 harvest years. This study investigates not only the determinants of participation and intensity of off-farm activities, but also factors that affect the dynamics between 1994 and 1997. The results of this study attempt to answer the question: to what extent initial conditions (for instance, asset <b>holdings,</b> <b>production,</b> and crop income) prompt households to diversify to off-farm activities overtime. The results show that participation in off-farm activities is mainly driven by demographic factors, whereas land and other asset ownership as well as crop production and income affect intensity of off-farm activities. The dynamic model results show that farm families who have initially diversified to more off-farm activities subsequently realized less income diversification. Families with more initial crop production from slack harvest season subsequently realized greater income from off-farm activities in 1997. The study also confirms that it is only during slack harvest season that off-farm and on-farm activities are complement each other.

Knowledge of where, when and how incursions have occurred helps assess the risks, and regionalize preventative and reactive measures. Methodology: Based on reports of British governmental veterinary services, we review occurrence of the former OIE List A diseases, and of Aujeszky’s disease, anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in farm-animals in Great Britain (GB) between 1938 and 2007. We estimate incidence of each disease on GB agricultural holdings and fraction of susceptible farm-animals culled to control the disease each year. We then consider the frequency and incidence of the diseases in Scotland alone. The limitations of available data on historical disease occurrence and denominator populations are detailed in Text S 2. Conclusions: The numbers of livestock and poultry farmed in GB grew over the years 1938 – 2007; the number of agricultural holdings decreased. An amalgamation of <b>production</b> on larger <b>holdings</b> took place from the 1940 s to the 1980 s.

40|$|Energy is an {{important}} production factor in glasshouse horticulture. However in recent years glasshouse growers are faced with increasing energy prices and growing environmental concerns. In 2000 the Flemish government decided to stimulate environmentally sound investments by means of investment subsidies. In the current research the factors influencing the adoption of environmentally sound and energy saving technologies by glasshouse growers are analysed. Based on the innovation diffusion theory the hypothesis is that external factors, personal characteristics of the firm manager (personal objectives, age, education level, importance attached to subsidies, [...] .) and fixed characteristics (business objectives, business size, modernity, [...] .) determine investment behaviour. Data for the research are obtained from accounting data and interviews at 58 holdings specialised in vegetable <b>production</b> and 79 <b>holdings</b> specialised in <b>production</b> of ornamental plants. These holdings all belong to the Farm Accountancy Data Network of the Centre of Agricultural Economics. PRINCALS and discriminant analysis are used to analyse the data. The most important investments are the conversion from fuel oil to natural gas and the installation or use of energy saving screens. An important obstacle to the conversion to natural gas, as determined by this study, {{is the lack of}} natural gas pipelines in the surroundings of the glasshouse holding. The holdings which currently use natural gas are mainly large, energy-intensive businesses with younger managers. Those who intend to change over to natural gas attach a great importance to investment subsidies as they have smaller but growth-oriented business. Investments in energy saving screens are important for producers of energy intensive ornamental plants. In most of the cases these investments consist of replacement of the existing energy saving screens with more efficient ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} the CAP in 1999, with {{extensive}} revisions in 2003 (Council regulation 1782 / 2003), was constructed around three central ideas: decoupling, cross-compliance of payments, and modulation. Decoupling, which is specifically analysed in this article, is intended to eliminate all aid linked {{in one way or}} another to production, in favour of aid which is completely independent of the production activity. It is encapsulated in the new 2003 regulation by the introduction of the right to a single farm payment (SFP) proportional to farm area, independent of production activities. These new arrangements have been accompanied by much variation in the application of the reform, and the member states have taken great advantage of the extensive room for manoeuvre inherent in the new regulation. This is revealed in the extreme diversity of choices made, both in the degree of decoupling (total or partial) and in the methods of calculating the SFPs (historical or regionalised references). In order to better understand the reasons for and practical details of the differing national choices, this article presents a synthesis of the results of a comparative study of how the SFPs are managed in four large EU 15 countries (Germany, the UK, Spain and Italy), chosen because of the diversity in their approaches to decoupling and the calculation and trade of the SFPs. Objective economic data specific to each country and national political context are combined to e on the evolution of production systems and xplain the observations, taking into account both the implications of how agricultural <b>holdings,</b> <b>production</b> systems and land are categorised, and the expected effects structures.

40|$|The Free State (FS) and North West (NW) Provinces {{are often}} hard hit by {{droughts}} with impacts on water availability, farm <b>production</b> and livestock <b>holdings.</b> The South African government declared the two Provinces drought disaster {{areas in the}} 2015 / 2016 hydrological year. This is a major drawback, since both the Provinces {{play an important role}} to South African economy as they are a haven to agricultural production and have major water reservoirs in South Africa. This study was undertaken to investigate the historical evolution of drought within the FS and NW Provinces over the past 30 years. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated based on monthly meteorological data from 14 weather/climate stations within the FS and NW Provinces were used to explore and characterize variation in drought intensity, duration, frequency and severity in FS and NW Provinces during 1985 – 2015. Results indicate that there exist localized positive and negative trends with spatial dependence across the selected stations. In particular, about 60 % of the weather stations exhibiting a decreasing trend are located in FS Province, suggesting that FS has being experiencing increasing drought during the analyzed period compared to NW Province. Results from the analysis of drought evaluation indicators (DEIs) calculated from SPEI suggest that drought severity and frequency was more pronounced in FS while the intensity of the drought was more in NW Province during 1985 – 2015. In addition, based on SPEI calculations, moderate drought occurrences increased during 1985 – 1994 and 1995 – 2004 periods and decreased thereafter (2005 – 2015) in both Provinces. Drought classification based on parameters derived from SPEI produced similar results for mild drought occurrences during the same time scales...|$|R
