The group held copyright on all its work and published over 20 research reports between 1978 and 1992. Taylor published an account of the anti-nuclear movement in The Ecologist - a text used by the Open University for its Control of Technology Course, an on assessments of nuclear risk in the science journal Nature.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Cockburn {{moved to}} the US in 1972 and once there he set himself up as a journalist. He would become close friends with Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Israel Shahak, Andrew Kopkind, and Saul Landau, among others. Cockburn wrote for many publications, {{including}} The New York Review of Books, Esquire, and Harper's. From 1973 to 1983 he was a writer with The Village Voice, originating its longstanding [...] "Press Clips" [...] column, in his time there he interviewed Rupert Murdoch after a struggle over the ownership of The Voice culminated in Murdoch buying the paper. James Ridgeway later noted [...] "Murdoch, when he owned the Voice, was said to gag on some of Alex's pointed epithets, but he never did anything about it. He actually had us both to lunch and offered us a column." [...] Cockburn went on to write Idle Passion: Chess and the Dance of Death (1975) as a class history of chess, {{and a lot of}} [...] "bogus Freudian stuff", as he would later put it, in a critical evaluation of the claims made for chess. In the late 1970s Cockburn and Ridgeway wrote <b>Political</b> <b>Ecology</b> in which they went through numerous areas of US domestic policy, whether it was housing or agriculture, critically examining each topic, making proposals to adjust policy.|$|E

Analysing the relationship between the energies generated by mass strike action and the narrative energetics of fiction, the article explores how Wilkinson and de Boissière reshape the novel form in their efforts to represent working-class life...|$|R

This article questions how climate change discourse translates into lived worlds in such places. It reviews arguments that challenge the easy transfer of knowledge about data and models into contested <b>political</b> <b>ecologies</b> of territorial claims and sovereign powers. Using a longitudinal series of ethnographic vignettes, the theme of human dimensions of climate change is explored to connect debates in critical social theory of the anthropocene with the dialogical remonstrations of communities who experience climate change policies as a new stage in state encroachment on local livelihoods and wellbeing. People in northern Nepal speak of needing to cultivate reciprocal connections to territorial sovereigns, while being aware of {{not knowing how to}} act in uncertain political and economic times...|$|R

Situated within these extensive, heterogenous, and dynamic assemblages, which I contextualize in historical-geographical terms throughout Chapter I, I narrow my argument to three relatively neglected problematics that occupy subsequent chapters: the role of pigs in the affective construction of modernity, the microbiological zones of insecurity intertwined with industrial pig production, and the re-valorization of urban food waste through peri-urban pig farming, including so-called “garbage pigs. ” Animated by broad political, ethical, ontological, and epistemological concerns about society and ecology, culture and technology, and food and the mass-production of commodified organisms, this research helps demonstrate how fraught relationships between pigs, people, and place participate {{in the politics of}} "modernity" in the People's Republic of China. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} on the materiality of cities {{has been criticized}} by critical urban scholars for being overly descriptive and failing to account for political economy. We argue that through the conceptualization of urban metabolisms advanced by ecological economists and industrial ecologists, materialist and critical perspectives can be mutually enriching. We focus on conflict that has erupted in Delhi, India. Authorities have embraced waste-to-energy incinerators, and wastepickers fear that these changes threaten their access to waste, while middle class residents oppose them because of their deleterious impact on ambient air quality. We narrate {{the emergence of an}} unlikely alliance between these groups, whose politics opposes the production of a waste-based commodity frontier within the city. We conclude that the materiality and political economy of cities are co-constituted, and contestations over the (re) configuration of urban metabolisms span these spheres as people struggle to realize situated urban <b>political</b> <b>ecologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{conceptual}} {{tools in}} historical analyses {{of environmental issues}} and <b>political</b> <b>ecologies</b> have gained much attention in recent years: ecologically unequal exchange and landesque capital. The former narrows in on how societal relations of power allow for the physical transfer of environmental degradation—upon which our daily consumption rests—to places far away from our environmentally clean (and therefore often presumed sustainable) homes, cities and regions. The latter focuses instead {{on the power of}} human activity to improve environmental conditions, commonly in terms of soil fertility, biodiversity, land cover, carrying capacity, resilience vis-à-vis ecological degradation, or other dimensions of sustainability. One draws attention to the geographically uneven and ecologically detrimental consequences of human activities, while the other draws attention to the potential of human activities to reinforce the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. There is an interesting tension between these processes which calls for closer inspection. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to bring them together in the same empirical analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{discourse}} of resilience has increasingly been utilised {{to advance the}} political prioritisation of enhanced security and to extend the performance of risk management in the Anthropocene. This has been notably advanced through integrated approaches that engage with uncertainty, complexity and volatility {{in order to survive}} and thrive in the future. Within this context, and drawing on findings from a number of EU-wide research projects tasked with operationalising critical infrastructure resilience, this paper provides a much- needed assessment of how resilience ideas are shaping how critical infrastructure providers and operators deal with complex risks to ‘lifeline’ systems and networks, whilst also illuminating the tensions elicited in the paradigm shift from protective-based risk management towards adaptive-based resilience. In doing so, we also draw attention to the implications of this transition for organisational governance and for the <b>political</b> <b>ecologies</b> of the Anthropocene that calls for more holistic, adaptable and equitable ways of assessing and working with risk across multiple systems, networks and scales...|$|R

'Road ecology' has emerged as an approach to evaluate the various ecological and hydrological impacts of roads. This article aims to complement road ecology by examining the socio-spatial processes of road building itself. Focusing on the Brazilian Amazon, a heavily-studied context due to forest fragmentation by roads, the authors consider non-state social actors who build 'unofficial roads' {{for the purpose of}} gaining access to natural resources to support livelihoods and community development. They examine four case studies of roads with distinct histories in order to explain the socio-spatial processes behind road building in terms of profit maximization, land tenure claims, co-operative and conflictive <b>political</b> <b>ecologies,</b> and constraints as well as opportunities afforded by the biophysical environment. The study cases illustrate the need for a multi-pronged theoretical approach to understanding road building, and call for more attention to the role of non-state actors in unofficial road construction...|$|R

40|$|Biochar {{currently}} attracts {{technological and}} market optimism, promising multiple wins – for climate change, food security, bioenergy and health – not least for African farmers. This paper examines the political-economic and discursive processes constructing biochar as a novel green commodity, creating new alliances amongst scientists, businesses, venture capital firms and non-governmental organisations. Carbon market logics {{are not only}} threatening large-scale land grabs for biochar feedstocks but also other forms of resource, labour and ecological appropriation through driving {{research and development and}} shaping small-scale pilot projects. In these, soil carbon is ‘chopped out’ of its ecosystem and social contexts and revalued as exchangeable pieces of carbon nature. Farmers are hailed as green actors and market winners, provided they discipline their practices according to these new technical and market logics. These discourses contrast strongly with the farmers' existing conceptual and practical repertoires; a case study from Liberia illustrates how farmers already manipulate soil carbon in creating locally valued anthropogenic dark earths, but within diverse farming repertoires, ontologies of human–nature interrelationship and historical and <b>political</b> <b>ecologies...</b>|$|R
