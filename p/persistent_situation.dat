Semantically, such construction conveys either a resulting state or a <b>persistent</b> <b>situation,</b> {{in accordance with the}} aspectual type of the situation. Syntactically, the existential verb in the perfect construction is not thoroughly grammaticalized as an aspect marker, but retains some element of its core meaning such as denoting that an entity exists. Moreover, they show distinct features from the serial verb constructions in terms of the aff ixation. Regarding a possible historical origin of the perfect constructions with existential verbs, I conclude that it is the functional borrowing from the neighboring languages...|$|E
40|$|The Aspect Hypothesis (Andersen 2 ̆ 6 Shirai, 1994; 1996) {{proposes that}} the {{inherent}} lexical aspect of verbs {{plays a major}} role in the acquisition of tense-aspect (TA) morphology in both first and second language. This has been attested in most studies on TA morphology conducted with past and present TA markers. The present study examined the acquisition of Present Perfect, a rather insufficiently studied TA form from a Prototype Account, in two of its four functions, Experiential Past and <b>Persistent</b> <b>Situation.</b> The subjects were 85 L 1 -Spanish English language learners at intermediate and advanced levels. All participants had received formal instruction in English grammar as part of their curriculum. The data was collected through a forced-choice task with 16 situations equally distributed between the two Present Perfect functions and between telic and atelic verbs of four semantic categories: stative, activities, achievements, and accomplishments. Participants had to choose the correct verb form out of three options (Present, Past or Present Perfect) that would best complete the sentences given. The results showed evidence of clear developmental stages in the acquisition of the Present Perfect. The stages were characterized by an important role of proficiency level and lexical aspect as the more proficient participants showed a more accurate use of the target form. In addition, both the intermediate and advanced groups showed a tendency towards employing <b>Persistent</b> <b>Situation</b> with atelic verb types, whereas they used Experiential Past with telic verbs. Contrary to the predictions of the AH, the use that seemed to be first acquired and easier to learn was <b>Persistent</b> <b>Situation,</b> which obtained higher correctness rates in both groups than Experiential Past. When the results were analyzed across each aspectual verb type, the pattern of acquisition was less clear and thereby partly met the claims of the AH. This irregular trend attested in the data encouraged the argument that the acquisition of the functions of the Present Perfect may not be solely influenced by lexical aspect and verb prototypicality but several other factors may be at stake, such as sentence-type effect, input distribution, L 1 transfer and rote-learned forms. Therefore, developmental stages in the acquisition of the Present Perfect should be examined in view of an interplay of 2 ̆ 2 multiple factors 2 ̆ 2 as already proposed by Sugaya and Shirai (2007), which work simultaneously and in a complementary fashion in the acquisitional process of TA morphology...|$|E

40|$|Modern theorists rarely {{agree on}} how to {{represent}} the categories of tense and aspect, making a consistent analysis for phenomena, such as the present perfect, more difficult to attain. It has been argued in previous analyses that the variable behavior of the present perfect between languages licenses independently motivated treatments, particularly of a morphosyntactic or semanticsyntactic nature (Giorgi & Pianesi 1997; Schmitt 2001; Ilari 2001). More specifically, the wellknown readings of the American English (AE) present perfect (resultative, experiential, <b>persistent</b> <b>situation,</b> recent past (Comrie 1976)), {{are at odds with}} the readings of the corresponding structure in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), the 'pretérito perfeito composto' (default iterativity and occasional duration (Ilari 1999)). Despite these variations, the present work, assuming a tense-aspect framework at the semantic-pragmatic interface, will provide a unified analysis for the present perfect in AE and BP, which have traditionally been treated as semantically divergent. The present perfect meaning, in conjunction with the aspectual class of the predicate, can account for the major differences between languages, particularly regarding iterativity and the "present perfect puzzle", regarding adverb compatibility...|$|E

Apractical method for cross-section strength calculation of flexural reinforced concrete members with rectangular compression zone using curvilinear concrete stress-strain diagrams of Eurocode 2 (EN- 2) is presented in this article. The method {{can be used for}} strength calculation of members with flanges and reinforcement in compression zone as well. Curvilinear EN- 2 stress diagrams are readily superseded by polynomials that can be easily integrated are proposed by the author. It gives opportunity for mathematically accurate, without changing of curvilinear diagram by arbitrary diagrams, determination of value and location for resultant of concrete compression zone stresses and location of neutral axes as well. Calculation is performed for any chosen strain of the layer subjected to the maximum compression. The said strain may be of greater or less value in comparison to that corresponding to the concrete strength. In this way the maximum strength of the member can be estimated when the compression zone strain value varies within chosen interval. The method is suitable in both cases for the members which are commonly (not abundantly) and abundantly reinforced if the neutral axes is located within the cross-section, i. e. within the interval up to the centre of the tensile reinforcement cross-sectional area. Strength of members reinforced with high strength reinforcement which is not sufficiently prestressed or not prestressed at all can be determined by calculation. Formulae can be used for calculation of stress-strain state in <b>persistent</b> <b>situations</b> (not ultimate ones) and for calculation of steel prestress value as well. Rectangular compression zone parameters required for member strength calculation using curvilinear stress diagram are presented in the article.

40|$|Abstract Background A small {{fraction}} of Human T cell Leukemia Virus type- 1 (HTLV-I) infected subjects develop a severe form of myelopathy. It has been established that patients with HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) show an exaggerated immune response {{when compared with the}} immunological response observed in HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers. In this study the immunological responses in HAM/TSP patients and in HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers were compared using several immunological assays to identify immunological markers associated with progression from infection to disease. Methods Immunoproliferation assays, cytokine levels of unstimulated cultures, and flow cytometry analysis were used to evaluate the studied groups. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks) were used to compare the difference between the groups. Results Although both groups showed great variability, HAM/TSP patients had higher spontaneous lymphoproliferation as well as higher IFN-γ levels in unstimulated supernatants when compared with asymptomatic carriers. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated a high frequency of inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ and TNF-α) producing lymphocytes in HAM/TSP as compared to the asymptomatic group. This difference was accounted for mainly by an increase in CD 8 cell production of these cytokines. Moreover, the HAM/TSP patients also expressed an increased frequency of CD 28 -/CD 8 + T cells. Since forty percent of the asymptomatic carriers had spontaneous lymphoproliferation and IFN-γ production similar to HAM/TSP patients, IFN-γ levels were measured eight months after the first evaluation in some of these patients to observe if this was a transient or a <b>persistent</b> <b>situation.</b> No significant difference was observed between the means of IFN-γ levels in the first and second evaluation. Conclusions The finding that a large proportion of HTLV-I carriers present similar immunological responses to those observed in HAM/TSP, strongly argues for further studies to evaluate these parameters as markers of HAM/TSP progression. </p...|$|E
40|$|According to some {{historical}} linguists, {{the early}} English HAVE + past participle construction {{had only one}} meaning (e. g. Mustanoja 1960 : 499 - 500, Carey 1994), namely the resultative perfect. However, recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the Old English HAVE + past participle construction has much more in common with the Modern English present perfect than was previously thought (Lee 2003 and Łęcki 2010). Reading of the literature of both diachronic and synchronic analyses opens up terminological issues of the usage of “uses”, “meanings” and “functions”. Such terminological ambiguity is in fact a reflection of the uncertainty as to the true nature of HABBAN + past participle construction or the present perfect in Modern English. A recent synchronic corpus-based analysis of the present perfect (Žic Fuchs 2009) has shown that we are faced with four constructions each reflecting a specific meaning, the most frequent two being the resultative and the experiential, which are primarily aspectually marked. The other two meanings, the perfect of <b>persistent</b> <b>situation</b> and the perfect of recent past, exhibit lower frequency counts and features of relative tense. This study differs from views expressed by authors such as Klein (1994) and Declerck (2006) have {{gone to great lengths to}} prove the status of the present perfect as belonging to the tense system. On the other hand, Lyons (1968 : 315 - 316) and Comrie (1976) see it predominantly as aspect. On the basis of an extensive analysis of HAVE + past participle constructions in Old and Middle English corpora (The York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose and Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English, Second Edition), the development of aspectual and relative tense meaning constructions will be demonstrated. Frequency of occurrence of different meaning constructions will be compared to contemporary evidence found in Modern English corpora. Thus the basic aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the development of meaning constructions that we find in Modern English present perfect...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} policy {{response to the}} 2007 - 2010 sanitary crisis in the Chilean salmon industry, the second largest producer and exporter of salmon in the world. This industry is an emblematic case of the possible consequences of employing an intensive natural resource model for development. The research draws upon the two literatures on policy learning and policy change, and crisis and disaster management, and upon the system failure to explain the causes and consequences of the sanitary crisis in the industry. The thesis employs the qualitative method of case study and utilises primary and secondary sources of data and information. The main argument of the research is {{that the process of}} policy learning during and following catastrophic events {{is very different from the}} process of the policy learning during normal times. The main findings are, firstly, in the case of the Chilean salmon industry, the sanitary crisis disrupted the industry governance processes, including the regulatory framework of the industry, opening a window for radical institutional change. Secondly, potentially radical measures were part of a set of policies that emerged as initial responses, after which a set of more incremental policy responses were developed and applied. Moreover, the sanitary crisis was not transient nor episodic but was enduring, persistent and dynamic. Thirdly, the policy responses to the sanitary crisis destabilised the consensus in the Chilean industry causing conflict and ambiguity over policy responses. The thesis contributes to the policy learning and policy change literature in the context of catastrophic events by extending the view this literature offers on dramatic events such as crises, by considering them as dynamic and <b>persistent</b> <b>situations,</b> analysing their potential as precipitators of radical policy change, and providing a means for considering the timing and processes by which this radical policy change may occur and be directed toward better social outcomes...|$|R

Systematic changes in the frequencies of EXTEs are investigated by the Mann–Kendall test and a method based on the Wilcoxon test. The catalogue of macrocirculation types over central Europe (the Hess–Brezowsky classification) is applied to investigate the connections between EXTEs and large-scale circulation. Circulation classes (HBC) are defined, and mostly spatial averages of EXTEs are examined. There were large long-term fluctuations in the frequencies of both winter extreme cold events (EXCEs) and summer extreme warm events (EXWEs) during the 20 th century.

The analyses of data were accomplished through the statistical use of t-tests, one-way analysis of variance tests, and qualitative exposition. The sample consisted of 446 secondary school instructors, selected senior high school and junior high school respondents from five high schools and five junior high schools in the Tucson area. The examination of 54 educational stressors was conducted under the auspices of six research hypotheses which identified the variables on which senior high school teachers and junior high school teachers differed. The independent variables that were investigated were: sex (male and female teachers), teaching experience (0 to 4 years of completed teaching experience, 5 to 9 years of completed teaching experience, 10 to 16 years of completed teaching experience, and 17 to 38 years of completed teaching experience), age (21 go 30 years of age, 31 to 40 years of age, 41 to 50 years of age, and 51 to 67 years of age), marital status (married, single, widowed, divorced, and separated), and types of college degrees (bachelor's, bachelor's plus, master's, and master's plus or doctorate). An additional 63 educational stressors were named by the secondary school participants and listed in the study. For the {{purpose of this}} study the researcher developed the Teacher Stress Survey which was given to the 10 Tucson secondary school teaching faculties. The survey consisted of five parts: (1) 15 demographic items, (2) 54 educational stressors and their degrees of discomfort, (3) common and <b>persistent</b> distressful educational <b>situations</b> in the secondary school environment, (4) the coping strategies used to reduce or dispel the stress in the distressful educational situations and their levels of effectiveness, and (5) more appropriate or better coping strategies that might have been used. Over 70 % of the secondary school instructors responded. The immediate crises' situations involving teaching materials and personnel seemed to be more distreeful to junior high teachers than high school teachers whose primary concerns were centered on the school's misuse of power and authority and the teacher's struggle with inadequate salary and unrealistic educational expectations. The 20 educational stressors identified by female teachers involved all areas of the educational spectrum [...] from paperwork to the future of education [...] while male teachers evinced concern with the lack of adequate salary and inconsistent educational methods and philosophies. The teachers with the least experience showed the most distress, particularly in the areas of school policy and populace. The teachers with the most experience were concerned about teacher representation, salary, and materials. The oldest teachers had the greatest distress in their lack of control over assignment, salary, and subject matter as well as their feelings of lack of self-esteem through professional stagnation. The marital status of the teachers did have a significant effect derived from their dissatisfaction with salary, the power of the school board and the superintendent, lack of teaching materials, lack of job security, the derogatory public view of education, and the paperwork overload.

40|$|Determining {{the role}} of {{different}} precipitation periods for peak discharge generation is crucial for both projecting future changes in flood probability and for short- and medium-range flood forecasting. In this study, catchment-averaged daily precipitation time series are analyzed prior to annual peak discharge events (floods) in Switzerland. The high number of floods considered – more than 4000 events from 101 catchments have been analyzed – allows to derive significant information about {{the role of}} antecedent precipitation for peak discharge generation. Based on the analysis of precipitation times series, a new separation of flood-related precipitation periods is proposed: (i) the period 0 to 1 day before flood days, when the maximum flood-triggering precipitation rates are generally observed, (ii) the period 2 to 3 days before flood days, when longer-lasting synoptic situations generate "significantly higher than normal" precipitation amounts, and (iii) the period from 4 days to 1 month before flood days when previous wet episodes may have already preconditioned the catchment. The novelty of this study lies in the separation of antecedent precipitation into the precursor antecedent precipitation (4 days before floods or earlier, called PRE-AP) and the short range precipitation (0 to 3 days before floods, a period when precipitation is often driven by one <b>persistent</b> weather <b>situation</b> like e. g., a stationary low-pressure system). A precise separation of "antecedent" and "peak-triggering" precipitation is not attempted. Instead, the strict definition of antecedent precipitation periods permits a direct comparison of all catchments. The precipitation accumulating 0 to 3 days before an event is the most relevant for floods in Switzerland. PRE-AP precipitation has only a weak and region-specific influence on flood probability. Floods were significantly more frequent after wet PRE-AP periods only in the Jura Mountains, in the western and eastern Swiss plateau, and at the outlet of large lakes. As a general rule, wet PRE-AP periods enhance the flood probability in catchments with gentle topography, high infiltration rates, and large storage capacity (karstic cavities, deep soils, large reservoirs). In contrast, floods were significantly less frequent after wet PRE-AP periods in glacial catchments because of reduced melt. For the majority of catchments however, no significant correlation between precipitation amounts and flood occurrences is found when the last 3 days before floods are omitted in the precipitation amounts. Moreover, the PRE-AP was not higher for extreme floods than for annual floods with a high frequency and was very close to climatology for all floods. The fact that floods are not significantly more frequent nor more intense after wet PRE-AP is a clear indicator of a short discharge memory of Pre-Alpine, Alpine and South Alpine Swiss catchments. Our study poses the question whether the impact of long-term precursory precipitation for floods in such catchments is not overestimated in the general perception. The results suggest that the consideration of a 3 – 4 days precipitation period should be sufficient to represent (understand, reconstruct, model, project) Swiss Alpine floods...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of food as a social determinant of health has been elucidated, it remains underexplored in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where a significant population is faced with challenges of accessing food, largely from a combination many factors including low economic power, poor livelihoods, political instability and policy gaps. Despite tremendous improvement on food security in Ghana, {{the northern part of}} the country including the Upper West Region still experience disproportionally high levels of deprivation and food insecurity. Research has tends to explain the dynamics and complexities of food insecurity in the Region, yet variation of the incidence of food insecurity across different geo-political districts in the region and its association with human health is less examined. In response, this thesis examines the relationship between household food insecurity and health in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Results from quantitative survey (n= 1438) conducted in all the eleven districts of the Upper West Region from May to August, 2014 show that households that received remittance and located in both rural and urban areas as well as non-remittance receiving households in rural areas were more likely to report being severely food insecure compared to non-remittance receiving households in urban areas. Those who reported being food insecure were more likely to report poor mental health. Although migration and remittance have been used by households to address food insecurity, the findings here show that migration and remittance may not adequately impact on food insecurity in all contexts, giving prominence to the role of local context in influencing the <b>persistent</b> food insecurity <b>situation</b> in the Upper West Region of Ghana. The research demonstrates that use of Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFAIS) in most sever periods of food insecurity would produce much higher scores of food insecurity compared to scores produced from use of Food Consumption Scores (FCS). Also, the use of subjective health rating tool (the DUKE Health Profile) in this research indicates its wider applicability. The study makes suggestions for an integrated food security policy, decentralization of mental health care, and expansion of the economic potential of the Upper West Region. Future research directions are also discussed...|$|R
