The area outside the building was shot in Van Nuys, California in what Novak called a [...] "bad area": he later noted that they [...] "had to <b>pretend</b> <b>we</b> weren't scared, even though every car that is left next to our set overnight is stripped to the bone for parts." [...] Greg Daniels noted that during the filming of [...] "The Fire", {{the cast and crew}} kept being interrupted by the sound of helicopters.

However, {{in an interview with the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Scranton firefighter Art Franklin pointed out that the uniform is actually tan, instead of the black ones seen on the show.|$|E

6000|$|The {{whole world}} exaggerates.
