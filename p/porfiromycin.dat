40|$|SUMMARY-Two related {{antitumor}} antibiotics, mitomycin C and <b>porfiromycin,</b> were quanti-tated {{for their}} cytotoxic activities against leukemic and normal hematopoietic colony-forming units (CFU) by spleen colony assay. After administration of {{increasing amounts of}} either drug to AKR mice, the dose-survival curves revealed shoulders of varying degree followed by an exponential decrease in sur-vival. Although twice as much <b>porfiromycin</b> as mitomycin C was required to obtain a similar surviving fraction of the leukemic CFU, <b>porfiromycin</b> {{was estimated to be}} more effective. Time-survival curves were also obtained for leukemic CFU after a single dose of either agent. The number of leukemic cells decreased rapid ~ with time, and-most cells were killed withm 1 - 2 hours after drug ad...|$|E
40|$|Purified NADPH:cytochrome c (P- 450) reductase (FpT; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, EC 1. 6. 2. 4) can reductively {{activate}} mitomycin antibiotics {{through a}} one-electron reduction to species that alkylate DNA. To assess {{the involvement of}} FpT in the intracellular activation of the mitomycins, transfectants overexpressing a human FpT cDNA were established from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line deficient in dihydrofolate reductase (CHO-K 1 /dhfr-). The parental cell line was equisensitive to the cytotoxic action of mitomycin C under oxygenated and hypoxic conditions. In contrast, <b>porfiromycin</b> was considerably less cytotoxic to wild-type parental cells than was mitomycin C in air and markedly more cytotoxic under hypoxia. Two FpT-transfected clones were selected that expressed 19 - and 27 -fold more FpT activity than the parental line. Levels of other oxidoreductases implicated in the activation of the mitomycins were unchanged. Significant increases in sensitivity to mitomycin C and <b>porfiromycin</b> in the two FpT-transfected clones were seen under both oxygenated and hypoxic conditions, with the increases in toxicity being greater under hypoxia than in air. These findings demonstrate that FpT can bioreductively activate the mitomycins in living cells and implicate FpT in the differential aerobic/hypoxic toxicity of the mitomycins...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to set up a method for {{quantification}} of plasma mitomycin C (MMC) concen-trations during intravesical chemotherapy delivered in the presence of local bladder hyperthermia (HT). In comparison with existing methods, this assay, character-ized by relative simplicity and efficiency, resulted in the facilitation of performance with nondedicated instru-mentation or nonspecialized staff. Purification from plasma matrix was carried out by solid-phase extraction under vacuum. The purified drug was then collected directly into the vials of the HPLC autosampler. Chro-matographic analysis was performed on a reversed-phase C 18 column with water:acetonitrile (85 : 15 by vol) as the mobile phase and the UV detector set at 365 nm. The use of <b>porfiromycin</b> as internal standard provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitomycin}} C-resistance gene, mcrA, of Streptomyces lavendulae produces MCRA, {{a protein}} that protects this microorganism {{from its own}} antibiotic, the antitumor drug mitomycin C. Expression of the bacterial mcrA gene in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells causes profound resistance to mitomycin C and to its structurally related analog <b>porfiromycin</b> under aerobic conditions but produces little change in drug sensitivity under hypoxia. The mitomycins are prodrugs that are enzymatically reduced and activated intracellularly, producing cytotoxic semiquinone anion radical and hydroquinone reduction intermediates. In vitro, MCRA protects DNA from cross-linking by the hydroquinone reduction intermediate of these mitomycins by oxidizing the hydroquinone back to the parent molecule; thus, MCRA acts as a hydroquinone oxidase. These findings suggest potential therapeutic applications for MCRA {{in the treatment of}} cancer with the mitomycins and imply that intrinsic or selected mitomycin C resistance in mammalian cells may not be due solely to decreased bioactivation, as has been hypothesized previously, but instead could involve an MCRA-like mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Streptonigrin (SN, CAS no. 3930 - 19 - 6) is an aminoquinone {{antitumor}} antibiotic {{isolated from}} cultures of Streptomyces flocculus. This compound {{is a member}} of a group of antitumor agents which possess the aminoquinone moiety and that includes also mitomycin C, <b>porfiromycin,</b> actinomycin, rifamycin and geldanamycin. Because of the potential use of SN in clinical chemotherapy, the study of its genotoxicity has considerable practical significance. SN inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA, causes DNA strand breaks after reduction with NADH, induces unscheduled DNA synthesis and DNA adducts and inhibits topoisomerase II. At the chromosome level, this antibiotic causes chromosome damage and increases the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges. SN cleaves DNA in cell-free systems by a mechanism that involves complexing with metal ions and autoxidation of the quinone moiety to semiquinone in the presence of NADH with production of oxygen-derived reactive species. Recent evidence strongly suggests that the clastogenic action of this compound is partially mediated by free radicals. The present review aim...|$|E
40|$|Two non-transformed {{human skin}} {{fibroblast}} strains, GM 38 and 3437 T, {{were found to}} be more sensitive to the bioreductive alkylating agents mitomycin C (MMC) and <b>porfiromycin</b> (PM) under hypoxic compared to aerobic conditions. One of these strains, 3437 T, was 6 - 7 times more resistant to these agents under aerobic exposure conditions, but was identical in sensitivity to the normal strain, GM 38, under hypoxic conditions. Aerobic 3437 T cells demonstrated no increased resistance to cisplatin compared to the normal strain, arguing against enhanced ability to repair DNA interstrand cross-links as the underlying explanation for the mitomycin resistance. The aerobic resistance of 3437 T was not altered by dicumarol, an inhibitor of the enzyme DT-diaphorase which is believed to be involved in aerobic activation of MMC and PM. Dicumarol did increase the resistance of GM 38, but not to the same level of resistance demonstrated by 3437 T. These results suggest that the aerobic MMC and PM resistance of 3437 T may arise, in part, from a deficiency in DT-diaphorase activity. The identical sensitivities under hypoxic conditions indicate that drug activation pathways operative in the absence of oxygen are similar in both the normal and 3437 T cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies in mice were {{performed}} to determine the interaction of two sulfur nucleophiles, oral n-acetylcysteine (NAC) and intravenous sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) with the anticancer drug mitomycin C (MMC). Neither nucleophile reduced MMC lethality or hematopoietic toxicity. Both increased the antitumor activity of MMC in mice bearing P- 388 and L- 1210 leukemias. There was no nucleophile reduction of MMC effects on normal bone marrow stem cells (CFUs) using a murine spleen colony forming assay. In contrast, the nucleophiles significantly enhanced MMC bone marrow toxicity. Three clonogenic human tumor cell lines (HEC- 1 A endometrial, 8226 myeloma, WiDr colon) were relatively resistant to MMC and the nucleophiles did not increase activity. A human breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7) was sensitive to MMC and this activity was blocked by glutathione. Oxygen free radical scavengers did not reduce MMC activity. A novel isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay (48 : 52, methanol: 0. 01 M phosphate buffer) using ultraviolet detection at 365 nm was used to characterize MMC-protein binding and murine pharmacokinetics. The k' for MMC was 7. 91 and 9. 86 for <b>porfiromycin.</b> Peaks were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. MMC was bound 30 % to albumin and S- 9 microsomal proteins and 60 - 70 % to calf thymus DNA. MMC uptake into mouse bone marrow was enhanced by the nucleophiles and was rapidly cleared from the plasma (half-life 0. 5 hours). In vitro MMC metabolism with rat liver S- 9 microsomes demonstrated production of a polar eluting, putative MMC metabolite (K' = 4. 486, lambda maximum 300 nm). This metabolite was inactive in the in vitro clonogenic tumor cell assay. Finally, molecular pharmacology studies using alkaline DNA elution showed that MMC causes both DNA-DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks. There was no evidence for free radical-induced DNA strand scission by MMC. There was also some evidence of moderate DNA protection with the sulfur nucleophiles...|$|E
