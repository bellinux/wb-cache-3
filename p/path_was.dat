5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight <b>path</b> <b>was</b> incorrect.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} flight <b>path</b> <b>was</b> a {{great circle}} route, {{which would have}} taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} approach to full transparency {{is to use}} a Clipping path. A clipping <b>path</b> <b>is</b> simply a shape or outline, that is used in conjunction with the other graphics. Everything inside the <b>path</b> <b>is</b> visible, and everything outside the <b>path</b> <b>is</b> invisible. The <b>path</b> <b>is</b> inherently vector, but can potentially be used to mask both vector and bitmap data. The main usage of clipping <b>paths</b> <b>is</b> in PostScript files.|$|R
50|$|Predication is most {{effective}} when <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> balanced or when the longest <b>path</b> <b>is</b> the most frequently executed, but determining such a <b>path</b> <b>is</b> very difficult at compile time, even {{in the presence of}} profiling information.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} variant, {{attributed}} to Jin Y. Yen, the <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> {{required to be}} loopless. (This restriction introduced another level of complexity.)Yen's algorithm is used where only simple <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> considered, whereas Eppstein's algorithm is used when non-simple <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> allowed (e.g., <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> allowed to revisit the same node multiple times) or where loops are not possible (in directed acyclic graphs).|$|R
5|$|US40Alternate {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40. The highway's <b>path</b> <b>was</b> blazed in the mid-18th century to connect the Hagerstown Valley and Shenandoah Valley with eastern Pennsylvania and central Maryland. In the early 19th century, US40Alternate's <b>path</b> <b>was</b> improved {{as part of a}} series of turnpikes to connect Baltimore with the eastern terminus of the National Road in Cumberland. The highway was improved as one of the original state roads in the early 1910s and designated US40 in the late 1920s. Construction on a relocated US40 between Hagerstown and Frederick with improved crossings of South Mountain and Braddock Mountain began in the mid-1930s; the new highway was completed in the late 1940s. US40 Alternate was assigned to the old route of US40 in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its <b>path</b> <b>was</b> widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this <b>path</b> <b>was</b> never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
50|$|<b>Paths</b> <b>are</b> often {{important}} in {{their role as}} subgraphs of other graphs, in which case they <b>are</b> called <b>paths</b> in that graph. A <b>path</b> <b>is</b> a particularly simple example of a tree, {{and in fact the}} <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> exactly the trees in which no vertex has degree 3 or more. A disjoint union of <b>paths</b> <b>is</b> called a linear forest.|$|R

5000|$|Two <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> vertex-independent (alternatively, {{internally}} vertex-disjoint) {{if they do}} {{not have}} any internal vertex in common. Similarly, two <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> edge-independent (or edge-disjoint) {{if they do not}} have any internal edge in common. Two internally vertex-disjoint <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> edge-disjoint, but the converse is not necessarily true.|$|R
5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the most damaging of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage <b>path</b> <b>was</b> only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} of the <b>path</b> <b>was</b> {{designated}} as a National Trail in 1978. Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status, either as a National Park {{or one of the}} Heritage Coasts. The path passes through two World Heritage Sites: the Dorset and East Devon Coast, known as the Jurassic Coast, was designated in 2001, and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{promontory}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust in December 1953. The Southwest Coast <b>Path</b> <b>was</b> created in 1978, and runs {{along the top of}} Zennor Head as part of its , following the edge of the cliffs closely. Zennor in Darkness, the 1994 McKitterick Prize-winning novel by Helen Dunmore, was partly set around Zennor Head. In 2009 the headland suffered flooding which affected the cliff-top footpath.|$|E

5|$|When Laura's <b>path</b> <b>was</b> uncertain, forecasters advised {{fishermen}} {{to remain}} at port along the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida. Gale warnings were also issued for the Florida Keys, due to the uncertainty. No significant damage or casualties were reported in Central America, although heavy rainfall was reported across the region. On Glover's Reef {{off the coast of}} British Honduras (now Belize), the storm stranded a group of about 20scientists affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution; the group was affected by the strong winds and rains, and required rescue. The storm damaged several buildings along the mainland.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>path</b> <b>was</b> {{finalized}} {{came the}} augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|An early road {{following}} the current <b>path</b> <b>was</b> {{established in the}} late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E

5|$|Bueno's {{schedule}} at {{the time}} included twenty-five to thirty shows weekly. Due to his demanding tours, Bueno began consuming beer to excess, which began to interfere with his performing. His stress level was further increased from receiving multiple death threats. Following a concert at the nightclub Escándalo in La Plata, Bueno was returning {{to the city of}} Buenos Aires on the evening of June 24, 2000. After his <b>path</b> <b>was</b> blocked by another driver who had passed him on the turnpike, Bueno tried to chase the vehicle to move in front of it again. In the process, he lost control of his SUV and crashed against a barrier. He was ejected from the SUV and he died instantly. His death caused an immediate sensation in the Argentine media, with speculation about a possible murder conspiracy. After a short trial, the driver of the other vehicle was found not guilty; the judge considered Bueno to have been responsible for driving imprudently.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, MD150 {{had been}} {{extended}} west {{into the city}} of Baltimore over Eastern Avenue {{at least as far}} as Highlandtown. Around 1950, the state highway followed Highland Avenue south from US40 to Eastern Avenue. MD150 was moved to Kresson Street, Lombard Street, and Ponca Street, which met Eastern Avenue just west of its present junction, in 1960. Around 1963, Haven Street and Kresson Street were converted to a one-way pair, with Haven Street carrying eastbound traffic south and Kresson Street handling westbound traffic toward US40. The portion of Lombard Street between Haven and Kresson was added to MD150; the state highway was also extended north on Haven and Kresson to Monument Street, then east along Monument Street to MD150's new western terminus at US40 at the U.S. Highway's underpass of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. This convoluted <b>path</b> <b>was</b> ameliorated around 2002 when the highway was shortened to its present course in East Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from {{personal}} experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's <b>path</b> <b>was</b> formed {{by a variety}} of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight <b>path</b> <b>was</b> significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|The Great Island <b>Path</b> <b>was</b> a major {{trail that}} ran {{north along the}} Susquehanna River from the Saponi village of Shamokin at modern Sunbury, fording the river there and {{following}} {{the west bank of}} the West Branch Susquehanna River north until White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the Nippenose valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the river to the Great Island (near the present day city of Lock Haven). The stretch from the mouth of the creek to the Nippenose valley is approximately followed by Route 44. From the Great Island, the Great Shamokin Path continued further west to the modern boroughs of Clearfield and Kittanning, the last on the Allegheny River.|$|E
5|$|The first planned {{route of}} the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and {{continuing}} along the Don Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of the Don Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the <b>path</b> <b>was</b> rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.|$|E
