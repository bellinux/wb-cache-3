40|$|<b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PNS) is an {{uncommon}} manifestation of cancer {{that is not}} caused by the tumor or metastasis. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an initial symptom of this disease, but it has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. Here, we report the case of a 76 -year-old woman who presented with classic TN, followed by limbic encephalitis due to an underlying ovarian intestinal-type mucinous borderline tumor, with the presence of anti-Hu antibodies. She recovered quickly after removal of the tumor and was essentially free of symptoms 2 weeks after surgery. Because PNS precedes the tumor in approximately 60 % of cases, its rapid detection and treatment are crucial. Therefore, we propose that PNS be considered during the management of TN when brain imaging is normal, as it is followed by other central and/or peripheral neurological manifestations as well as the presence of systemic symptoms such as anemia, fatigability, loss of appetite, or weight loss...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{dating back}} to the 1940 ’s have led to the {{hypothesis}} that the brain is an immunologically privileged site, shielding its antigens from immune recognition. The paraneoplastic Hu syndrome provides a powerful paradigm for addressing this hypothesis; it is believed to develop because small cell lung cancers (SCLC) express the neuron-specific Hu protein. This leads to an Hu-specific tumor immune response that can develop into an autoimmune attack against neurons, presumably when immune privilege in the brain is breached. Interestingly, all SCLC express the onconeural HuD antigen, and clinically useful tumor immune responses can be detected in up to 20 % of patients, yet the <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is extremely rare. We found that HuD-specific CD 8 + T cells are normally present in the mouse T cell repertoire, but are not expanded upon immunization, although they can be detected after in vitro expansion. In contrast, HuD-specific T cells could be directly activated in HuD null mice, without the need for in vitro expansion. Taken together, these results demonstrate robust tolerance to the neuronal HuD antigen in vivo, and suggest a re-evaluation of the current concept o...|$|E
30|$|In 1865, Trousseau {{described}} migratory thrombosis as {{the first}} manifestation of occult gastric cancer (Rickles and Edwards 1983). Since then, the association between cancer and excessive blood coagulation has remained well-recognized. The description of Trousseau syndrome was refined and reported as being frequently associated with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation, plate-rich microthrombi, macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia, verrucous endocarditis, and thromboembolic problems related to these processes (Sack et al. 1977). Uchiyama et al. described that Trousseau syndrome is a <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndrome</b> caused by remote effects of occult cancers, which causes neurological symptoms due to hypercoagulability associated with cancers (Uchiyama and Shimizu 2003). Today, the concept of Trousseau syndrome is commonly used not only to describe migratory thrombosis that precedes the diagnosis of occult cancer, but also any hypercoagulability associated with malignant cancer (Varki 2007). Thus, when acute ischemic strokes occur in patients with cancer, Trousseau syndrome {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis. In the current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines, intravenous t-PA administration in acute ischemic stroke associated with Trousseau syndrome is not mentioned (Jauch et al. 2013). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of multiple extra-ischemic hemorrhages following intravenous t-PA in a patient with Trousseau syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndromes</b> (PNS) pose {{quite an}} {{uncommon}} neurological complication, affecting less than 1 % {{of patients with}} breast cancer. Nearly one third of these patients lack detectable onconeural antibodies (ONAs), and improvement in neurologic deficits with concomitant cancer treatments is achieved in less than 30 % of cases. Case Presentation: A 42 -year-old, premenopausal woman presented with facial paralysis on the central left side accompanied by a left tongue deviation, an upward vertical nystagmus, moderate spastic paraparesis, dystonic posturing of the left foot, lower limb hyperreflexia and bilateral extensor plantar reflex. After ruling out all other potential neurologic causes, PNS was suspected but no ONAs were found. A PET-CT scan detected increased metabolism in the right breast, {{as well as an}} ipsilateral thoracic interpectoral adenopathy. Core biopsy confirmed the presence of an infiltrating duct carcinoma.

40|$|Paraneoplastic {{neurologic}} disorders (PNDs) offer an uncommon {{opportunity to study}} human tumor immunity and autoimmunity. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), expression of the HuD neuronal antigen is thought to lead to immune recognition, suppression of tumor growth, and, in a subset of patients, triggering of the Hu <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Antigen-specific CTLs believed to contribute to disease pathophysiology were described 10 years ago in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Despite parallel efforts, similar cells have not been defined in Hu patients. Here, we have identified HuD-specific T cells in Hu patients and provided an explanation for why their detection has been elusive. Different Hu patients harbored 1 of 2 kinds of HuD-specific CD 8 + T cells: classical IFN-γ–producing CTLs or unusual T cells that produced type 2 cytokines, most prominently IL- 13 and IL- 5, and lacked cytolytic activity. Further, we found evidence that SCLC tumor cells produced type 2 cytokines and that these cytokines trigger naive CD 8 + T cells to adopt the atypical type 2 phenotype. These observations demonstrate {{the presence of an}} unusual noncytotoxic CD 8 + T cell in patients with the Hu paraneoplastic syndrome and suggest that SCLC may evade tumor immune surveillance by skewing tumor antigen–specific T cells to this unusual noncytolytic phenotype...|$|E
30|$|In {{patients}} with anti-Yo antibody-positive PCD, gynecological malignancies {{are known to}} be frequently associated [5, 6]. The majority of these cases involve ovarian cancer, and, on rare occasions, tubal carcinoma is known to be associated with PCD [2 – 4]. Two approaches can be used to treat <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndrome</b> [11]. The first treatment is directed toward the underlying tumor, while the second approach focuses on the autoimmune disease causing the cerebellar dysfunction. For the neurologist, paraneoplastic syndrome is a therapeutic challenge, and medical treatment for paraneoplastic syndrome is generally unsatisfactory [7]. Therefore, early tumor detection and treatment by a gynecologist should be the primary objective in these patients. According to a review [11] of long-term clinical outcomes in cases of anti-Yo antibody-associated PCD, cancer progression was the cause of death in almost half of the patients, including a patient with advanced cancer. Most of these cancer-related deaths were due to the delay in diagnosis of the primary malignancy, and {{patients with}} early stage cancer showed a relatively favorable cancer-related prognosis. Manifestation of cerebellar dysfunction usually precedes the onset of symptoms of the primary malignancy by many months [11]. Therefore, early screening of anti-Yo antibody in patients with cerebellar degeneration is an important step before one initiates an extensive search for the primary tumor to achieve improvement of cancer-related prognosis in PCD patients. Further, it is known that the presence of anti-Yo antibody is important to predict the cancer-related prognosis of patients, since tumor progression in PCD patients with anti-Yo antibody is slower than usual [6], probably due to the suppression of tumor growth through antibody-mediated immune mechanisms by massive infiltrating inflammatory cells, as shown in the present case. Thus, the preoperative evaluation of cancer metastasis and invasion to local structures that drastically decreases the possibility of tumor control [11] should be carefully pursued before the treatment strategy for the individual case is developed.|$|E

Neurological syndromes {{can be seen}} in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mostly present as either leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combined sensory-motor neuropathy, myopathy, and dermatitis in a patient with CLL. Case presentation: A 61 -year-old African American man presented with acute dysphagia, rapidly progressive proximal limb-girdle weakness, and dermatitis. He had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14, 600 /mm 3, hemoglobin of 11. 4 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 165, 000 /mm 3. Lymphocytes comprised 15 % of the total WBC with an absolute lymphocyte count of 2100 /mm 3. Metabolic profile was unremarkable except for a serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 1056 mg/dL. Serum protein electrophoresis, serologic studies for autoimmune, genetic diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes were all negative. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed sensorimotor neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating features. Muscle biopsy revealed discrete areas of interstitial fibrosis juxtaposed to areas of intact muscle without any inflammation. At that point, a bone marrow biopsy was done because of anemia and slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume of 103. Bone marrow biopsy revealed minimal involvement with CD 5 /CD 19 -positive CLL. Flow cytometry demonstrated monoclonal CD 5 /CD 19 /CD 20 /CD 23 -positive cells, with dim kappa expression, and negative FMC- 7 and CD 3. This case doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria for CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, considering the possibility of paraneoplastic phenomenon for his symptoms, it was decided to start the patient on CLL-directed therapy with Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide. After only two cycles, the patient experienced a dramatic improvement in his muscle strength with disappearance of the rash. Conclusion: This case highlights a unique clinical picture of inflammatory dermatitis with electromyography and biopsy findings suggestive of myopathy and combined sensorimotor neuropathy with response to CLL-directed therapy. Also the symptoms started before peripheral lymphocytosis which masked the diagnosis for over a year.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: We {{reported}} that 43 % {{of patients with}} Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) had an antibody called anti-glial nuclear antibody (AGNA), defined by the immunoreaction with the nuclei of the Bergmann glia of the cerebellum. This study was undertaken to identify the antigen recognized by AGNA and to confirm the association with paraneoplastic LEMS in a larger series. METHODS: We probed a fetal brain cDNA library with AGNA-positive sera. The presence of antibodies against the isolated antigen was detected by immunoblot of phage plaques from two positive clones. We studied 105 patients with LEMS (55 with SCLC), 50 with <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>neurologic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> SCLC, and Hu antibodies, and 50 with only SCLC. RESULTS: Probing of the fetal brain expression library with AGNA sera resulted in the isolation of SOX 1, a highly immunogenic tumor antigen in SCLC. IgG eluted from SOX 1 clones produced the same cerebellar immunoreactivity as of AGNA sera. SOX 1 antibodies were present in 64 % of patients with LEMS and SCLC but in none of the 50 with idiopathic LEMS (p < 0. 0001). Compared with paraneoplastic LEMS, the frequency of SOX 1 antibodies was significantly lower in patients with Hu antibodies (32 %, p = 0. 002) and in those with only SCLC (22 %). CONCLUSIONS: SOX 1 is the antigen recognized by anti-glial nuclear antibody-positive sera. The detection of SOX 1 antibodies in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) predicts the presence of small cell lung cancer and {{may be used to}} follow more closely those LEMS patients with no evidence of cancer at the initial workup.
