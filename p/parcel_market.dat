40|$|The {{development}} of the Austrian Courier, Express and <b>Parcel</b> (CEP) <b>market,</b> {{as well as the}} Austrian <b>parceled</b> goods <b>market</b> has been affected by the various economical, technical and legal developments during the last 25 years. Globalization and consolidation process within the European CEP and <b>parceled</b> goods <b>market</b> have affected the Austrian market. In the past, the major part of the European CEP and <b>parceled</b> goods <b>market</b> was covered by small and medium sized companies. Nowadays, both markets are dominated by major enterprises. For example, in the last 5 to 10 years, five global players (La Poste/DPD, The Post Office/GLS, Deutsche Post/ DHL, TNT Post Group, UPS) have emerged on the European CEP market. These five own an overall market share of approximately 54 percent. Transportation cooperatives and alliances will become more important in the future, especially for small and medium - sized companies. The Austrian CEP market, which has developed since the late eighties, presents itself as a dynamic market. In the nineties, double digit rates of economic growth characterized this market. In the last few years the growth has slowed down. During 2004 the growth rate amounted to a total of 3. 2 percent in contrast to the previous year. Although there aren't any accurate numbers for the Austrian <b>parceled</b> goods <b>market,</b> the amount of parceled seems to be growing. In summary, there exists on both markets a highly destructive competition combined with a massive price decline. Value - added - service and the further {{development of}} the various information technology methods (e. g. RFID) will be crucial for companies of the CEP and the <b>parceled</b> goods <b>market's</b> future success.

We describe the market and contrast the incumbents' and the entrant's business strategies. Moreover, we develop a model to analyze the effect of the entrant's market entry on competitive strategies, market shares, prices, costs and profits. First, we solve the game-theoretic model analytically to derive qualitative results.

40|$|The Courier Express Parcel {{industry}} is booming business. Final delivery {{in the business}} to customer (B 2 C) <b>parcel</b> <b>market</b> {{has been one of}} the main focusses for innovation. The last mile in the B 2 C market is inefficient and expensive, due to delivery failures, congestion, urban constraints, non-optimum loading rates and regulations. The best solution in solving the last mile problem within B 2 C logistics is decoupling the presence of the final costumer and the delivery; electronic parcel lockers achieve exactly that. MYPUP is one of the companies operating in the electronic parcel locker market and their method of operation is unique. MYPUP allows for delivery from all courier services by integrating the last mile of the delivery. The integration of the final delivery resulted in a new logistics process to consolidate, register and redistribute parcels and is the subject of this research. Analysis of the current logistics process exposed that the process involved a fair amount of manual labor, was error prone and reaching its capacity. The aim of this research was to redesign the warehousing process of MYPUP, focusing on the outbound logistics, to be more efficient, less error prone and to increase capacity, within the constraints of the limited available funds. Solutions were found based on brainstorm sessions with MYPUP executives, MYPUP employees and by consulting experts. A model was developed to show the potential of the proposed solutions and to support the decision-making process of which solutions to implement. The model results showed that introducing optical character recognition (OCR) in the registration process leads to the biggest improvement. A MYPUP specific algorithm was developed to deliver a proof of concept for implementation of OCR in the registration process. This algorithm provided a financially attractive alternative to the expensive, already existing OCR solutions in the market. The other identified solutions that were modeled all showed that significant improvements can be achieved. The registration process time can be reduced to a third of the current registration process time and a substantial portion of the errors can be eliminated, if all solutions are implemented. Furthermore, the reduction in registration time almost triples the hourly capacity. It is recommended MYPUP implements all proposed solutions. The software solutions are recommended to be implemented first, in case financial constraints do not allow for immediate implementation of the 3 D camera solution. Although using a 3 D camera to determine the size of parcels, eliminates errors and saves time, it requires investment in expensive hardware. It is also recommended to introduce the use of barcodes in combination with a drivers’ app to eliminate errors in the registration, sorting and delivery process. The first step is to implement the drivers’ app with the scan and OK functionalities. The route optimization algorithm requires further research and is recommended to be added later. Finally, further research into the consolidation phase is recommended. Consolidating all parcels in time is crucial if the parcels are to be delivered the same day. Quantifying these benefits strengthens the negotiating position of MYPUP in concluding agreements with parcel delivery service companies. Solutions proposed in this research, although specifically designed for MYPUP, can be adjusted and used to improve logistics processes in small-scale city logistics facilities as well.

40|$|The {{recent history}} of postal administrations (POs) and postal {{regulation}} has clearly underlined the continuing tension between the financial burden associated with the Universal Service Obligation (USO) {{and the desire to}} promote efficiency and innovation through increased competition. Nowhere is this tension more evident than in the area of access, not only for letters but also for parcels. Opportunities for rent seeking abound in both areas, and there is a pressing need for cogent analysis to inform regulatory policy under conditions that are likely to be present in letter and <b>parcel</b> <b>markets</b> going forward. Experience in other sectors has been hardly reassuring and has been indicative of severe rent seeking. In particular, while opening up access has the potential to promote efficiency, misguided attempts to subsidize access should be avoided. Indeed, {{this is especially true in}} postal service as access in postal facilities can hardly be regarded as an “essential facility”. While entry is the normal means of promoting competition, the presence of the USO means that in the letter market, entry will occur in low-cost areas and cream skimming will be the likely result POs present an attractive prospect for rent seekers in the name of competition and efficiency.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the cost structure of different scenarios for urban B 2 C distribution in Antwerp. We generated demand {{on the basis of}} a real-world dataset and computed delivery routes with realistic cost values. By the comparison of different scenarios, we found that external costs, related to the transportation with delivery vans, account for 18 %– 28 % of the operational costs. Also, we showed that the <b>parcel</b> delivery <b>market</b> is unbalanced in the sense that small LSPs have higher operational costs per delivery than a large LSP. Those operational costs can be reduced by stimulating self-pick-up, at the expense of rising external costs. Reversely, a bike delivery system can significantly reduce external costs but slightly increases the costs of LSPs. Consequently, neither self-pick-up nor bike deliveries alone seem to be beneficial for all stakeholders. However, a combination of both concepts, fueled by the implementation of additional DPs, represents a B 2 C delivery system that improves the quality of life in Antwerp and is also appealing to LSPs. The efficiency of such a delivery system could be further enhanced if, for instance, multiple LSPs collaborate and execute and plan the last-mile delivery jointly to make use of the economy-of-scales effect that we observed.|$|R

Primarily the technical literature focuses on the different ways of creating segments. Up till now, the way in which companies operate a {{market segmentation}} process in reality, has only been surveyed sporadically. For this reason, a qualitative field study was conducted from November 2006 to January 2007, comprising companies from the consumer as well as the industrial goods industries, from B 2 C services, from B 2 B markets and the retail industry. This paper highlights the general procedures, as well as the challenges arising in the context of developing and implementing market segmentation concepts. On the one hand, it becomes apparent that segmentation activities may differ considerably, depending on issues like sector, industry and company size. On the other hand, the field study also identifies some remarkable trans-sectoral similarities concerning segmentation issues. market segmentation; STP; segment target position; segmenting; targeting; positioning; segmentation criteria; business practices; Germany; customer groups; marketing; qualitative studies; field studies; consumer goods; industrial goods; B 2 C services; B 2 B markets; retail trade; retailing; retailers; business-to-business; business-to-consumer; company size; trans-sectoral similarities; industry sectors; entrepreneurs; entrepreneurialism; management. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{inquires}} into {{dynamics and}} controversies of constructing {{a market for}} wind power in China. Inquiring into what the thesis dubs a quality crisis in Chinese wind power after years of high growth rates, and into a potential turn to quality, the thesis traces such current ambiguous winds of change with point of departure {{in the notion of}} global innovation networks (GINs). Thus, it looks into how international collaborations on critical components, such as software programmes, {{play a critical role in}} the qualification of wind power as a ‘sustainable’ renewable energy source. However, with a structural rather than micro-relational or processual lens, the existing GIN literature is claimed to be ill-equipped to grasp the genesis, dynamics, and agency of GINs. To fill this gap, the thesis develops a situational, constructivist framework based in Science and Technology Studies, which renders a processual and relational understanding of GINs as part and <b>parcel</b> of <b>market</b> construction. It does this by initially ‘looking away’ from the original metaphor of GINs, with the result of effectively reconceptualising it. This is done by illustrating the dynamics and the agency of GIN genesis through a mapping of controversies over issues of Intellectual Property Rights, standardisation, money, and cost and price calculations, entangled in a Chinese ‘system problem’ of stateowned actors and a Chinese experimental pragmatism of market construction, which has had unintended effects. Tracing one potential GIN taking shape around a critical component, the thesis also contributes to the GIN literature through a new methodological approach. Illustrating the potentially disruptive dynamics of GIN construction, and how the emerging GIN around software programmes possesses disruptive agency in regard to the framing of the emerging Chinese wind power market, the thesis sheds light on some of the socio-material work needed to construct and maintain GINs and the markets it co-constitutes and is co-constituted by, as well as the negotiated roles, identities, and positions of actors in a developmental context of China. The thesis coins the seemingly particular Chinese mode of market construction within wind power a fragmented and experimental ‘pragmatics of (green) market construction’, with its agile responses to emerging issues. Last, to overcome the dualism between structural and processual accounts, the thesis draws on the pragmatist notion of figuration (Elias, 1978). After demonstrating a potential figurational change reflected in the ongoing turn to quality, the thesis also considers the implications that the inquiry has for other related literatures, hereunder proposing a new research agenda for New Economic Sociology to understand market and GIN construction in a developmental context, which holds a promise for inquiring into China’s self- and other-disruptive, yet potentially path-creating modes of development and upgrading...|$|R
