In this paper, we use a two-phase approach to calibrate simulation parameters using classification tools. This classification-based method is used in Phase I to facilitate the global search process and it is followed by local optimization in Phase II. By learning knowledge from existing data the approach identifies potentially high-quality parameter settings. We present an example of its use on a Wisconsin breast cancer simulation. 1.

5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, but in the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> severe drought {{has become much more}} frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} {{is common}} and widely {{distributed in the}} temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Off southern Africa, {{it has been reported}} from Cape Town in South Africa to the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Along the southern Australian coast, it is found from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Maroochydore in Queensland, including Tasmania. In New Zealand waters, it occurs off North Island and the Chatham Islands, and rarely off South Island and the Kermadec Islands. Records from northern Australia and Thailand likely represent misidentifications of Himantura fai and D. matsubarai respectively. Over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> its range and numbers off southeastern Tasmania have grown, possibly as a result of climate change.|$|E

40|$|Parameter {{identification}} of permanent magnet synchronous machines {{is a topic}} of utmost interest these days. The growing effort and investment in this field of research {{is largely due to}} the ever-expanding market share of these machines. The high-performance and efficient control of the drive depends on the accuracy with which the information about the machine connected to its terminals is available. The available identification methods are surveyed here and they are classified into offline and online strategies. Self-commissioning, in principle, is a subset of offline methods, yet it is treated separately for its importance in modern adjustable speed drives that tend to minimize the user intervention. Fully exploiting the power electronic converter and the computational power on-board a modern drive, the self-commissioning feature can be embedded in the start-up routine of the drive to estimate the parameters of the machine at hand. This paper presents a review of the parameter identification techniques and schemes investigated over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R
25|$|Over the <b>past</b> a <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> the {{taxonomy}} of Oncomelania hupensis {{has been a}} dispute due to the variation in morphological characters such as shell sculpture, operculum etc. Phenotypically, Oncomelania hupensis can be separated into ribbed- and smooth- shelled morphotypes.

Smooth-shelled snails are also distributed in mainland China, but are considered as the same species and subspecies of Oncomelania hupensis.|$|R

One way to do this is by transforming all the supporting units, including the library. Such changes becomes a concern not only for the library itself but also for other stakeholders, such as corporations. Through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, corporations took their part in supporting library transformation. This can be seen in the initiative done by PT HM Sampoerna, a giant cigarette industry in Indonesia. PT. HM Sampoerna has established Sampoerna Corner (SC) in 7 university libraries in Indonesia, including in Diponegoro University. SC came up with learning commons, a relatively new concept in library services not only for Diponegoro University, but also for most libraries in Indonesia. The implementation of such new concept will surely raise some questions : how is learning commons implementation in the SC in Diponegoro University, how’s the progress and what are the barriers of its development?

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans is {{a social}} wasp and {{is part of the}} family Vespidae of the order Hymenoptera. It is found {{throughout}} the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas and parts of Canada. Due to solitary nest founding by queens, P. exclamans has extended its range in the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> and now covers the eastern half of the United States, as well as part of the north. This expansion is typically attributed to changing global climate and temperatures. P. exclamans has three specific castes, including males, workers, and queens, but the dominance hierarchy is further distinguished by age. The older the wasp is, the higher it is in ranking within the colony. In most P. exclamans nests, there is one queen who lays all the eggs in the colony. The physiological similarities between the worker and queen castes have led to experiments attempting to distinguish the characteristics of these two castes and how they are determined, though males have easily identifiable physiological characteristics. Since P. exclamans live in relatively small, open combed nests, they are often subject to predators and parasites, such as Chalcoela iphitalis, Elasmus polistis, and birds. P. exclamans have defense and recognition strategies that help protect against these predators and parasites.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{impressive}} hydrographic technique developed over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decade</b> is multibeam sonar systems. Sounding data from these systems is a result of processing information from several data sources. Among them, positional data from Global Positioning System (GPS), vessels heading and attitude data from gyrocompass and motion sensor systems, vertical reference data from tide gauge and sound speed data, in addition to the multibeam data itself. There must be a good coordination between these systems in order to obtain reliable data. To determine this, a proper and thorough field calibration procedure has to be carried out on the system as a whole. This process begins with measurement of static offsets between each sensor system with reference to a fixed point on the vessel. Preferably, the point of centre of gravity (COG). Then the patch test is carried out to determine the mounting offsets and GPS latency and lastly a performance test to verify whether the data meet the accuracy requirements for the survey. This is achieved through a comparison of data with a reference surface. This paper discusses the theoretical aspects, steps involved and results of the calibration procedures for multibeam sonars, using RESON SeaBat 8124 multibeam system. Finally, a summary of multibeam sonar calibration criteria is also presented showing the methodology involve which include when to perform each test and applying corrections...|$|R
