5|$|The {{first human}} {{settlement}} in, and near Zaprešić {{dates from the}} Neolithic, and several Roman roads were constructed in the area. The first records of the modern town date from 1334. Since that date, the town's history includes {{being a part of}} a feudal estate to operating the first meat <b>packaging</b> <b>plant</b> in Croatia. However, it was not formally established as a city until 1995. The city is governed by a mayor, a city government of seven members (upper house), and a city council of twenty one (lower house). Zaprešić has its own fire department, but police coverage is provided by the city of Zagreb. Komunalno poduzeće Zaprešić manages all utilities except electricity. Tap water in Zaprešić is of high quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a novel <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> using available process technologies that would be competitive in the domestic waste water treatment market. A market analysis identified the business opportunity for Balmoral Tanks to develop a <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> with higher treatment capability than its current product. A customer survey and a review of Regulatory standards provided valuable input into the design considerations for the <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A review of available process technologies and materials of construction resulted in the selection of a Moving Bed Biolm Reactor (MBBR) process and High Density Polyethylene material as the optimum design basis for the <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A detailed design exercise scoped out and specified all the components of the MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A four month duration programme for testing the prototype at Cranfield University facilities was devised which satisfactorily simulated typical domestic wastewater treatment operating conditions. Test rig problems associated with very low ambient temperatures were experienced {{in the early stages of}} testing and were identified and resolved. The prototype <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> unit subsequently operated satisfactorily and the performance was demonstrated to meet all the wastewater constituent removal design specifications. The MBBR process performance was shown to be consistent with published findings of other researchers. Novel fabrication methods developed by Balmoral Tanks resulted in the cost of the new MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> being only 3 % higher than that of Balmoral Tanks current lower specification product. The new MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> is shown to be a potentially very marketable domestic wastewater treatment product...|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} on-site {{treatment}} {{and disposal of}} wastewaters from tourist resorts was evaluated and compared to conventional <b>package</b> <b>plants</b> {{on the basis of}} experimental results obtained from a laboratory scale simulation of the system and reported data. The system was found to produce an effluent comparable to <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> effluents with respect to BOD 5 and suspended solids but superior with respect to reliability and fecal coliforms. Disposal of the treated effluent to the soil through absorption trenches or to the sea through a short outfall are the most appropriate disposal methods, although reuse for irrigation after disinfection can also be practiced. The initial capital cost of the system is at most half the cost of the conventional <b>package</b> <b>plants</b> and the operation and maintenance expenditure negligible. The system is particularly suited to recreational facilities with seasonal operation.

Previous discussion papers have reviewed existing conditions and on-site treatment issues. This discussion paper {{takes a look at}} policies regarding new communities and developer-installed treatment plants. These treatment plants are more commonly known as <b>package</b> wastewater treatment <b>plants.</b> 1. 1 <b>Package</b> Wastewater Treatment <b>Plants</b> and Regulatory Requirements A <b>package</b> wastewater treatment <b>plant</b> is a pre-fabricated or pre-built wastewater treatment plant, which uses a process involving energy, and mechanical, biological, chemical, or physical treatment of the wastewater to reduce the following wastewater constituents: biological oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrogen, bacteria, and other wastewater constituents. <b>Package</b> treatment <b>plants</b> typically provide a secondary level of treatment and are smaller than conventional treatment <b>plants.</b> <b>Package</b> treatment <b>plants</b> are privately owned, and serve specific uses or new housing developments, rather than entire cities or regional districts. In 1996, the RDN Board requested the Ministries of Health and Environment cease approval of <b>package</b> treatment <b>plants</b> for strata and other private developments within the RDN, except where the application had first been referred to the RDN for review and approval. The RDN passed this resolution because it was concerned about the following: <b>Package</b> treatment <b>plants</b> may be approved on a site-by-site basis with no assessment of the cumulative impact of such approvals. <b>Package</b> treatment <b>plant</b> approval might conflict with the RDN’s strategy to provide community sewer service. ...|$|R
