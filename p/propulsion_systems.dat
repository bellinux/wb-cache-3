5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems,</b> but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems,</b> a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1967, the US Air Force funded a study into {{advanced}} rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> for {{use during}} Project Isinglass, with Rocketdyne asked to investigate aerospike engines and Pratt & Whitney (P) to research more efficient conventional de Laval nozzle-type engines. At {{the conclusion of}} the study, P put forward a proposal for a 250,000lbf engine called the XLR-129, which used a two-position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Much of the UK's space {{industry}} is centred on EADS Astrium, based in Stevenage and Portsmouth. The company builds the buses – the underlying structure onto which the payload and <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> are built – {{for most of}} the European Space Agency's spacecraft, as well as commercial satellites. The world leader in compact satellite systems, Surrey Satellites, is also part of Astrium. Reaction Engines Limited, the company planning to build Skylon, a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane using their SABRE rocket engine, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system is based Culham.|$|E

5|$|The German naval staff hoped {{all these}} changes could be {{accomplished}} by April 1943, with the carrier's first sea trials taking place in August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee Graf Zeppelins completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 2526 knots, fast enough for sea trials to commence and for conducting air training exercises. By the winter of 19431944 she {{was expected to be}} combat-ready.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
40|$|The {{merits of}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> {{development}} testing are discussed. The existing data base of technical reports and specialists is utilized in this investigation.

5|$|By January 1944 the Soviets {{were aware}} of {{successful}} British and American jet aircraft projects and that the Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People's Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As {{a result of this}} meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux (OKBs) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942.|$|E
5|$|Following their commissionings in 1878–1883, {{the four}} ships {{served with the}} fleet on {{numerous}} training exercises and cruises in the 1880s and 1890s. They also participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In the late 1890s, the four ships were extensively rebuilt; their secondary batteries were modernized and they received upgraded <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> They were removed from active duty between 1902 and 1910 and relegated to secondary duties. Sachsen and Bayern became target ships while Württemberg became a torpedo training ship. The three ships were broken up for scrap in 1919–1920. Baden {{was used as a}} boom defense hulk from 1910 to 1920, when she became a target ship. She survived until 1938, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston {{moved his}} yard to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 when the yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b> The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in the lock, resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E

5000|$|The Delta-P traces its {{heritage}} to the Apollo Lunar Module's Descent <b>Propulsion</b> <b>System.</b> The TR-201 {{engine is}} the Descent <b>Propulsion</b> <b>System</b> modified to be a fixed thrust engine.

5000|$|Its {{original}} GTO-VVVF <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> was {{supplied by}} Siemens. The {{ability to produce}} a [...] "fa-so-la-ti-do-re-mi-fa-so" [...] scale when the propulsion starts up quickly became a signature to the 2100 series when it was introduced, earning the nickname as the [...] "singing train" [...] (歌う電車). Subsequently, similar propulsion was also installed on 56 cars of the N1000 series. The uniqueness of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> made its way into various music and popular culture, such as Super Bell"Z. Due to the unavailability of substitute parts for the train's GTO-VVVF <b>propulsion</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> on every train was replaced with a new IGBT-VVVF <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> (supplied by Toyo Denki) {{that does not have}} a solfège scale.|$|R
5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{reactivated}} {{for a number}} of ceremonial duties in the late 1880s, including for the dedication of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in June 1887 and a tour of the Baltic by the recently crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1888. In the 1890s, all four ships returned to active service with the fleet, serving in the I Division until the middle of the decade, when the new s began entering service. The four Sachsens were then displaced to the II Division. In the late 1890s, all four of the ships were extensively reconstructed; their secondary armament was modernized and their <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> were rebuilt with new machinery, which increased their speed.|$|E
5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone to failure. The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod <b>propulsion</b> <b>systems</b> fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract. The Achilles’ heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E
