50|$|Standing's best-known book is The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class, {{published}} in 2011. In it, he blames globalisation for having plunged {{more and more}} people into the <b>precariat,</b> which he analyses as a new emerging social class. According to Standing, the <b>precariat</b> is not only suffering from job insecurity but also identity insecurity and lack of time control, not least due to workfare social policies.|$|E

They’re {{part of a growing}} army of 2 ̆ 7 <b>precariats</b> 2 ̆ 7 - workers on low wages, {{temporary}} or no contracts, little or no sick or holiday pay, and no penalty rates. The precarious nature of their employment means they can’t save, making it difficult to cope with life’s little surprises, like when the car or washing machine pack up. And God forbid you or your kids should get ill, even for a few days. A decent holiday is simply out of the question...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the burden}} of the severe and {{protracted}} Greek crisis, it seems that Greek youngsters face an increasingly precarious situation of suffering and transition. This affects them in multiple ways, concerning both the external socio-economic conditions and their internalised sense of self-biographical continuity. The present qualitative study aims to demonstrate and examine the core dimensions of the crisis-ridden selfstructure of young adults, using semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Taking into consideration the growing “boomerang phenomenon” of Greek young people returning to their parental home (after losing their job or finishing their studies), we investigate the disruption caused in their life trajectories and the need for re-orientation, as it is expressed within subjective living-with-parents experiences. The sample consists of 15 Greek young inhabitants, aged between 24 and 32 years old, who are either unemployed or <b>precariats,</b> and live with their parents. The experienced collapse of linear self-imaginaries and the subsequent frustration along with the reaction to the present reality, as well as the **recuperating strategies emerged from the participants’ narratives, are carefully examined according to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and through relational and self-oriented pathways. The present study concludes by highlighting the reflexive deficit depicted on our participants’ psychic investment in obsolete or even unrealistic mentalities, despite their pronounced repudiation...|$|R
40|$|Behind {{the facade}} of society Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Huffington Post and many more. It is behind the new media “social façade” of equality, partnership, {{communities}} and group knowledge, in the aura of creativity and experience where the media corporations administer the largest network factory of the world. Internet users are efficient and creative there, they learn and buy equipment of work by themselves: smartphones, computers, applications. They co-create the media themselves: they fix computer games, record digital music, write articles and emails… They share them with others, they all create the market value. There are already three billions {{of them in the}} network, “new, great world” and this number is constantly increasing. Never have so many worked so unknowingly and with such enthusiasm for so few. Usually for free. Nowadays, administering their activity is the greatest challenge for the media organizations. The new, dominating modern media corporations and the old, which are forced to rely on pirate activities and companies going “stowaways” in order to find effective business models. In the environment of “liquid reality” and “suspended law”, newspaper publishers and television broadcasters still deliver what is most precious in the media, that is the unique products: information, films, games, recommendations. In the Web 2. 0 the Internet users have fun, inform and teach. However, they also create market values but at the same time, consciously and unconsciously, they get rid of the fruits of their labor. In the Web 2. 0, Culture 2. 0 arises but it is also accompanied by Work 2. 0 of the prosumers and <b>precariats...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>precariat</b> is {{the poorest}} class {{with an average}} {{household}} income of £8,000, negligible savings, who usually rent. Their social contacts are few and of low status. Interest in either highbrow or emerging cultural capital is low. They often live in old industrial areas but away from large urban areas; Stoke-on-Trent is a typical location. Few have attended university. <b>Precariat</b> is as term used by the British economist Guy Standing who has analysed the <b>precariat</b> as a new emerging social class in work done for the think tank Policy Network and in his subsequent book Precariat: The New Dangerous Class and as a reflection {{on the existence of}} a significant group characterised by high amounts of insecurity on all of measures of capital.|$|E

5000|$|The British {{economist}} Guy Standing has analysed the <b>precariat</b> {{as a new}} emerging {{social class}} in work done for the think tank Policy Network. In 2014, he wrote another book titled [...] "A <b>Precariat</b> Charter" [...] where he argued that all citizens {{have a right to}} socially inherited wealth. The latest in the series is the titled Precariat: The New Dangerous Class where he proposed basic income as a solution for addressing the problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the results of}} the Great British Class Survey of 2013, a collaboration between the BBC and researchers from several UK universities, contended there is a new model of class structure consisting of seven classes, ranging from the Elite at the top to the <b>Precariat</b> at the bottom. The <b>Precariat</b> class was envisaged as “the most deprived British class of all with low levels of economic, cultural and social capital” and the opposite of “the Technical Middle Class” in Great Britain in that instead of having money but no interests, people of the new <b>Precariat</b> Class have all sorts of potential activities they like to engage in but cannot do any of them because they have no money, insecure lives, and are usually trapped in old industrial parts of the country.|$|E
50|$|Precarity is a {{precarious}} existence, lacking in predictability, job security, material or psychological welfare. The social class defined by this condition has been termed the <b>precariat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Standing {{describes}} the <b>precariat</b> as an agglomerate of several different social groups, notably immigrants, young educated people, {{and those who}} have fallen out of the old-style industrial working class.|$|E
50|$|In sociology, <b>precariat</b> {{refers to}} the social class formed by people with no job security, or no {{prospect}} of regular employment, distinct from the lumpenproletariat. The term is a neologism obtained by merging precarious with proletariat.|$|E
5000|$|Guy Standing {{is perhaps}} the most well known {{contemporary}} advocate of the idea. In his book The <b>Precariat</b> - the new dangerous class, he blames globalization for having plunged more and more people into the <b>precariat,</b> which he analyses as a new emerging social class. He concludes on the necessity for [...] "governments to provide basic security as a right" [...] through a basic income. Other advocates include Edward Skidelsky and Robert Skidelsky, who argued for basic income in their book called How Much is Enough?, Malcolm Torry who is Director of the UK Citizen's Income Trust, Louis Haagh, chair of the Basic Income Earth Network, and Annie Miller who co-founded Citizens Basic Income Network Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>precariat,</b> about 15 {{percent of}} British society, shows poor {{economic}} capital, {{and the lowest}} scores on every other criterion.

50|$|Standing {{has written}} widely {{in the areas}} of labour economics, labour market policy, unemployment, labour market flexibility, {{structural}} adjustment policies and social protection. His recent work has concerned the emerging <b>precariat</b> class and the need to move towards unconditional basic income and deliberative democracy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{sociology}} and economics, the <b>precariat</b> {{is a social}} class formed by people suffering from precarity, which is a condition of existence without predictability or security, affecting material or psychological welfare. Unlike the proletariat class of industrial workers in the 20th century who lacked their own means of production and hence sold their labour to live, members of the <b>precariat</b> are only partially involved in labour and must undertake extensive [...] "unremunerated activities that are essential {{if they are to}} retain access to jobs and to decent earnings". Specifically, it is the condition of lack of job security, including intermittent employment or underemployment and the resultant precarious existence. The emergence of this class has been ascribed to the entrenchment of neoliberal capitalism.|$|E
5000|$|Guy Standing {{has been}} very active in the debate since the 1980s. He is now {{especially}} well known for his theory about the so-called <b>precariat,</b> a new social class which he thinks is growing because of globalization, and that this development is yet another strong argument for why basic income should be implemented.|$|E

50|$|The {{prize for}} the best film 2013 was given to Three-Legged Horses from Felipe Bustos Sierra, Edinburgh, Scotland. His short shows an evening in the live of a {{professional}} cycle rickshaw driver, the friendly contacts with passersby, street musicians, colleagues, {{but also by the}} demanding fight against gravity, physical pain and nasty passengers. Referring to this contrast the film ends in a big brass party including the whole nightlife of Edinburgh. Three-Legged Horses shows the bright and dark site of professional bicycle driving, the fascination of free urban life, the solidarity among a modern <b>precariat</b> on the one hand, {{and on the other hand}} the vulnerability and toughness of this particular work life. The film won both Goldene Kurbel and audience award of the 8th ICFF.|$|E
50|$|PRECARIOT is {{a self-portrait}} {{of the artist}} as a {{continental}} drifter in perpetual precarity. The <b>Precariat</b> is a term that combines the word “proletariat” with “precarious” to describe an emerging “barbarian” class of migrant laborers and professionals living and working precariously, holding temporary underpaid jobs, lacking a political voice and increasingly frustrated by their living and working conditions. Attracted by its revolutionary aspects, Massa Lemu embraces the label and adopts it as his title. For Lemu the old patriot was proud of, and ready to die for fatherland, the “precariot” however is one whose only possession is the unstable and indeterminate terrain of precarity, staking claims and maneuvering in this uncertain landscape. In the age of heightened mobility, PRECARIOT focuses on processes of inspection and scrutiny, labeling and branding to highlight the realities of migration.|$|E
40|$|In this {{interview}} Guy Standing outlines the main {{links between the}} <b>precariat</b> and the universal basic income. He briefly comments on the relationships of his work to traditional Marxism, and expands his critique of the <b>precariat</b> towards information and communication technologies. He identifies common features of the global <b>precariat,</b> and links them to creation of a common global class identity. Moving on to transformative potentials of the universal basic income, he dismisses ancient labels and frameworks as unnecessary and potentially misleading, and calls for reinvention of the contemporary language of progress. Finally, he seeks critical emancipation of the <b>precariat</b> in urgent decommodification of all aspects of education and information...|$|E
40|$|This book {{presents}} the <b>Precariat</b> - an emerging class, comprising {{the rapidly growing}} number of people facing lives of insecurity, moving in and out of jobs that give little meaning to their lives. Guy Standing argues that this class is producing instabilities in society. Although {{it would be wrong to}} characterise members of the <b>Precariat</b> as victims, many are frustrated and angry. The <b>Precariat</b> is dangerous because it is internally divided, leading to the villainisation of migrants and other vulnerable groups. Lacking agency, its members may be susceptible to the siren calls of political extremism. To prevent a 'politics of inferno', Guy Standing argues for a 'politics of paradise', in which redistribution and income security are reconfigured in a new kind of Good Society, and in which the fears and aspirations of the <b>Precariat</b> are made central to a progressive strategy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{critically}} examines Guy Standing’s A <b>Precariat</b> Charter by posing three questions: 1) What is {{the significance}} of the North/South divide for the global spread of the <b>precariat?</b> 2) Is the <b>precariat</b> an agent of transformation, or simply a passive recipient? 3) How should we understand the fragmentation of the working class and its implications for progressive change? In addressing these questions, I argue that Standing’s analysis offers useful insights into the current era of insecurity. But it downplays important variations in forms of precarity, and also over‐emphasises fragmentation and weakness. The limits of this approach are illustrated through two empirical examples drawn from Johannesburg, South Africa, and Oakland, United States. Taken together, these examples point towards a broader and more fluid understanding of the “working class”. They also underscore possibilities for workingclass solidarity, both between stable workers and their more precarious counterparts, and between different groups that Standing identifies as the <b>precariat...</b>|$|E
40|$|The project’s {{objective}} is to operationalize and assess the theory of 'the precariat' by Guy Standing on a Danish context. As a by-product of the globalization and neoliberalism, the increasing flexibility in the labour market in Denmark {{has led to an}} aggravated fragmentation and polarization. We conclude that Standing’s assertion on the development towards a precarious and fragmentized society is visible in Denmark, though only partly due to the traditionally strong trade unions, the relatively high level of social security and the Danish flexicurity model. It is possible to identify the <b>precariat,</b> but the level of insecurity and the consequences of which it composes is highly divergent. Although highly divergent, the current political developments and the weakening of the traditional trade unions seem to form the bedrock for an escalation of the Danish <b>precariat.</b> The future of the <b>precariat</b> will depend on how the issue is conveyed and which solutions are set forth. We assess that strengthened trade unions and a steady collective mobilization can be the basis to accommodate the ever rising <b>precariat</b> citizens in Denmark. The need for such a mobilization is not yet significant, but the development seems to be in accordance with Standing’s predictions. The <b>precariat</b> can, on one hand, be presumed to be a side-effect of the general neoliberal pressure on all trades, but it can on the other hand, be considered as an articulation of a global trend that constitutes a class of its own. We estimate that it is highly relevant to shed light on the Danish <b>precariat,</b> although we also conceive that our theoretical foundation can be questioned for its validity and explanatory power due to its class perspective...|$|E

The <b>Precariat</b> is struggling, some times spontaneous, some times organised, not on a common ground, rather along diverse segmentations.

40|$|The {{world economy}} {{is in the midst}} of a Global Transformation that is {{producing}} a new global class structure. A new class is emerging – the <b>precariat</b> – characterised by chronic uncertainty and insecurity. Although the <b>precariat</b> is still a class-in-the-making, divided within itself, its elements are united in rejecting old mainstream political traditions. To become a transformative class, however, the <b>precariat</b> needs to move beyond the primitive rebel stage manifested in 2011 and become enough of a class-for-itself to be a power for change. This will involve a struggle for redistribution of the key assets needed for a good life in a good society in the twenty-first century – not the “means of production”, but socio-economic security, control of time, quality space, knowledge (or education), financial knowledge and financial capital...|$|E

More precisely, the projekts surveys with its offspring i the danes, who has felt {{the consequences of the}} income maintenance bill. The projekt also has its offspring in the theories: the <b>precariat</b> by Guy Standing and Axel Honneths theory of approval. We will use these to answer the question; why can the <b>precariat</b> in Denmark be seen as growing, and how can this affect individual feelings of approval indside the three realms. Besides taking our offspring in these theories, the projekt also takes its offspring in a carefully chosen field of empiricism. This includes Klassekamp for oven by Lars Olsen, Trygfondens Tryghedsmåling 2013 and chosen parts of articles. The projekt takes its stand the critical theory, which results in a critical approach towards the existing community throughout the projekt. The projekts results is that a change in the flexicurity-model has created a growing <b>precariat</b> in Denmark and a decrease in the approval in the labour market and in the private realm. We conclude that the feeling of social security has decreased for big parts of the danish people...|$|E
40|$|Liberalized markets {{promoted}} by the Washington Consensus under globalization {{have resulted in a}} global class structure in which new groups have emerged, including a <b>precariat</b> consisting of millions of people subject to flexible, insecure labor relations.

One consequence is that the growing inequality has generated a global class structure in which the <b>precariat</b> is growing and becoming more insecure and vulnerable.
