500|$|James {{became obsessed}} with {{the threat posed by}} witches and wrote Daemonologie in 1597, a tract {{inspired}} by his personal involvement that opposed the practice of witchcraft and that provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth. James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical. In a later letter written in England to his son Henry, James congratulates the prince on [...] "the discovery of yon little counterfeit wench. I <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> ye may be my heir in such discoveries... most miracles now-a-days prove but illusions, and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations".|$|E
500|$|James {{was widely}} mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely {{retained}} the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. [...] "As {{he lived in}} peace," [...] remarked the Earl of Kellie, [...] "so did he die in peace, and I <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> our king [...] may follow him". The earl prayed in vain: once in power, Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth.|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{perceived}} decline in his work's quality, the 1840s {{were the most}} financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty {{was in a position}} to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that [...] "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO MARRY.

At one point his horse dropped from under him and, assuming {{that it had been}} killed, Hancock proceeded on foot. The horse later jumped to its feet, having been temporarily paralyzed by a glancing blow to the spine, and Hancock remounted. He shouted, [...] "We can beat them yet. Don't leave me, for God's sake!"

2500|$|Conté's {{funeral was}} held in Conakry on 26 December. His body was put {{on display in the}} {{parliament}} building before being taken to the national stadium, where over 20,000 people were in attendance. Leaders of neighboring countries were present for the funeral. General Mamadou Ba Toto of the CNDD said at the funeral that [...] "we <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> to give us the courage to continue [...] work of tolerance and peace for the welfare of Guinea". Afterwards, his body was buried the village of Lansanaya in front of his mansion. It was taken out of its coffin and placed into the ground, then covered with handfuls of dirt tossed by mourners. The burial was marked by some disorder, as thousands of mourners tried to reach the grave and security forces formed a cordon around it.|$|E
2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. I know you will not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's {{division}} assaulted the Union {{position at}} about 2 p.m. on August 25. Despite launching two attacks, Wilcox was driven back by Miles's division, which was manning {{the northern part}} of the earthworks. To the south, Gibbon's division was blocking the advance of Hampton's cavalry, which had swept around the Union line. Confederate reinforcements from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived while the Confederate artillery softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. against Miles's position and it broke through the northwest corner of the Union fortifications. Hancock desperately galloped from one threatened point to the next, attempting to rally his men. As he witnessed the men of his once proud corps reluctant to retake their positions from the enemy, he remarked to a colonel, [...] "I do not care to die, but I <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> I may never leave this field." [...] By this time, Hampton's cavalry was making progress against Gibbon's infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon's men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time to allow for an orderly Union withdrawal to Petersburg after dark.|$|E
2500|$|According to Knox, Mary of Guise {{surveyed}} her victory {{from the}} fore-wall of Edinburgh Castle with some pleasure, comparing the English dead {{laid on the}} walls of Leith to fair tapestry, laid out to air in the sun:"The Frenche, prowd of the victorie, strypit naikit all the slayne, and laid thair carcassis befoir the hot sune alang thair wall, quhair thay sufferit thame to lye ma dayis nor ane, unto the quhilk, quhen the Quene Regent luikit, for myrth sche happit and said, 'Yonder are the fairest tapestrie that I ever saw, I wald that the haill feyldis that is betwix this place and yon war strewit with the same stuiffe.'" [...] Knox thought James Croft had not wholeheartedly played his part. Carew heard that Croft should have attacked a breach in the Pale: instead his men [...] "ran up between the Church and the water." [...] Norfolk blamed Croft, who he believed colluded with Guise, later writing, [...] "I thought a man could not have gone nigher a traitor than Sir James, I <b>pray</b> <b>God</b> make him a good man." [...] Richard Lee made a map of Leith, which Norfolk sent to London on 15 May. This map or [...] "platte" [...] was perhaps made as much for the enquiry into the 7 May events as for future works. Elizabeth read Carew and Valentine's reports and sent them to William Cecil with instructions to keep them safe and secret.|$|E
