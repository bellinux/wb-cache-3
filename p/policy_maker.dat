5|$|Rau {{grew up in}} {{a suburb}} of Stuttgart, where early on he became active in socialist youth organizations. After {{military}} service in World War I, he participated in the German Revolution of 1918-19. From 1920 onward, he was a leading agricultural <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). This ended in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power. Shortly afterward Rau was thrown in jail for two years. As an enemy of the Nazi regime in Germany he was imprisoned, in total, {{for more than half of}} the time of Hitler's reign. After his first imprisonment he emigrated in 1935 to the Soviet Union (USSR). From there, in 1937, he went on to Spain, where he participated in the Spanish Civil War as a leader of one of the International Brigades. In 1939, he was arrested in France, and was delivered by the Vichy regime back to Nazi Germany in 1942. After a few months in a Gestapo prison, he was transferred to the Mauthausen Concentration Camp in March 1943. While in the concentration camp he participated in conspiratorial prisoner activities, which led to a camp uprising in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Background: Currently, {{little is}} known about the types of {{evidence}} used by <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> This study aimed to investigate how <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> in the health domain use and evaluate evidence and how this differs from academic epidemiologists. By having a better understanding of how <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> select, evaluate and use evidence, academics can tailor the way in which that evidence is produced, potentially leading to more effective knowledge translation. Methods: An exploratory mixed-methods study design was used. Quantitative measures were collected via an anonymous online survey (n= 28), with sampling from three health-related government and non-government organisations. Semi-structured interviews with <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> (n= 20) and epidemiologists (n= 6) were conducted to gather qualitative data. Results: <b>Policy</b> <b>makers</b> indicated systematic reviews were the preferred research resource (19 %), followed closely by qualitative research (16 %). Neither <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> nor epidemiologists used grading instruments to evaluate evidence. In the web survey <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> reported that consistency and strength of evidence (93 %), the quality of data (93 %), bias in the evidence (79 %) and recency of evidence (79 %) were the most important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the available evidence. The same results were found in the qualitative interviews. Epidemiologists focused on the methodology used in the study. The most cited barriers to using robust evidence, according to <b>policy</b> <b>makers,</b> were political considerations (60 %), time limitations (55 %), funding (50 %) and research not being applicable to current policies (50 %). Conclusion: The <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> investigated did not report a systematic approach to evaluating evidence. Although there was some overlap between what <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> and epidemiologists identified as high quality evidence, there was also some important differences. This suggests that the best scientific evidence may not routinely be used in the development of policy. In essence the policy making process relied on other jurisdictions’ policies and the opinions of internal staff members as primary evidence sources to inform policy decisions. Findings of this study suggest that efforts should be directed towards making scientific information more systematically available to <b>policy</b> <b>makers...</b>|$|R

However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict. The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption.

40|$|Basic {{research}} can inform social policy {{in a number}} of ways. First, it can draw the attention of <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> to problems. Second, it can deflect <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> away from focusing on issues that are not really problems. Third, it can help <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> understand whether or not factors are causally related to problems and the processes underlying development. And fourth, it can contribute to the evaluation of programs and policies by helping policy analysts develop models of behavior and by providing the measures and methods needed to conduct rigorous evaluation studies. To communicate information to <b>policy</b> <b>makers,</b> researchers need to be very brief; write in clear, accurate, and nontechnical language; and make information easily accessible.

30|$|Evidently, <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> {{have the}} power to {{introduce}} change and have experience of what is feasible and justifiable to implement. However, they may not always be experts in the field. Researchers on the other hand have expert knowledge, but they cannot make decisions (Boyd 2013). Therefore close collaboration between the two groups is essential. Collaboration between <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> and researchers can be described with different models. Traditionally, researchers conduct their studies independently and <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> use the findings for policy making—in this model, researchers and <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> are considered as two separate communities (Furlong and Oancea 2006) and is referred to as a one-way linear transfer model (Sylva et al. 2007). In a two-way model, <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> are interested in certain questions and they commission a research team to conduct research on these questions. Even though <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> are involved in the research right from the beginning, the model can be characterised through knowledge transfer rather than knowledge exchange. The third model, a more recent model, can be described as a partnership model and includes knowledge exchange. Within the partnership model, both groups, researchers and <b>policy</b> <b>makers,</b> are involved in shaping and implementing the study and disseminating the findings. Research in the health field showed that the one-way and two-way models did not lead to actual change in practice, whereas the partnership model did (cf. Sylva et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|IntroductionLittle {{attention}} has been given to how researchers can best provide evidence to <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> so that it informs policy making. The objectives of this study were to increase understanding about the current state of public health nutrition and obesity researcher practices, beliefs, barriers, and facilitators to communicating and engaging with <b>policy</b> <b>makers,</b> and to identify best practices and suggest improvements. MethodsEighteen semistructured interviews were conducted from 2011 to 2013 with public health nutrition and obesity researchers who were highly involved in communicating research to <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed to identify common themes. ResultsStudy participants described wide variation in practices for communicating and engaging with <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> and had mixed beliefs about whether and when researchers should engage. Besides a lack of formal policy communication training, barriers noted were promotion and tenure processes and a professional culture that does not value communicating and engaging with <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> Study participants cited facilitators to engaging with <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> as ranging from the individual level (eg, desire to make a difference, relationships with collaborators) to the institutional level (eg, training/mentorship support, institutional recognition). Other facilitators identified were research- and funding-driven. Promising strategies suggested to improve policy engagement were more formal training, better use of intermediaries, and learning how to cultivate relationships with <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> ConclusionStudy findings provide insights into the challenges that will need to be overcome and the strategies that might be tried to improve communication and engagement between public health researchers and <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> 1 R 01 CA 124404 - 01 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 48 /DP 001903 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 25927604 PMC 441648...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> have {{increasingly}} {{recognized the need to}} include people’s perceptions in methods for describing landscape quality. At the same time, a third wave of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become available that make it technically possible to model landscape quality in a realistic manner. However, as there is often a mismatch between science and policy, it remains unclear to what extent perception-based models developed by scientists can be useful to <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the usefulness to policy making of a GIS-based procedure for describing perceived landscape openness. To this end, a workshop was organized which was attended by eight Dutch <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> who acted as representatives of their province (region). The Group Decision Room (GDR) technique was used to elicit the policy makers’ evaluations of the procedure in an anonymous and reliable manner. The procedure was presented to the <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> using cases from their own province, which they assessed using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> rated the procedure as being highly relevant to policy making, scientifically credible, usable by <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> and feasible to implement in the policy making process.

The <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> concluded that the procedure would be of most value for monitoring landscape changes and for analysing impacts on landscape openness in land use scenario studies. However, they requested guidelines for proper implementation of the various options in the procedure.
