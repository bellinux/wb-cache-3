30|$|In general, the {{relationship}} of “power, responsibility, and interests” mostly includes the integration or the asymmetry of right and responsibility. The integrated relation mainly means {{the right and the}} responsibility need to adapt to each other, otherwise the unintegrated relation that leads to bureaucratic irresponsible behavior will. The integration of right and responsibility is therefore the basis to protect <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> from erosion (Qi 1988; Wang 2000). In other words, once endowed with public power, these public departments have to implement their responsibility for the realization of <b>public</b> <b>interests.</b> Therefore, it is proved that <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> have become the important bridge to connect public power with public responsibility. Meanwhile, public responsibility also has another function: to protect <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> from infringement of public power or to prevent abusing public power to seek private interests. These explanations amply demonstrate that public power and public responsibility should be unified in <b>public</b> <b>interests.</b> The asymmetric relation figures out that power is divorced from responsibility. If this asymmetry becomes much more serious, it will be harmful to <b>public</b> <b>interests,</b> which will cause the chain of power and responsibility to become much more fragile (Wei and Chen 2005; Guo 2009). The relationship between “power, responsibility, and interests” proclaims that the unification of public power and public responsibility is the key influence to maintain <b>public</b> <b>interests,</b> or else it will be damaged by the erosion of private interests.|$|R

5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> (<b>public</b> <b>interest</b> standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> to accord standing.|$|E

5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v.

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v.

Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E

40|$|Residents, businesses, local, {{state and}} {{national}} government stakeholders all want to have their say when airports expand or develop. While stakeholder engagement is increasingly a strategy employed for managing the tensions attracted to airport development, different stakeholders have different expectations and demands of airports. This requires different approaches to stakeholder engagement. Identifying the <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> that are at stake in developing airports provides an initial step towards building a platform for selecting and applying stakeholder engagement strategies in airport and more general infrastructure contexts. This paper uses the existing literature of <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> and values to build a general typology of public values for the stakeholders of airport development. A range of semi-privatised and state owned airport case studies from Europe {{have been used to}} demonstrate the universal nature of the identified values. The result is a framework that identifies both the substantive and procedural values, separated into local, state/regional and national levels of interest. The typology provides a generalised view of <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> in airport development; however, the <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> identified may be limited to more western oriented societies due to the skew of airport cases reviewed. Contributions are made to the literature with a typology of public values derived from existing knowledge and explored using empirical case examples. The provided typology enables research of airport development decision-making to delineate <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> both within and between stakeholder groups, and helps to explain the different perspectives that stakeholders have towards airport development. Future research may focus on refining the typology for different types of airport governance structures, such as differences between public values in state and market-led airport development; include more airport cases from eastern societies to draw parallels or differences between western and eastern societies; or utilise the typology as a framework for analysing changes in <b>public</b> <b>interests</b> of airports over time. ...|$|R
