This paper takes the several different perspectives to probe if there are valid reasons other than a religious prohibition on interest. Chapter one and two provide a background and historical perspective on the Islamic Financial Industry. Chapter three focuses on the basic principles of Islamic Finance. The next three chapters focus deeply on the different perspectives in understanding the prohibition of riba: the religious perspective, the consumer's perspective and the economic perspectives of debt and interest. Chapter eight highlights the more common Islamic Financial Instruments with some examples and provides some comparison to western financial models as well. This paper looks closely at the religious <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and also how it affects an individual, a corporation and the economy as a whole. It highlights the perils of the current banking system. This sheds light on the validity of the prohibition and draws attention to the negative effects of riba.

By applying ideas developed in the Western contract literature, the authors show that a mudarabah contract between the manager of a project and a syndicate of investors may permit a more efficient revelation of any informational asymmetries between the two.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the standards that}} determine the validity of contracts that are governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG). While Article 4 (a) of the—CISG � the so-called ‘validity exception’—generally excludes {{the validity of the}} contract from the Convention's material scope, it does so incompletely by adding a ‘except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention’ caveat. Against this background, the article sets out to develop a novel validity definition. According to this definition, provisions concerned with the ‘validity of the contract’ in the sense of Article 4 (a) of the CISG are legal limits to party autonomy. The article continues by applying this definition to various potential validity issues as discussed in case law and legal writings. In doing so, it distinguishes between validity issues clearly not covered by the CISG (as legal limits on what to sell, legal limits on who to sell to or to purchase from, and legal limits on how to sell) and validity issues clearly covered by the CISG, as the formal validity of contracts, the validity of open-price contracts and the effect of an initial objective impossibility of the agreed performance on the contract.

40|$|The {{banking and}} other {{financial}} institutions {{play a key role}} in the economy of Malaysia. They provide a platform to facilitate the intermediation process in the financial system. The Islamic financial services such as Islamic banks operate under a different structure of corporate governance that one used in the conventional banking. An Islamic bank is obliged to appoint a board of Islamic scholars called Shariah Supervisory Board or Shariah Advisory Council/Board (SAC). Corporate Governance in financial institutions has been analysed almost exclusively in the content of conventional commerce industry. By contrast, very little is written on governance structures in Islamic banking and other Islamic financial institutions, despite the rapid growth of Islamic banks since 1970 s and their increasing presence on world financial markets (Nasser M Sulaiman, 2000). Quoting the definition by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz (2002), "corporate governance involves the manner in which the business and the affairs of the individual banking institutions are being governed by their board of directors and senior management, how the economic returns are generated to the owners, the day-to-day running of the operations of the business and the consideration <b>of</b> the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> recognised stakeholders including depositors; and how they behave in a safe and sound manner, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations". Islamic banking in modern world aims to promote and develop the application of Islamic principles, law and traditions to transactions of financial, banking and related business affairs. It is also promote investment companies to engage in such business activities that are acceptable and consistent with the Shariah concept. The main principles of Islamic banking are the <b>prohibitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (usury) in all transactions, the undertaking business and trade activities must be on the basis of fair and legitimate profit and the <b>prohibitions</b> <b>of</b> monopoly and hoarding. By doing so, Islamic banks will safeguard the Islamic communities and societies from activities that are forbidden in Islam.

The study also points out the key properties and characteristics of the Islamic model of a man who, with his dualistic nature, participates in everyday economic life by making choices between good and evil, just and unjust, etc. The study provides analysis of justice and fairness which are constituent parts of the concept of total moral and social values that guide an individual in an effort to prevent this person from exceeding the boundaries of what is allowed according to Islam.

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the first Islamic bank twenty-five years ago, the concept of Islamic banking has gained world-wide acceptance. The main feature that distinguishes Islamic banking from conventional banking is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> or "riba". The choice of Turkey was made for several reasons. Firstly, although Turkey has a large and overwhelmingly Muslim population, it is also a secular state. In many ways the problems experienced by the Islamic banks in Turkey are similar to those faced by Islamic banks in non-Islamic countries. Secondly, since 1980, the Turkish economic and financial sector has undergone rapid change, with the entry of many conventional banks. Turkey therefore offers an example of how Islamic banks can survive and prosper in a very competitive financial environment. Thirdly, due to Turkey’s strategically important position between the Middle East and Europe and increasing trade and political ties with both areas, the potential for further expansion in the field of Islamic banking in Turkey is enormous. In the introductory chapter, the economy of Turkey from the founding of the Republic to the present day was examined. Chapter 2 dealt with the activities and functions of the Central Bank. The conventional banks and other financial institutions were discussed in Chapter 3.
