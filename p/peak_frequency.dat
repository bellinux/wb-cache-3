25|$|The Tier 4 engines produce {{substantially}} lower emissions {{than most}} other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than Tier 4, and showed that at <b>peak</b> <b>frequency</b> the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any pollution level above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of Tier 4 emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute {{on the order of}} 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human health assessment in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for Tier 4 emission controls on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to Tier 4 and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.|$|E

The pitch {{recognition}} of musical sounds {{is one of}} the indispensable technologies for realizing an automatic copy-down-a-tune system. Recently various researches for the pitch recognition have been studied. In many pitch recognition systems, it is hard to cope with rapid changes in the <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> because the frame length in the frequency analysis requires many observation points rather than the frame shift interval. Therefore, these systems fail to do accurate pitch recognition at the transition part of the pitch change.

40|$|Speech {{contains}} {{a variety of}} acoustic cues to auditory and phonetic contrasts that are exploited by the listener in decoding the acoustic signal. In three experiments, we tried to elucidate whether listeners rely on formant <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies</b> or whole spectrum attributes in vowel discrimination. We created two vowel continua in which the acoustic distance in formant frequencies was constant but the continua differed in spectral moments (i. e., the whole spectrum modeled as a probability density function). In Experiment 1, we measured reaction times and response accuracy while listeners performed a go/no-go discrimination task. The {{results indicated that the}} performance of the listeners was based on the spectral moments (especially the first and second moments), and not on formant peaks. Behavioral results in Experiment 2 showed that, when the stimuli were presented in noise eliminating differences in spectral moments between the two continua, listeners employed formant <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In Experiment 3, using the same listeners and stimuli as in Experiment 1, we measured an automatic brain potential, the mismatch negativity (MMN), when listeners did not attend to the auditory stimuli. Results showed that the MMN reflects sensitivity only to the formant structure of the vowels. We suggest that the auditory cortex automatically and pre-attentively encodes formant <b>peak</b> <b>frequencies,</b> whereas attention can be deployed for processing additional spectral information, such as spectral moments, to enhance vowel discrimination...|$|R

The high synchrotron peak energies, flagging the presence of high energy electrons, make the extreme BL Lacs also good candidates for TeV emission, and therefore good probes for the IR background.

The dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the alpha range (6 - 12  Hz) are associated with cognition in typical development. <b>Peak</b> alpha <b>frequency</b> is also highly sensitive to developmental changes in neural networks, which underlie cognitive function, and therefore, it holds promise as a developmentally sensitive neural marker of cognitive function in ASD. Here, we measured <b>peak</b> alpha band <b>frequency</b> under a task-free condition in a heterogeneous sample of children with ASD (N =  59) and age-matched typically developing (TD) children (N =  38).
