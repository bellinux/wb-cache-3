5|$|Aspect weavers' {{performance}}, {{as well as}} {{the performance}} of the code that they produce, has been a subject of analysis. It is preferable that the improvement in modularity supplied by aspect weaving does not impact run-time performance. Aspect weavers are able to perform aspect-specific optimizations. While traditional optimizations such as the elimination of unused special variables from aspect code can be done at compile-time, some optimizations can only be performed by the aspect weaver. For example, AspectJ contains two similar but distinct keywords, thisJoinPoint, which contains information about this <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> of woven code, and thisJoinPointStaticPart, which contains information common to all instances of code relevant to that set of advice. The optimization of replacing thisJoinPoint with the more efficient and static keyword thisJoinPointStaticPart can only be done by the aspect weaver. By performing this replacement, the woven program avoids the creation of a join point object on every execution. Studies have shown that the unnecessary creation of join point objects in AspectJ can lead to a performance overhead of 5% at run-time, while performance degradation is only approximately 1% when this object is not created.|$|E
25|$|Some {{approaches}} for resolving the paradox {{focus on the}} inductive step.

25|$|An eclipse cycle {{takes place}} when eclipses {{in a series}} are {{separated}} by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> is the saros, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3days, or a little over 18 years. Because {{this is not a}} whole number of days, successive eclipses will be visible from different parts of the world.|$|E

The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to the appreciation of the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{definition}} alone {{it is not}} obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given {{a description of a}} Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then {{the question of whether the}} instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.|$|E
25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs. See process variation, design for manufacturability, reliability engineering, and statistical process control.|$|E
25|$|The Malta, with Buller {{still in}} command, went to sea again in early January 1807 with orders to join Lord Collingwood's fleet in the Mediterranean. Collingwood placed Buller {{in command of}} the inshore squadron, where he {{continued}} to distinguish himself. In one <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> he destroyed the beached transport Mary, which had run aground carrying stores for 25,000 troops, and which Buller burnt to prevent them falling into enemy hands. On another occasion while Malta was refitting at Gibraltar, Buller learnt that a Portuguese frigate had been wrecked on the Spanish coast. Buller at once went out and attempted to save the crew, working for several hours in pounding surf and twice being swept away, but refusing to leave until there were no more men to be saved. Perhaps because of these exertions, Buller became seriously ill with a fever, but recovered to resume his station. His health had been weakened however, and he applied to be superseded, returning to Britain later in 1807.|$|E

Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime. But Prof. Bill O'Neal cites just five incidents in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters. Earp expressed his dismay about the controversy that followed him his entire life.

500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising {{was not a good}} idea for most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this <b>particular</b> <b>instance.</b> He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur". Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version.|$|E
500|$|The deaths at Truckee Lake, Alder Creek, {{and in the}} snowshoe {{party were}} {{probably}} caused {{by a combination of}} extended malnutrition, overwork, and exposure to cold. Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation, such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5years younger than those who died; children aged between 6 and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and {{children under the age of}} 6, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were [...] "extremely high" [...] among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent. Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks and, in this <b>particular</b> <b>instance,</b> the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.|$|E
