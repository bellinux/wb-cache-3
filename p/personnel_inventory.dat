Abstract: The report {{deals with}} the author's review of the manpower attrition rate generator developed by Decision Science Associates, Inc. for use with the Marine Corps's manpower planning models. The major {{focus is on the}} implementation and documentation of the author's methodology for treating the rather vast number of small <b>personnel</b> <b>inventory</b> cells present. That methodology features two main steps: an algorithm for the aggregation of extremely small but similar (in terms of attrition behavior) cells into groups of moderately sized cells; and the use of modern 'shrinkage' methods applied to the groups in order to provide statistically stable attrition rates. These methods are described and suggestions for expediting their use are made. The use of these methods in other communities is considered and groundwork is laid for such extensions. The question of default values for some model parameters has been studied and a framework to treat these issues has been developedHQ USMC, Code MI[URL] USMC, Code MIN...|$|E

However, by our research, it has not done so while minimizing the assignment costs faced by the Marine Corps when moving a Marine to another permanent duty station. With increased pressure on cost savings due to shrinking budgets, the importance of cost minimizing efforts is becoming more significant. This thesis examines the Marine Corps personnel assignment process and proposes a methodology of optimizing the allocation of Marine Corps personnel that minimizes assignment costs, while taking into account constraints such as military occupational specialty, billet vacancies, duty station preference, and seniority. Optimization is achieved by incorporating an integer programming model into the personnel assignment process. The model is tested by contrasting {{the results of the}} actual assignments of a 15 Marine sample with the results of simulated optimization assignments of the same sample.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis work develops and tests RCMOP- 2, {{an extension of}} the Requirements-Driven, Cost-Based, Manpower Optimization (RCMOP) model introduced by Clark. Like its predecessor, RCMOP- 2 simultaneously guides monthly values for U. S. Navy officer manpower variables, including inventory, promotions, accessions, designator transfers, and forced and natural losses, in order to minimize a "gap index" reflecting the lack of fit between a given <b>personnel</b> <b>inventory</b> and a set of billet requirements. RCMOP- 2 enhances RCMOP with added resolution to input data and the inclusion of non-linear penalties for vacant billet requirements. Specifically, RCMOP- 2 details individual flow of personnel in Intelligence, Supply Corps, Civil Engineering and Other Restricted Line communities to avoid unsuited job assignments due to aggregation. Also, by increasing the planning horizon from two to four years, RCMOP- 2 can narrow the initial inventory shortfalls at lower ranks. The utilization of non-linear penalties ensures a balanced dispersion of unfilled jobs across multiple billet categories, which is consistent with current practice. Finally, a comparison of several natural loss rate scenarios yields minor differences in our gap index and number of unfilled jobs, which indicates RCMOP- 2 can accommodate specific loss information without severely impacting the outcome.

GRDB is a general purpose database system designed to be completely independent {{of the nature of}} data to be handled, since it is not tailored to the specific requirements of any particular enterprise. It can handle different types of data such as variable length records and textual data. Apart from the usual database facilities such as data definition and data manipulation, GRDB supports User Definition Language (UDL) and Security definition language. These facilities are provided through a SEQUEL-like General Purpose Query Language (GQL). GRDB provides adequate protection facilities up to the relation level. The concept of âsecurity matrixâ has been made use of to provide database protection. The concept of Unique IDentification number (UID) and Password is made use of to ensure user identification and authentication. The concept of static integrity constraints has been used to ensure data integrity. Considerable efforts have been made to improve the response time through indexing on the data files and query optimisation. GRDB is designed for an interactive use but alternate provision has been made for its use through batch mode also.

40|$|The Army {{manpower}} {{system is}} a integration of numerous elements that can be independently modeled. Identifying and closing gaps in modeling research can reduce workforce inefficiencies and costs. Military manpower models are predominantly focused on forecasting behavior and inventory within given demand requirements. Moreover, research directed towards predicting behavior is almost entirely disaggregated by pecuniary and non-pecuniary goals with disproportionate effort devoted to modeling the external factors that effect such behavior. This thesis proposes modeling approaches to improve the management capabilities of the Army 2 Ì 7 s manpower system. First, we consider a simulation-optimization approach to estimating workforce requirements examines the capabilities and limitations of Monte Carlo simulation and optimization methods {{within the context of}} workforce demand forecasting, modeling and planning. Specifically, we focus on these methods as a viable improvement for aligning strategic goals with workforce requirements. A general model is presented for estimating workforce requirements given uncertain demand. Using a real-world data example, we assess the benefits of this methodology to determine an optimal mix of workforce skills while providing the flexibility and robustness to incorporate uncertainty, assess risk and improve effectiveness of the workforce planning process. Second, we address the critical stay-or-leave decision associated with military retention. Personnel retention {{is one of the most}} significant challenges faced by the U. S. Army. Central to the problem is understanding the incentives of the stay-or-leave decision for military personnel. Using three years of data from the U. S. Department of Defense, we construct and estimate a Markov chain model of military personnel. Unlike traditional classification approaches, such as logistical regression models, the Markov chain model allows us to describe military personnel dynamics over time and answer a number of managerially relevant questions. Building on the Markov chain model, we construct a finite horizon stochastic dynamic programming model to study the monetary incentives of stay-or-leave decisions. The dynamic programming model computes the expected payoff of staying versus leaving at different stages of the career of military personnel, depending on employment opportunities in the civilian sector. We show that the stay-or-leave decisions from the dynamic programming model possess surprisingly strong predictive power, without requiring personal characteristics that are typically employed in classification approaches. Furthermore, the results of the dynamic programming model can be used as input in classification methods and lead to more accurate predictions. Overall, our work presents an interesting alternative to classification methods and paves the way for further investigations on personnel retention incentives. Finally, a graph coloring approach to deployment sourcing addresses one of the external factors of <b>personnel</b> <b>inventory</b> behavior, deployments. The configuration of persistent unit deployments has the ability to affect everything from individual perceptions of service palatability to operational effectiveness. There is little evidence to suggest any analytical underpinnings to U. S. Army deployment scheduling and unit assignment patterns.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityDespite {{the general}} {{clinical}} acceptance and {{utility of the}} Rorschach method there has been wide concern with the status of validation of the test. Those who use the test have agreed {{that it is in}} need of experimentally controlled validation; since, the successful application of the test has been highly dependent upon the skill of the examiner rather than the validity of the test. 	The Rorschach test dimension chosen for experimental investigation was the experience-balance. This concept expresses the relationship between the quantity of human movement responses and the sum of the weighted color responses, the ratio M:EC. 	A review of the literature vri th respect to the experience-balance indicated some common, consensual interpretations. From these, one broadly stated assumption concerning the experience-balance was constructed. The assumption, which is essentially a summary statement of some of the implicit and explicit beliefs held by users of the test, has been stated as follows: 	Movement responses reflect a tendency to emphasize behaviorally mental activity whereas color responses reflect a tendency to emphasize behaviorally motor activity. 	Two behavioral predictions were derived from this assumption: 	 1. People who give a preponderance of human movement determined responses to the Rorschach test delat motor activity longer in approaching a novel situation than do people who give a preponderance of color determined responses. 	 2. People who give a preponderance of human movement determined responses to the Rorschach test delay motor activity longer in approaching a novel situation than do people who give a preponderance of color determined responses. 	The general plan of the study was a comparison of subjects' scores in an independent, standardized behavioral situation to quantitative measures of the experience-balance. 	Variation in the experience-balance served as the primary criterion for the selection of the subjects. Median cutting points were determined for moth M and C using eighty-six Rorschach protocols. The obtained median values were x_M= 3, x_C= 2. The M group consisted of those subjects in whom M was above three and C at or below two. The C group consisted of those subjects in whom C was above two and M at or below three. 	A modified version oft he Katona (23) Match Stick Tasks was employed as the independent, standardized behavior situation. This test was selected for the following reasons: (a) it offered the subjects an opportunity to behave in a manner compatible with both aspects of the assumption and its implications for behavior; (b) it was possible to vary and apply the material extensively; and (c) these tasks proved difficult enough in a pilot study to allow for extended behavioral observations. Nine tasks were used. They were arranged in an ascending order of difficulty as determined by the pilot study. Reaction time, defined as the time elapsing between the last word of the instructions to the time the first move was made, served as the measure of delay. A move was defined as any change of the position of a stick either from the arrangement placed before the subject, or from an arrangement he had devised in attempting solution. The number of moves served as the measure of motor activity. 	The behavioral implicat i ons, deduced from the assumption, were translated into operational hypotheses. 	 1. The reaction time for the M group will be significantly longer than the reaction time for the C group. 	 2. The M group will make significantly fewer moves than will the C group. 	Two groups of ten subjects each were used in this study. Both groups with one exception, consisted of white, American-born students drawn from psychology classes conducted at a local uni versity. One subject was obtained from a group of student nurses in training at a local hospital. No subject with a previous history of, or treatment for psychiatric or neurological difficulties, as determined by available records and interview, was used. Any subject with a record of previous Rorschach examination was eliminated from the experiment. The hypothesis that the two samples were drawn from a common population with respect to age, intelligence, and total number of Rorschach responses was found tenable. The M group consisted of six male and four female subjects, and the C group contained an equal number of males and females. 	The subjects were seen in two sessions. The first session consisted of the administration of the group Rorschach test. The second session was made up of the individual administration of the Stick tasks and the Wonerlic <b>Personnel</b> <b>Inventory,</b> Form A, which was used to derive an estimate of intellectual level. The operational hypotheses were translated into the following statistical hypotheses: 	la. The M and C groups are drawn from populations having equal mean log reaction times. 	 2 a. The M and C groups are drawn from populations having equal mean rates of moves. 	These hypotheses were tested against the classes of alternatives which state that la.) the mean log reaction time for the M group is larger than the mean log reaction time for the C group, and 2 a.) the mean rate of moves for the M group is lower than the mean rate of moves for the C group. 	Analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used to analyze the data. The analysis of variance was performed, in each instance, using two groups of subjects tested on nine trials. Both hypotheses were tested by the between groups F test. The obtained value of F for hypothesis (1 a) equalled 11. 616, and is significant at <. 01 level. The value of F for hypothesis 2 a was 29. 982, significant at <. 001 level of confidence. 	The results of the statistical analyses indicated acceptance of both stated alternatives. Support was therefore indicated for the behavioral predictions that movement-preponderant people delay longer and are motorically less active than color-preponderant people. In light of the supplemental finding that the groups did not differ with respect to efficiency of solution, the results were interpreted as indicating that the experience-balance reveals rather characteristic response tendencies. 	This study makes no claim of having contributed new meanings to the Rorschach experience-balance. It would seem rather, that some of the insights of those who use the test have gained experimental support. In this sense the clinician may form interpretations {{on the basis of the}} experience-balance with more ease and support and need to rely less on funtuition and subjective impressions. 	Movement-preponderant people tend to approach novel situations with caution and deliberation. They tend to engage in relatively little motor activitywhen compared to color-preponderant individuals. On the other hand, color-preponderant people become motorically active much more quickly and engage primarily in motor activity in attempting to resolve and adjust to the novel situation. 	In the course of this research questions and issues have arisen which point to the future for possible resolution. It is not the purpose here to supply definitive procedures, but to recognize and structure some of these problems. 	 1. The results of the present study demonstrated that validity can be ascertained for Rorschach variables. A need remains to attempt verification of other important Rorschach factors. On the basis of inference as to which personality processes are related to specific indices, research could be structured that would experimentally study the interactions between these indices, attempting to approach the total personality. 	 2. The results of the present study suggest that the experience-balance may bear an important relationship to the nature of social and interpersonal activity. Of particular interest would be research designed to measure group activity in groups composed solely of movement-preponderant and color-preponderant individuals. The findings of the present study suggest the expectation that these groups would tend to exhibit differential behavior with respect to the type of communication between the members, the type of activity emphasized, and the type of defenses employed. For practical purposes, if such results are obtained, it may be found beneficial to consider the possibility of admixing these individuals in establishing groups. The use of the experience-balance score, in clinical situations, may prove to be extremely valuable and might conceivably lead to a relatively simple, objective criterion for the selection of group members. 	 3. A final implication different from the results of the present study concerns the relationship of efficiency of performance of movement-and color-preponderant individ~als in situations which impose demands for activity antithetical to their preferred modes of behavior. It should be kept in mind that in the present study both groups were found to be equally proficient in the problem-solving situation. The subjects were offered a free choice situation, and the set for either type of approach was kept at a win:Un. um. However, there are life situations which impose particular demands upon the individual and offer little opportunity for choice. Within this latter framework the question may be raised: What is the proficiency of a movement-preponderant individual in a job or task situation demanding large amounts of motor activity? Similarly, what is the performance efficiency of a color-preponderant individual in a situation demanding deliberation and caution for maximal productivity?
