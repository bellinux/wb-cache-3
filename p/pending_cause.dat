40|$|On November 4, 1912 the Supreme Court of the United States, by formal order, {{adopted and}} {{established}} a code of rules for the courts of equity of the United States, which should {{take the place of}} all rules theretofore prescribed by the Supreme Court and then in force. Rule 81 provides: 2 ̆ 2 These rules shall be in force on and after February 1, 1913, and shall govern all proceedings in cases then pending or thereafter brought, save that where in any then <b>pending</b> <b>cause</b> an order has been made or act done which cannot be changed without doing substantial injustice, the court may give effect to such order or act to the extent necessary to avoid any such injustice. All rules theretofore prescribed by the Supreme Court, regulating the practice in suits in equity, shall be abrogated when these rules take effect. 2 ̆ 2 In pursuance of said order the rules so promulgated now regulate the procedure in the federal courts of equity.

50|$|In early 846, Emperor Wuzong became {{extremely}} ill and {{was unable}} to speak. The palace eunuchs gathered and decided on Li Yi as Emperor Wuzong's successor, probably because they considered him unintelligent and therefore easier to control. They had an edict issued in Emperor Wuzong's name creating Li Yi crown prince and changing his name to Li Chen and putting him in charge of the imperial affairs. It was said that only when Li Chen met the officials in his role as crown prince that his appropriate expressions of sadness and actions on <b>pending</b> matters <b>caused</b> people to begin to see that he was truly intelligent. Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong died, and Li Chen took the throne (as Emperor Xuānzong).|$|R

5000|$|The Metropolitan Opera's general manager, Giulio Gatti-Casazza, hired Talley for the 1925/26 season. On February 17, 1926, {{she made}} her debut there as Gilda, the {{daughter}} of the title character in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto. At the age of nineteen, she was the youngest prima donna to sing at the Metropolitan Opera at that time. [...] (Patrice Munsel would perform there at age eighteen in 1943.) Her <b>pending</b> debut <b>caused</b> a media sensation, contrary to Gatti-Casazza's hopes that it would remain low-key. A delegation of two hundred leading citizens of Kansas City, including Mayor Albert I. Beach, arrived via a special train. Tickets were being resold at astronomical prices. A telegraph was set up backstage so her father could send dispatches to the Associated Press. Her performance prompted multiple ovations from the crowd, but critics were less enthusiastic. While they thought her debut promising, it did not live up to the expectations caused by the media frenzy.|$|R

40|$|The primate {{prefrontal cortex}} plays {{a central role}} in {{choosing}} goals, along {{with a wide variety of}} additional functions, including short-term memory. In the present study, we examined neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex as monkeys used abstract response strategies to select one of three spatial goals, a selection that depended on their memory of the most recent previous goal. During each trial, the monkeys selected a future goal on the basis of events from the previous trial, including both the symbolic visual cue that had appeared on that trial and the previous goal that the monkeys had selected. When a symbolic visual cue repeated from the previous trial, the monkeys stayed with their previous goal as the next (future) goal; when the cue changed, the monkeys shifted from their previous goal to one of the two remaining locations as their future goal. We found that prefrontal neurons had activity that reflected either previous goals or future goals, but only rarely did individual cells reflect both. This finding suggests that essentially separate neural networks encode these two aspects of spatial information processing. A failure to distinguish previous and future goals could lead to two kinds of maladaptive behavior. First, wrongly representing an accomplished goal as still <b>pending</b> could <b>cause</b> perseveration or compulsive checking, two disorders commonly attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. Second, mistaking a pending goal as already accomplished could cause the failures of omission that occur commonly in dementia...|$|R
50|$|In 1905, Oke was {{appointed}} Justice of the Peace and Notary Public for the Colony. In Feb 1909, the Governor in Council appointed Oke to be Stipendiary Magistrate for the Northern District of Newfoundland and Judge of the Harbour Grace District Court {{in place of}} Alfred Henry Seymour (1855-1912), who was elected to represent Harbour Grace in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. Given this new position, Oke recused himself as a publisher. Until his death in 1923, Oke served {{as one of the}} two District Court judges in Newfoundland; the District Court in Harbour Grace was abolished in 1935. By 1913, Oke {{was appointed}} as a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, authorized to take affidavits for any <b>cause</b> <b>pending</b> in the Supreme Court and empowered to issue Original or Mesne Process.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The sub judice rule is a media law {{practice}} {{that is currently}} often in the spotlight. Editors and journalists are constantly furiously speaking out against this rule that limits their freedom of expression {{in an attempt to}} assure the accused's fair and proper trial. Practitioners of the law, on the other side, say the sub judice rule is indispensable to the proper administration of justice. The rule, which much prevents the media from interfering with a <b>pending</b> case, <b>causes</b> confusion under journalists, as it is not consistently applied. Judges often warn the media against the violation of the rule during a high profile case, but those who do break the rule are not charged with contempt of the court. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine how Beeld, the Afrikaans daily newspaper, applies the sub judice rule in his reporting. The way in which this leading paper handles the rule is of importance to other journalists as well as the readers. The origin, development and function of the rule are also examined. It was established that Beeld did not contravene the sub judice rule as unceremoniously as a few other newspapers. Beelds violations of the rule were different experts' nuanced interpretations thereof. These violations is more based on the perception that the court's independence and worthiness must be upheld in the public eye than on the rule's actual function to guard against the interfering in the due course of a case.

5000|$|In 1866, sureties made an $8,000 {{cash bond}} for Edward McGuire in Connecticut, {{after he was}} charged with grand larceny. While {{awaiting}} trial in Connecticut, McGuire returned to his home in New York. Unknown to the bondsmen in Connecticut, McGuire was wanted in Maine for another felony. Upon request from the Governor of Maine later in 1866, the Governor of New York extradited McGuire to Maine, where he was convicted of burglary in 1867 and imprisoned for fifteen years. When McGuire failed to appear for trial in Connecticut in October 1866, the cash bond was forfeited. The Connecticut bondsmen sought relief from the forfeiture on grounds that they were not at fault in failing to secure McGuire's appearance, but rather that his nonappearance was the result of his extradition to Maine—an intervening [...] "act of law" [...] under the Extradition Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 4 to 3 (2 Justices recused themselves) held that the sureties were at fault and were not protected by the Extradition Clause. The sureties' [...] "supineness and neglect" [...] in failing to keep up with McGuire and to inform the New York authorities of the <b>pending</b> Connecticut case <b>caused</b> McGuire's nonappearance.|$|R
5000|$|The 2016-17 {{was one of}} {{the most}} strange and {{contradictory}} seasons. From title contender half way through season, Tirana fell continuously to dramatically succumb to relegation for the first time in their precious history. Season started well with coach Ilir Daja and by end of first quarter Tirana had lost only one match and was 3 points from head of table. However, suddenly Daja got dismissed after the home draw against Vllaznia. Mirel Josa was straightaway appointed as the new coach. Even though furiously won the next two home matches, Tirana started wasting points home and away (especially home draw against ultimately ranked team was unattainable). To add further to the insult, an unexpected agreement between Tirana's president and red rivals in sharing with them Tirana's home stadium for the season, broke club's relationship with their fans who had always opposed such an agreement. They subsequently abandoned the matches for the entire season as result. Referees played another negative role in Tirana's doom, as further precious points were wasted due to canceled goals, card punishments or favoritism towards opponents. With only few exceptions, club never raised their voice towards this injustice.By end of half season, club dismissed several [...] "unsuitable" [...] players. And as Tirana was preparing to bring new players such as Elis Bakaj, etc in order to withstand the rest of season, they faced UEFA's restrictions due to a <b>pending</b> debt. This <b>caused</b> further shrinkage on the group's quality. By end of third quarter team was struggling at bottom four and 3 matches due to finish Tirana needed at least 5 points to survive relegation, with all possible combinations against. Ultimate round was the away match against Vllaznia who were themselves fighting to stay in the League and needed just one point, whereas Tirana needed only the win. However, after a hard fought match which ended goalless, Tirana ranked 9th and therefore relegated.Contrary to League display, Tirana won the Cup for record 16th time defeating KS Skenderbeu Korce in final after extra time. Tirana did not lose a single match along the campaign. Cup trophy also meaning participation in European cups after 5 years absence.|$|R
