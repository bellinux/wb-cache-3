5000|$|If {{the shaft}} of a DC motor is turned by an {{external}} force, the motor will act like a generator and produce an Electromotive force (EMF). During normal operation, the spinning of the motor produces a voltage, known as the counter-EMF (CEMF) or back EMF, because it opposes the applied voltage on the motor. The back EMF {{is the reason that}} the motor when free-running {{does not appear to have}} the same low electrical resistance as the wire contained in its winding. This is the same EMF that is produced when the motor is used as a generator (for example when an electrical load, such as a light bulb, is placed across the terminals of the motor and the motor shaft is driven with an external torque). Therefore, the total voltage drop across a motor consists of the CEMF voltage drop, and the <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltage</b> drop resulting from the internal resistance of the armature's windings.

To understand the hot-carrier degradation mechanism, stress damages were characterized by dc hot-carrier stress measurement for various stress conditions and fin widths.

40|$|In this letter, {{we report}} on the {{theoretical}} investigations of electron mobility in practically viable designs of InxGa 1 -xN channel high electron mobility transistors (HEMT). Carriers in such devices are expected to exhibit a higher velocity and hence higher cut-off frequencies (fT) for highly scaled architectures. We estimate that the mobility of two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) is limited by alloy scattering rather than phonon scattering unlike in conventional GaN-channel HEMTs. For indium composition of 0. 30, the mobility and sheet resistance are found to be 500 cm 2 /Vs and 700 ohm per sq. respectively, which can severely affect the <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltage</b> drop in access regions. The results presented here are believed to significantly guide the practical exploration of InxGa 1 -xN channel HEMTs towards next-generation electronics by enabling careful design of device layouts in highly scaled transistors to minimize parasitic access region voltage drop which results due to significant degradation of 2 DEG mobility.

40|$|The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) {{arises from}} spin {{dependent}} scattering. It signifies a conversion of a longitudinal spin current into a transversal charge current. This enables spin current sensors using conventional charge-based electronics leveraging advances in technology, e. g., towards {{the development of}} magnetization based universal memory concepts, and a fundamental understanding of physical properties of spin-dependent scattering. From an experimental point of view this PhD-thesis {{is placed in the}} greater context of magnetization dynamics. In metallic heterostructures consisting of atleast one ferromagnetic and one normal metal (non-magnetic) layer, a precessing magnetization in the ferromagnetic layer may facilitate a pure spin current across the interface into the normal metal (NM). The spin current generated by this so-called spin pumping effect is converted into a charge current by ISHE in NM. In steady-state this corresponds to a voltage drop along the normal metal which relates directly back to the amount of spin dependent scattering in NM and which is retained in one single parameter characterizing the material, the spin Hall angle. In this PhD-thesis this kind of experiment is used for the quest for materials which feature large spin Hall angles. To this end {{it is one of the}} central concerns to characterize and ultimately exclude all possible <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltages,</b> which naturally arise in an experimental setup towards magnetization dynamics. The main <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltages</b> in this respect are the ones caused by spin rectification due to anisotropic magnetoresistance in the ferromagnetic layer and the ones caused by electromagnetic induction in the measurement circuit. Ruling out these effects comprehensive and reliable estimations of the spin Hall angles for platinum, gold and of the alloys of both materials are conducted. Furthermore, the experimental approach of using a combination of spin pumping and ISHE is used to investigate the oscillating nature of spin currents which naturally result from spin pumping. This eventually leads to the observation of the ac-ISHE in platinum measuring voltages in the GHz-regime. This observation uncovers the interesting field of ac-spintronics...|$|R

Important aspects of such generators include a high power-to-weight ratio, high efficiency and a low cost per kVA output [1]. Another critical aspect is the requirement for very low harmonic content in the output voltage. Hence, it is very important to be able to model and predict the no-load voltage waveform in an accurate manner in order to be able to satisfy standards requirements, such as the permissible total harmonic distortion (THD). Also, at steady-state conditions, <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltages</b> are induced in the damper bars which lead to a current flow with associated power losses and an increase in temperatures.

40|$|Spin pumping in ferromagnets {{provides}} {{a source of}} pure spin currents. Via the inverse spin Hall effect a spin current is converted into a charge current and a corresponding detectable DC-voltage. The ratio of injected spin current to resulting charge current is given by the spin Hall angle. However, the number of experiments more or less equals the number of different values for spin Hall angles, even for the most studied normal metal platinum. This publication {{provides a}} full study of inverse spin Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance for different NiFe(Py) / normal metal bilayers using a coplanar waveguide structure. Angle and frequency dependent measurements strongly suggest that spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect {{can be used to}} quantify spin Hall angles only if certain conditions are met. Ruling out the anisotropic magnetoresistance as a <b>parasitic</b> <b>voltage</b> generating effect measurements of the inverse spin Hall effect in Py/Pt and Py/Au yield spin Hall angles of 0. 09 and 0. 008 respectively.

50|$|The SGT was {{the first}} process {{technology}} used to fabricate commercial MOS integrated circuits that was later widely adopted by the entire industry in the 1960s. In late 1967, Tom Klein, working at the Fairchild Semiconductor R&D Labs, and reporting to Les Vadasz, realized that the work function difference between heavily P-type doped silicon and N-type silicon was 1.1 volt lower than the work function difference between aluminum and the same N-type silicon. This meant that the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with silicon gate could be 1.1 volt lower than the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with aluminum gate fabricated on the same starting material. Therefore, one could use starting material with 111 silicon orientation and simultaneously achieve both an adequate <b>parasitic</b> threshold <b>voltage</b> and low threshold voltage transistors {{without the use of}} a channel-stopper mask or ion implantation under the field oxide.

In fact, interconnect {{takes up the}} most part of the total chip area. The parasitics associated with these interconnect have {{significant impact on the}} circuit performance. Some of the effects of parasitics include cross talk, voltage drop and high current density. These issues can result in cross-talk induced functional failure and failures due to IR drop and electro-migration.

40|$|When {{applying}} the noise thermometer in industrial facilities considerable line lengths are occasionally required {{due to the}} positioning of the measuring points in the facility (e. g. high radiation level etc.). Since the noise thermometer developed at the KFA Jülich operates according to the comparison method the signal lines require that the measuring signal is transmitted undistorted in the frequency band used for the noise temperature measurements. For reasons of measuring time and measuring accuracy it is desirable to have as wide as possible a frequency band available for measurements. To this end sensor resistance and line arrangement must be specially matched to each other. Apart from the transmission {{characteristics of the line}} arrangement with respect to the measuring signals, the equivalent noise resistances of the electronics as well as the <b>parasitic</b> noise <b>voltages</b> of the ohmic resistances of the lines, which canattain {{the same size as the}} sensor resistance or even greater, must also be taken into consideration in the case of long lines - although the correlation method is used (correlative errors of the line). Due to - the coupling of both line channels to the measuring resistance, these voltages can be overcoupled from one line channel to the other and are thus present at the two amplifier inputs in the form of correlated signals. Since in many applications (e. g. in nuclear reactors) the measuring sensor cannot be easily replaced, the value of the sensor resistance, as well as the selection of transmission lines with respect to good transmission characteristics of the whole arrangement and minimizing the correlative error terms, must already be optimized when designing a noise thermometerarrangement for the reasons mentioned above. The TRARAU computer program was developed for this purpose enabling the influences of the lines to be computed by taking into consideration all the effects occuring through the lines, such as transmission errors and correlative error terms. In order to check the accuracy of the TRARAU computer program a series of laboratory measurements were implemented enabling both the pure transmission behaviour of the line arrangement with respect to the measuring signal to be detected, as well as the overall line error. In all cases this resulted in a very good agreement of the measured values with the computed values. The transmission behaviour of noise thermometer arrangements occuring in practice were studied with the example of two reactor experiments. These were firstly an Na experiment in the Belgian BR 2 research reactor in Mol, and secondly the measurement of the primary coolant temperature in a power LWR (GKN - Gemeinschaftskernkraftwerk-Neckarwestheim). In both cases it was possible to demonstrate successfully the potential of the computer program TRARAU. As the parametric studies have shown, optimum matching over unlimited band widths is not feasible in principle. By reducing the upper band limit, however, the line error can practically always be kept sufficiently small. With good matching larger band widths can also be used...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. The {{drive for}} smaller and higher density power {{supplies}} have been realised by advances in switching technologies, higher frequencies and smaller components. Along with the advances of higher switching frequencies, came {{a number of}} restrictive parasitic effects that were insignificant at lower frequencies (in use a few years ago). A problem that is becoming of increasing concern, as the frequencies increase, rise times decrease and current levels increase, is the reactance of the <b>parasitic</b> inductance in <b>voltage</b> fed converter. This inductance is responsible for a multitude of limitations and problems in high frequency converters, with the most important being unstable voltage supplies, large voltage spikes during switching (which leads to electromagnetic interference), and power transfer limitations. The main contributors of this parasitic inductance {{was found to be}} the inherent inductance of the conductors of the DC bus, the internal inductance of the capacitor elements used in the DC bus and the paralleling of these capacitor elements (capacitor bank). It was decided to investigate the cause of these identified inductances in an attempt at finding a means to reduce them, thereby improving the performance of the converter. This was accompanied by a search into prediction methods for the inductance and capacitance of the DC bus conductors. The ability to predict the inductance and capacitance inherent to the DC bus conductors, will allow for a large decrease in prototyping, and should give insight into the causes of these elements and how to manipulate them. This was done for the DC bus conductors, and led to insight into their inductance and capacitance origins. Means to reduce this inductance was found, along with the ability to predict the inductance and capacitance of a number of DC bus conductors. The last two identified parasitic inductance sources, the internal inductance of the capacitors and inductance of the capacitor bank, were then investigated. The cause of the inductance in the capacitor elements was discovered, along with the factors on which the capacitor elements are dependent. A great deal of the inductance, and its associated effects, can be avoided through proper capacitor selection and correct capacitor bank design. In order to bring this study in context with a practical scenario, the information previously obtained was incorporated in a full bridge voltage fed converter. The previous findings on inductance and capacitance held equally well when applied to a practical scenario. Additional means to reduce the effects of the parasitic inductances were discovered, and the inductance and capacitance prediction methods proved to be relatively accurate when applied to the DC bus conductors of a physical converter...|$|R
