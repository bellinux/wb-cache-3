2500|$|Around 1900 low-thermal-expansion {{materials}} {{began to}} be used for <b>pendulum</b> <b>rods</b> in the highest precision clocks and other instruments, first invar, a nickel steel alloy, and later fused quartz, which made temperature compensation trivial. [...] Precision pendulums were housed in low pressure tanks, which kept the air pressure constant to prevent changes in the period due to changes in buoyancy of the pendulum due to changing atmospheric pressure. [...] The accuracy of the best pendulum clocks topped out at around a second per year.|$|R
2500|$|Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters: In 1887 Austro-Hungarian {{scientist}} Robert von Sterneck {{developed a}} small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled vacuum tank {{to eliminate the}} effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a [...] "half-second pendulum," [...] having a period close to one second, about 25cm long. [...] The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting {{the image of an}} electric spark created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted {{at the top of the}} <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod.</b> The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890, were used extensively for surveys into the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Kater built a {{reversible}} pendulum (shown at right) {{consisting of a}} brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular [...] "knife" [...] blades (a) near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> (b,c). In operation, the pendulum is hung {{in front of a}} precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the distance between the pivots into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration g very accurately.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{device to}} {{compensate}} for this error was the mercury pendulum, invented by George Graham in 1721. [...] The liquid metal mercury expands in volume with temperature. In a mercury pendulum, the pendulum's weight (bob) is a container of mercury. With a temperature rise, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> gets longer, but the mercury also expands and its surface level rises slightly in the container, moving its centre of mass closer to the pendulum pivot. By using the correct height of mercury in the container these two effects will cancel, leaving the pendulum's centre of mass, and its period, unchanged with temperature. Its main disadvantage was that when the temperature changed, the rod {{would come to the}} new temperature quickly but the mass of mercury might take a day or two to reach the new temperature, causing the rate to deviate during that time. [...] To improve thermal accommodation several thin containers were often used, made of metal. Mercury pendulums were the standard used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{source of}} error in early pendulums was slight changes in length due to thermal {{expansion}} and contraction of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> with changes in ambient temperature. [...] This was discovered when people noticed that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer, by as much as a minute per week (one of the first was Godefroy Wendelin, as reported by Huygens in 1658). [...] Thermal expansion of pendulum rods was first studied by Jean Picard in 1669. [...] A pendulum with a steel rod will expand by about 11.3 parts per million (ppm) with each degree Celsius increase, causing it to lose about 0.27 seconds per day for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, or 9 seconds per day for a [...] change. Wood rods expand less, losing only about 6 seconds per day for a [...] change, which is why quality clocks often had wooden pendulum rods. The wood had to be varnished to prevent water vapor from getting in, because changes in humidity also affected the length.|$|E
2500|$|Pendulums {{in clocks}} (see example at right) are usually {{made of a}} weight or bob (b) [...] {{suspended}} by a rod of wood or metal (a). [...] To reduce air resistance (which accounts {{for most of the}} energy loss in precision clocks) [...] the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock. In quality clocks the bob is made as heavy as the suspension can support and the movement can drive, since this improves the regulation of the clock (see Accuracy below). A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is [...] [...] Instead of hanging from a , clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring (d) of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight bending force of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's restoring force. A few precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the crutch, (e), which ends in a fork, (f) whose prongs embrace the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod.</b> The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's escapement, (g,h).|$|E
50|$|In most {{pendulum}} clocks {{the rate}} is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod.</b> Moving it up shortens the pendulum, making it beat more quickly, and causing the clock to gain time. In the most common arrangement, the bob {{is attached to the}} pendulum with an adjustment nut at the bottom, on the threaded end of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod.</b> Turning the nut adjusts the height of the bob. But some bobs have levers or dials to adjust the height. In some precision clocks there is a smaller auxiliary weight on a threaded shaft to allow more fine adjustment. Tower clocks sometimes have a tray mounted on the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod,</b> to which small weights can be added or removed, to adjust the rate without stopping the clock.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the theocratical work for a new type of wind power system. This wind system, called Wing {{oscillating}} coil <b>rod</b> <b>pendulum</b> system. This is a small prototype that generates low current and voltage. This system is a new type of wind turbine, to generate energy by using wind. One of the main elements of this system is a copper coil pendulum with flapping wing attached to it which oscillates at a low frequency when wind strikes it. The wind blowing kinetic energy compels the pendulum to oscillate, so the kinetic energy of wind is converted into oscillating energy of pendulum. The oscillating energy is then converted into electrical energy by using a semicircle shaped permanent magnet, which is placed under the coil <b>rod</b> <b>pendulum.</b> Theocratical construction and electrical design of wing oscillating coil <b>rod</b> <b>pendulum</b> system is discussed in this paper...|$|R
2500|$|Around 1900 low thermal {{expansion}} materials were developed which, when used as <b>pendulum</b> <b>rods,</b> made elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary. These were only used in {{a few of the}} highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy Invar. This has a CTE of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this {{can be seen in the}} Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock [...] which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.|$|R

50|$|A {{major source}} of error in {{pendulum}} clocks is thermal expansion; the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> changes in length slightly with changes in temperature, causing changes {{in the rate of}} the clock. An increase in temperature causes the rod to expand, making the pendulum longer, so its period increases and the clock loses time. Many older quality clocks used wooden pendulum rods to reduce this error, as wood expands less than metal.|$|E

2500|$|Achieving {{stability}} of an inverted pendulum {{has become a}} common engineering challenge for researchers.

A polar Van der Pol representation, with embedded time indications, is used to allow a precise comparison. The pendulums are modeled as Duffing oscillators.

If the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> is made of metal it will expand and contract with heat, shortening or lengthening the pendulum; this changes the time taken for a swing. Special alloys are used in expensive pendulum-based clocks to minimize this distortion. The degrees of arc which a pendulum may swing varies; highly accurate pendulum-based clocks have very small arcs in order to minimize the circular error.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Riefler escapement, Riefler clocks' mechanism had several other innovations which were responsible for their accuracy. They {{were one of the}} first clocks to use a <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> made of the low thermal expansion alloy invar, to prevent the pendulum from changing length with temperature changes, causing error. The most accurate models were mounted in a low pressure tank to eliminate the effect of changes in atmospheric pressure on the pendulum.

5000|$|As {{part of a}} {{committee}} appointed by the Royal Society in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately {{the length of the}} seconds pendulum in London.

If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted {{up and down on the}} <b>pendulum's</b> <b>rod,</b> and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivot points would be L. Kater wasn't the first to have this idea. French mathematician Gaspard de Prony first proposed a reversible pendulum in 1800, but his work was not published till 1889. In 1811 Friedrich Bohnenberger again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.|$|R

By using the correct amount of mercury, the centre of gravity of the pendulum remained at a constant height, and thus its period remained constant, despite changes in temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{gridiron}} pendulum was a temperature-compensated clock pendulum {{invented by}} British clockmaker John Harrison around 1726 and later modified by John Ellicott. It {{was used in}} precision clocks. In ordinary clock pendulums, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>rod</b> expands and contracts with changes in temperature. The period of the pendulum's swing depends on its length, so pendulum clocks rate varied with changes in ambient temperature, causing inaccurate timekeeping. The gridiron pendulum consists of alternating parallel rods of two metals with different thermal expansion coefficients, such as steel and brass. The rods are connected by a frame {{in such a way}} that their different thermal expansions (or contractions) compensate for each other, so the overall length of the pendulum, and thus its period, stays constant with temperature.|$|E
