40|$|ABSTRACT: Dielectric and {{mechanical}} {{measurements of the}} R-relaxation are reported for polystyrenes of varying vinylphenol content. The presence of the <b>polar</b> <b>moiety</b> substantially increases both the glass transition temperature and the segmental relaxation times of the polymer. However, {{the shape of the}} relaxation function, as well as the temperature dependence of the relaxation times, is invariant to copolymer composition. This indicates that the enhanced interactions arising from polar modification of the polystyrene are short-lived on the time scale of the segmental dynamics. Although fragility was found to be independent of copolymer composition, the heat capacity change at Tg increases with increasing vinylphenol content. The absence of a correlation between these two quantities is contrary to an energy landscape interpretation of fragility...|$|E

The 3 D-QSAR analysis, which was performed using both the CoMFA and CoMSIA protocols, revealed that the presence of a H-bond donor group is not statistically relevant for H(3) receptor affinity. Based on this result, another alignment was adopted that took into consideration the structural features common to all compounds, namely the imidazole ring and the N atom with a free lone pair in the polar portion.

To explore three-dimensional H-bonding properties, a new tool called Molecular Hydrogen-Bonding Potentials (MHBPs) was created. The development of this tool is based on a stepwise procedure similar to the one used successfully to generate the Molecular Lipophilicity Potential (MLP). First, a H-bonding fragmental system was developed starting from published solvatochromic parameters. An atomic H-bonding donor fragmental value (alpha) is associated to each hydrogen atom in a <b>polar</b> <b>moiety.</b> Similarly, an atomic H-bonding acceptor fragmental value (beta) is associated to each polar atom.

(2001), which is suggested as a similar mechanism occurred in our study for wax deposition removal. Apart from that, Wang et al.

Emergence of drug-resistant {{influenza virus}} strains limits the effectiveness of drug treatment. Importantly, a dual H 275 Y/I 223 R mutation detected in the pandemic influenza A 2009 virus strain results in multidrug resistance to current neuraminidase (NA) drugs. Therefore, discovery of new agents for treating multiple drug-resistant (MDR) influenza virus infections is important. Here, we propose a parallel screening strategy that simultaneously screens wild-type (WT) and MDR NAs, and identifies inhibitors matching the subsite characteristics of both NA-binding sites. These may maintain their potency when drug-resistant mutations arise. Initially, we analyzed the subsite of the dual H 275 Y/I 223 R NA mutant. Analysis of the site-moiety maps of NA protein structures show that the mutant subsite has a relatively small volume and is highly polar compared with the WT subsite. Moreover, the mutant subsite has a high preference for forming hydrogen-bonding interactions with polar moieties. These changes may drive multidrug resistance. Using this strategy, we identified a new inhibitor, Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RB 19, an anthraquinone dye), which inhibited WT NA and MDR NA with IC 50 values of 3. 4 and 4. 5 mM, respectively.

The partially purified flavolipid mixture isolated from strain MTN 11 exhibited a critical micelle concentration of 300 mg/liter and reduced surface tension to 26. 0 mN/m, indicating strong surfactant activity. The flavolipid mixture was a strong and stable emulsifier even at concentrations as low as 19 mg/liter. It was also an effective solubilizing agent, and in a biodegradation study, it enhanced hexadecane mineralization by two isolates, MTN 11 (100 -fold) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 (2. 5 -fold), over an 8 -day period. The flavolipid-cadmium stability constant was measured to be 3. 61, which is comparable to that for organic ligands such as oxalic acid and acetic acid.

Examples range from protein folding in a polarizable solvent to contact electrification induced by the rubbing of two dislike solids. When simulating such processes, it is not appropriate to decompose the electrostatic forces between the central atomistic degrees of freedom into (effective) two-body contributions. Instead, one needs to consider the dielectric response of the external medium, which one may want to represent as a continuum. In this contribution, we show that the split-charge equilibration (SQE) method {{can be used to}} describe continua with well-defined dielectric properties, although it was originally designed to assign atomic charges on the fly. As such, SQE bears much potential for hybrid particle-continuum simulations. The comparison of dielectric response functions as obtained by SQE and point-dipole methods reveals many advantages for SQE. The main points are: SQE requires fewer floating-point operations, non-local dielectric properties are more easily embedded, and the leading-order corrections to the continuum limit are isotropic on the simple cubic lattice in contrast to point dipole models...|$|R

On both columns, polar compounds exhibited a characteristic U- shape retention behavior in function of acetonitrile amount in the eluent, whereas retention of neutral molecules decreased continuously, following an increase of organic modifier, over the entire mobile phase range. The dependence of perfluoromethylene selectivity upon eluent composition explains the typical reversed-phase behavior (decreasing in retention following an increase of acetonitrile in mobile phase) initially exhibited by perfluoroalkyl acids, but alone it cannot justify their increasing of retention at organic-rich mobile phases (approximately > 90 % v/v for acetonitrile with the C 6 F 13 column and acetonitrile > 80 % v/v for the BEH-C 18 one). It actually predicts an opposite trend, indicating thus the presence of mixed- mode retention mechanisms. Indeed it was found that, at organic-rich mobile phases, the transfer from the mobile to the stationary phase of the <b>polar</b> <b>moiety</b> of molecules drives retention. This finding has been correlated to the excess adsorption isotherm of acetonitrile/water binary mixtures and thus to the composition of the stationary phase.

Of the two betaine lipids, the {{homoserine}} lipid DGTS mainly contains 14 : 0 and 18 : 2 fatty acids, while the alanine lipid DGTA is enriched in 18 : 0, 18 : 2 and 22 : 5 fatty acids. Of the <b>polar</b> <b>moiety</b> of DGTA, improved NMR data are presented. On incubation of cells with [3, 4 - 14 C]methionine, DGTS {{as well as}} DGTA were labelled. With [1 - 14 C]methionine as a substrate, the label appeared in DGTS only. If double labelled [3 H](glycerol) /[14 C](polar part) DGTS {{was used as a}} precursor, radioactivity was incorporated specifically into DGTA in which the isotope ratio was unchanged compared to the precursor. Thus, the glyceryltrimethylhomoserine part of DGTS acts as the precursor of the polar group of DGTA. Labelling of cells with [1 - 14 C]oleate in a pulse-chase manner and subsequent analysis of the label in the fatty acids and molecular species of different lipids including DGTS and DGTA, suggested a clearly different role of the two betaine lipids: DGTS acts as a i) primary acceptor for exogenous C 18 monoene acid, ii) substrate for the desaturation of 18 : 1 to 18 : 2 acid, and iii) donor of mainly 18 : 2 fatty acid to be distributed among PE and other membrane lipids. Into DGTA, in contrast, fatty acids are introduced only after elongation and desaturation. As a result, the biosynthesis of DGTA from DGTS involves a decarboxylation and recarboxylation of the polar part and a simultaneous deacylation and reacylation of the glycerol moiet...|$|E
40|$|The title compound, catena-poly[[tetrakis(μ-decanoato- κ 2 O:O′) -diruthenium(II,III) (Ru - Ru) ]- μ-octanesulfonato-κ 2 O:O′], [Ru 2 (C 10 H 19 O 2) 4 (C 8 H 17 O 3 S) ], is an octanesulfonate {{derivative}} of the mixed-valence complex diruthenium tetradecanoate. The equatorial carboxylate ligands are bidentate, bridging two Ru atoms {{to form a}} dinuclear structure. Each of the two independent dinuclear metal complexes in the asymmetric unit is located at an inversion centre. The octanesulfonate anion bridges the two dinuclear units through axial coordination. The alkyl chains of the carboxylate and sulfonate ligands are arranged in a parallel manner. The global structure {{can be seen as}} infinite chains of <b>polar</b> <b>moieties</b> separated by a double layer of non-polar alkyl groups, without interdigitation of the alkyl chains.

40|$|One of the {{barriers}} {{to the development of}} protein therapeutics is effective delivery to mammalian cells. The proteins must maintain a careful balance of <b>polar</b> <b>moieties</b> to enable administration and distribution and hydrophobic character to minimize cell toxicity. Numerous strategies have been applied to this end, from appending additional cationic peptides to supercharging the protein itself, sometimes with limited success. Here we present a strategy that combines these methods, by equipping a protein with supercharged elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) tags. We monitored cellular uptake and cell viability for GFP reporter proteins outfitted with a range of ELP tags and demonstrated enhanced uptake that correlates with the number of positive charges, while maintaining remarkably low cytotoxicity and resistance to degradation in the cell. GFP uptake proceeded mainly through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and we observed GFP emission inside the cells over extended time (up to 48 h). Low toxicity combined with high molecular weights of the tag opens the way to simultaneously optimize cell uptake and pharmacokinetic parameters. Thus, cationic supercharged ELP tags show great potential to improve the therapeutic profile of protein drugs leading to more efficient and safer biotherapeutics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Functionalization of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powders of ~ 6 μm {{particle}} size {{is carried out}} using low-pressure 2. 45 GHz H 2, NH 3 microwave plasmas for various durations (2. 5, 10 h) to chemically modify their surface and alter their surface energy. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal that plasma treatment leads to significant defluorination (F/C atomic ratio of 1. 13 and 1. 30 for 10 h NH 3 and H 2 plasma treatments, respectively vs. 1. 86 for pristine PTFE), along with the incorporation of functional <b>polar</b> <b>moieties</b> on the surface, resulting in enhanced wettability. Analysis of temperature dependent XPS revealed a loss of surface moieties above 200 °C, however, the functional groups are not completely removable even at higher temperatures (> 300 °C), thus enabling the use of plasma treated PTFE powders as potential tribological fillers in high temperature engineering polymers. Ageing studies carried {{over a period of}} 12 months revealed that while the surface changes degenerate over time, again, they are not completely reversible. These functionalised PTFE powders can be further used for applications into smart, high performance materials such as tribological fillers for engineering polymers and bio-medical, bio-material applications...|$|R
