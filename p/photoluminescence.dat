5|$|Interactions between nanotubes, such as {{bundling}}, broaden optical lines. While bundling strongly affects <b>photoluminescence,</b> it {{has much}} weaker effect on optical absorption and Raman scattering. Consequently, sample {{preparation for the}} latter two techniques is relatively simple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Photoluminescence</b> from SWCNT, {{as well as}} optical {{absorption}} and Raman scattering, is linearly polarized along the tube axis. This allows monitoring of the SWCNTs orientation without direct microscopic observation.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and <b>photoluminescence,</b> but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolated}} split-interstitial {{moves through}} the diamond crystal during irradiation. When it meets other interstitials it aggregates into larger complexes of two and three split-interstitials, identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (R1 and O3 centers), optical absorption and <b>photoluminescence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or <b>photoluminescence</b> (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
5|$|Similar to <b>photoluminescence</b> mapping, {{the energy}} of the {{excitation}} light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} <b>photoluminescence.</b> Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The defects can be {{detected}} by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (<b>photoluminescence,</b> PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption {{of light in the}} infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and <b>photoluminescence</b> spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue <b>photoluminescence</b> has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in <b>photoluminescence</b> mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} use the N-V− centers is as a detector {{to measure the}} full mechanical stress tensor in {{the bulk of the}} crystal. For this application, the stress-induced splitting of the zero-phonon-line is exploited, and its polarization properties. A robust frequency-modulated radio receiver using the electron-spin-dependent <b>photoluminescence</b> that operated up to 350°C demonstrates the possibility for use in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|Two {{charge states}} of this defect, neutral N-V0 and {{negative}} N-V−, are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption, <b>photoluminescence</b> (PL), {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which {{can be viewed as}} a hybrid of PL and EPR; most details of the structure originate from EPR. A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Three of them covalently bond to the carbon atoms and two remain non-bonded and are called a lone pair. The vacancy has three unpaired electrons. Two of them make a quasi covalent bond and one remains unpaired. The overall symmetry, however, is axial (trigonal C3V); one can visualize this by imagining the three unpaired vacancy electrons continuously exchanging their roles.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the quantum optical applications, luminescence from the N-V− centers can be applied for imaging biological processes, such as fluid flow in living cells. This application relies on good compatibility of diamond nano-particles with the living cells and on favorable properties of <b>photoluminescence</b> from the N-V− centers (strong intensity, easy excitation and detection, temporal stability, etc.). Compared with large single-crystal diamonds, nanodiamonds are cheap (about 1 USD per gram) and available from various suppliers. N-V− centers are produced in diamond powders with sub-micrometre particle size using the standard process of irradiation and annealing described above. Those nanodiamonds are introduced in a cell, and their luminescence is monitored using a standard fluorescence microscope.|$|E
500|$|Excitons are {{apparently}} delocalized over several nanotubes in single chirality bundles as the <b>photoluminescence</b> spectrum displays a splitting consistent with intertube exciton tunneling.|$|E
500|$|Within {{materials}} science, {{the optical}} properties of carbon nanotubes refer {{specifically to the}} absorption, <b>photoluminescence</b> (fluorescence), and Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes. Spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non-destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes. There is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view: numerous parameters of the nanotube synthesis can be changed, intentionally or unintentionally, to alter the nanotube quality. As shown below, optical absorption, <b>photoluminescence</b> and Raman spectroscopies allow quick and reliable characterization of this [...] "nanotube quality" [...] in terms of non-tubular carbon content, structure (chirality) of the produced nanotubes, and structural defects. Those features determine nearly any other property, such as optical, mechanical, and electrical.|$|E
500|$|Platelets produce sharp {{absorption}} peaks at 1359–1375 and 330 cm−1 in IR absorption spectra; remarkably, {{the position}} of the first peak depends on the platelet size. As with dislocations, a broad <b>photoluminescence</b> centered at ~1000 nm was associated with platelets by direct observation in an electron microscope. By studying this luminescence, it was deduced that platelets have a [...] "bandgap" [...] of ~1.7 eV.|$|E
500|$|Isolated {{interstitial}} {{has never}} been observed in diamond and is considered unstable. Its interaction with a regular carbon lattice atom produces a [...] "split-interstitial", a defect where two carbon atoms share a lattice site and are covalently bonded with the carbon neighbors. This defect has been thoroughly characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (R2 center) and optical absorption, and unlike most other defects in diamond, it does not produce <b>photoluminescence.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Photoluminescence</b> is {{used for}} {{characterization}} purposes to measure the quantities of semiconducting nanotube species in a sample. [...] Nanotubes are isolated (dispersed) using an appropriate chemical agent ("dispersant") to reduce the intertube quenching. Then PL is measured, scanning both the excitation and emission energies and thereby producing a PL map. The ovals in the map define (S22,S11) pairs, which unique identify (n,m) index of a tube. The data of Weisman and Bachilo are conventionally used for the identification.|$|E
500|$|Numerous Ni-related defects {{have been}} {{detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and <b>photoluminescence,</b> both in synthetic and natural diamonds. Three major structures can be distinguished: substitutional Ni, nickel-vacancy and nickel-vacancy complex decorated {{by one or more}} substitutional nitrogen atoms. The [...] "nickel-vacancy" [...] structure, also called [...] "semi-divacancy" [...] is specific for most large impurities in diamond and silicon (e.g., tin in silicon). Its production mechanism is generally accepted as follows: large nickel atom incorporates substitutionally, then expels a nearby carbon (creating a neighboring vacancy), and shifts in-between the two sites.|$|E

2500|$|The nitrogen-vacancy center (N-V center) {{is one of}} {{numerous}} point defects in diamond. [...] Its most explored and useful property is <b>photoluminescence,</b> which can be easily detected from an individual N-V center, {{especially those in the}} negative charge state (N-V−). Electron spins at N-V centers, localized at atomic scales, can be manipulated at room temperature by applying a magnetic field, electric field, microwave radiation or light, or a combination, resulting in sharp resonances in the intensity and wavelength of the <b>photoluminescence.</b> These resonances can be explained in terms of electron spin related phenomena such as quantum entanglement, spin-orbit interaction and Rabi oscillations, [...] and analysed using advanced quantum optics theory.
