She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields.

6000|$|Nor is it only by {{the theft}} of {{impressions}} that we suffer {{at the hands of}} these English discoverers of America. It {{is a part of the}} system also that we have to submit to being lectured to by our talented visitors. It is now quite understood that as soon as an English literary man finishes a book he is rushed across to America to tell the people of the United States and Canada all about it, and how he came to write it. At home, in his own country, they don't care how he came to write it. He's written it and that's enough. But in America it is different. One month after the distinguished author's book on The Boyhood of Botticelli has appeared in London, he is seen to land in New York very quietly out of one of the back portholes of the Olympic. That same afternoon you will find him in an armchair in one of the big hotels giving off impressions of America to a group of reporters.

It consists of all the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they have to go because they know all about Botticelli and all the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they have to go because they don't know anything about Botticelli.

Then he turns round, labels his lecture [...] "Botticelli the Man", and rakes it all back again. All the way across the continent and back he emits impressions, estimates of national character, and surveys of American genius. He sails from New York in a blaze of publicity, with his cordon of reporters round him, and a month later publishes his book [...] "America as I Saw It". It is widely read--in America.|$|E

6000|$|Jesus {{went beyond}} it very rapidly, {{according}} to Matthew. Though, like John, {{he became an}} itinerant preacher, he departed widely from John's manner of life. John went into the wilderness, not into the synagogues; and his baptismal font was the river Jordan. He was an ascetic, clothed in skins and living on locusts and wild honey, practising a savage austerity. He courted martyrdom, and met it {{at the hands of}} Herod. Jesus saw no merit either in asceticism or martyrdom. In contrast to John he was essentially a highly-civilized, cultivated person. According to Luke, he pointed out the contrast himself, chaffing the Jews for complaining that John must be possessed by the devil because he was a teetotaller and vegetarian, whilst, because Jesus was neither one nor the other, they reviled him as a gluttonous man and a winebibber, the friend of the officials and their mistresses. He told straitlaced disciples that they would have trouble enough from other people without making any for themselves, and that they should avoid martyrdom and enjoy themselves whilst they had the chance. [...] "When they persecute you in this city," [...] he says, [...] "flee into the next." [...] He preaches in the synagogues and in the open air indifferently, just as they come. He repeatedly says, [...] "I desire mercy and not sacrifice," [...] meaning evidently to clear himself of the inveterate superstition that suffering is gratifying to God. [...] "Be not, as the Pharisees, of a sad countenance," [...] he says. He is convivial, feasting with Roman officials and sinners. He is careless of his person, and is remonstrated with for not washing his hands before sitting down to table. The followers of John the Baptist, who fast, and who expect to find the Christians greater ascetics than themselves, are disappointed at finding that Jesus and his twelve friends do not fast; and Jesus tells them that they should rejoice in him instead of being melancholy. He is jocular and tells them they will all have as much fasting as they want soon enough, whether they like it or not. He is not afraid of disease, and dines with a leper. A woman, apparently to protect him against infection, pours a costly unguent on his head, and is rebuked because what it cost might have been given to the poor. He poohpoohs that lowspirited view, and says, as he said when he was reproached for not fasting, that the poor are always there to be helped, but that he is not there to be anointed always, implying that you should never lose a chance of being happy when there is so much misery in the world. He breaks the Sabbath; is impatient of conventionality when it is uncomfortable or obstructive; and outrages the feelings of the Jews by breaches of it. He is apt to accuse <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way of hypocrisy. Like the late Samuel Butler, he regards disease as a department of sin, and on curing a lame man, says [...] "Thy sins are forgiven" [...] instead of [...] "Arise and walk," [...] subsequently maintaining, when the Scribes reproach him for assuming power to forgive sin as well as to cure disease, that the two come to the same thing. He has no modest affectations, and claims to be greater than Solomon or Jonah. When reproached, as Bunyan was, for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables, he justifies himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught. He is, in short, what we should call an artist and a Bohemian in his manner of life.|$|E

40|$|We have interviewed {{nineteen}} {{men with}} a history of problem drug use, about the effects of amphetamines and heroin on their sexuality and their intimate partner relations during and after the drug abuse. We also focus on how the experience of treatment affects thoughts about sexuality and sexual patterns of action afterwards. The theoretical foundation of this study is Patrick Biernacki’s (1986) model of the recovery process and John H. Gagnon and William Simon’s (2004) theory of sexual scripts, both of which are rooted in symbolic interactionism. The interviews confirm the impression from previous research that there is a tangible link between amphetamine and sex, while heroin addiction generally causes reduced sexual interest. A key finding of our study is that people leaving a problematic drug use often experience sexual problems in their new existence. The treatment that they have participated in has not given them the tools in the form of new sexual script to handle sexual situations, whether they are related to sexual experiences during the drug abuse or are of a more universal nature, connected with {{the ups and downs of}} the sexual desire that is part of the course of life for most <b>people.</b> Men <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> using drugs improves their sex life could be at greater risk of relapse. However, even for those who have a stable abstinence, sexual problems can lead to reduced quality of life. Our conclusion is that sexuality, not least as a positive part of life, should play a greater part in the emotional processing of drug treatment...|$|R

40|$|Humiliation {{is viewed}} as an {{emotional}} experience. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> humiliated believe <b>that</b> others, by acting in certain ways, have diminished them as persons. The result {{is a sense of}} powerlessness, of having been deceived, used, degraded, or rejected. They see themselves as having been objectified, often with malice. “Typically, humiliation occurs within relationships of unequal power where the humiliator has power over the victim. While a humiliator may be emboldened by feelings of power, a victim of humiliation will feel degraded, confused, powerless, paralyzed, ostracized, violated, or assaulted. ” (Hartling & Luchetta, 1999) Humiliation comes into play when a victim “a) suffers from actions of an Other(s) intended to inflict harm; b) is forced by those actions to participate in the violation of core moral standards; and c) is forced to suffer, and violate these norms in a public space where their suffering, as well as their (forced) participation in the violation of core moral standards, is witnessed by Others. Together these three components are critical to the production of humiliation. ” (Cobb) As Cobb points out, humiliation does not occur in isolation. It is a sense of being that grows out of specific relationships. This suggests that a social constructionist approach is beneficial as we seek to better understand how the experience of humiliation is created in relationships, particularly in conversation. Social constructionism views social reality as being in process...|$|R

But if all people are born with potential to be musical, why is it that some people embrace their musicality while others refuse to acknowledge it? The purpose of this research was to develop an understanding of why some people consider themselves to be musical while others do not, and where the colloquial definition of musical comes from. The present study was conducted in two phases: Phase One entailed an online survey that was distributed to 840 participants; Phase Two entailed interviews with ten survey participants who were selected based upon their diverse responses to the survey questions. Prevailing themes from both phases of the study indicated that to be considered musical, a person must be musically engaged, with the most salient ways of musical engagement being listening to music, playing an instrument, or singing. Findings also suggested that for almost all people, whether they believe they are musical or not, music {{is an important part of}} everyday life. Music Educatio...|$|R
