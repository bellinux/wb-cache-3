500|$|Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an {{enormous}} and hostile press storm. [...] "To {{say there was}} an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," [...] the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as [...] "a white black man" [...] and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had [...] "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he [...] "may not be welcomed anywhere by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> justice is bigger than even sport". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had [...] "never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see why I should start now". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' [...] "calm dignity {{in response to the}} primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".|$|E

The release of their manifesto stated that “the Mozilla project is a global community of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> openness, innovation and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet.” A two-page ad in the edition of December 16 of the New York Times, placed by Mozilla Foundation in coordination with Spread Firefox, featured {{the names of the}} thousands of people worldwide who contributed to the Mozilla Foundation's fundraising campaign to support the launch of the Firefox 1.0 web browser. SFX portal enhanced the [...] "Get Firefox" [...] button program, giving users [...] "referrer points" [...] as an incentive. The site lists the top 250 referrers. From time to time, the SFX team or SFX members launch marketing events organized at the Spread Firefox website. As a part of the Spread Firefox campaign, there was an attempt to break the world download record with the release of Firefox 3. This resulted in an official certified Guinness world record, with over eight million downloads. In February 2011, Mozilla announced that it would be retiring Spread Firefox (SFX). Three months later, in May 2011, Mozilla officially closed Spread Firefox.

30|$|The {{validation}} of the MVS on {{a representative sample of}} Croatian citizens showed two- instead of three-factor solution. One dimension was labeled as Happiness as it captured beliefs that owing material goods and being able to acquire them leads to happiness, and another as Centrality/Success, capturing the <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> possessions are important for personal gratification. By the rated level of Happiness we suggest that perceptions of materialism in Croatian society may be different from the perception of materialism in societies that are more well off. The belief that owing material goods and being able to acquire them leads to happiness among Croatian citizens might not reflect materialistic values per se, but rather the expression of economic deprivation and inability to fulfill basic financial security. When examining the relationships between two MVS dimensions and well-being variables, it turned out that Happiness dimension was significantly related to life satisfaction, positive and negative affect, while Centrality/Success was significantly related only to positive affect. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> owing material goods leads to happiness experienced lower levels of life satisfaction and positive affect, and higher levels of negative affect. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> possessions are important for personal gratification experienced higher levels of positive affect.

One inevitably {{thinks of the}} old {{question}} thus travestied, when one reads, in the fifth edition, revised and augmented, of Monsieur Funck-Brentano's L'Affaire du Collier,[10] the familiar story of Jeanne de Valois, of Cardinal Rohan, and of the fatal diamond necklace. Jeanne de Valois might have sat, though she probably did not, for Becky Sharp. Her early poverty, her pride {{in the blood of}} Valois, recall Becky's youth, and her boasts about 'the blood of the Montmorencys.' Jeanne had her respectable friends, as Becky had the Sedleys; like Becky, she imprudently married a heavy, unscrupulous young officer; her expedients for living on nothing a year were exactly those of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley; her personal charms, her fluent tongue, her good nature, even, were those of that accomplished lady. Finally she has her Marquis of Steyne in the wealthy, luxurious Cardinal de Rohan; she robs him to a tune beyond the dreams of Becky, and, incidentally, she drags to the dust the royal head of the fairest and most unhappy of queens. Even now there seem to be <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Marie Antoinette was guilty, that she cajoled the Cardinal, and robbed him of the diamonds, fateful as the jewels of Eriphyle.|$|E
