In this paper we investigate how the innovation-productivity relationship differs across various subbranches of the service sector. For the analysis we use the CDM structural model consisting of equations for innovation expenditures, innovation output, productivity and exports. We use data from the community innovation surveys for Estonia. We show that innovation is associated with increased productivity in the service sector. The results indicate surprisingly that the effect of innovation on productivity is stronger in the less knowledge-intensive service sectors, despite the lower frequency of innovative activities and the results of earlier literature. Non-technological innovation only plays a positive role in some specifications, despite its expected importance especially among the service firms.

Our empirical study is guided by a theoretical model which introduces taxes into Foellmi and Oechslin's (2007) general equilibrium model of non-collusive corruption. In this model perceived corruption influences people's preferences for redistribution through two channels. On the one hand it undermines trust in government, which reduces people's support for redistribution. On the other hand, more corruption decreases own wealth relative to average wealth of below-average-wealth individuals leading to a higher demand for redistribution. Thus, the effect of perceived corruption on redistribution cannot be signed a priori.

Evidence from animal models has implicated SK/IK channels in neurological conditions such as ataxia and alcohol use disorders. Further, genome-wide association {{studies have suggested that}} cardiovascular abnormalities such as arrhythmias and hypertension are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms that occur within the genes encoding the SK/IK channels. The Ca 2 + sensitivity of the SK/IK channels stems from a constitutively bound Ca 2 +-binding protein: calmodulin.

Negative and Dual Channel TITO converters are also presented. In steady state one of the PCTITO outputs is positive while the other is negative. Although the outputs could be regulated to provide dif-ferent absolute values, an interesting application of the new converters is to provide symmetrical outputs (i. e., 15 V) to supply balanced loads. Since the absolute value of the outputs could be greater or smaller than the input voltage, the PCTITO con-verter will be suitable for present 14 V (from 9 to 16 V) or for future 42 V (from 30 to 50 V) automotive voltage distribution buses. To regulate the outputs, two in-phase equal-switching frequency PWM-based multivariable control loops have been designed. The closed-loop system must provide low audiosusceptibility and good line and load regulation at both outputs. In addition, the common mode voltage between the two outputs that could appear in unbalanced load operation has to be minimized...|$|E

This paper addresses the general structure of the incompatibility of completely <b>positive</b> <b>channels</b> with a fixed quantum input space and with general outcome operator algebras. We define a compatibility relation for such channels by identifying the composite outcome space as the maximal (projective) C^∗-tensor product of outcome algebras. We show theorems that characterize this compatibility relation in terms of the concatenation and conjugation of channels, generalizing the recent result for channels with quantum outcome spaces. These results are applied to the positive operator valued measures (POVMs) by identifying each of them with the corresponding quantum-classical (QC) channel. We also give a characterization of the maximality of a POVM with respect to the post-processing preorder in terms of the conjugate channel of the QC channel. We consider another definition of compatibility of normal channels by identifying the composite outcome space with the normal tensor product of the outcome von Neumann algebras. We prove that for a given normal channel the class of normally compatible channels is upper bounded by a special class of channels called tensor conjugate channels. We show the inequivalence of the C^∗- and normal compatibility relations for QC channels, which originates from the possibility and impossibility of copying operations for commutative von Neumann algebras in C^∗- and normal compatibility relations, respectively.

This research examined the determinants of current account imbalance in global economy where, two econometric techniques to find the determinants empirically: first, difference GMM dynamic panel and, second, system GMM dynamic panel estimators. This study is specially designed to deal with the key problems of the past literature of the global current account imbalance, for instance omitted variable bias, endogeneity and simultaneity bias originating from unobserved country-specific effects. As a robustness check, this paper also used the same techniques with adjusted variables. The both results present the same story; the exogenous determinants have a strong impact on current account balance. In particular, current account balance has positive link with commodity price real GDP growth and trade openness in emerging economies, whereas negative link in developed economies. In contrast, it has a significant negative channel with net foreign assets, real effective exchange rate and exchange rate stability in terms of emerging economies and, on the other hand, a <b>positive</b> <b>channel</b> with these variables except real effective exchange rate.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} soft {{ionization}} aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), bipolar near-infrared laser desorption/ionization AMS (BP-NIR-LDI-AMS), {{has been developed}} for the on-line, real-time analysis of organic aerosols. Use of a single NIR laser pulse to desorb/ionize aerosols deposited onto an aluminum probe results in minimal analyte fragmentation to produce exclusively intact pseudomolecular ions at [M–H]^− for acidic organic analytes and [M+H]^+ for basic organic analytes. Incorporation of a bipolar mass spectrometer with the NIR-LDI source enables simultaneous detection of acidic and basic species in organic particles. Limits of detection (total particulate mass sampled) for amino acids common to the organic fraction of atmospheric aerosols ranged from 69. 1 pg for ornithine to 197 pg for serine on the <b>positive</b> <b>channel,</b> and from 17. 0 pg for glycine to 100 pg for ornithine on the negative channel.

For acidic aerosol species, sensitivity was found to increase as a function of analyte acidity, while for basic species, [M+H]^+ ion signals were detected only {{in the presence of a}} labile proton source, with the intensity of the ion signals scaling with the acidity of the proton source.
