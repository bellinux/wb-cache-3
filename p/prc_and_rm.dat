40|$|We {{tested a}} novel hypothesis, {{generated}} from representational accounts of medial temporal lobe (MTL) function, {{that the major}} white matter tracts converging on perirhinal cortex (<b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> hippocampus (HC) would be differentially involved in face and scene perception, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging was applied in healthy participants alongside an odd-one-out paradigm sensitive to <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC lesions in animals and humans. Microstructure of inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, connecting occipital and ventro-anterior temporal lobe, including <b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> fornix (the main HC input/output pathway) correlated with accuracy on odd-one-out judgements involving faces and scenes, respectively. Similarly, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC, elicited during oddity judgements, was correlated with face and scene oddity performance, respectively. We also observed associations between ILF and fornix microstructure and category-selective BOLD response in <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC, respectively. These striking three-way associations highlight functionally dissociable, structurally instantiated MTL neurocognitive networks for complex face and scene perception...|$|R

To this end, we define novel matching rules for SM <b>and</b> <b>RM,</b> respectively, that is, every SM decision is made based on intermediate <b>RM</b> results, <b>and</b> vice versa, such that SM <b>and</b> <b>RM</b> can be performed alternately. The quality of integration is guaranteed by a Matching Likelihood Estimation model and the control of semantic drift, which prevent the effect of mismatch magnification. To reduce the computational cost, we design an index structure based on q-grams and a greedy search algorithm that can reduce around 90 percent overhead of the interaction. Extensive experiments on three data collections show that the combination and interaction between SM <b>and</b> <b>RM</b> significantly outperforms previous works that conduct SM <b>and</b> <b>RM</b> separately...|$|R

40|$|The fifth {{increased}} branching ramosus (rms) mutant, rms 5, from pea (Pisum sativum), {{is described}} here for phenotype and grafting responses {{with four other}} rms mutants. Xylem sap zeatin riboside concentration and shoot auxin levels in rms 5 plants have also been compared with <b>rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> wild type (WT). <b>Rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Rms</b> 5 appear to act closely at the biochemical or cellular level to control branching, because branching was inhibited in reciprocal epicotyl grafts between rms 5 or <b>rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> WT plants, but not inhibited in reciprocal grafts between <b>rms</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>rms</b> 1 seedlings. The weakly transgressive or slightly additive phenotype of the rms 1 rms 5 double mutant provides further evidence for this interaction. Like rms 1, rms 5 rootstocks have reduced xylem sap cytokinin concentrations, <b>and</b> <b>rms</b> 5 shoots do not appear deficient in indole- 3 -acetic acid or 4 -chloroindole- 3 -acetic acid. <b>Rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Rms</b> 5 are similar in their interaction with other Rms genes. Reciprocal grafting studies with rms 1, <b>rms</b> 2, <b>and</b> <b>rms</b> 5, together {{with the fact that}} root xylem sap cytokinin concentrations are reduced in <b>rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>rms</b> 5 <b>and</b> elevated in <b>rms</b> 2 plants, indicates that <b>Rms</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Rms</b> 5 may control a different pathway than that controlled by Rms 2.

40|$|Traditional {{anatomical}} {{studies of}} the parahippocampal region (PHR) defined the lateral portion into two subregions, the perirhinal (<b>PRC)</b> <b>and</b> parahippocampal (PHC) cortices. Based on this organization, several models suggested that the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> the PHC play different roles in memory through connections with different memory-related brain networks. To identify the key components of the human PHR, we used a well accepted connection-based parcellation method on two independent datasets. Our parcellation divided the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> PHC into three subregions, specifically, the rostral PRC, caudal <b>PRC</b> (PRCc), <b>and</b> PHC. The connectivity profile for each subregion showed that the rostral PRC {{was connected to the}} anterior temporal (AT) system and the PHC was connected to the posterior medial (PM) system. The transition area (PRCc) integrated the AT-PM systems. These results suggest that the lateral PHR not only contains functionally segregated subregions, but also contains a functionally integrated subregion...|$|R
