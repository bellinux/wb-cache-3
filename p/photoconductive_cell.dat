(2) Decrease in dark impedance of the cell due to the gamma-ray irradiation shows only a slight recovery. (3) Value of the activation energy is changed by the gamma-ray irradiation. (4) Dark current is increased, photocurrent is decreased and time constant is also decreased. Increase in dark current is due to the decrease in dark impedance of the cell, and shows little recovery.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Thermal {{expansion}} {{is one of}} the most frequently measured physical properties of materials. One of the important methods of detecting and measuring these changes is dilatometry, which is measuring the thermal expansion of the specimen and relating the specimen's expansion to its temperature. Four major types of dilatometers are commonly used: The precision micrometric method, the Fizeau-Pulfrich interferometric dilatometer, the quartz tube and dial indicator apparatus, and the autographic optical lever method. These methods have various shortcomings and are not particularly suited for high temperature application. The development of the laser, which provided a high intensity monochromatic light source, prompted the investigation of interferometric configurations as a dilatometer technique. The interferometer has distinct advantages over other systems in that the measurement is absolute, that is, calibration is not needed as measurements are made directly in terms of a wavelength of light and are relatively contactless in nature. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the feasibility of a dilatometer using an interferometric configuration with a gas laser light source and to construct a working model interferometers characteristically break a light beam into two wave trains which, when reunited, will interfere if a phase shift has occurred. The dilatometer configuration developed suspends the specimen in the center of a one inch by eight inch long tantalum heating element such that the specimen is contained in one of the beams of the interferometer, As the specimen changes length, the path containing the specimen changes length, causing a change in the point of interference. The interference bands are counted as they pass in front of a <b>photoconductive</b> <b>cell</b> orifice. The only direct contact between the specimen and the dilatometer is at the supporting wires. The feasibility of using an interferometric configuration utilizing the polished ends of the specimen has been demonstrated by various experiments, one of which was to produce fringes at 1, 000 °C using a polished steel specimen. Various experiments using a Michelson interferometer and a gas laser produced clear, stable fringes which could be easily counted. Preliminary measurements have been made to 500 °F with the dilatometer. The specimen and support system were heated to 1, 000 °C for one hour. The performance of the vacuum system and the cooling system was satisfactory. Subsequent inspection of the support system, etc., showed that it was undamaged. Calculations indicate an upper limit of the present configuration with the particular laser light source to be about 1, 800 °C. Preliminary data indicate the accuracy of the apparatus to be about five per cent compared to a probable accuracy for an improved model of about two per cent. The dilatometer measurement errors can be grouped in optical errors, errors due to differential thermal expansion in the apparatus, and readout errors. Most of the errors are independent of the coefficient of expansion of the specimen; thus, the percentage error will be largely determined by the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material measured. All of the errors except the errors due to the movement of the specimen and its support system can be reduced or eliminated by proper design and use of materials which have low coefficients of thermal expansion. Movement of the specimen causes a series of second order errors, estimated in the aggregate to be less than twenty millionths of an inch per 100 °C. The use of the gas laser light source in an interferometric configuration for dilatometry is feasible and has definite high temperature potential. A working model has been built and some preliminary measurement capability demonstrated...|$|E

Since a high stability in use is essential for successful application of CdS photoconductors and solar cells, {{one of the main}} aims of the research has been to investigate the optically induced processes which lead to the degradation of the efficiency of CdS photosensitive devices. Using the technique of thermally stimulated currents on CdS : C 1 crystals doped with monovalent and bivalent copper ions, we have shown that optically induced degradation of photoconductivity in CdS : C 1 rods doped with Cu(^++) ions occurs in conjunction with a reduction in the density of shallow traps, and the simultaneous formation of deep traps. In contrast, optical illumination does not have any deleterious effect on CdS : C 1 samples doped with Cu ions.

The effects of ageing on such properties as the short circuit photoresponse, the C-V characteristics and the I-V characteristics of the diodes were investigated.

40|$|Cadmium sulfide and cadmium {{selenide}} are important materials for {{applications such as}} <b>photoconductive</b> <b>cells,</b> photovoltaic cells and other electrooptical devices. Generally, these devices use single crystals. However, reasonable efficiencies have been observed by using polycrystalline films on conducting substrates, which are easier to make and provide considerable savings on materials and energy. Polycrystalline CdS/CdSe films {{have been made by}} sputtering and solution spraying, compound evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, and many others. A recent technique involves the electrochemical deposition of CdS and CdSe from nonaqueous solvents. Preparation of these films is based upon the cathodic deposition from a nonaqueous solution of a cadmium salt and elemental sulfur and/or selenium. Although the technique is simple, no mechanistic information is known to optimize the conditions in which films of controlled stoichiometry, doping and crystallinity are made. This research has the purpose to understand the mechanism of the formation of polycrystalline films of CdS and CdSe by electrochemical deposition in dimethylsulfoxide. This approach to the problem makes use of electrochemical techniques such as rotating ring disc electrode, linear scan voltammetry, high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet and electrochemical detection. By the rotating ring disc electrode technique, we have studied the kinetic parameters for the reduction of sulfur, selenium, cadmium, and the electroChemical formation of CdS and CdSe for temperatures from 25 - lOO°C. The results show that rates of initie. l electron transfer for the reduction of these species are moderately rapid, and secondly, that the reverse reaction is irreversible and involves additional steps. Studies of solubility of selenium with temperature reveal that its solubility is enhanced by the addition of sulfur. Understanding the electrochemical behavior of sulfur-selenium mixtures is of great importance to produce mixed semiconductive films with more adequate bandgaps for use with solar spectrum.

40|$|The present {{communication}} {{is a response}} to renewed interest in nanostructure based "coupled compounds", like ZnO-MeX (where Me = Cd, Pb, [...] . and X = S, Se) which can find extensive use in the fabrication of a number of solid state devices, such as <b>photoconductive,</b> solar <b>cells,</b> electroluminescent cells, photocatalysts. Various oxide semiconductors, like TiO 2 and ZnO, are known to have appropriate properties for these applications, although there are some drawbacks associated with their use: (i) charge carrier recombination occurs within a few nanoseconds, (ii) band edge absorption threshold does not allow the utilization of visible light. One of the main approaches to overcome these particular limitations involves the contact of the semiconductor particle with another semiconductor, called "sensitizer". For example, this is the case of nanostructured ZnO particles combined with metal chalcogenides. Infact it is known that in these coupled systems the absorption threshold is extended to the visible region and the photogenerated electrons are quickly transferred from sulphide/selenide layer into to the lower lying conduction band of ZnO, thus limiting recombination effects. In order to produce this type of material we have combined ZnO nanoparticles, in the specific "tetrapod" morphology, with nanoparticles of metal chalcogenides. The main innovative aspects of the preparation procedure are the following: &# 61485;	the use of appropriate organic solvents to keep both ZnO and the formed metal chalcogenides completely suspended and dispersed in the liquid; &# 61485;	an in situ direct formation of metal chalcogenides keeping pH value in the range 6 - 8 (no use of ammonia salt or complexing agents); &# 61485;	the limited use of chemical reagents, i. e. only metal and sulphur/selenium precursors are involved; &# 61485;	the possibility to deposit the "coupled compounds" in form of thin films directly from the liquid suspension onto the substrates (silicon, alumina, glass, TCO layers, etc.).

40|$|Interactions {{of light}} and {{electricity}} within matter have been known and studied {{for quite a long}} time. However, a systematic exploration of many relations among optical and electronic phenomena has a more recent history. Solid state optoelectronics is concerned with the technological exploitation of these relations. Photoconductivity studies illuminate the internal electronic processes in semiconductors and helps in the development of highly sensitive materials and devices. Photoconductivity is the increase in electrical conductivity of a material due to adsorption of radiation by it. Materials with special imperfections incorporated during preparation, give large signals. Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide are the II – VI compound semiconductors which are useful in the visible and near infrared range. For low levels of illumination (<= 301 x), cadmium sulphide is sluggish in response (response time 100 v m. sec.) while cadmium selenide has a faster response under similar conditions (30 m. sec.). Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide form a continuous series of substitution solid solutions and it is reasonable to expect some of these solid solutions might exhibit a broader spectral sensitivity coupled with faster response. Of the various methods available for the preparation of II – VI compound semiconductor layers, sintering of screen printed layers is, by far, the most flexible and inexpensive method for large scale preparation of highly sensitive layers. No systematic studies are reported on sintered cadmium sulphoselenide layers, though quite a large numbers of patents and reports on these for specific purposes are available besides some published literature. Systematic studies on the preparation of photoconductive grade CdS and CdSe powders and sensitization and sintering of these powders to obtain optimum photosensitivity stability have been made. Analyses of the powders and sintered layers by AAS, polarography and EPMA as well as X-ray characterization for true solid solution formation have been made. The effect of various electrode materials like indium, silver, graphite, cadmium oxide and copper are examined and the effect of diffusion of the corresponding ions into the photoconductive layers on the current-voltage behavior both in the dark illumination are examined in detail. The optoelectronics properties like spectral distribution of sensitivity with composition, lux-ampere characterization and response time studies have been measured and correlated. An attempt has been made {{for the first time in}} the case of sintered layers to further enhance the sensitivity CdSxSe(1 -x) layers, by several methods, where such high sensitivity is called for, in specific applications. The possibility of using these CdSxSe(1 -x) layers in sintered CdSxSe(1 -x) : Cu 2 S/Cu 2 Se and CdSxSe(1 -x) : Tl 2 S photovoltaic solar cells has also been examined. <b>Photoconductive</b> CdSxSe(1 -x) <b>cells</b> will continue the interest of the solid state scientists and future applications may include image intensifiers and image storage panels in solar energy conversion and in electro photography.

40|$|Design and {{development}} of electronic devices based on organic semiconductors requires knowledge of the electronic conduction processes that occur within these solids. In this thesis the structural, optical and electrical properties of nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) are investigated. In particular, various electrical properties of NiPc were studied (to the best of author's knowledge for the first time) in situ employing a fabrication and characterisation method developed in-house for this particular purpose. Films deposited onto quartz substrates, maintained at room temperature, were identified by X-ray diffractometry {{to be of the}} #alpha#-form. Optical studies of absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) spectrum of the same films showed the existence of two absorption bands. The absorption maxima in the Vis and UV were identified as the Q and Soret band, respectively, and were both attributed to #pi##->##pi#"* transition. Analysis of optical data yielded a value of 2. 32 eV for the optical energy band gap (E_g"O). The dark current-voltage characteristics at fixed temperatures, and the variation of current as a function of temperature at constant bias levels, have also been established. Results were analysed in the framework of band theory to elucidate various electronic parameters. The dark conductivity of NiPc films was found to be strongly dependent upon the type of metal contacts, electric field and ambient conditions. For symmetric gold electrodes, ohmic behaviour at low-voltages and space charge limited conduction (SCLC) at higher-voltages, were identified. The latter, was found to be controlled by an exponential trap distribution above the valence band edge. A number of electronic parameters, namely, relative permittivity (#epsilon#_r), hole mobility (#mu#), activation energies (E_A), thermally generated hole concentrations (p_ 0), concentration of traps per unit energy range at the valence band edge (P_ 0), characteristic temperature parameter of trap distribution (T_t) and total trap concentrations (N_t) were obtained. Dark conductivity of NiPc was found to increase upon exposure to dry air. Schottky-type junction formation between NiPc and low work function metal contacts, such as, aluminium (Al), lead (Pb) and indium (In), was investigated under vacuum and dry air ambient at various temperature regimes. Potential barrier height and depletion region width, were determined for several contacts. The AC electrical properties of NiPc films utilising gold electrodes were also studied over the frequency range of 20 - 10 " 6 Hz at various temperature regimes. AC conductivity was identified to be via a hopping-type mechanism in the lower temperature region and via a free-band conduction in the high temperature region. Dependence of capacitance and loss tangent on frequency were consistent with the equivalent circuit model of Goswami and Goswami (1971). C-V measurements obtained for devices incorporating symmetric gold electrodes confirmed the ohmic nature of the contact. In the presence of a Schottky contact C-V measurements yielded various junction parameters of interest. The photovoltaic (PV) properties of a novel single layer Schottky type solar cell consisting of Au/NiPc/Pb were also studied for the first time by means of current-voltage and steady-state <b>photoconductive</b> measurements. The <b>cell</b> was found to produce a measurable photocurrent upon illumination with white light through the semitransparent top Pb electrode. A drastic improvement in the cell's performance was observed upon exposure to dry air for prolonged periods of time.
