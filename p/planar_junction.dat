40|$|Josephson {{effect in}} a planar {{graphene}} junction is studied by {{assuming that the}} coupling of a graphene sheet and two superconductors deposited on its top is described by a tunneling Hamiltonian. This model properly takes account of the proximity effect characteristic to a <b>planar</b> <b>junction,</b> and allows us to treat monolayer and bilayer cases in a parallel manner. Applying a quasiclassical Green's function approach to it we analyze the Josephson critical current I_ c in a short-junction limit. As a characteristic feature of the <b>planar</b> <b>junction</b> we find that I_ c is a concave function of temperature at the strong coupling limit while it crosses over to a convex function with decreasing the coupling strength. We also find different chemical-potential dependences of I_ c in the monolayer and bilayer cases. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|Although the pairing {{mechanism}} in MgB 2 {{is thought to}} be phonon mediated, there are still many experimental results that lack appropriate explanation. For example, there is no consensus about the magnitude of the energy gap, its temperature dependence, and whether it has only one-gap or not. Many techniques have been used to investigate this, like Raman spectroscopy, far-infrared transmission, specific heat, high-resolution photoemission and tunneling. Most tunneling data on MgB 2 are obtained from mechanical junctions. Measurements of energy gap by these junctions have many disadvantages like the instability to temperature and field changes. On the other hand, sandwich-like <b>planar</b> <b>junctions</b> offer a stable and reliable measurement for temperature dependence of the energy gap, where any variation in the tunneling spectra can be interpreted as a direct result from the sample under study. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first energy gap temperature-and magnetic field-dependence of MgB 2 /Pb <b>planar</b> <b>junctions.</b> Study of the temperature-dependence shows that the small gap value (reported by man...|$|R

40|$|A {{standard}} procedure for {{the determination of}} the minority carrier diffusion length by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) consists in scanning across an angle-lapped surface of a P-N junction and measuring the resultant short circuit current I sub sc as a function of beam position. A detailed analysis of the I sub sc originating from this configuration is presented. It is found that, for a point source excitation, the I sub sc depends very simply on x, the variable distance between the surface and the junction edge. The expression for the I sub sc of a <b>planar</b> <b>junction</b> device is well known. If d, the constant distance between the plane of the surface of the semiconductor and the junction edge in the expression for the I of a <b>planar</b> <b>junction</b> is merely replaced by x, the variable distance of the corresponding angle-lapped junction, an expression results which is correct to within a small fraction of a percent as long as the angle between the surfaces, 2 theta sub 1, is smaller than 10 deg...|$|E
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of multiple superconducting condensates in a material {{gives rise to}} intriguing phenomena, such as the possible presence of number-phase fluctuations. In this work, tunnel junctions were fabricated, aiming {{for the detection of}} such phenomena. <b>Planar</b> <b>junctions</b> with normal conducting and superconducting counter-electrodes have been realized. It was found from spectroscopic investigations that the MgO barrier used for the <b>planar</b> <b>junctions</b> is not ideal. To optimize for the two-band behaviour of MgB 2, ab-plane ramp-type MgB 2 tunnel junctions were fabricated. The use of Al 2 O 3 barriers substantially improved the homogeneity of the junctions, as was concluded from the nearly ideal magnetic field dependence of the critical current and excellent scaling of the junction properties with the junction widths. The current–voltage characteristics show clear Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation. However, the spectrum showed a degradation of the MgB 2 in the ramp region and the signature of the σ-gap was absent. For tunnel junction spectroscopy in the ab-direction and the detection of new, two-band related modes, the fabrication process still has to be further optimized. ...|$|R

The sandwiches are a-axis oriented. Out of these, single junctions were etched, planarized with CeO/sub 2 /. Finally gold contacts were sputtered. The junctions are squares of size 20 /spl times/ 20 to 100 /spl times/ 100 /spl mu/m/sup 2 /.

The T/sub c/ of a single film is about 62 K; by using a template layer up to 78 K can be reached. For α-axis oriented growth not only a reduction of the deposition temperature is important, but also the growth rate must be high enough. Best results were obtained at rates higher than 150 nm/h.

The (001) oriented Fe/vacuum/Cr <b>planar</b> <b>junction</b> serves as model junction. Even though the conduction electrons of antiferromagnetic Cr are spin-degenerate, it is possible to observe magnetoresistance due to two mechanisms: Firstly, the surface magnetism of Cr creates a spin-dependent potential barrier, and secondly, exchange-split surface states and resonances result in a tunneling conductance which depends on the relative orientation of the Fe and Cr magnetizations. Spin-dependent tunneling between a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet happens frequently in tunneling setups such as in spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy or magnetic tunnel junctions for magnetic random access memory...|$|E
