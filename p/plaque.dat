5|$|In 1939, {{the group}} E Clampus Vitus {{commissioned}} and dedicated a <b>plaque</b> commemorating Emperor Norton's {{call for the}} construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group's intention was that the <b>plaque</b> be placed on the newly opened San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge itself. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however; and, sometime shortly after World War II, the <b>plaque</b> was installed at the Cliff House. In the 1990s, the <b>plaque</b> was moved to the Transbay Terminal. When the Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010, as part of the project to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, the <b>plaque</b> was placed in storage, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} <b>plaque,</b> which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of <b>plaque</b> and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most <b>plaque,</b> except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes <b>plaque</b> from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between amyloid formation and amyloid precursor protein (APP), the brain sections from eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and four with Gerstmann-Sträussler Syndrome (GSS) were investigated immunohistochemically by the double-immunostaining method. In AD, most APP-positive senile <b>plaques</b> belong to classical <b>plaques</b> or primitive <b>plaques,</b> whereas in diffuse <b>plaques,</b> APP-positive neuritic components are rarely observed. The authors documented that anti-APP-labeled degenerative neurites surrounding kuru <b>plaques</b> in all four GSS patients. These kuru <b>plaques</b> were verified by double immunostaining using anti-prion protein and anti-APP. The APP-positive structures in kuru <b>plaques</b> were almost identical with those seen in the classical <b>plaques</b> in AD. The authors concluded that APP-positive degenerative neurites are not an early event in the amyloid formation of senile <b>plaques.</b> It is therefore postulated that depositions of beta/A 4 and prion proteins are primary events that may involve the surrounding microenvironment and result in the secondary formation of APP-positive degenerative neurites, not specific to AD...|$|R

30|$|Kyrieleis <b>plaques</b> {{have been}} {{primarily}} reported {{in association with}} toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis. Although the cause of Kyrieleis <b>plaques</b> is unclear, the increase in these <b>plaques</b> following treatment and immune recovery in our case supports the theory of an immune response to an infectious agent and deposition of inflammatory debris as the etiology of these <b>plaques.</b> Kyrieleis <b>plaques,</b> although not specifically noted in many reports of infectious chorioretinitis, may be under reported. While many authors have concluded that Kyrieleis <b>plaques</b> are rare, Griffin and Bodian in 1959 felt {{that they may be}} more common than the literature suggests [2]. We have found at least one case of CMV retinitis in the literature that appears to also have had Kyrieleis <b>plaques,</b> similar to our patient [14]. Our case adds CMV retinitis to the list of causes of Kyrieleis <b>plaques.</b>|$|R
40|$|Integrins {{belonging}} to different subfamilies {{can be identified}} immunohistochemically in cerebral amyloid <b>plaques.</b> Monoclonal antibodies against the VLA family beta 1 -integrins show staining of the corona of classical amyloid <b>plaques</b> for beta 1, alpha 3 and alpha 6. Immunostaining reveal also the presence of collagen and laminin in the corona. Activated microglial cells in classical <b>plaques</b> strongly express receptors {{belonging to}} the LeuCAM family (beta 2 integrins). The ligands ICAM and activated complement C 3 are found in both amorphous and classical <b>plaques.</b> Vitronectin receptor (alpha v) is found in glial cells in classical <b>plaques</b> but its ligand vitronectin is seen in both amorphous and classical <b>plaques.</b> The data presented here demonstrate the presence of different cellular and substrate adhesive molecules (integrins) and their ligands in classical <b>plaques.</b> The findings suggest that amyloid <b>plaques</b> show signs of regeneration and tissue remodellin...|$|R

50|$|Senile <b>plaques</b> can {{be found}} in human and animal brains (e.g. mammals and birds). From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%), the {{proportion}} of people with senile <b>plaques</b> increases linearly. A small proportion of <b>plaques</b> that form can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have <b>plaques</b> than men.

40|$|The {{detection}} of atherosclerotic <b>plaques</b> {{at risk for}} disruption will be greatly enhanced by molecular probes that target vessel wall biomarkers. Here, we test if fluorescently-labeled Activatable Cell Penetrating Peptides (ACPPs) could differentiate stable <b>plaques</b> from vulnerable <b>plaques</b> that disrupt, forming a luminal thrombus. Additionally, we test the efficacy of a combined ACPP and MRI technique for identifying <b>plaques</b> {{at high risk of}} rupture. In an atherothrombotic rabbit model, disrupted <b>plaques</b> were identified with in vivo MRI and co-registered in the same rabbit aorta with the in vivo uptake of ACPPs, cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or thrombin. ACPP uptake, mapped ex vivo in whole aortas, was higher in disrupted compared to non-disrupted <b>plaques.</b> Specifically, disrupted <b>plaques</b> demonstrated a 4. 5 ~ 5. 0 fold increase in fluorescence enhancement, while non-disrupted <b>plaques</b> showed only a 2. 2 ~ 2. 5 fold signal increase. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicates that both ACPPs (MMP and thrombin) show high specificity (84. 2 % and 83. 2 %) and sensitivity (80. 0 % and 85. 7 %) in detecting disrupted <b>plaques.</b> The detection power of ACPPs was improved when combined with the MRI derived measure, outward remodeling ratio. Our targeted fluorescence ACPP probes distinguished disrupted <b>plaques</b> from stable <b>plaques</b> with high sensitivity and specificity. The combination of anatomic, MRI-derived predictors for disruption and ACPP uptake can further improve the power for identification of high-risk <b>plaques</b> and suggests future development of ACPPs with molecular MRI as a readout...|$|R
40|$|The {{manuscript}} by Schmidt et al {{reports that}} antibodies generated to paired helical filaments (AMY antibodies) unexpectedly labeled novel non-amyloid, plaque-like structures (AMY <b>plaques)</b> in aged and Alzheimer's disease brains. The full {{disclosure of the}} nature of these lesions awaits additional structural and biochemical studies, but at first glance there are interesting parallels between AMY <b>plaques</b> and recently described lesions composed of glia and glia-associated proteoglycans in brains of aged mice. The increasing recognition of the role of proteoglycans in paired helical filaments formation makes proteoglycans or their associated molecules attractive candidates for AMY-immunoreactive proteins. The relationship of AMY <b>plaques</b> to age-related glial changes that some have speculated may be precursors to senile <b>plaques</b> remains to be determined, as is the relationship of AMY <b>plaques</b> to more widely recognized amyloid-containing <b>plaques.</b> Future studies will determine whether AMY <b>plaques</b> are non-amyloid precursors to senile <b>plaques</b> or if they represent an independent type of structural lesion in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Ultimately, the clinical significance of AMY <b>plaques</b> will depend upon their characterization in brains of prospectively studied subjects...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the risk of pleural <b>plaques</b> according {{to the degree of}} past exposure to asbestos, type of amphibole asbestos, and smoking, as well as to estimate the aetiologic fraction of asbestos as a cause of <b>plaques</b> among urban men. METHODS [...] The occurrence and extent of pleural <b>plaques</b> were recorded at necropsies of 288 urban men aged 33 to 69 years. The pulmonary concentration of asbestos and other mineral fibres was analysed with scanning electron microscopy. The probability of past exposure was estimated from the last occupation. RESULTS [...] Pleural <b>plaques</b> were detected in 58 % of the cases and their frequency increased with age, probability of past occupational exposure to asbestos, pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibres, and smoking. The risk of both moderate and widespread <b>plaques</b> was raised among asbestos exposed cases, and the risk estimates were higher for widespread <b>plaques</b> than for moderate <b>plaques.</b> The age adjusted risk was higher for high concentrations of crocidolite/amosite fibres than for anthophyllite fibres. The aetiologic fraction of pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibres exceeding 0. 1 million fibres/g was 43 % for widespread <b>plaques</b> and 24 % for all <b>plaques.</b> The median pulmonary concentrations of asbestos fibres were about threefold greater among cases with widespread <b>plaques</b> than among those without <b>plaques.</b> No increased risk of pleural <b>plaques</b> was associated with raised total concentrations of non-asbestos fibres. CONCLUSION [...] The occurrence of pleural <b>plaques</b> correlated closely with past exposure to asbestos. The risk was dependent on the intensity of exposure. Due to methodological difficulties in detecting past exposures to chrysotile and such low exposures that may still pose a risk of <b>plaques,</b> the aetiologic fractions calculated in the study probably underestimate the role of asbestos...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of amyloid <b>plaques</b> {{in the brain}} is one of prominent histological features of Alzheimer’s disease. However, imaging of amyloid <b>plaques</b> in vivo in humans is not yet feasible. Recent technical advances in high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in mice have enabled not only the detection of amyloid <b>plaques</b> in vivo but also allowed to monitor {{the development of these}} <b>plaques</b> with age in the same animals. Further technical improvements to visualize small <b>plaques</b> at early stages at ultrahigh magnetic fields are underway. This review summarizes some of the current developments in visualizing AD <b>plaques</b> in vivo in mice and highlights their future impact on drug discovery. Fur-thermore potential application and challenges of translation of these methods for visualizing <b>plaques</b> in human are dis-cussed...|$|R
