6000|$|I {{will not}} build on yonder mount; And, should {{you call me}} to account, Consulting with myself, I find It was no levity of mind. Whate'er I promised or intended, No fault of mine, the scheme is ended; Nor can you tax me as unsteady, I have a hundred causes ready; All risen since that {{flattering}} time, When Drapier's-Hill appear'd in rhyme. [...] I am, as now too late I find, The greatest cully of mankind; The lowest boy in Martin's school May turn and wind me like a fool. How could I form so wild a vision, To seek, in deserts, Fields Elysian? To live in fear, suspicion, variance, With thieves, fanatics, and barbarians? [...] But here my lady will object; Your deanship ought to recollect, That, near the knight of Gosford[1] placed, Whom you allow a man of taste, Your intervals of time to spend With so conversable a friend, It would not signify a pin Whatever climate you were in. [...] 'Tis true, but what advantage comes To me from all a usurer's plums; Though I should see him twice a-day, And am his neighbour 'cross the way: If all my rhetoric must fail To strike him for a pot of ale? [...] Thus, when the learned and the wise Conceal their talents from our eyes, And from deserving friends withhold Their gifts, as misers do their gold; Their knowledge to themselves confined Is the same avarice of mind; Nor makes their conversation better, Than if they never knew a letter. Such is the fate of Gosford's knight, Who keeps his wisdom out of sight; Whose uncommunicative heart Will scarce one precious word impart: Still rapt in speculations deep, His outward senses fast asleep; Who, while I talk, a song will hum, Or with his fingers beat the drum; Beyond the skies transports his mind, And leaves a lifeless corpse behind. [...] But, as for me, who ne'er could clamber high, To understand Malebranche or Cambray; Who send my mind (as I believe) less Than others do, on errands sleeveless; Can listen to a tale humdrum, And with attention read Tom Thumb; My spirits with my body progging, Both {{hand in hand together}} jogging; Sunk over head and ears in matter. Nor can of metaphysics smatter; Am more diverted with a quibble Than dream of words intelligible; And think all notions too abstracted Are like the ravings of a crackt head; What intercourse of minds can be Betwixt the knight sublime and me, If when I talk, as talk I must, It is but prating to a bust? [...] Where friendship is by Fate design'd, It forms a union in the mind: But here I differ from the knight In every point, like black and white: For none can say that ever yet We both in one opinion met: Not in philosophy, or ale; In state affairs, or planting kale; In rhetoric, or picking straws; In roasting larks, or making laws; In <b>public</b> <b>schemes,</b> or catching flies; In parliaments, or pudding pies. [...] The neighbours wonder why the knight Should in a country life delight, Who not one pleasure entertains To cheer the solitary scenes: His guests are few, his visits rare; Nor uses time, nor time will spare; Nor rides, nor walks, nor hunts, nor fowls, Nor plays at cards, or dice, or bowls; But seated in an easy-chair, Despises exercise and air. His rural walks he ne'er adorns; Here poor Pomona sits on thorns: And there neglected Flora settles Her bum upon a bed of nettles. Those thankless and officious cares I used to take in friends' affairs, From which I never could refrain, And have been often chid in vain; From these I am recover'd quite, At least in what regards the knight. Preserve his health, his store increase; May nothing interrupt his peace! But now let all his tenants round First milk his cows, and after, pound; Let every cottager conspire To cut his hedges down for fire; The naughty boys about the village His crabs and sloes may freely pillage; He still may keep a pack of knaves To spoil his work, and work by halves; His meadows may be dug by swine, It shall be no concern of mine; For why should I continue still To serve a friend against his will? ...|$|E

50|$|In 1838, the Commissioners of Public Works were created, and one {{of their}} tasks was to find <b>public</b> <b>schemes</b> that would create employment. Accordingly, William Mulvany carried out the next survey at their request, {{at a time when}} work had begun on the Ulster Canal, which would provide the link onwards to Lough Neagh. The powers of the Commissioners were {{increased}} in 1842, so that their remit included navigations, drainage and water power works. The Ulster Canal wanted the link to the Shannon completed, while local landowners wanted better drainage of the area, and these two factors finally convinced the Commissioners that they should act. The scheme would combine navigation and drainage, and plans were drawn up by John McMahon, an engineer working for the Board of Works. He estimated that the work would cost £100,000.|$|E

They agreed to lend the canal company £200,000 if they could find another £100,000, which they succeeded in doing, and in December 1817, work resumed on the canal. In 1819, a fourth Act was obtained, which made provision for the construction of City Road Basin, and removed powers to build a cut to Shoreditch. Another £105,000 was raised and the canal opened on 1 August 1820. The opening celebrations included the arrival of boats from Manchester, which discharged their cargos at the basin and began their journey back to the north on the same day.|$|E

For a farm size of 6.0 ha the investment per family is some US$40,000 on average, not including the cost of agricultural support services and operational subsidies.

40|$|The neo-liberal tide of {{privatisation}} targeted public {{pension schemes}} {{quite some time}} ago. While decreasing {{the role of the}} State as such {{is part and parcel of}} this ideology, another as-pect of privatising basic needs does not seem to have received appropriate attention. Govern-ment intervention and trade union strife for higher income have created high levels of rela-tively wide-spread wealth, which could profitably be tapped by private business. This is simi-lar to state property such as railways whose privatisation offers golden business opportunities. The necessity to provide for old age and outright fear of misery during this stage of one's life are powerful incentives to provide financially, even if fees and charges for doing so are rela-tively high – elasticity of demand will be low. Naturally, private pension schemes are likely to remain a comparatively marginal fac-tor- of interest mainly to a relatively small layer of the well heeled- if and as long as <b>public</b> <b>schemes</b> offer relatively good levels of income for most people.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a new method capable of evaluating the economic welfare for quality graded fish products using the hedonic price method for plaice in Denmark. Today no labelling scheme exists for the final consumers of different qualities of fish. A scheme does only exist at the first hand market. On this basis, a general applicable theoretical and empirical method is developed to compare the costs and benefits of the hypothetical choice between the total absence of labelling and the presence of a <b>public</b> label-ling <b>scheme,</b> which fully inform consumers on the quality and simultaneously allow the producers to differentiate prices between quality grades. It is shown that the economic welfare associated with a <b>public</b> labelling <b>scheme</b> is at mini-mum 263, 000 euro. Sensitivity analysis shows that this result is robust. The pol-icy implication is that a <b>public</b> labelling <b>scheme</b> should not be implemented as the demand and cost functions have low elasticities, implying that the welfare gain is low.
