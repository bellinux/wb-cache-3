5000|$|Geiger joined The American Legion {{before leaving}} active service in 1945, {{becoming}} Illinois Commander in 1960 and National Commander in 1971. His tenure as National Commander was marked with {{his campaign for}} better healthcare for veterans and opposition to blanket amnesty for draft dodgers. He was also a staunch defender of presidential power during the Vietnam war saying, [...] "Any limitations {{on the ability of}} the president as commander in chief to conduct military operations in southeast Asian would endanger the lives of our fighting men and make more difficult the achievement of a just peace". He believed those who objected to President Richard Nixon's war policies were" [...] divisive and defeatist and likely to encourage Hanoi in its demands". On March 1, 1971, he spoke before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and <b>Procedure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Judiciary on The American Legion's opposition to draft dodging, he believed amnesty would devastate morale of those who served in the war and dishonored the memory of the dead. A large project of his was the Three Letter Campaign as he advised each member of the legion to write three letters: one to their congressman and one to each senator. The purpose of the campaign was to improve the GI Bill for veterans of Vietnam. He later served on the National Commander's Advisory Committee from 1978 to 1999.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: The use {{of local}} {{ventilation}} system {{is one of}} methods to collect and control of air pollutants in the cramp unit of industrial poultry slaughterhouse and its subsequent is reduction {{of the effects of}} air pollutants on human health. The {{purpose of this study is}} to survey the effect of design and proper implementation of local ventilation system and the refiner on the control of dust in industrial slaughterhouse poultry. Materials and methods: This study was conducted in three steps; evaluation of particulate air pollutants before design, design and implementation of local ventilation system and evaluation of local ventilation system. Sampling of respiratory and inhalational particles was done with the use of nylon cyclone and PVC filter according to the NIOSH 0600 method. Then, local ventilation system was designed and implemented according to velocity pressure <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Industrial Ventilation America. Finally, the efficiency of local ventilation system and the refiner used were evaluated. Results: The concentration of dust in a ventilation off system for respirable and inhalable particles, was obtained 13 / 07 and 1 / 18 mg/m 3, respectively. Previous inefficient efficiency to remove respirable and inhalable particles was about 14 and 18 percent, respectively, which design and implementation of local ventilation systems increased the efficiency to more than 83 and 92 percent. Also, the efficiency of used refiner has been 58 / 26 and 27 / 52 percent for respirable and inhalable particles. Conclusion: Findings of the study showed that design and proper implementation of local ventilation systems can have a great effect on reduction of particles in cramp unit. Also, use of the sedimentation chamber refiner has relatively good efficiency for the control of respiratory particles...|$|E
