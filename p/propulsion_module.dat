5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external <b>propulsion</b> <b>module</b> to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing <b>propulsion</b> <b>module.</b> The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
25|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{built the}} Galileo {{spacecraft}} and managed the Galileo mission for NASA. West Germany Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm supplied the <b>propulsion</b> <b>module.</b> NASA's Ames Research Center managed the atmospheric probe, {{which was built}} by Hughes Aircraft Company.|$|E

40|$|Evaluations are {{presented}} of alternative LANDSAT follow-on launch configurations to derive the propulsion {{requirements for the}} multimission modular spacecraft (MMS). Two basic types were analyzed including use of conventional launch vehicles and shuttle supported missions. It was concluded that two sizes of modular hydrazine <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> would provide the most cost-effective combination for future missions of this spacecraft. Conceptual designs of the selected <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> were performed to the depth permitting determination of mass properties and estimated costs...|$|R
5000|$|Sea Star SAAHTO (Stage And A Half To Orbit): The largest design. It {{could be}} fitted to carry either cargo or human passengers. To do so, a crew module has been designed. This space capsule {{is to be}} capable of housing five crew members and a pilot, and sits atop the Neptune TSAAHTO during launch. The rocket itself is {{composed}} of eight large common <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> and eight small common <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> and can place a 7,000-pound payload into a 250-mile 51° orbit.|$|R
25|$|Several modules {{planned for}} the station were {{cancelled}} {{over the course of}} the ISS programme. Reasons include budgetary constraints, the modules becoming unnecessary, and station redesigns after the 2003 Columbia disaster. The US Centrifuge Accommodations Module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity. The US Habitation Module would have served as the station's living quarters. Instead, the sleep stations are now spread throughout the station. The US Interim Control Module and ISS <b>Propulsion</b> <b>Module</b> would have replaced the functions of Zvezda in case of a launch failure. Two Russian Research Modules were planned for scientific research. They would have docked to a Russian Universal Docking Module. The Russian Science Power Platform would have supplied power to the Russian Orbital Segment independent of the ITS solar arrays.|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} planned that the ports would connect to [...] modules {{derived from the}} Soyuz spacecraft. These modules would have used a Soyuz <b>propulsion</b> <b>module,</b> as in Soyuz and Progress, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module. Following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with Vladimir Chelomei's manned Almaz military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate [...] space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft. NPO Energia {{was responsible for the}} overall space station, with work subcontracted to KB Salyut, due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7, Soyuz-T, and Progress spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and gyrodyne flywheels (taken from Almaz), Kurs automatic rendezvous system, Luch satellite communications system, Elektron oxygen generators, and Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.|$|E
2500|$|Her second mission, Expedition 16, {{launched}} October 10, 2007, on Soyuz TMA-11. Along {{with her}} Expedition 16 crew member Yuri Malenchenko and spaceflight participant Yi So-yeon, {{she returned to}} Earth in Soyuz TMA-11 on April 19, 2008. The re-entry was remarkable {{for the failure of}} the Soyuz <b>propulsion</b> <b>module</b> to separate properly, and the subsequent [...] "ballistic reentry" [...] which subjected the crew to forces about eight times that of Earth surface gravity. She spent 191 days, 19 hrs and 8 mins in space on this mission.|$|E
50|$|The YF-23 is {{a liquid}} rocket vernier engine, burning N2O4 and UDMH. It {{is used in}} along the YF-22 to form the YF-24 and YF-25 <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules.</b>|$|R
50|$|An ESA {{presentation}} from June 13, 2006 {{presents a}} lunar orbital {{mission of the}} CSTS spacecraft with 3 launches, of which two are <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> to propel the spacecraft to a trans-lunar trajectory. Such a scenario, while more complicated than the 2-stage approach mentioned by Manuel Valls, gives more leeway {{in terms of the}} CSTS' mass budget.|$|R
50|$|The final MMU {{mission was}} STS-51-A, which flew in November 1984. The {{propulsion}} unit {{was used to}} retrieve two communication satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2, that did not reach their proper orbits because of faulty <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules.</b> Astronauts Joseph P. Allen and Dale Gardner captured the two satellites and brought them into the Orbiter payload bay for stowage and return to Earth.|$|R
2500|$|The Kliper {{program was}} {{proposed}} as the Russian-European counterpart to the American Orion Spacecraft {{and was therefore}} designed (similar to the Orion) {{to be part of}} a modular system that enabled it to be both a LEO-shuttle type vehicle as well as part of a spacecraft able to go beyond Earth orbit to the Moon and even Mars (there were outline suggestions of lunar applications in September 2005). [...] The modular design would have included the Kliper crew module and - depending on the mission - a mission module or <b>propulsion</b> <b>module.</b> Although far-fetched, this corresponds to announcements by the Russian Space Agency that according to a lunar mission study, using the Soyuz, a landing on the Moon could be achieved within the next decade.|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{instruments}} to measure fields and particles were {{mounted on the}} spinning section of the spacecraft, together with the main antenna, power supply, the <b>propulsion</b> <b>module</b> and most of Galileo computers and control electronics. The sixteen instruments, weighing [...] altogether, included magnetometer sensors mounted on an [...] boom to minimize interference from the spacecraft; a plasma instrument for detecting low-energy charged particles and a plasma-wave detector to study waves generated by the particles; a high-energy particle detector; and a detector of cosmic and Jovian dust. It also carried the Heavy Ion Counter, an engineering experiment to assess the potentially hazardous charged particle environments the spacecraft flew through, and an extreme ultraviolet detector associated with the UV spectrometer on the scan platform.|$|E
2500|$|Nauka ( [...] ; lit. [...] "science"), {{also known}} as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) or FGB-2 ( [...] , [...] ), is the major Russian {{laboratory}} module. It was scheduled to arrive at the station in 2014, docking to the port that was occupied by the Pirs module. Due to deterioration during many years spent in storage, it proved necessary to build a new <b>propulsion</b> <b>module,</b> and the launch date was postponed to 2018. Before the Nauka module arrives, a Progress spacecraft will remove Pirs from the station and deorbit it to reenter over the Pacific Ocean. Nauka contains an additional set of life support systems and attitude control. Originally it would have routed power from the single Science-and-Power Platform, but that single module design changed over the first ten years of the ISS mission, and the two science modules, which attach to Nauka via the Uzlovoy Module, or Russian node, each incorporate their own large solar arrays to power Russian science experiments in the ROS.|$|E
50|$|Flying {{over the}} {{southern}} Atlantic Ocean, the Soyuz executed its deorbit burn at 01:36 UTC on May 24. The deorbit burn was a four-minute, 16-second firing. The descent, habitation and <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> {{making up the}} spacecraft separated at 02:01 UTC. The descent module, with the crew inside, reached the first traces of the Earth's atmosphere {{at an altitude of}} about 62 miles at 02:03 UTC.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} modular, {{enabling}} it to accommodate {{any of a}} number of mission specific <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules,</b> manipulator arms, docking port for an Orion or commercial crew capsule, and landing craft for destination worlds. In theory the engines and fuel could be swapped out depending on the mission. The proposal also had an industrial slide-out airlock unit and a command, control and observation deck.|$|R

Recurring and non-recurring cost elements were generated for these modules. As a result, ion propulsion cost drivers were identified to be Shuttle charges, solar array, power processing, and thruster costs. Cost effective design approaches included short length module configurations, array power sharing, operation at reduced thruster input power (reduced solar array size), simplified power processing units, and power processor output switching...|$|R

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{cost model}} for mercury ion <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> is presented. A detailed {{work breakdown structure}} is included. Cost estimating relationships were developed for the individual subsystems and the nonhardware items (systems engineering, software, etc.). Solar array and power processor unit (PPU) costs are the significant cost drivers. Simplification of both of these subsystems through applications of advanced technology (lightweight solar arrays and high-efficiency, self-radiating PPUs) can reduce costs. Comparison of the performance and cost of several chemical propulsion systems with the Hg ion module are also presented. For outer-planet missions, advanced solar electric propulsion (ASEP) trip times and O 2 /H 2 propulsion trip times are comparable. A three-year trip time savings over the baselined NTO/MMH propulsion system is possible with ASEP...|$|R

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{functions for}} the U. S. Space Station Freedom (SSF) are accomplished by two separate systems, the Primary Propulsion System and the Supplemental Reboost System (SRS). The Primary Propulsion System includes self-contained hydrazine modules for station reboost, attitude control and contingency maneuvers. These <b>Propulsion</b> <b>Modules</b> contain reboost and attitude control thrusters, propellant storage, thermal conditioning and electronic controls. The modules are serviced {{on the ground}} and launched on the Space Shuttle as replacements for the on-orbit modules which have expended their propellant. The expended modules are returned to the ground for reservicing and subsequent reuse.

40|$|An initial {{investigation}} of the design considerations in clustering nuclear rocket engines for space transfer vehicles has been made. The clustering of both <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> (which include start tanks) and nuclear rocket engines installed directly to a vehicle core tank appears to be feasible. Special provisions to shield opposite run tanks and {{the opposite side of}} a core tank - {{in the case of the}} boost pump concept - are required; the installation of a circumferential reactor side shield sector appears to provide an effective solution to this problem. While the time response to an engine-out event does not appear to be critical, the gimbal displacement required appears to be important. Since an installation of three engines offers a substantial reduction in gimbal requirements for engine-out and it may be possible to further enhance mission reliability with the greater number of engines, it is recommended that a cluster of four engines be considered...|$|R
40|$|Exploration {{technology}} roadmaps {{have been}} developed by ESA {{in the past few}} years and the latest edition has been released in 2015. Scope of these technology roadmaps, elaborated in consultation with the different ESA stakeholders (e. g. European Industries and Research Entities), is to provide a powerful tool for strategic, programmatic and technical decisions in support of the European role within an International Space Exploration context. In the context of preparation for possible future European Moon exploration initiatives, the technology roadmaps have been used to highlight the role of technology within Missions, Building Blocks and Operational Capabilities of relevance. In particular, as part of reference missions to the Moon that would fit in the time frame 2020 to 2030, ESA has addressed the definition of lunar surface exploration missions in line with its space exploration strategy, with the common mission goals of returning samples from the Moon and Mars and expanding human presence to these destinations in a step-wise approach. The roadmaps for the procurement of technologies required for the first mission elements of the above strategy have been elaborated through their main building blocks, i. e. Visual navigation, Hazard detection and avoidance; Sample acquisition, processing and containment system; Surface mobility elements; Tele-robotic and autonomous control systems; and Storable <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> and equipment. Technology prioritization methodologies {{have been developed}} in support of the ESA Exploration Technology Roadmaps, in order to provide logical and quantitative instruments to verify choices of prioritization that can be carried out on the basis of important, but non-quantitative factors. These methodologies that are thoroughly described in the paper proceed through subsequent steps. First technology prioritization's criteria are selected; then decision trees are developed to highlight all feasible paths of combination of technology prioritization's criteria and to assess the final achievement of each path, i. e. the cost-effectiveness. The risk associated to each path is also evaluated. In the second part of the paper, these prioritization methodologies have been applied to some of the building blocks of relevance for the mission concepts under evaluation at ESA (such as Tele-robotic and autonomous control systems; Storable <b>propulsion</b> <b>modules</b> and equipment) and the results are presented to highlight the approach for an effective TRL increase.
