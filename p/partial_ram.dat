40|$|We {{study the}} atomic (H[*]I) and {{molecular}} hydrogen (H 2) contents of early-type galaxies (ETGs) and their gas sources using the GALFORM model of galaxy formation. This model uses a self-consistent {{calculation of the}} star formation rate, which depends on the H 2 content of galaxies. We first present a new analysis of H[*]I Parkes All-Sky Survey and ATLAS 3 D surveys, with special emphasis on ETGs. The model predicts H[*]I and H 2 contents of ETGs {{in agreement with the}} observations from these surveys only if <b>partial</b> <b>ram</b> pressure stripping of the hot gas is included, showing that observations of neutral gas in ‘quenched’ galaxies place stringent constraints on the treatment of the hot gas in satellites. We find that ≈ 90 per cent of ETGs at z = 0 have neutral gas contents supplied by radiative cooling from their hot haloes, 8 per cent were supplied by gas accretion from minor mergers {{that took place in the}} last 1 Gyr, while 2 per cent were supplied by mass-loss from old stars. The model predicts neutral gas fractions strongly decreasing with increasing bulge fraction. This is due to the impeded disc regeneration in ETGs, resulting from both active galactic nuclei feedback and environmental quenching by <b>partial</b> <b>ram</b> pressure stripping of the hot gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between color, characterized {{with respect to}} the g – r red sequence; stellar structure, as determined using the i-band Sérsic index; and group membership are explored using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new results place novel constraints on theories of galaxy evolution, despite the strong correlation between color and stellar structure. Observed correlations are of three independent types—those based on stellar structure, on the color of disk-like galaxies, and on the color of elliptical galaxies. Of particular note, the fraction of galaxies residing on the red sequence measured among galaxies with disk-like light profiles is enhanced for satellite galaxies compared to central galaxies. This fraction increases with group mass. When these new results are considered, theoretical treatments of galaxy evolution that adopt a gas accretion model centered on the hot galactic halo cannot consistently account for all observations of disk galaxies. The hypothesis is advanced that inflow within the extended H I disk prolongs star formation in satellite galaxies. When combined with <b>partial</b> <b>ram</b> pressure stripping (RPS) of this disk, this new scenario is consistent with the observations. This is demonstrated by applying an analytical model of RPS of the extended H I disk to the SDSS groups. These results motivate incorporating more complex modes of gas accretion into models of galaxy evolution, including cold mode accretion, an improved treatment of gas dynamics within disks, and disk stripping...|$|E

Three LPs were rereleased on CD: Volume 1, a <b>partial</b> rerelease of <b>Ram</b> Narayan en Concert, in 1989, and Inde du Nord in 1998 and Raga Puria Kalyan in 1999. Since the 2000s, the releases by Music Today, Nimbus Records, The Gramophone Company, Universal Music India, and Venus Records have become available in online music stores.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>partial</b> {{replacement}} of <b>ram</b> semen diluent with ram seminal plasma on the fertility of ewes were studied. Crossbred Chios ewes (n = 152) {{were assigned to}} six groups. The oestrous cycles of the ewes were synchronised at the peak (Groups A, B, C and D) {{and at the end}} (Groups E and F) of the breeding season by means of intravaginal sponges impregnated with fluorogestone acetate (FGA) for 14 days. Four hundred IU of PMSG were injected intramuscularly at the time of sponge removal. Ewes of Groups A, C and E were artificially inseminated with ram semen diluted with skim milk extender, while those of Groups B, D and F with ram semen diluted with 50 % skim milk and 50 % ram seminal plasma. The addition of ram seminal plasma induced a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in litter size in Groups B and D when compared with that of Groups A and C (1. 85 and 1. 88 vs. 1. 39 and 1. 52, respectively). This increase was not significant when insemination was performed {{at the end of the}} breeding season (2. 0 vs. 1. 4). These results indicate that the addition of seminal plasma can influence the fertility of ewes or the fertilising capacity of extended ram semen to some extent...|$|R
