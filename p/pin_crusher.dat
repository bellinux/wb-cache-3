5|$|The {{following}} match featured Shawn Michaels {{defending his}} WWF Intercontinental Championship against Crush. Crush controlled the early {{portion of the}} match by performing several dropkicks on Michaels, which he followed with a military press slam and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Michaels left the ring to recover and returned to attack Crush's head. Michaels was unable to <b>pin</b> <b>Crush,</b> however, and Crush threw Michaels out of the ring. Two wrestlers dressed as Doink the Clown, with whom Crush had been feuding, came to the ring to distract Crush. Michaels performed a superkick, his signature move, and <b>pinned</b> <b>Crush</b> to retain the championship.|$|R
25|$|Older table-based pinsetters that pick up {{the pins}} between throws could {{malfunction}} if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, <b>pin</b> <b>crush</b> damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} the World Tag Team Championship match. The Headshrinkers gained the early advantage, but Mr. Fuji helped his team by hitting Fatu with the Japanese flag. Yokozuna {{performed}} a leg drop on Fatu, but Samu {{was able to}} tag in. All four wrestlers fought in the ring before the brawl moved to the arena floor. Crush performed a superplex on Samu, but Lex Luger came to ringside and distracted Crush. This allowed Samu to attempt a roll-up. Crush recovered, but Fatu tagged in and <b>pinned</b> <b>Crush</b> to retain the belts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{feature of}} centerfire ammunition is the primer {{which is a}} metal cup containing a primary explosive inserted into a recess {{in the center of}} the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing <b>pin</b> <b>crushes</b> this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. [...] Berdan and Boxer cartridge primers are both considered [...] "centerfire" [...] and are not interchangeable at the primer level; however, the same weapon can fire either Berdan- or Boxer-primed cartridges if the overall dimensions are the same.|$|R
25|$|On the April 28, 1990, {{edition of}} Saturday Night's Main Event, they faced The Rockers in a tag team match, which {{resulted}} in a double disqualification after WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition interfered. As a result of the interference, Demolition feuded with both the Rockers and the Hart Foundation. At SummerSlam 90, the Hart Foundation faced Demolition in a two out of three falls match for the tag title. By this time Demolition member Ax was suffering from health problems so a third member of Demolition (Crush) was introduced with the storyline being that the Hart Foundation didn't know which two members they would face until Demolition entered the arena. The two chosen were Crush and Smash. In the first fall, Hart was <b>pinned</b> by <b>Crush</b> but the Hart Foundation won the second fall by disqualification after Crush attacked the referee. Ax then {{made his way to the}} ring and interfered in the third fall until the Legion of Doom (Animal and Hawk) came to ringside and attacked Demolition, the distraction allowed Hart to <b>pin</b> <b>Crush</b> and the Hart Foundation won. As a result, the Hart Foundation got their second WWF Tag Team Championship (despite the second fall being decided by disqualification).|$|R
50|$|After leaving WCW in 1992, Osborne {{returned}} to the World Wrestling Federation on September 21, 1992 in Manitoba, Canada at a WWF Superstars taping. Competing as himself, he defeated Bill Jordan. Borne would shortly thereafter become Doink the Clown, in a villainous clown gimmick that would frequently pull tricks on wrestlers at ringside as well as fans. He would also briefly use the character in United States Wrestling Association in February before returning to WWF television in March. Soon after his televised return, he began feuding with Crush after attacking him with a prosthetic arm on an episode of Superstars of Wrestling, which subsequently resulted in a match at WrestleMania IX. During this match, another Doink (Steve Keirn) came {{out from under the}} ring and attacked Crush with another prosthetic arm, allowing the real Doink to <b>pin</b> <b>Crush.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{feature of}} centerfire ammunition is the primer -- a metal cup containing primary explosive inserted into a recess {{in the center}} of the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing <b>pin</b> <b>crushes</b> this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. [...] Berdan and Boxer primers are used in centerfire cartridges; the primers differ in construction. American cartridges primarily use Boxer primers, and European cartridges use Berdan primers. Various priming mixtures have been used in different sized primers to effect prompt ignition of the powder charge. Particles with relatively high heat capacity are required to promptly ignite smokeless powder deterrent coatings. Some priming explosives decompose into incandescent solids or liquids. Inert ingredients may be heated into incandescent sparks when the explosive decomposes into gas. Cartridges for military use require stable priming formulations so war reserves of small-arms ammunition will dependably function after years of storage.|$|R

50|$|The {{second of}} two matches necessitated by the {{cancellation}} of Pillman's match was an eight man tag team contest pitting the Disciples of Apocalypse against Los Boricuas. DOA won the match after <b>Crush</b> <b>pinned</b> Miguel Perez, Jr. following a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker.|$|R
50|$|Three Princeton {{students}} reported seeing Towner in the undergraduate cheering section during the game. Princeton police were told on November 13 that Towner was seen falling down the concrete {{steps of the}} stadium during the football contest. This occurred during the most exciting {{part of the game}} when Princeton scored the only touchdown. Towner rose from his seat, tripped and fell down five concrete steps, landing on his hands. He was assisted to his seat by other spectators, appearing to be uninjured. Editors of the Daily Princetonian established that Towner was not <b>pinned</b> and <b>crushed</b> against a concrete wall by the departing crowd.|$|R
5000|$|Rimfire {{cartridges}} {{are limited}} to low pressures because they require a thin case so that the firing <b>pin</b> can <b>crush</b> the rim and ignite the primer. Rimfire cartridges of [...]44 caliber (actually [...]45 caliber) up to [...]56 caliber were once common when black powder {{was used as a}} propellant. However, modern rimfire cartridges use smokeless powder which generates much higher pressures and tend to be of [...]22 caliber (5.5 mm) or smaller. The low pressures necessitated by the rimfire design mean that rimfire firearms can be very light and inexpensive, which has helped lead to the continuing popularity of these small-caliber cartridges.|$|R
50|$|This snake {{reaches a}} length of over nine feet. It is {{terrestrial}} and diurnal. It {{can be found in}} marshes, swamps, and riverbeds. The unicolor cribo is non-venomous. It bites its prey without coiling around it. It <b>pins</b> its prey, <b>crushing</b> it, and then swallows it whole. Its prey consists of other snakes, including venomous snakes, small mammals, small birds, lizards, frogs, fish, and other small vertebrate animals.|$|R
5000|$|Berdan primers {{are named}} after their American inventor, Hiram Berdan of New York who invented his first {{variation}} of the Berdan primer and patented it on March 20, 1866, in [...] A small copper cylinder formed the shell of the cartridge, and the primer cap was pressed into a recess in {{the outside of the}} closed end of the cartridge opposite the bullet. In the end of the cartridge beneath the primer cap was a small vent-hole, as well as a small teat-like projection or point (later to be known as an anvil) fashioned from the case, such that the firing <b>pin</b> could <b>crush</b> the primer against the anvil and ignite the propellant. This system worked well, allowing the option of installing a cap just before use of the propellant-loaded cartridge as well as permitting reloading the cartridge for reuse.|$|R
50|$|During the Free For All pre-show Bret Hart, Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart, the British Bulldog and Brian Pillman {{were interviewed}} backstage, {{claiming}} they bought {{tickets for the}} show to watch the Stone Cold Steve Austin match later in the night. During the PPV Ahmed Johnson faced off against all {{three members of the}} Nation of Domination in a Gauntlet match. Before the match begun WWF president Gorilla Monsoon came to ringside and ejected any member of the Nation of Domination that was not wrestling, forcing manager Clarence Mason, D'Lo Brown and others to leave ringside. Johnson <b>pinned</b> <b>Crush</b> in the first match in just over five minutes. The second match ended in a disqualification when Savio Vega hit Johnson with a chair repeatedly. The deliberate disqualification was to set Johnson up as an easy victim for NOD leader Faarooq. Faarooq faked an arm injury and then quickly attacked Johnson's knee gaining a fast victory. The match between former Ultimate Fighting Championship champion Ken Shamrock and Vader featured mixed rules as a hybrid between wrestling and MMA that would only allow someone to win by submission or knock out. During the match Shamrock accidentally broke Vader's nose with a series of knee strikes to Vader's face. In the end Shamrock forced Vader to submit to an Ankle lock submission hold. The Hart Foundation made their presence known during the main event between The Undertaker and Steve Austin. At one point, when it looked like Austin was about to win, Pillman reached over and rang the bell prematurely, causing a distraction. In the end the Undertaker pinned Steve Austin, followed moments later by Neidhart, Owen Hart, Bulldog and Pillman attacking both wrestlers. Moments later Steve Austin knocked Bret Hart out of his wheel chair and then used one of Hart's crutches as a weapon to chase {{all the members of the}} Hart Foundation off.|$|R
5|$|On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia. Allman was riding at a high speed in his motorcycle at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman <b>pinned</b> underneath, <b>crushing</b> several internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.|$|R
5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman <b>pinned</b> underneath, <b>crushing</b> his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to modern}} {{centerfire}} cases {{used in the}} strongest types of modern guns, existing rimfire cartridge designs use loads that generate relatively low pressure because of limitations of feasible gun design — the rim {{has little or no}} lateral support from the gun. Such support would require very close tolerances in design of the chamber, bolt, and firing pin. Because that is not cost-effective, it is necessary to keep rimfire load pressure low enough so that the stress generated by chamber pressure that would push the case rim outward cannot expand the rim significantly. Also, the wall of the folded rim must be thin and ductile enough to easily deform, as necessary to allow the blow from the firing <b>pin</b> to <b>crush</b> and thereby ignite the primer compound, and it must do so without rupturing, If it is too thick, it will be too resistant to deformation. If it is too hard, it will crack rather than deform. These two limitations — that the rim is self-supporting laterally and that the rim is thin and ductile enough to easily crush in response to the firing pin impact — limit rimfire pressures.|$|R
50|$|Allman {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} crash only months after the release and initial success of At Fillmore East. On October 29, 1971, while the band was on a break from touring and recording, Allman was riding his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle at high speed on Hillcrest Avenue, {{in the western part of}} Macon. As he approached Bartlett Street, a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing him to swerve sharply. He struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was thrown from the motorcycle, which landed on top of him and skidded another 90 feet with him <b>pinned</b> underneath it, <b>crushing</b> his internal organs. He was alive when he was brought to a hospital, but despite immediate medical treatment, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|R
5|$|In the two out {{of three}} falls tag team match, Crush and Smash {{represented}} Demolition against the team of Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart. Both teams relied on brawling tactics during the first fall, which was awarded to Demolition when they pinned Hart after performing the Demolition Decapitation. They continued to wear down Hart until Neidhart tagged back into the match. He and Hart took turns attacking Smash before performing the Hart Attack. Before they could <b>pin</b> him, however, <b>Crush</b> prevented the referee from making a pinfall count, which resulted in a disqualification. During the third fall, Demolition distracted the referee, enabling Ax, their third member, to come to hide at ringside. When Smash was knocked out of the ring, Ax took his place while Smash hid. Well rested, Ax used his power to control the match against Hart. Ax and Smash traded places again, but the Legion of Doom appeared and pulled Ax out from under the ring. With Smash distracted, Hart and Neidhart were able to tackle <b>Crush</b> and <b>pin</b> him to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|R
40|$|Working in an {{underground}} mine presents many unique challenges. One significant challenge is providing adequate lighting for miners to work safely. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) identifies {{an underground}} coal mine {{as the most}} difficult environment {{in the world to}} illuminate, yet miners depend most heavily on vision to identify and avoid hazards as they navigate their work environment. Many of the higher frequency risks in mining are related to the challenge of inadequate lighting. This includes slip, trip, and fall (STF) hazards which can be more difficult to detect in low light: in 2007 there were 254 STF injuries among underground miners. Inadequate light can also prevent a miner from seeing an approaching machinery hazard; 31 miners were fatally <b>pinned</b> or <b>crushed</b> by machinery between 1983 - 2009. With increased age can come decreased visual abilities, particularly in low light environments. The average age of the mining workforce is 45 years; as the mining workforce ages, the need for effective underground lighting becomes even more pressing. Traditional mine lighting consists of a low level of background light, along with a high-intensity, yellow-tinted incandescent spot light from a miner's cap lamp or piece of machinery. This traditional method, with a narrow beam of bright light fixed in a single location, is not very adaptable to the variety of lighting needs that a miner may encounter. There is also a risk of decreased visibility from the glare of this spotlight. One study found 78 % of test subjects complaining of glare from traditional lighting systems.

40|$|Homogeneous dispersions of fissile and fertile {{material}} in graphite are being currently considered as fuel for high-temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactors. A possible method of fuel preparation involves compaction of finely ground artificial graphite with U and Th metal powders. Size reduction of artificial graphite is therefore {{of interest in}} the preparation of graphite-fuel compacts. Reactor graphite has been successively size reduced in a jaw <b>crusher,</b> <b>pin</b> disc mill and ball mill to give material 50 % finer than 9 microns, and with a B. E. T. nitrogen adsorption surface area ranging up to 18. 4 m 2 /g. This variables in ball milling have been studied, and in particular it was found that Ni-hard balls gave a faster grinding rate, but a higher contamination than was obtained with steel balls. Leaching with boiling HCI was effective in removing contamination introduced by these grinding media. The Rosin-Rammler function, R = 100 e - (x/x) n applied to the size distributions of the ground graphite. In the size range 70 - 1000 microns the distribution constant "n" equaled 1, which is consistent with publishing data for other materials. However, above and below this size range, the distribution constant approximated 2. This high value of n for the sub-sieve range has not been previously reported, but is not peculiar to artificial graphite as other materials were found to have a similar value of n...|$|R
