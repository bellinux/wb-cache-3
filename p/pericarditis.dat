5|$|A {{different}} type of sound, a pericardial friction rub {{can be heard in}} cases of <b>pericarditis</b> where the inflamed membranes can rub together.|$|E
5|$|Olds {{was briefly}} a stepbrother of author Gore Vidal after Olds' father married {{for the fourth}} time in June 1942, to Nina Gore Auchincloss. His father died of {{pneumonia}} on April 28, 1943, after hospitalization for constrictive <b>pericarditis</b> and Libman-Sacks endocarditis, at the age of 46, just prior to Olds' graduation from West Point.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of <b>pericarditis,</b> caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, <b>pericarditis,</b> and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, <b>pericarditis,</b> and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called <b>pericarditis.</b> This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{usefulness}} of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone or dexamethasone) {{in the treatment}} of TB is proven for TB meningitis and TB <b>pericarditis.</b> The dose for TB meningitis is dexamethasone 8 to 12mg daily tapered off over six weeks (for those who prefer more precise dosing should refer to Thwaites et al., 2004). The dose for <b>pericarditis</b> is prednisolone 60mg daily tapered off over four to eight weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pericarditis</b> is a {{frequent}} cardiac manifestation. Chronic aortic regurgitation due to aortic root disease may also be seen.|$|E
25|$|Carditis: Inflammation of {{the heart}} muscle (myocarditis) which can {{manifest}} as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, <b>pericarditis</b> with a rub, or a new heart murmur.|$|E
25|$|Serositis: Pleurisy (inflammation of the {{membrane}} around the lungs) or <b>pericarditis</b> (inflammation of {{the membrane}} around the heart); sensitivity = 56%; specificity = 86% (pleural is more sensitive; cardiac is more specific).|$|E
25|$|Pericardial effusion* is a {{collection}} of fluid in the pericardium. It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually hemangiosarcoma or a heart base tumor, idiopathic <b>pericarditis.</b> Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias, uremia, pericardial cysts, or hypoalbuminemia. Rarely pericardial effusion can be caused by infection and consist of pus. An echocardiogram should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor). Drainage of the fluid (pericardiocentesis) relieves the clinical signs and, in the case of idiopathic <b>pericarditis,</b> can be curative.|$|E
25|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} {{azotemia}} and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to <b>pericarditis</b> and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").|$|E
25|$|About 10 {{percent of}} people with {{reactive}} arthritis, especially those with a prolonged course of the disease, will develop cardiac manifestations, including aortic regurgitation and <b>pericarditis.</b> Reiter's syndrome {{has been described as}} a precursor of other joint conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis.|$|E
25|$|In animals, virulent {{strains of}} E. coli are {{responsible}} {{of a variety}} of diseases, among others septicemia and diarrhea in newborn calves, acute mastitis in dairy cows, colibacillosis also associated with chronic respiratory disease with Mycoplasma where it causes perihepatitis, <b>pericarditis,</b> septicaemic lungs, peritonitis etc. in poultry, and Alabama rot in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Moscoe is a {{prominent}} ally of David Miller, {{who was elected}} as Lastman's successor in the 2003 municipal election. Moscoe's own campaign for re-election in 2003 was complicated by a heart virus, {{which resulted in a}} rare condition known constrictive <b>pericarditis.</b> He organized most of his re-election campaign from a hospital bed, and did not publicize his illness until later in the year.|$|E
25|$|SLE {{may cause}} <b>pericarditis</b> - {{inflammation}} of the outer lining surrounding the heart, myocarditis - {{inflammation of the}} heart muscle, and/or endocarditis - inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. The endocarditis of SLE is non-infectious, and is also called (Libman–Sacks endocarditis). It involves either the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve. Atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac is {{used for}} {{short-term}} management of moderate to severe pain. It is usually not prescribed for longer than five days. Ketorolac is effective when administered with acetaminophen to control pain in neonates {{because it does not}} depress respiration as do opioids. Ketorolac is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. It is also used to treat dysmenorrhea. Ketorolac is used to treat idiopathic <b>pericarditis,</b> where it reduces inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Excess iron causes serious {{complications}} {{within the}} liver, heart, and endocrine glands. Severe symptoms include liver cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, and in extreme cases, liver cancer. Heart failure, growth impairment, diabetes and osteoporosis are life-threatening contributors brought upon by TM. The main cardiac abnormalities {{seen to have}} resulted from thalassemia and iron overload include left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, valveulopathies, arrhythmias, and <b>pericarditis.</b> Increased gastrointestinal iron absorption is seen in all grades of beta thalassemia and increased red blood cell destruction by the spleen due to ineffective erythropoiesis further releases additional iron into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute <b>pericarditis,</b> agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{complications that}} may arise include: <b>pericarditis,</b> endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel {{when they have}} angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, {{it is crucial to}} maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which may be involved in causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Smith (Anti-Sm) {{antibodies}} are a {{very specific}} marker for SLE. Approximately 99% of individuals without SLE lack anti-Sm antibodies, but only 20% of people with SLE have the antibodies. They are associated with central nervous system involvement, kidney disease, lung fibrosis and <b>pericarditis</b> in SLE, {{but they are not}} associated with disease activity. The antigens of the anti-Sm antibodies are the core units of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), termed A to G, and will bind to the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. Most commonly, the antibodies are specific for the B, B' and D units. Molecular and epidemiological studies suggest that anti-Sm antibodies may be induced by molecular mimicry because the protein shows some similarity to Epstein-Barr virus proteins.|$|E
25|$|In March 1992, {{living with}} {{advanced}} AIDS, he visited Kazan and {{appeared as a}} conductor {{in front of the}} audience at Musa Cälil Tatar Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, which now presents the Rudolf Nureyev Festival in Tatarstan. Returning to Paris, with a high fever, he was admitted to the hospital Notre Dame du Perpétuel Secours in Levallois-Perret, a suburb northwest of Paris, and was operated on for <b>pericarditis,</b> an inflammation of the membranous sac around the heart. At that time, what inspired him to fight his illness was the hope that he could fulfill an invitation to conduct Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet at an American Ballet Theatre benefit on 6 May 1992 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. He did so and was elated at the reception.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{progressive}} loss in kidney function {{over a period}} of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a bloodline relative with CKD. This disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, <b>pericarditis</b> or renal osteodystrophy (the latter included in the novel term CKD-MBD). CKD is a long-term form of kidney disease; thus, it is differentiated from acute kidney disease (acute kidney injury) in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months. CKD is an internationally recognized public health problem affecting 5–10% of the world population.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Hill's illness, Lee's performance {{was affected by}} heart troubles, which would eventually lead to his death in 1870; he {{had been diagnosed with}} <b>pericarditis</b> by his staff physicians in March 1863, though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack. He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, [...] "I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{collection}} of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension. Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, <b>pericarditis,</b> brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, [...] "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon." [...] He {{was back on the}} road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric [...] "Blowin' in the Wind".|$|E
500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is {{to do everything possible to}} aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute <b>pericarditis.</b> His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E

2500|$|Secondary AF – {{occurs in}} the setting of a primary {{condition}} that may be the cause of the AF, such as acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, <b>pericarditis,</b> myocarditis, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or other acute pulmonary disease ...|$|E
2500|$|S. pneumoniae is {{the main}} cause of {{community}} acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of septicemia in those infected with HIV. The organism also causes many types of pneumococcal infections other than pneumonia. [...] These invasive pneumococcal diseases include bronchitis, rhinitis, acute sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, meningitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, <b>pericarditis,</b> cellulitis, and brain abscess.|$|E
2500|$|Rubs [...] The pericardial {{friction}} rub can {{be heard}} in <b>pericarditis,</b> an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. This is a characteristic scratching, creaking, high-pitched sound emanating from the rubbing of both layers of inflamed pericardium. It is the loudest in systole, but can often be heard at the beginning {{and at the end of}} diastole. It is very dependent on body position and breathing, and changes from hour to hour.|$|E
2500|$|In rheumatic fever, these lesions can {{be found}} in any layer of the heart causing {{different}} types of carditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudate described as [...] "bread-and-butter" [...] <b>pericarditis,</b> which usually resolves without sequelae. [...] Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and wart formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. [...] Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendocardial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.|$|E
2500|$|Woods {{embarked}} for the Western Front from Fremantle on 23 December 1916 as a reinforcement for 48th Battalion, {{with the}} rank of private. He arrived in England in February 1917 but {{spent most of the}} next few months in hospital due to illness and did not join the battalion until September 1917. He continued to struggle with his health and had further periods in hospital, firstly in January 1918 due to <b>pericarditis</b> and later, in July 1918, with dysentery.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1992, Nureyev showed renewed {{signs of}} <b>pericarditis</b> but {{determined}} to forswear further treatment. His last public appearance was on 8 October 1992, at the premiere at Palais Garnier {{of a new}} production of La Bayadère that he choreographed after Marius Petipa for the Paris Opera Ballet. Nureyev had managed to obtain a photocopy of the original score by Minkus when in Russia in 1989. [...] The ballet was a personal triumph although the gravity of his condition was evident. The French Culture Minister, Jack Lang, presented him that evening on stage with France's highest cultural award, the Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.|$|E
2500|$|Leptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by bacteria {{of the genus}} Leptospira. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin. In dogs, transmission most commonly occurs by drinking puddle, pond, or ditch water contaminated by urine from infected wildlife such as squirrels or raccoons. [...] The liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by leptospirosis. [...] Vasculitis can occur, causing edema and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). [...] Myocarditis, <b>pericarditis,</b> meningitis, and uveitis are also possible sequelae.|$|E
2500|$|About 96% of {{individuals}} with aortic dissection present with severe pain that had a sudden onset. [...] The pain may {{be described as a}} tearing, stabbing, or sharp sensation; 17% {{of individuals}} feel the pain migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta. [...] The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection. Anterior chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta, while interscapular (back) pain is associated with descending aortic dissections. [...] If the pain is pleuritic in nature, it may suggest acute <b>pericarditis</b> caused by bleeding into the pericardial sac. [...] This is a particularly dangerous eventuality, suggesting that acute pericardial tamponade may be imminent. Pericardial tamponade is {{the most common cause of}} death from aortic dissection.|$|E
2500|$|Flint treated 13 {{hospital}} {{inmates who}} had rheumatic fever; 11 were [...] "acute", and 2 were [...] "sub-acute". He then compared {{the results of}} his dummy [...] "placeboic remedy" [...] with that of the active treatment’s already well-understood results. (Flint had previously tested, and reported on, the active treatment’s efficacy.) There {{was no significant difference between}} the results of the active treatment and his [...] "placeboic remedy" [...] in 12 of the cases in terms of disease duration, duration of convalescence, number of joints affected, and emergence of complications. In the thirteenth case, Flint expressed some doubt whether the particular complications that had emerged (namely, <b>pericarditis,</b> endocarditis, and pneumonia) would have been prevented if that subject had been immediately given the [...] "active treatment".|$|E
