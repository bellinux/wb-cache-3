40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} the possible association between educational level and previous <b>professional</b> <b>occupation,</b> and objective cognitive and functional evaluation {{in a sample}} of elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Through retrospective analysis of medical files, 174 patients with probable Alzheimer disease were randomly selected, classified and submitted to analysis according to previous <b>professional</b> <b>occupation</b> and years of formal education. Results: Subjects with lower education and less intellectually-demanding occupations performed worse than higher educated subjects in all cognitive subtests and on the functional scale. Conclusions: Results indicate that not only the total years of education, but also <b>professional</b> <b>occupation</b> has an impact on cognition and functioning in accordance with the hypothesis of cognitive reserve. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis, where subjects with higher education/ higher intellectual demand manifested first symptoms later than low education/ low intellectual demand subjects, with the latter group also exhibiting faster disease progression...|$|R
40|$|With 2006 Census data, {{this paper}} uses wages and salaries, employment, {{work in a}} <b>professional</b> <b>occupation,</b> and {{self-employment}} status as labour market outcomes to examine the economic performance of highly-educated immigrants in Canada. The aim is to identify the factors and deterninants most likely leading to a successfull integration in the Canadian labour market. Geographical, socio-demographic, immigration and educational characteristics {{are taken into account}} in the models. Those factors are examined for males and females respectively to see if the influences on outcomes differ by gender This study finds that married male immigrants who received their doctoral degrees in science and technology in Canada or the U. S. A earned the highest income and are the most likely to work in a <b>professional</b> <b>occupation.</b> Similar characteristics apply to female immigrants; however, contrary to most studies, the presence of children is not a barrier for female access to a <b>professional</b> <b>occupation.</b> Furthermore, highly-educated immigrants with high qualifications are relatively {{more likely to engage in}} self-employment and, surprisingly, the country of origin does not significantly affect the likelihood of being self-employed for males...|$|R

25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held <b>professional</b> <b>occupations</b> in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States.

2500|$|Immigration from Cuba to Union City began {{slowly in}} the late 1940s and early 1950s, when jobs in the local {{embroidery}} and textile factories were abundant. By 1955, the city's Cuban population was large enough that Fidel Castro visited Union City {{to raise money for}} his revolt against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, though a speech he gave one night at a bar on 26th Street, Le Molino Rojo ("The Red Mill") led to a brawl that resulted in Castro's arrest. Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, large numbers of Cubans in <b>professional</b> <b>occupations</b> emigrated to Union City, resulting in Union City's status as the nation's second-largest Cuban population, behind Miami, Florida, leading to the nickname [...] "Havana on the Hudson". Aspects of the enclave are explored in the 2009 publication The Cubans of Union City: Immigrants and Exiles in a New Jersey Community. In the ensuing decades, Cuban residents spread out to other communities of North Hudson County. West New York, at 19.64%, now has the highest percentage of Cubans in New Jersey, with Union City in second place, with 15.35%. These two municipalities have the highest Cuban population percentage in the United States outside of Florida. Moreover, Union City still boasts the largest Hispanic population percentage in New Jersey, at 84.7% by the 2010 Census. By the early 2000s Union City had become a mix of the Latin and Asian diasporas, with Dominicans cited as the fastest-growing ethnic group, and other groups including Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Salvadorans. Despite the reduction in the Cuban population, the major New York City television news outlets will invariably journey to Union City to interview citizens when developments in Cuba Cuban-American relations occur. As of the 2000 census, 5.94% of Union City's residents identified themselves as being of Ecuadorian ancestry, which was the third highest of any municipality in New Jersey and the seventh highest percentage of Ecuadorian people in any place in the United States with 1,000 or more residents identifying their ancestry. That number increased to 9.23% in the 2010 Census. As of the 2000 Census, 58.7% of the population was foreign born and 21.6% of residents were naturalized citizens, while 13.9% only speak English at home, whereas 80.7% reported that they spoke Spanish at home.|$|E
