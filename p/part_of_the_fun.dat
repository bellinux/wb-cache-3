500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] was pitched by Richard Appel, {{who decided to}} do {{something}} about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was {{that they were able to}} solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when he watches the ending.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure {{in one of the}} bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E

500|$|In the post-impact {{briefing}} at 01:00 PDT (08:00 UTC) on July 4, 2005, {{the first}} processed images revealed existing craters on the comet. NASA scientists stated {{they could not}} see the new crater that had formed from the impactor, but it was later discovered to be about 100meters (328ft) wide and up to 30 meters (98ft) deep. Lucy McFadden, one of the co-investigators of the impact, stated [...] "We didn't expect the success of one part of the mission [...] to affect a second part [...] But that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of science, to meet with the unexpected." [...] Analysis of data from the Swift X-ray telescope showed that the comet continued outgassing from the impact for 13 days, with a peak five days after impact. A total of 5 millionkilograms (11millionpounds) of water and between 10 and 25 millionkilograms (22 and 55millionpounds) of dust were lost from the impact.|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{praised the}} aspect of {{shifting}} between realms, particularly the visual effects involved. Similarly, Edge described the transition between realms as a [...] "complex and inspired piece of design", noting that it makes players think on different levels and consider [...] "each room as two rooms, {{the answer to a}} puzzle possibly existing in either." [...] However, the magazine criticized the save system for occasionally forcing players to replay large sections of the game to get to new areas. IGN stated that acquiring and learning the powers of Raziel's brothers constituted <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun,</b> and that Raziel's moves were well animated and articulated. Finding minimal difficulty in using camera controls, GameSpot likened them to those of Banjo-Kazooie and stated that players would want to adjust the camera deliberately to watch Raziel's movements. Presenting differences between Soul Reaver and the Tomb Raider series, AllGame stated that the game's puzzles would challenge [...] "all but the most experienced gamers", while Game Informer considered the puzzles [...] "difficult-to-the-point-of-insanity".

500|$|In October 2014, Kreisberg {{described}} the episodes as {{very important to}} both Barry and Oliver {{and what they are}} going thorough, while also promising [...] "one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode". Guggenheim added, [...] "It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I think <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash." [...] It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help [...] "introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond—Caitlin's former fiancée presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion—appears as Firestorm using his powers.|$|E

500|$|Fifteen {{original}} {{tracks were}} considered for inclusion on the album, which Reznor described as [...] "Highly conceptual. Quite noisy. Fucking cool." [...] Reznor also described the album as a [...] "collage of sound type of thing", citing musical inspiration from early Public Enemy records, specifically the production techniques of The Bomb Squad. Most of Year Zeros musical elements {{were created by}} Reznor solely on his laptop, {{as opposed to the}} instrument-heavy With Teeth. AllMusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: [...] "guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken." [...] Many reviews of the album compared the album's electronic sound to earlier Nine Inch Nails releases such as The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, while contrasting its heavily modified sounds to the more [...] "organic" [...] approach of With Teeth. Many critics also commented on the album's overall tone, including descriptions such as [...] "lots of silver and grey ambience" [...] and reference to the album's [...] "oblique tone". [...] The New York Times review described the album's sound by saying [...] "Hard beats are softened with distortion, static cushions the tantrums, sneaky bass lines float beneath the surface." [...] The article went on to describe individual tracks: [...] "And as usual the music is packed with details: [...] "Meet Your Master" [...] goes through at least three cycles of decay and rebirth; <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of [...] "The Warning" [...] is tracking the ever-mutating timbres." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} well-received critically. It {{currently}} has {{a rating of}} 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. In David Ansen's review for Newsweek magazine, he wrote that the film [...] "works equally as a love story, a baseball fable and a comedy, while ignoring the clichés of each genre". Vincent Canby praised Shelton's direction in his review for The New York Times; [...] "he demonstrates the sort of expert comic timing and control that allow him {{to get in and}} out of situations so quickly that they're over before one has time to question them. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> in watching Bull Durham is in the awareness that a clearly seen vision is being realized.

2500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} {{critical}} of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly around Earth's moon. Writing for Slate, Phil Plait remarked, [...] "The science mistakes were so egregious and so obvious that they kept pulling me {{right out of the}} story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search." [...] In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to [...] "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was [...] "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of the show is [...] "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, [...] "When [...] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{nature of}} the hills I have already explained, and this time we have had no lakes or {{ornamental}} water.

But on this occasion we have nothing of the kind, nor have we made use of a green-colored tablecloth we sometimes use to drape our hills.

They said indeed that the electric trams and the '70 buildings, and that criminal advertisement that glares upon the Forum, outraged their aesthetic feelings unspeakably; but that was only <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun.</b> And indeed Rome is such a wonderful place that it made Miss Winchelsea forget some of her most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times, and Helen, taken unawares, would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected things.
