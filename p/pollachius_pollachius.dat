The disinfectant was selected due to its potential compatibility with probiotics, since it was more effective against Gram-negative bacteria than against lactic acid bacteria and yeast. However, the presence of formaldehyde reduced the intake of P. acidilactici in Artemia. Consequently, the disinfection was stopped before Bactocell supplementation to the nauplii fed to pollack (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>pollachius)</b> larvae. The mean weight of pollack was higher with this probiotic treatment. Growth was even better with the combination of Levucell and Bactocell, but the yeast should be introduced circumspectly.

Its abundance-at-age shows strong seasonal variations, with a marked increase from spring to summer followed by a decline through autumn and winter. These patterns relate partly to seasonal changes in depth distribution and catchability. Combined with the observation that spawning-stage pollack are abundant in spring, we interpret these patterns to suggest that pollack in Masfjorden represent a dynamically independent unit. Seasonal changes in abundance are less marked for cod, and seasonal changes in depth distribution seem insignificant. However, cod shows an unusual pattern in length at age, with no apparent growth in summer and fast growth in autumn.

The complexity of the echoes increased as the aspect angle of the fish moved away from the normal aspect. The echoes in both the time and frequency domains were easily distinguishable among the four species of fish and were generally consistent within species. A cochlear model consisting of a bank of band-passed filters was also used to analyze the echoes.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. smolts are produced under intensive rearing conditions. They reach smolt size and are transferred to net pens in seawater during their first autumn under a short natural daylength, instead of being synchronised with the natural period for seawater entry of wild smolts under increasing daylength the next spring. Escapes of cultured salmon may threaten the genetic integrity of wild salmon, {{but there is little}} information about the impact of escaped out-of-season smolts. Do they display normal migratory behaviour typical of spring smolts, and can they survive at sea and return as mature adults? To answer these questions, about 23000 spring smolts (1 yr old) and a similar number of autumn out-of-season smolts were tagged with T-bar anchor tags and released from net pens in Masfjord on the west coast of Norway in 2007, 2008 and 2009. A further 43 out-of-season smolts were equipped with acoustic transmitters in 2008.

Final bacterial concentrations in the wells were 106 and 104 CFU ml– 1. Eggs and larvae not exposed to bacteria were used as unchallenged controls. Challenged controls were exposed to Vibrio anguillarum strain 610. Eggs were challenged approximately 48 h prior to hatching and mortality was recorded daily throughout the yolk-sac period. In spite of the high challenge dose of 106 CFU ml– 1, only 5 bacterial strains tested caused higher mortality than the unchallenged controls. Four of these strains were identified by 16 S rDNA and gyrase B gene (GyrB) seq encing as resembling V. anguillarum and 1 strain resembled Carnobacterium sp. Most of the larvae exposed to these strains died within 10 d of challenge. Serotyping of the strains resembling V. anguillarum gave inconclusive results.

Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to these stocks. These recommendations are given for two‐year periods and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES recommended reducing catches by 20 % as a precautionary measure compared to 2009 ‐ 2011 for the three stocks. Considering that TACs are in force for whiting and pollack in the Bay of Biscay, the lack of diagnosis and the application of a precautionary approach could result in reductions in French fishing possibilities. Rapid improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority.

Despite evidence {{for the importance of}} fish and shellfish to diet, virtually nothing is known as to the methods of procurement. Initially, work focussed on the palaeoenvironments of Scottish West Coast Mesolithic coastal sites, to establish the resources available to Mesolithic coastal dwellers. A range of archaeological/ethnohistorical fishing gear and food procurement strategies is described, together with views of field archaeologists, bushcraft practitioners and experimental archaeologists. These perspectives together with palaeoenvironmental data were considered when producing fishing gear utilising resources and technologies available during the Mesolithic. Fieldwork and experiments were conducted at the Scottish West Coast Mesolithic coastal sites of Ulva Cave, the Oban area, the island of Oronsay, and Sand, together with South Uist and the Urr estuary on the Solway Firth. The fishing gear manufactured reflects current debates as to fishing strategies, as such, several archaeological ‘models’ were tested. The gear also enabled an attempt at targeting the main fish and crab species found in the middens; Pollachius virens, Labridae, <b>Pollachius</b> <b>pollachius,</b> Carcinus maenas, Liocarcinus depurator and Cancer pagurus. In addition to fishing experiments, ecological surveys and forage exercises established the species present and available to a contemporary coastal forager, providing an indication as to the vigour and abundance of shoreline species. This data was compared to data from the middens, providing an insight into potential collection strategies. Exploratory procurement and manufacture experiments were conducted that tested a variety of materials, including their suitability for use, while bait tests assessed bait desirability.

For pelagic trawls, designed to be fished in the water column with little or no contact on the seabed, mesh openings in the forward and belly sections can be metres across making them relatively inefficient filters and reliant on herding to guide fish into the codend where meshes are small enough to prevent fish from escaping. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the behaviour of fish, particularly large gadoids, during pelagic trawling and as a result trawl designs and fishing strategies are likely not optimized either for commercial harvest or research sampling. The first investigation described in this thesis revealed that shoaling Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) captured in a commercial fishing setting using a pelagic trawl dove following vessel passage and swam towards the approaching trawl, with a significant proportion of fish escaping beneath the trawl. Once they were inside the trawl, the cod turned and swam slowly in the direction of trawling but were carried deeper into the trawl by its greater speed through water. They remained in the lower portion of the trawl, suggesting the top panel played little role in retaining fish and could be modified to reduce drag without reducing the catch. Despite the use of three acoustic sensors and multiple mechanical catch sensors mounted to the trawl, poor information was available during trawling on the species, sizes, and quantity of fish entering and already inside the trawl. In a commercial fishery, this would likely result in bycatch and discards. In response to this information gap, an in-trawl camera system, DeepVision, was developed to identify and measure all fish as they passed into the codend. Stereo photogrammetric techniques were developed to calculate lengths of fish from the images, and counts by species and individual fish lengths match well with standard physical sampling of the catch. The system has generated significant interest within the fisheries research community as a tool to provide enhanced information during research trawling and was tested during an annual ecosystem survey in the Norwegian Sea. Benefits shown during this trial included documentation of fine-scale patterns in spatial distribution by species and sizes, documentation of external parasites on Atlantic cod and saithe (Pollachius virens), and positive identification of the species and size composition of acoustically visible layers. The mis-identification of whiting (Merlangius merlangius) as pollack (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>pollachius)</b> during routine catch sampling was uncovered during review of the DeepVision data, demonstrating its value as a tool to quality check data even after the catch has been discarded. The technique opens the possibility to reduce sampling mortality while still registering large numbers of fish by trawling with an open codend or in conjunction with multisampler equipment to collect small, directed, biological samples for physical analysis...|$|E
