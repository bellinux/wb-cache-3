5|$|The {{rudiments of}} <b>perspective</b> arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), who {{attempted}} to draw in <b>perspective</b> using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines.

Brunelleschi's own <b>perspective</b> paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E

This paper will discuss Western European <b>perspectives</b> towards traditional and folk dance and investigate the origins of such <b>perspectives,</b> if they do indeed exist. In doing so the reasoning of Western European <b>perspectives</b> will be examined, considered and questioned alongside that of non-Western European <b>perspectives.</b> The thesis is compiled {{from a wide range}} of textual sources that explore Western European world views in relation to non-Western European <b>perspectives</b> to argue that such <b>perspectives</b> do, to a large extent, shape and pervade the wider field of dance...|$|R
