The analysis indicates that, in Egypt, the legal framework of privatisation did not explicitly incorporate FDI participation. FDI regulations were developed separately from privatisation regulations. As a result, a foreign investor in Egypt is faced with multiple laws and multiple regulating agencies for FDI. Unlike in Argentina, the legal framework of privatisation explicitly incorporated the participation of FDI, and FDI regulations were totally liberalised. This explains why FDI participation in Argentine privatisation during 1989 – 2000 accounted for 63 % of <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceeds,</b> while, in Egypt, FDI participation accounted for only 24 % of <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceeds</b> during 1993 – 2000. egypt; fdi; argentina; regulations; privatisation...|$|E

In much critical policy sociology the terms marketisation, privatisation and commercialisation are used interchangeably. Our argument is that each of these denotes distinct, albeit related, characteristics of contemporary schooling and the impact of the Global Education Industry (GEI). We define marketisation as the series of policy logics that aim to create quasi-markets in education; privatisation as the development of quasi-markets in education that privilege parental choice, school autonomy and venture philanthropy; and commercialisation as the creation, marketing and sale of educational goods and services to schools by external providers. In this chapter we explain the manifestations of each of these forms and offer two cases of actors situated within the GEI, the OECD and Pearson plc, to outline how commercialisation and <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceed</b> at the level of policy and practice...|$|R

In 1990, the UK government opted for a competitive electricity market over expanding nuclear power. Now, the option of opting for a competitive electricity market may not exist.

The new government, committed to fundamental reforms necessary for a market economy, did not take power until after the second general election in March 1992. One outcome of this long pre-transition period was that the privatisation programme had to evolve gradually in the course of transformation, without ever having been planned in a comprehensive and integrated manner. <b>Privatisation</b> <b>proceeded</b> on five different fronts: small privatisation, privatisation of agriculture, housing, small and medium-sized enterprises and mass privatisation. The article discusses the progress of each aspect and provides up-to-date information and data on their progress. The privatisation of agriculture and housing were the most crucial aspects of the overall policy, with significant impacts on economic growth and the progress of the transformation programme. The privatised agricultural sector grew very rapidly and made a major contribution to pulling the whole economy out of the 'transformational recession'. Privatised housing created a significant wealth effect amongst the urban population, providing many of them with collateral or start-up capital. The privatisation of state-owned enterprises, however, was carried out with much more difficulty and controversy. Although auctions were to be the main method of transfer, ensuring a significant income for the treasury, in practice many enterprises were privatised through other methods, bringing in less income and giving rise to allegations of political favouritism. Another aspect of privatisation was the weak corporate governance mechanism which replaced state ownership. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (probably about half) were sold or transferred to their employees, without any outsider interest. The performance of this sector has to be monitored closely in order {{to assess the impact of}} massive insider privatisation, reminiscent of Russia's privatisation programme. Mass privatisation too, by distributing enterprise shares amongst the general public, resulted in the increased power of insiders. The shares of nearly 100 enterprises were transferred to the private sector over the first year of the implementation of this programme. Although the privatisation programme progressed very rapidly, no serious attention was paid to problems of corporate governance. Without concentrated ownership or the involvement of financial intermediaries to oversee and monitor the managers, it is unlikely that the expected efficiency gains will be realised. The political crisis resulting from the collapse of informal financial schemes brought the whole reform process, including the privatisation programme, to a halt in early 1997. It is expected that, with a new government in power, there will be a new push for reforms and an increased pace of privatisation. It is hoped that the renewed efforts will also deal with the shortcomings of the previous schemes-particularly the corporate governance issues. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{justice and}} the welfare state: {{constraints}} {{of social and economic}} change. This paper reviews welfare privatisation in Europe with special reference to the UK. The UK is the EU member country in which welfare <b>privatisation</b> has <b>proceeded</b> most rapidly, although pressures on the welfare state are not obviously any more severe here than elsewhere. Privatisation was certainly a central element in Mrs Thatcher's attack on state welfare, yet the policy seems to continue just as vigorously under the centre-left New Labour government. Part of the explanation for interest in privatisation lies in the context of economic globalisation and the technological shifts which reinforce demands for the redirection of state spending to areas where it will enhance economic competitiveness. However, these factors also affect other countries. We need to understand how they are able to exert such a distinctive impact on practical policy-making in the UK. One answer is to do with current cultural shifts, bound up with a transition to a Risk Society. This idea is influential in relation to the Third Way ideology of the current government. However, available evidence from studies of responses to concrete welfare policy changes in areas where privatisation is on the policy agenda indicates that the values of citizens do not endorse privatisation, as the theory implies. An alternative account {{is to be found in}} the distinctive UK constitutional and institutional policy-making framework, which allows the executive great autonomy in pursuing its policies, and the lack of a strong trade union influence. The paper contrasts policy-making in the UK with that in the dominant social insurance tradition of Europe, and particularly in France, in which trade unions, pension scheme members', citizens' and other groups have high legitimacy and considerable influence in relation to welfare, and are able to obstruct reform. The paper concludes that to understand why privatisation reforms are more rapid and successful in some countries, it is important to take into account the way policy is made, as well as considering arguments about the economic pressures on the welfare state and shifts in contemporary cultural values. UK experience is unusual, and is strongly influenced by the peculiarities of the national policy-making system. Elsewhere in the EU, private pensions and welfare provision will be much slower in emerging, and will require a substantial involvement from government in order to facilitate their development...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Over {{the past}} decade, German {{hospitals}} have been privatised {{at a rate}} not seen in any other country. In response to massive public-sector debt and the resulting investment backlog, many {{state and local governments}} have been privatising hospitals. The most common arguments for privatisation are repeated in a recent study commissioned by the association of private hospital owners (Bundesverband Deutscher Privatkliniken - BDPK) namely that private hospitals manage in a more efficient manner and are economically more successful (Augurzky, Beivers et al., 2009). Indeed, in some cases, private for-profit hospital companies have invested generously and turned inefficient public hospitals into profitable private ones. Of interest to us is the cost of this trend, to workers and patients. Assertions that privatisation has not undermined the quality of care are highly dubious. In German public opinion, there is broad scepticism about the privatisation of hospitals. While there are very few scientific studies on the effects of privatisation on patients, there are a growing number of local ballot initiatives and other campaigns to fight it. There are widespread fears that for-profit health-care provision would undermine the existing system, which provides universally accessible medical treatment at a relatively high level of quality. Even among physicians, often considered the winners of privatisation, there is scepticism (Bundesärztekammer, 2007). We will argue below that one reason for these problems is the effect of privatisation on employees. Trade unionists and works councils in privatised hospitals have seen a severe deterioration in working conditions (Ver. di Vertrauensleute und Vorsitzende und Mitglieder von Konzernbetriebsräten und Konzern-Jugend- und Auszubildenden-Vertretungen privater Krankenhauskonzern, 2008). Since personnel accounts for about 60 per cent of hospitals’ overall costs (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2008 b), private for-profit hospitals can only make profits at the expense of employees. These perceptions are supported by the statistics presented in this paper, and trade unions and employees protest — in cooperation with other parts of civil society - almost every planned privatisation. Drawing on publicly available quantitative data and qualitative interviews, we map out in this paper the trend toward the privatisation of German hospitals. We begin by showing how and why <b>privatisation</b> has <b>proceeded</b> in Germany despite the controversy. Then we examine the effects of privatisation on workers and patients. We will conclude with some implications for policy and practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{delivered}} rapid structural {{change to the}} Australian electricity sector. The common conceptualisation of the sector's restructuring has been narrowly based around sector-specific regulatory change {{and the creation of}} a national electricity market. This thesis argues that such a focus provides an incomplete and inaccurate explanation of the transformation. Three closely interrelated layers of policies and actions embodying the precepts of neoliberalism, and implemented by the state, have driven the sector's transformation. These policies and actions transcend 'electricity-centric' policies and encompass policies which have become systemic to the Australian public sector as well as a third layer which has transformed the prevailing industrial paradigm across all industry sectors. The drivers of the electricity sector's restructuring [...] and the outcomes and beneficiaries arising [...] form the core research focus of this thesis. The research task is addressed by using the analytical framework of the French theory of régulation. The analysis reveals that the electricity sector has been Australia's second largest contributor of <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceeds,</b> remains dominated by government ownership and has falling levels of foreign ownership. Higher relative wage levels and union membership are also evident as have been job losses and substantial real price increases for households whereas those for business have generally fallen. The purported 'reform' centrepiece, the national electricity market, was found to be increasingly uncompetitive due to its own regulatory regime and market manipulation by government-owned companies. In addition, the sector exhibits a heightened precariousness: an unprecedented financial vulnerability arising from a strong appetite for debt and derivatives and exacerbated by payments to government owners not by new investment in generation capacity; increasing tensions between the nation-state and local-state concerning the national electricity market and compromises with labour; and an exposure to political and financial risks from the sector's global integration. The clear winners from the sector's restructuring are the owners of capital and the state, particularly the local-state, although the sustainability of this situation is questionable. The analysis also generates a number of propositions about the application of régulation theory to sector-based research...|$|E
40|$|In the 1980 s, most {{developing}} countries faced macroeconomic structural {{problems such as}} high inflation and increase in foreign debt. Most of the {{developing countries}} had to engage in Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Policies (ERSAP) to meet the IMF and World Bank conditionality criteria for their assistance to overcome their economic problems. Privatisation was a major policy of the World Bank's ERSAP. Developing governments started to privatise their state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, domestic investment in these countries {{was not enough to}} carry out the whole privatisation programme. Therefore, the need for FDI to participate in privatisation and close the gap between domestic saving and domestic investment became imperative. The approach to the application of privatisation and attracting FDI differed among developing countries. While some countries applied speedy privatisation and welcomed unlimited participation of FDI in the programme, others were more conservative in the speed of application and the acceptance of FDI participation. One of the factors that affected the speed of application and the participation of FDI is the institutional and regulatory frameworks applied in each country. This research explores the effects of privatisation and FDI on long-run economic growth during the era of intensive privatisation of the 1990 s. Hence, the time period covered for this research is from 1971 to 2000. Case studies on the frameworks of privatisation and FDI in Egypt and Argentina are used to show how different institutional and regulatory frameworks affected the application of privatisation and participation of FDI and hence yielded different <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceeds</b> and FDI inflows. Egypt followed a slow and cautious approach to privatisation, and partial liberalisation of FDI regulations, while Argentina followed a speedy and aggressive approach to privatisation and fully liberalised their FDI regulations. As a result, Argentina had already completed 2 / 3 of its privatisation programme within the first 5 years of the programme, while Egypt took 10 years to privatise 2 / 3 of the SOEs participating in the programme. In addition, Argentina was more successful in attracting more FDI inflows to participate in the privatisation programme than Egypt. The effects on long-run economic growth are estimated using Error Correction Models for Egypt and Argentina over the period of 1971 - 2000. Dynamic fixed effects models are also used for a sample of 47 developing countries over the period of 1988 - 2000 to obtain more generalised results for the developing countries. The results reveal that privatisation had positive effects on economic growth during the privatisation era. The effects of FDI on economic growth, however, depend on the sectoral distribution of these FDI inflows. It is found that FDI had negative effects on economic growth in Argentina during the privatisation era because the majority of the FDI inflows were participating in the privatisation of the primary sector; mainly the petroleum sector. In Egypt, on the other hand, FDI had positive, yet limited, effects on economic growth during the privatisation era as the majority of the FDI inflows were directed to the manufacturing sector.

40|$|Privatisation and {{competition}} {{were supposed to}} make electricity cheaper in SA - but John Spoehr finds that the opposite has happened SOUTH Australians {{have good reason to}} be angry about {{what has happened to the}} electricity industry in SA. The former Liberal state government leased the assets for less than their true value. Electricity prices have skyrocketed about 30 per cent for businesses and households. The state has lost control of one of its most strategically important assets at a time when market-based electricity systems appear to be risky business. The spectacular collapse of giant US energy firm Enron began a sorry saga of electricity industry failures, with recent blackouts in New York, London and Italy raising more serious questions about the reliability of market-based electricity systems. Against this global scenario, electricity price rises are hitting SA consumers hard. The crunch for households came with the arrival of the winter quarter AGL bill. Reports of elderly people and families on low incomes experiencing hardship are widespread; AGL recently indicated about 3000 people had sought assistance with payment of bills. These are set to escalate when a higher tariff rate applying over the summer period pushes bills to dizzy new heights. As part of its ETSA sales pitch, the former Liberal South Australian government claimed that privatisation would bring about reductions in electricity prices and make SA more competitive with the eastern states, helping to attract new business investment and generate jobs. It was claimed a privately-run industry would be more efficient as it would be subject to the discipline of competition - and that risks associated with SA’s participation in the National Electricity Market would be passed on to the private operators. Complex regulatory structures designed to mimic competition have failed to obscure the reality that competition in the electricity industry is illusory in SA. Privatisation {{and competition}} were supposed to create competition between generators, wholesalers and retailers to make electricity cheaper. The reality is something different. While the electricity generation sector in SA was broken up prior to privatisation, the potential for competition between generators was limited as each were designed to play particular roles. Some meet ongoing baseline demand while others are designed to meet peak demand in winter and summer. The only real prospect of competition with SA generators came from interstate through inter-connection with the Victorian and New South Wales systems. In any case, SA had long been importing electricity from Victoria to meet shortfalls in supply and because it was cheaper at the time. The proposed Riverlink inter-connector with NSW offered some prospect of cheaper power for SA, though the former Liberal government did not back its construction, suggesting that the introduction of further competition in the generation sector would reduce <b>privatisation</b> <b>proceeds.</b> They were probably right, but at what cost to the consumer? The electricity retail sector is also far from a glowing testimony to privatisation. Few small electricity consumers have transferred from AGL to alternative electricity retailers, such as Origin Energy and TXU. The Essential Services Commission of SA recently reported that by the end of August, 2003, less than 1 per cent of the 750, 000 small electricity consumers in SA had switched from AGL to an alternative retailer. There is little or no incentive to change retailers at the moment. Moreover it appears that consumers take some comfort in the idea of not having to shop around for electricity. One of the central arguments for privatisation of ETSA was that it would result in a net financial benefit to South Australians. We were told the proceeds from privatisation would exceed the loss of income from the sale or lease of the assets. Given the continued profitability of the electricity industry in SA, it is now beyond reasonable doubt that SA taxpayers are about $ 3 billion worse off. Solutions to challenges facing the electricity industry will not be found in the ideological mirage that is competition but rather in the recognition of the limitations of competition (or simulated competition as it currently is) as the mechanism for managing the industry. The industry must be capable of responding to the challenges of environmental sustainability and equitable, affordable price outcomes. This will require much greater collaboration toward publicly defined objectives than the current National Electricity Market makes provision for. The SA government is now confronted with a policy quagmire flowing from privatisation and National Competition Policy (NCP). The NCP fuelled the fragmentation of a highly integrated electricity industry while privatisation compromised the influence that government can have in addressing critical energy policy challenges. In the short term, the government has options available. An independent panel of experts should be established to review options for achieving lower electricity prices as part of the Electricity Distribution Price Review being undertaken by the Essential Services Commission of SA (ESCOSA). Consumers should be adequately resourced to make an informed contribution to this complex process. The SA government should move to amend the Essential Services Commission Act 2002, which governs the operation of the ESCOSA, to ensure that ESCOSA has the authority to make detailed determinations in relation to the social and environmental consequences of electricity industry arrangements in SA. It might also join with other state governments to establish a national Sustainable Energy Forum and Co-operative Research Centre to drive rapid uptake of renewable energy generation and energy efficiency technologies and strategies. Electricity crises in other countries are prompting debate about the role of government in this industry, including ownership and control of assets. The state government may seek to forge a partnership with the NSW government to invest in electricity generation and retail in SA. It could initiate discussions with other states to ensure that social and environmental objectives are embedded in energy policy and are central to the design and operation of electricity systems. Ultimately, states that have privatised electricity assets should aim to restore the monopoly components of the industry, including transmission and distribution, to public ownership. While governments investing in electricity assets may now seem out of the question, changed circumstances, enlightened leadership and political will mean it is possible tomorrow. And it will be the voter’s choice. John Spoehr is executive director of the Centre for Labour Research, Adelaide University. This article first appeared in the Adelaide Revie...|$|E
