5|$|April 5: At Los Alamos, Emilio Segrè {{receives}} the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from Oak Ridge, and within ten days discovers that the spontaneous fission rate {{is too high}} {{for use in a}} gun-type fission weapon (because of Pu-240 isotope <b>present</b> <b>as</b> an impurity in the Pu-239).|$|E
5|$|As {{departments}} {{have changed over}} the years, some are no longer <b>present</b> <b>as</b> they have been abolished or merged, with most departments present being mainly based in Brussels while retaining a minor presence in Luxembourg. There are however some departments which are still entirely based in the city per the 1965 agreement.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may <b>present</b> <b>as</b> impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may <b>present</b> <b>as</b> slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
30|$|The {{appearance}} of SCC <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> GGNs {{is similar to}} that of adenocarcinomas <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> GGNs on CT images. In adenocarcinomas <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> GGNs, the nodules become larger and their solid components increase over time. The last CT images before operation still showed 64 % of the ground glass opacity component in a three-dimensional volumetric analysis [9]. Histologically, the solid components of these GGNs demonstrate stromal invasion, collapsed alveoli, fibrosis, and masses of tumor cells or macrophages that fill the alveolar sacs, whereas in the areas of pure ground glass appearance tumor cells are spread along the alveolar lumen [10]. In the present case, the tumor initially <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a pure GGN and gradually developed a solid component; the pathological findings were in agreement with these CT findings (Fig.  2). Air-containing spaces or a bubble-like appearance were reportedly noted in one SCC <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> a GGN, this phenomenon being characteristic of adenocarcinomas <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> GGNs [2]. In these respects, SCC and adenocarcinoma <b>presenting</b> <b>as</b> GGNs appear similar on CT scans.|$|R

5|$|Neptunium accumulates in {{commercial}} household ionization-chamber smoke detectors from decay of the (typically) 0.2 microgram of americium-241 initially <b>present</b> <b>as</b> {{a source of}} ionizing radiation. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in an ionization smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{video game}} {{publications}} have provided praise and criticism on Alucard's character. In Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, where Alucard was <b>present</b> <b>as</b> Genya Arikado, reviewers noted {{that although he}} fell into a stereotypical character mold, the greater concentration on supporting characters was a welcomed change from previous Castlevania games.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's office {{records show}} {{meetings}} at which Khrushchev was <b>present</b> <b>as</b> early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship.

5000|$|A message framing {{technique}} known as temporal framing {{has been used}} to examine the impact of CFC on persuasive messages regarding various behaviours. The temporal frame allows the expected outcomes of a behaviour (benefits and losses) to be <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> occurring in the short-term or in the long-term. This technique allows for researchers to implement two different frames: one with the negative consequences <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> short-term and the positive consequences <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> long-term. In the opposite time frame, the positive consequences are <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> short-term and the negative consequences as long-term.|$|R

50|$|Also, {{the same}} game {{structure}} can always be <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a gain or a loss game. Because of the Framing effect players respond completely differently when it is <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a gain or a loss.

5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if <b>present,</b> <b>as</b> in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid. Alkaline hydrolysis experiments {{show that most}} of the phenolic acids are <b>present</b> <b>as</b> bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds. Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
