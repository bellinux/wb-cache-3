5000|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the WMTS, medical telemetry devices generally could be operated on an unlicensed basis on vacant television channels 7-13 (174-216 MHz) and 14-46 (470-668 MHz) or on a licensed but secondary basis to <b>private</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> operations in the 450-470 MHz frequency band. This meant that wireless medical telemetry operations had to accept interference from the primary users of these frequency bands, i.e., the television broadcasters and <b>private</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> licensees. Further, if a wireless medical telemetry operation caused interference to television or <b>private</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> transmissions, the user of the wireless medical telemetry equipment would be responsible for rectifying the problem, even if that meant shutting down the medical telemetry operation.The FCC was concerned that certain regulatory developments, including the advent of digital television (DTV) service, would result in more intensive use of these frequencies by the primary services, subjecting wireless medical telemetry operations to greater interference than before and perhaps precluding such operations entirely in many instances. To ensure that wireless medical telemetry devices can operate free of harmful interference, the FCC decided to establish the WMTS. In a Report and Order released on June 12, 2000, the FCC allocated a total of 14 megahertz of spectrum to WMTS on a primary basis. At the same time, it adopted a number of regulations to ensure that the WMTS frequencies are used effectively and efficiently for their intended medical purpose. The WMTS rules took effect on October 16, 2000 ...|$|R
50|$|Land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> system (LMRS), {{also called}} public land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> or <b>private</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio,</b> is a {{wireless}} communications system {{intended for use}} by terrestrial users in vehicles (mobiles) or on foot (portables).

50|$|DMR (digital mobile radio), and dPMR (digital <b>private</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio)</b> {{are more}} recent ETSI-{{standard}}s for digital mobile radio using two-slot TDMA and FDMA respectively. The Tier 3 standard for these systems defines a trunking protocol {{very similar to}} MPT1327 and is intended as a potential migration path for existing and perhaps future trunking customers. Tier 3 equipment is (late 2011) now becoming available, so the impact on TETRA and MPT 1327 {{is yet to be}} seen, but may well be significant. However, it is unlikely that in terms of cost that the complicated new DMR/dPMR equipment will be able to compete with the simpler MPT1327 equipment for some time, if ever.|$|E
50|$|A trunked {{version of}} the <b>private</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> (PMR) concept that is defined under the {{standard}} MPT 1327 (MPT1327) is widely used and provides significant advantages over the simpler single station systems that are in use. MPT1327 enables stations to communicate over wider areas as well as having additional facilities. In view of the very high cost of setting up trunked networks, they are normally run by large leasing companies or consortia that provide a service to {{a large number of}} users. In view of the wider areas covered by these networks and the greater complexity, equipment has to be standardised so that suppliers can manufacture in higher volumes and thereby reduce costs to acceptable levels. Most trunked radio systems follow the MPT1327 format.|$|E

40|$|Several trunked <b>private</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> (PMR) {{systems have}} been {{designed}} over the last decade, most of which have symmetric downlink and uplink channel capacities. These systems may not be spectrally efficient in case of group or broadcast-based voice and data calls, a common feature of PMR systems. We propose a new asymmetric PMR system comprising a wideband OFDM-based downlink and a narrowband uplink, which not only achieves a better spectral efficiency but also can support high bit rate multimedia applications. The system is shown to have high trunking efficiency since all users are assumed to use the pool of channels available in the wideband downlink. In this paper, we study the performance and capacity of a <b>private</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> system using a digital audio broadcasting (DAB) downlink.
