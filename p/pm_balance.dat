The branch engine worked seven trips down to Bullo Pill Jen, one a pick-up goods; {{there was also}} a short working down to Quidchurch to fetch ore back to Bilson, and a late trip if {{required}} leaving Bilson at 6.0 <b>p.m.</b> There were <b>balancing</b> workings, including two pick-ups which called at the various sidings as required; the journey time for a through train down from Bilson was usually 20 minutes (25 in the opposite direction), while the pick-ups were allowed one hour in each direction.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} soil erosion rates {{had been done}} on a {{slightly}} and long slope of cultivated area in Ciawi - Bogor, using 137 Cs technique. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the applicability of the 137 Cs technique in obtaining spatially distributed information of soil redistribution at small catchment. This paper reports the result of the choice of conversion model for erosion rate estimates and the sensitive of the changes in the model parameter. For this purpose, small site was selected, namely landuse I (LU-I). The top of a slope was chosen as a reference site. The erosion/deposit rate of individual sampling points was estimated using the conversion models, namely Proportional Model (<b>PM),</b> Mass <b>Balance</b> Model 1 (MBM 1) and Mass Balance Model 2 (MBM 2). A comparison of the conversion models showed that the lowest value is obtained by the PM. The MBM 1 gave values closer to MBM 2, but MBM 2 gave a reliable values. In this study, a sensitivity analysis suggest that the conversion models are sensitive to changes in parameters that depend on the site conditions, but insensitive to changes in  parameters that interact to the onset of 137 Cs fallout input.   Keywords: soil erosion, environmental radioisotope, cesiu...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} empirical connections between humanistic psychology and psychoanalysis by exploring a single measurable construct from each discipline. Specifically, we examined the relationship between self-actualization (SA) and psychological mindedness (PM). A cross-sectional design was selected to explore interrelations among study variables at a single timepoint. The participants were 204 students enrolled at midsize Eastern (Fordham) and Western (Boise State) US universities. Participant volunteers filled out the following measures: the Psychological Mindedness Scale (<b>PM</b> Scale), the <b>Balanced</b> Index of Psychological Mindedness (BPIM), the Brief Index of Self-Actualization – Revised (BISA-R), and the Short Index of Self-Actualization (SISA) along with a demographic form. SA and PM were not affected by demographic variables of age, gender, or ethnicity/race but were strongly and positively associated with one another. This study establishes empirical connections between humanistic psychology and psychoanalysis at the construct level. These connections have disciplinary and interdisciplinary implications...|$|R

In this latter case, interpretation may be complicated by the joint action of combinatorial uncertainty and stochastic effects of the PCR. We explore this particular and so far little noticed aspect of mixture interpretation by first providing a complete quantitative combinatorial analysis of the two-person mixture model (2 <b>PM)</b> at highly <b>balanced</b> ratio of contributors, and then by carrying out a calibration study of the 2 PM model on good quality experimental mixtures. The calibration tests provided the evidence {{for the existence of}} irregular distribution of peak heights, that can misguide the correct genotype assignment at high template ratios too. Repeating the experiment, performing Bayesian analysis to the whole evidence and developing a careful joint prediction of all plausible genotype datasets is highly mandatory in these cases, prior to set evidentiary LRs and use them in court...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vegetation}} is capable of capturing contaminants from air. In particular, plant leaves can act as a biological filter and as a sink for airborne particles and their associated Semi Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs) such as Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), influencing their environmental fate. In order to assess the filtration performance of plants with respect to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and their associated SVOCs, deposition on vegetation has recently been investigated by a number of different methods (field, laboratory studies as well as modelling approaches). Some authors studied the particulate matter uptake and retention capacity of different plant species, showing that some plant type are much more efficient than other at collecting particulate matter and PAHs contained upon them. Other researches were focused on measuring particle deposition velocities not only for specific tree species but also at different wind speeds. Furthermore different predictive approaches were developed to evaluate PM uptake by trees in urban areas and to estimate dry particle matter deposition on leaf surfaces using species-specific deposition velocity. Nevertheless, the existing multimedia fate models do not generally account for <b>PM</b> mass <b>balance</b> in predicting <b>PM</b> deposition to vegetation and the corresponding chemical flux. In the present study we used a dynamic multimedia fate model (SoilPlusVeg), which incorporates a vegetation compartment, to calculate leaf particle-bound PAHs uptake from air. In this model, formulated in terms of fugacity, the vegetation compartment can be composed by a mono- or multi- specific forest canopy, which interacts with dynamic air and the soil compartments. The model, which incorporates some forest structural parameters such as specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI), was modified to account for some of recent findings concerning the particulate matter uptake by vegetation. Simulations were performed for some high molecular weight PAHs, as they exist predominantly in the particulate phase, for a multi-specific semi-urban wood located in Como. The results were compared to data measured in air, deposition and vegetation in the same location...|$|R
30|$|On each of {{the test}} days, after {{checking}} all abovementioned criteria, the four stages of the experiment were performed {{in the following order}} with subjects sitting in a quiet, temperature-controlled, driving simulator: (a) sensors were attached in the appropriate positions, which took at least 15 min; (b) a rest period of 10 min; (c) the drink was consumed over a period of 5 min; and (d) a simulated monotonous driving period of 90 min. Each test was performed over a 120 -min period. In order to simulate a real monotonous driving situation, each subject was previously informed that they had to continue driving safely, as though they were actually driving, that they should maintain a speed of 80 ~ 120 km/h, and that they should drive within a specified lane. Test sessions were performed either in the morning (10 : 00 - 12 : 00 AM) or in the afternoon (13 : 00 - 15 : 00 <b>PM)</b> in a <b>balanced</b> manner. Each subject started each test day at the same time.

40|$|Nature-based {{solutions}} {{have been}} identified by the European Union as being critical for the enhancement of environmental qualities in cities, where urban and peri-urban forests {{play a key role}} in air quality amelioration through pollutant removal. A remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) approach was applied to the Metropolitan City (MC) of Rome to assess the seasonal particulate matter (PM 10) removal capacity of evergreen (broadleaves and conifers) and deciduous species. Moreover, a monetary evaluation of PM 10 removal was performed on the basis of pollution externalities calculated for Europe. Deciduous broadleaves represent the most abundant tree functional group and also yielded the highest total annual PM 10 deposition values (1769 Mg). By contrast, PM 10 removal efficiency (Mg·ha− 1) was 15 %– 22 % higher in evergreen than in deciduous species. To assess the different removal capacity of the three functional groups in an area with homogeneous environmental conditions, a study case was performed in a peri-urban forest protected natural reserve (Castelporziano Presidential Estate). This study case highlighted the importance of deciduous species in summer and of evergreen communities as regards the annual <b>PM</b> 10 removal <b>balance.</b> The monetary evaluation indicated that the overall PM 10 removal value of the MC of Rome amounted to 161. 78 million Euros.

Of fundamental and clinical interest is whether diabetogenic insults promote membrane/cytoskeletal dysfunction amendable for therapy. As exposure to excess fatty acid (FA) s induce glucose intolerance by mechanisms imperfectly understood, we tested if PM cholesterol/F-actin changes could contribute to FA-induced glucose transporter GLUT 4 dysregulation in skeletal muscle. High-fat fed, insulin-resistant animals displayed elevated levels of skeletal muscle PM cholesterol and a loss in cortical F-actin, compared to normal-chow fed animals. Consistent with a PM cholesterol component of glucose intolerance, human skeletal muscle biopsies revealed an inverse correlation between PM cholesterol and whole-body glucose disposal. Mechanistically, exposure of L 6 myotubes to the saturated FA palmitate induced an increase in PM cholesterol that destabilized actin filaments and decreased insulin-stimulated PM GLUT 4 and glucose transport, which could be reversed with cholesterol lowering. Next, study tested if the lipid-lowering action of the antidiabetic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) had a beneficial influence on <b>PM</b> cholesterol <b>balance.</b> Consistent with AMPK inhibition of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, we found that AMPK activation promoted {{a significant reduction in}} PM cholesterol and amplified basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation. A similar loss of PM cholesterol induced by β-cyclodextrin caused an analogous enhancement of GLUT 4 regulation. Interestingly, PM cholesterol replenishment abrogated the AMPK effect on insulin, but not basal, regulation of GLUT 4 translocation. Conversely, AMPK knockdown prevented the enhancement of both basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation. As a whole these studies show PM cholesterol accrual and cortical F-actin loss uniformly in skeletal muscle from glucose-intolerant mice, swine, and humans. In vivo and in vitro dissection demonstrated this membrane/cytoskeletal derangement induces insulin resistance and is promoted by excess FAs. Parallel studies unveiled that the action of AMPK entailed lowering PM cholesterol that enhanced the regulation of GLUT 4 /glucose transport by insulin. In conclusion, these data are consistent with PM cholesterol regulation being an unappreciated aspect of AMPK signaling that benefits insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation during states of nutrient excess promoting PM cholesterol accrual...|$|R

Results revealed (1) an unusual speciation of Hg in the outgoing gaseous stream of the flue gas desulphurisation (OUT-FGD) system at the two power plants: Hg 0 was the dominant Hg OUT-FGD species at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2; (2) a different retention of gaseous Hg between the two sampling campaigns at the coal-fired power plant under co-combustion conditions: a higher retention of Hg 2 + in 2007 (73 %) than in 2008 (24 %) at PP 2; (3) a high concentration of trace pollutants and a distinctive behaviour of some elements in the waters of re-circulation to the scrubber at both power plants: Al, F, and SO 42 presented a higher concentration in the 2007 gypsum slurry than at PP 2 in 2008 and that at PP 1; and (4) a characteristic leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum: insignificant leaching of heavy metals from FGD-gypsums was found at PP 2. The behaviour of Se proved to be the inverse. Laboratory experiments were conducted to reproduce the differences in speciation of gaseous Hg OUT-FGD with respect to that detected at industrial scale. Thermodynamic modelling tools were employed to study the causes of the different retention and speciation of gaseous Hg OUT-FGD and causes and effects of the high concentration of elements in the waters of re-circulation. Potentiometric titration experiments for FGD-gypsum samples were conducted to study the leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum. Laboratory experiments confirmed Hg 0 as the dominant species in the OUT-FGD gas at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2. The gaseous speciation of Hg 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 in 2007 and in 2008 was caused by the high concentration of HCl and Hg in the IN-FGD gaseous stream. The unusual speciation of Hg 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 was probably due to the evaporation of HgCl 2 particles from the gypsum slurry in the OUT-FGD gas. The Al-additive used at PP 2 was responsible for the higher retention of gaseous Hg in 2007 than in 2008. The enrichment of inorganic trace pollutants in the re-circulated water streams at PP 1 and PP 2 resulted from the continuous re-circulation of filtered water to the scrubber. The emission of the enriched elements by entraining particles and droplets of gypsum slurry OUT-FGD was the most significant consequence of such a fact. Thermodynamic modelling revealed that the Al-additive i) increased the concentration of F- in filtered waters at PP 2 in 2007, ii) gave rise to the differential behaviour and enrichment of Al, F, SO 42 -, Mg, and U in gypsum slurries and filtered waters, iii) led to the formation of SO 42 - complexes with metals increasing their concentrations in the gypsum slurry from PP 1 to PP 2 - 2008 and 2007, iv) caused the acidification of gypsum slurry from PP 2 via aluminium hydrolysis, and v) induced the protonation of the PP 2 FGD-gypsum surfaces. The relatively high leaching values of Se and the absence of significant leaching of heavy metals from the PP 2 FGD-gypsums resulted from the protonation of the surface of the FGD-gypsum and the formation of SO 4 -complexes...|$|R
40|$|IN THE FLURRY {{of concern}} over the {{appointments}} of vocal right-wingers to the ABC board - Ron Brunton, Janet Albrechtsen and now Keith Windschuttle - the broadcaster 2 ̆ 7 s supporters {{are in danger of}} losing focus. Demonising individuals doesn 2 ̆ 7 t help. The real dangers are in commercialisation, which the broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 supporters should do all they can to resist; and beyond that, in the new board members 2 ̆ 7 guiding concepts on nationality and history. With all its acknowledged value in nation-building, the ABC has survived 74 years in the teeth of recurrent political hostility, no matter which party was in power. Windschuttle?s anxieties about alleged Marxists and radicals come in a longer tradition than he may realise. It 2 ̆ 7 s more than 40 years since the RSL began alleging Communist influence inside the broadcaster - that was after Allan Ashbolt 2 ̆ 7 s legendary Four Corners, in August 1962, on the RSL 2 ̆ 7 s political strength. In late 1978, the outgoing commissioner Richard Harding told a press conference that the Fraser government had reduced the ABC to 2 ̆ 7 a timid, dispirited and punch-drunk organisation. 2 ̆ 7 In protest against funding cuts and the abolition of the position of staff-elected commissioner, held at that time by Marius Webb, the staff engaged in rolling strikes. ?Save the ABC? rallies were held in several cities; Friends of the ABC circulated a wonderful poster showing Aunty on the rampage in flying petticoats, stilt heels, brolly and handbag. The Commission survived further strictures and punishments through the prolonged period of the Dix Committee of Review, became a Corporation, endured the enmity of Labor governments ? the moment when presenter Jane Singleton pulled the plug on Bob Hawke remains an agreeable comic memory ? and lived to fight another day. Remember the Mansfield report? This is not to say plus ?a change, plus c?est la m?me chose. The broadcaster?s survival {{has a lot to do}} with the resilience of good liberal journalism and an unsinkable public demand for it. But while no government likes independent critical enquiry, our present masters like it even less than most. These appointments do constitute the threat of destruction from within, but not because Windschuttle and company amuse themselves with oldstyle Cold War games. (Reds under the Kath and Kim sofas, or Peter Cundall?s garden-beds? It?s a charade.) What matters is that they?re likely to promote advertising in or between programs. Opposition to ads on the ABC is generally read as nothing more than cultural snobbery, middle-class aversion to crassness. But for the ABC, commercials ? however limited and regulated, in however much bland good taste ? would be the thin end of a malignant wedge: increased dependence on chancy commercial revenue, further decreases in public funding, and the inevitable inhibition of critical content in line with advertisers? pressures and competition with other channels. With those threats looming, public broadcasting needs all the friends it can get. The kinds of supportive action taken 30 years ago mightn?t work now; a strike of program-makers would probably be ammunition for the enemy. Better to email the minister, her colleagues and your local members ? particularly to those on the Coalition side, to independents, and to those representing regional and remote Australia. Justice should be seen to be done. Ideally, nobody should be considered for board membership without a clear commitment to the principles in the ABC?s Charter, particularly those on independence for the purposes of ?adequate and comprehensive? programming. Neither Senator Coonan nor those she has appointed show any such allegiance. Challenged by Mark Colvin on <b>PM</b> about political <b>balance,</b> she evaded the issue, appealing to ?a mix of skills? and invoking Windschuttle?s past concerns with media and journalism. But it?s rather as though a Labor government had appointed John Pilger ? instead of, say, some more discriminating left-liberal like Stuart Macintyre or Judith Brett. It?s all further evidence on the government?s disquieting insulation from informed opinion at large. Coonan seems amazingly unaware of how far middle-class Australia is, and wishes to be, anti-racist; and their special take on race relations, along with intransigent hostility to liberal critique per se, is what links together her choices from the Quadrant lineup. Both Brunton and Windschuttle have campaigned strenuously against pro-Aboriginal treatments of history; Brunton most visibly through the Hindmarsh Island case, Windschuttle ? with support from Albrechtsen ? in the output of his Macleay Press. It?s on this score that Senator Coonan should have brought in at least one real opponent, and there?s no shortage. Here again, the senator is marvellously deaf; Windschuttle?s version in particular has been systematically discredited from positions right across the range, from Martin Krygier?s gentle conservativism to the Green Left Weekly. Among much else, James Boyce?s long essay ?Fantasy Island? in Robert Manne?s collection Whitewash (Black Inc., 2003) surveys the great spread of evidence ignored by Windschuttle on the Aboriginal Tasmanians; he finds ?a view of the past disconnected from the lives of real people who lived in Van Diemen?s Land. ? Elsewhere in the same volume, the indigenous scholar Greg Lehman, speaking for his Tasmanian kind, offers the clearest brief indictment I?ve seen of the Windschuttle project: ?We aspire to ? a future for ourselves where conflict, racism and separatism might become just steps along the way to something much better. This future is not to be found in the pages of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History. All Windschuttle offers us is an ignoble death in the past. He is consumed by the absurd task of telling the dead how to die. ? As that book and others demonstrate, we do owe Windschuttle a debt. He has incited a whole expansion of necessary analysis, and compelled anti-racist intellectuals in all corners of the field to know better what we?re about. That, however, is no qualification for a share in governing the ABC. By ironic default, these appointments suggest that Aboriginal issues, especially questions of historical understanding, are not merely contentious; they are central to the imagined community, the nation. In the absence of clear and full acknowledgement, Aboriginal history threatens the over-cherished positions of Gallipoli, Anzac, masculine mateship and the rest of John Howard?s private gallery (never say the man lacks imagination). There is a fear of deep human difference, and an attendant fear of serious national responsibility. Those fears underlie much of the government?s broad self-protective agenda, its program for the ABC included. Here once more, the denial of Aboriginal claims works rather like a boomerang. Sent off repeatedly, they keep on coming back. ? Sylvia Lawson has published widely on culture and politics.
