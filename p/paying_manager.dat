50|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} law, various reviews are taken before any actions are made. The State Financial Authority, either the State Treasurer or Superintendent of Public Instruction, must provide an interim report within 20 days of creating a preliminary review to the local government. Then within 30 days, they must provide a final report to the Local Emergency Financial Assistance Review Board (ELB). If the review finds a financial emergency exists, the local government is given four different choices: a consent agreement, chapter 9 bankruptcy, mediation or emergency manager. Under this law, the State government <b>pays</b> the <b>manager's</b> <b>pay</b> under this version. If an emergency manager is appointed, when the manager files his plan with the state, the local governing board may propose an alternative plan which the Local Emergency Financial Board will select which version the manager will implement.

40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three chapters. In the first chapter, coauthored with Stephen Spear, we study endogenous shocks driven by collective actions of managers. A good recent {{example of this is}} how the collective actions of bank managers engaging in securitization of loans ended up freezing the world financial markets in 2008. Motivated by examples like the 2008 crisis, we analyze how endogenous shocks driven by collective actions of managers impact social welfare by using a dynamic general equilibrium model. We first show that such endogenous shocks render competitive equilibrium allocations inefficient due to externalities. We establish that a socially optimal allocation can only be attained by <b>paying</b> <b>managers</b> the socially optimal wages, and this can be achieved by imposing wage taxes (or subsidies) on managers. Finally, we extend the model by allowing for information asymmetry, and show that {{it is not possible to}} attain a socially optimal (i. e., first-best) allocation. We instead examine second-best allocations. In the second chapter, I study whether coalitions of consumers are beneficial to consumers when producers have market power. I refer to coalitions of consumers as consumer unions and the number of consumers in a union as union size. By constructing an imperfect competition mode...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of firm scope in which {{integrating}} two firms into one facilitates the allocation of resources, but leads to weaker incentives for effort, compared with non-integration. Our theory makes minimal assumptions about the underlying agency problem. Moreover, the benefits and costs of integration originate from the same problem to allocate resources efficiently, the integrated firm's top management must obtain information about the possible use of resources from division managers. The division managers' job is to create profitable investment projects. Giving the managers incentives to do so biases them endogenously towards their own divisions, and gives them a motive to overstate {{the quality of their}} projects in order to receive more resources. We show that <b>paying</b> <b>managers</b> based on firm performance in addition to individual performance can establish truthful upward communication, but creates a free-rider problem and raises the cost of inducing effort. This effect exists even though with perfect information, centralized resource allocation would improve the managers' incentives. The resulting tradeoff between a better use of resources and diminished incentives for effort determines whether integration or non-integration is optimal. Our theory thus provides a simple answer to Williamson's selective-intervention 9 ̆ 4 puzzle concerning the limits of firm size and scope. In addition, we provide an incentive-based argument for the prevalence of hierarchically structured firms in which higher-level managers coordinate the actions of lower-level managers...|$|R
40|$|Stereotypically, {{marketing}} is mainly concerned about satisfying customers and manufacturing is mainly interested in factory efficiency. Using the principal-agent (agency) paradigm, which {{assumes that the}} marketing and manufacturing managers of the firm will act in their self-interest, we seek incentive plans that will induce those managers to act so that {{the owner of the}} firm can attain as much as possible of the residual returns. One optimal incentive plan can be interpreted as follows: The owner subcontracts to <b>pay</b> the manufacturing <b>manager</b> a fixed rate for all capacity he delivers. Each marketing manager receives all of the returns from his product. In turn, all <b>managers</b> <b>pay</b> a fixed fee to the owner. Under this plan, the marketing managers will often complain about the stock level decisions, even though these levels are announced in advance. Under a revised plan, the owner can eliminate such complaints by delegating the stocking decisions to the respective marketing managers, without any loss. This plan is interpreted as requiring the owner to make a futures market for manufacturing capacity, <b>paying</b> the manufacturing <b>manager</b> the expected marginal value for each unit of capacity delivered, receiving the realized marginal value from the marketing managers, and losing money on average in the process. manufacturing/marketing incentives, agency theory, hidden effort, newsvendor model, delegation, futures market, franchising...|$|R
