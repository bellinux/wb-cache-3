By articulating a contemporary repositioning of mimesis beyond imitation, mimesis is proposed in an attempt to articulate the complex power relations between the original and the copy in live and mediatised performance.

Adverse events are not uncommon. Incident monitoring provides a means to better understand such events. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize incidents occurring during retrieval to provide a basis for developing corrective strategies. Four organizations contributed 125 reports, documenting 272 incidents; 91 % of forms documented incidents as preventable. Incidents related to equipment (37 %), patient care (26 %), transport operations (11 %), interpersonal communication (9 %), planning or preparation (9 %), retrieval staff (7 %) and tasking (2 %). Incidents occurred during patient transport to the receiving facility (26 %), at patient origin (26 %), during patient loading (20 %), at the retrieval service base (18 %) and receiving facility (9 %). Contributing factors were system-based for 54 % and human-based for 42 %. Haste (7. 5 %), equipment malfunctioning (7. 2 %) or missing (5. 5 %), failure to check (5. 8 %) and pressure to proceed (5. 2 %) were the most frequent contributing factors. Harm was documented in 59 % of incidents with one death. Minimizing factors were good crew skills/teamwork (42 %), checking equipment (17 %) and patient (8 %), patient monitors (15 %), good luck (14 %) and good interpersonal communication (4 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe National Audit of Thrombolysis for Acute Leg Ischemia (NATALI) {{database}} is a consecutive {{series of}} patients who underwent intra-arterial thrombolysis to treat acute leg ischemia in one of 11 centers in the United Kingdom. The {{purpose of the study}} was to analyze the factors associated with outcome after 30 days. MethodsThe data were collected over 10 years on standard <b>pro</b> <b>formas,</b> and registration was completed at the end of 1999. Since then, data from each unit have been verified and missing data included when available. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, with the outcomes of amputation-free survival (AFS), amputation with survival, and death. ResultsA total of 1133 thrombolytic events were included. Outcome results at 30 days for the entire group were AFS, 852 (75. 2 %); amputation, 141 (12. 4 %); and death, 140 (12. 4 %). Results for the entire group improved from the first half of the database, when AFS ranged from 65 % to 75 %, to almost 80 % for the last few years of the study, although this was not statistically significant. Preintervention factors associated with lower AFS at multivariate analysis included diabetes (P =. 002), increasing age (P <. 001), short-duration ischemia (P =. 027), Fontaine grade (P =. 001), and ischemia with neurosensory deficit (P =. 004). AFS was improved in patients receiving warfarin sodium at the time of the arterial occlusion (P =. 04). Mortality was higher in women (P =. 006) and in older patients (P <. 001), and in patients with native vessel occlusion (P <. 001), emboli (P =. 02), or a history of ischemic heart disease (P <. 001). Amputation risk was greatest in younger men (P <. 001) and in patients with more severe ischemia (P =. 02), graft occlusion (P <. 001), or native vessel thrombotic occlusion (P =. 02). ConclusionExperienced surgeons and radiologists can achieve an AFS of about 80 % in selected patients with acute leg ischemia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Constructive {{feedback}} {{plays an}} important role in learning during surgical training. Standard feedback is usually given verbally following direct observation of the procedure by a trained assessor. However, such feedback requires the physical presence of expert faculty members who are usually busy and time-constrained by clinical commitments. We aim to evaluate electronic feedback (e-feedback) after video observation of surgical suturing in comparison with standard face-to-face verbal feedback. METHODS: A prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing e-feedback with standard verbal feedback was carried out in February 2015 using a validated <b>pro</b> <b>formas</b> for assessment. The study participants were 38 undergraduate medical students from the University of Sheffield, UK. They were recorded on video performing the procedural skill, completed a self-evaluation form, and received e-feedback on the same day (group 1); observed directly by an assessor, invited to provide verbal self-reflection, and then received standard verbal feedback (group 2). In both groups, the feedback was provided after performing the procedure. The participants returned 2 days later and performed the same skill again. Poststudy questionnaire was used to assess the acceptability of each feedback among the participants. RESULTS: Overall, 19 students in group 1 and 18 students in group 2 completed the study. Although there was a significant improvement in the overall mean score on the second performance of the task for all participants (first performance mean 11. 59, second performance mean 15. 95; p ≤ 0. 0001), there was no difference in the overall mean improvement score between group 1 and group 2 (4. 74 and 3. 94, respectively; p = 0. 49). The mean overall scores for the e-feedback group at baseline recorded by 2 independent investigators showed good agreement (mean overall scores of 12. 84 and 11. 89; Cronbach α = 0. 86). Poststudy questionnaire demonstrated that both e-feedback and standard verbal feedback achieved high mean Likert grades as recorded by the participants (4. 42 [range: 2 - 5] and 4. 71 [range: 4 - 5], respectively; p = 0. 274). CONCLUSION: e-Feedback after watching a video recording appears to be acceptable and is not quantitatively different than standard feedback in improving suturing skills among novice trainees.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} experiences of 18 mature career-changing physiotherapists over {{the first three years}} of belonging to their new profession, employing and critiquing Lave and Wenger’s (1991) theory of community of practice in so doing. Such newcomers to a profession bring with them social and cultural capital which can impact upon the new workplace and their progress within it, as might their biographies, atypical for their chosen profession. Very little has been written about the effect of importing people experienced in another occupation into a profession. This leaves an empirical and theoretical gap to be explored regarding both the effect on the individuals and on the practice of the communities they join. No-one has considered what might be involved in what amounts to identity re-construction in the new career, and what impact the employment context (possibly unstable or fluctuating) might have on the process. Annual semi-structured interviews were chosen as the appropriate mode of generating data from the main respondents, augmented by single interviews with six physiotherapy managers and four established clinicians to provide additional necessary context. The recorded transcripts were analysed using brief interviewee narratives, <b>pro</b> <b>formas</b> and reflective questions. It was found that previous experience, including upbringing and habitus, were particularly influential in these newcomers’ progress, and individuals may be beginning to self-manage their careers, a practice which questions and adds to Lave and Wenger’s (1991) theory of legitimate peripheral participation. Other elements that contradicted community of practice theory included the fact that it was with patients and their carers that social interaction leading to learning occurred most, and it was often to this client group that practitioners felt loyalty and a sense of belonging, rather than to any community of fellow practitioners. Also solo workers are often isolated from the newcomer and cannot pass on their learning as Lave and Wenger (1991) suggest. Full participation was found to be difficult to define, equating with proficiency rather than expertise. The thesis as a whole gives some indication of the way in which a profession’s traditions may be changing with respect to widening participation and the problems of a context of fractured and uncertain employment. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Reduction of lung {{inflammation}} {{is one of}} {{the goals}} of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the current level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in the light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids, compared to not taking them, in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 15 August 2016. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard <b>pro</b> <b>formas.</b> Main results The searches identified 34 citations, of which 26 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 506 people with cystic fibrosis aged between six and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Many of the risk of bias judgements were unclear due to a lack of available information. Only two trials specified how participants were randomised and less than half of the included trials gave details on how allocation was concealed. Trials were generally judged to have a low risk of bias from blinding, except for two which were open label or did not use a placebo. There were some concerns that a number of trials had not been published in peer-reviewed journals, but the risk of bias from this was unclear. Inclusion criteria varied between trials, as did type and duration of treatment and timing of outcome assessments. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete. Significant benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated. Four trials systematically documented adverse effects and growth was significantly affected in one study using high doses. Authors' conclusions Evidence from these trials is insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether long-term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial...|$|R

This thesis namely investigates three construction types in the syntax of contemporary Czech, aH ofwhich have in common a binary coordinative structure, using the Czech coordinator a (and), where two verbs are coordinated. These constructions are referred to as prototypical coordination (ProKoor), pseudo-coordination (PseKoor) and reduplicative coordination (ReKoor). The main claim is that even though these three types share the same surface structure (go) VlandV 2 or Vl andVl, they do not represent the same phenomenon of coordination and it is necessary to divide them into three types, as proposed. I have proposed a two-part analysis. Firstly, PseKoor is analysed as a complex predicate formed on the level of syntax. This analysis immediately accounts for a number of properties of PseKoor which allows the comparison with ProKoor. Secondly, PseKoor is analysed as means of aktionsart, resp. as a variety coordination over substages of events. This also accounts for a number of characteristics of PseKoor, this time on the level of semantics. ln this way I also present criteria for [...] ...|$|R
