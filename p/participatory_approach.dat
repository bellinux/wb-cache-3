40|$|Adapting through {{innovation}} {{is one way}} for rural communities to sustain and improve their livelihoods and environments. Since the 1980 s research and development organizations have developed <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to foster rural innovation. This paper develops a model, called the Learning-to-Innovate (LTI) model, of four basic processes linked to decision making and learning which regulate rate and quality of innovation. The processes are: creating awareness of new opportunities; deciding to adopt; adapting and changing practice; and learning and selecting. The model is then used to analyse four <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> and the model is evaluated through the quality of insights generated. It shows that, while outwardly very different, the four approaches are built from combinations of 11 strategies. Most of these strategies are aimed at providing information about new opportunities and deciding whether to adopt, and give less support {{to the other two}} processes, thus suggesting one way the four <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> can be strengthened. Beyond analysing <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches,</b> the model {{could be used as a}} framework for diagnosing the health of local innovation systems and designing tailor-made approaches to strengthen them.

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades {{participatory}} research processes have informed much international development and conservation work in developing countries. Public participation is also a growing legislative requirement in natural resource and environmental management in developed countries. So far, multiple <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> have been formulated and applied in different contexts, including so-called participatory modelling methods. The latter have developed alongside a growing unease and fundamental critique of the <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> and their theoretical underpinnings. One of the central themes running through the critique is the naivete with which complexities of power relations are assumed to be understood and addressed in <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches.</b> The critique also highlights the danger that <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> become legitimising instruments that simply maintain and reinforce existing power relations. In this paper we engage with the critical literature in the hope of drawing lessons and requirements for participatory modelling. We also empirically evaluate participatory modelling case studies with regard to the fundamental critique. While we do not agree with some demands from the critique that imply abandoning the whole participatory enterprise, we suggest that claims to participatory modelling be taken seriously and that each claim be accompanied by critical reflection. Based on {{a review of the literature}} we suggest initial set of questions towards developing a framework for critical reflection...|$|R
2500|$|A {{pilot for}} the new policy was {{initiated}} by WaterAid in Dodoma Urban District together with the district government. An innovative feature {{of the project was}} that the water department worked closely with the community development department and the health department. Both had previously not been involved in water projects. Using the acronyms of the three departments and of WaterAid the integrated team was called WAMMA, giving the project its name. Each of the three departmental teams had to have both men and women among its staff, although this was difficult to implement because of a shortage of female staff. Unlike before, communities were selected based on a needs survey. [...] However, government staff at all levels were poorly paid and had little interesting work to do. Some were consequently demotivated. Like many other externally funded projects, the WAMMA project paid allowances to fieldworkers for work undertaken outside their offices in order to motivate them. However, “payments were made at the official rate, as any higher allowances would undermine the government’s capacity to sustain or replicate work without donor inputs.” Interestingly, WaterAid initially worked directly at the district level without any formal agreement with the regional government until 1995. The programme, which was considered a success by WaterAid and the district government, was subsequently extended from Dodoma Urban District to three other districts in Dodoma Region. 86 projects were built under between 1991 and 1996. The innovative collaborative work between three district departments and the <b>participatory</b> <b>approach</b> attracted visitors from all over Tanzania.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the prime}} {{ingredients}} for rural development in developing countries is information access. Although the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) revolution in these countries has gained momentum, most of the farming communities still {{have no access to}} value added information. The agricultural researcher and the farming community need to enhance their knowledge by increased ‘farmer participation’ in research. This paper makes a strong case for the use of <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> involving farming community for development and adoption of ICT in the agricultural sector. It acknowledges that farmers are knowledgeable and encourages researchers to work with farmers and development workers for agricultural improvements. This paper discusses how digital ICT developed by means of participatory learning and action research can spur development and eradicate poverty by providing services to farmers in rural areas. It also highlights how <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> can empower collective groups of farmers and help to put decision-making {{in the hands of the}} farmers. Although no single ICT will be satisfactory for farmers, the use of a wide range of ICTs in agriculture can improve the livelihood of the farmers in rural areas and help in their socio-economic growth. The paper focuses on various <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> such as <b>participatory</b> communication and participatory learning for effective use of ICTs in agricultural domain.

40|$|Background: Epidemiology {{has contributed}} {{in many ways}} to {{identifying}} various risk factors for disease and to promoting population health. However, there is a continuing debate {{about the ability of}} epidemiology not only to describe, but also to provide results which can be better translated into public health practice. It has been proposed that <b>participatory</b> research <b>approaches</b> be applied to epidemiology as a way to bridge this gap between description and action. A systematic account of what constitutes participatory epidemiology practice has, however, been lacking. Methods: A scoping review was carried out focused on the question of what constitutes <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to epidemiology for the purpose of demonstrating their potential for advancing epidemiologic research. Relevant databases were searched, including both the published and non-published (grey) literature. The 102 identified sources were analyzed in terms of comparing common epidemiologic <b>approaches</b> to <b>participatory</b> counterparts regarding central aspects of the research process. Exemplary studies applying <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> were examined more closely. Results: A highly diverse, interdisciplinary body of literature was synthesized, resulting in a framework comprised of seven aspects of the research process: research goal, research question, population, context, data synthesis, research management, and dissemination of findings. The framework specifies how <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> not only differ from, but also how they can enhance common approaches in epidemiology. Finally, recommendations for the further development of <b>participatory</b> <b>approaches</b> are given. These include: enhancing data collection, data analysis, and data validation; advancing capacity building for research at the local level; and developing data synthesis. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a basis for systematically developing the emergent science of participatory epidemiology...|$|R
