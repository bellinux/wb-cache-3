5000|$|Of these, Phylloscopus chloronotus forresti is {{possibly}} also a separate species, but further analysis {{is required to}} confirm this. The breeding ranges of the Gansu <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> and the Chinese <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> overlap in southern Gansu, but the species are separated ecologically: the Gansu <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> is found in taller forest habitats and the Chinese <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> uses lower, often scrubby habitats. [...] "Lemon-rumped warbler" [...] was sometimes used as synonym for Pallas's <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> before the species' split. Pallas's <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> appears to have diverged from the Chinese <b>leaf</b> <b>warbler</b> 4.1-5.5 million years ago, and from its other former subspecies about 1.7-3.2 million years ago.|$|R

5000|$|... “In plumage, the Limestone <b>Leaf</b> <b>Warbler</b> {{appears to}} be largely indistinguishable from P. ricketti, {{although}} {{as a result of}} the small number of specimens available for the Limestone <b>Leaf</b> <b>Warbler</b> and their poor quality, detailed comparisons are difficult to make. The only two specimens of the Limestone <b>Leaf</b> <b>Warbler,</b> which have been directly compared with a series of P.ricketti are marginally colder yellow below a more greyish tinge above, and show marginally greyer lateral crown-stripes than P. ricketti. The Limestone <b>Leaf</b> <b>Warbler</b> is easily separable from P. cantator by its yellow belly”.|$|R
