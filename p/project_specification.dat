This is in contrast to the reopened Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link, which was built as a double-track electrified railway from the outset. The difference between the two lines has been claimed by commentators to reflect scepticism toward the Borders Railway, which has existed since proposals were first made in the 1990s, as well as a reluctance to allow the project to become too ambitious. In particular, a 2011 cost-cutting exercise by Transport Scotland resulted in a new <b>project</b> <b>specification</b> which reduced the dynamic passing loops from their planned length of , and failed to future-proof the line by providing for all eight road bridges to be built to single-track width only, including the five bridges on the section between Tynehead and [...] Stow where there were otherwise no other obstacles to doubling of the line.|$|E

50|$|To enable e-invoicing, {{there must}} be an {{existing}} method of viewing the transactions, typically an ERP or accounting system. Routing and rules must be established in a <b>project</b> <b>specification.</b> This typically involves members of accounts payable, IT, and sometimes procurement. Once routing is established to the system, validation rules can be set up {{to reduce the amount of}} invoice exceptions. Further validation can be set up to automatically reject errors, three-way match invoices, purchase orders, and other documents. Validation can also notify suppliers of acceptance or rejections. Once the e-invoicing specification is finalized and testing is complete, the business's suppliers are connected electronically, and the e-invoicing system is ready.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1986, Salas had created a slideshow-like {{demonstration}} of a system known as Modeler on the IBM PC. In February 1987 he hired Glenn Edelson to implement a working version in C++. As they worked on the project, it became clear that the basic concept was a good one, and was especially useful for financial modeling. At {{the end of the}} spring, they hired Bonnie Sullivan to write up a <b>project</b> <b>specification,</b> and Jeff Anderholm was hired to examine the market for a new program aimed at the financials industry. That summer, the team took Modeler to a number of financials companies, and found an overwhelmingly positive reception.|$|E

40|$|In risk {{management}} of complex procurement projects in construction, the buyer has two principal instruments at his disposal: 1) {{the choice of}} time and resources put into engineering and design (<b>project</b> <b>specification),</b> thus affecting the level of risk in the project, 2) the sharing of risk, as specified by the incentive contract for the contractor. Each of the instruments implies costs for the buyer. Detailed <b>project</b> <b>specification</b> involves direct planning costs, but the major specification cost is often a time cost, i. e., the reduction in net present value due to the postponement of the project. Risk sharing by the buyer is costly even if the buyer is risk neutral, since lower risk exposure for the contractor implies weaker incentives and thereby higher construction costs. Hence, {{risk management}} of procurement projects can for the buyer {{be perceived as a}} trade-off between the time costs of <b>project</b> <b>specification</b> and planning and the budget implications of weaker incentives. We model this trade-off in a risk sharing model with endogenous risk...|$|E

40|$|Final {{project is}} one of duties {{that have to be}} done by {{university}} college student, especially in PENS-ITS, as a condition to graduate. But, there are many students that get difficulties in finishing their final project. That can be caused by their capability on final <b>project</b> <b>specification</b> that they're working on. So that, it's needed an application that can help students to determine their final <b>project</b> <b>specification</b> based on their capability. This Final Project discuss about fuzzy methods to determine Final <b>Project</b> <b>specification</b> for student of Informatics Engineering PENS-ITS based on their interest and ?lectures? values. Each specification has lectures itself and those lectures that will be the attributes of the data in this system. Fuzzy method used is the Fuzzy Sugeno. Fuzzy methods are used to perform fuzzification of data that formed the membership value. Membership value is performed or the determination of rules of inferenci. Inference is to find the highest value of the fuzzification process. Composition process is a combination of the outputs of all rules or inference. The result of the composition and then perform defuzzification process data. Defuzzification is the final process that uses max method by taking the highest index will be chosen field of TA.
