40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown {{individuals}} to hold <b>positive</b> biases <b>about</b> their relationships. The present study examined <b>positive</b> illusions <b>about</b> a partner's specific personality characteristics in relation to relationship quality and personality. Both partners of 120 heterosexual couples participated in the present study, {{making it possible to}} examine both partner and actor effects. Results showed that although, in general, individuals did not hold <b>positive</b> illusions <b>about</b> a partner's specific personality characteristics, positive illusions were positively related to relationship quality. In addition, interesting relations emerged between <b>positive</b> illusions <b>about</b> a partner's personality and both individuals' personality and marital duration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Tales games, it features an action-based battle system, called the Three-Line Linear Motion Battle System. The game {{was developed by}} the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny. The scenario, written by Hiramatsu Masaki, dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and ethnic conflicts. The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600,000 units and the PSP re-release selling over 83,000. Western sites have been <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the game, though neither version of the game have received English localizations.|$|E
5|$|Chenevix-Trench {{was known}} for his {{substantial}} tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School. He died in 1979. In 1994, a book by Tim Card, a former Vice-Provost of Eton, revealed {{for the first time that}} Chenevix-Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord. There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix-Trench's use of corporal punishment, and numerous letters to the editor in response, most of which were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> Chenevix-Trench's legacy. Peel, a teacher at Fettes College at the time, published The Land of Lost Content two years later.|$|E
40|$|Twelve chronic hospitalized female {{patients}} received token reinforcement {{contingent on}} two separate classes of verbalizations: (a) <b>positive</b> statements <b>about</b> optional activities {{available in the}} hospital setting, and (b) <b>positive</b> statements <b>about</b> people. Cross-class generalization of reinforced verbal responses about activities to overt behavior was tested by actual participation in activities; within-class generalization of verbal responses about people to verbalizations in another stimulus setting was assessed in a structured interview situation. A multiple baseline design with contingency reversals was employed to demonstrate experimental control of both classes of verbalizations in the group sessions. <b>Positive</b> statements <b>about</b> activities generalized to actual participation in activities, while generalization of <b>positive</b> statements <b>about</b> people to verbalization in the extragroup setting did not occur...|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> their experience: despite some comments about a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, aesthetics, gameplay and story all came in for general praise, with multiple reviewers calling it a worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to {{the failure of}} the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt <b>positive</b> <b>about,</b> and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E
5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the game, citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret {{that it would not be}} localized.|$|E
40|$|PublishedArticleAnticipatory {{processing}} (AP) is a repetitive thinking style {{associated with}} social anxiety {{that has been}} understudied relative to other similar constructs (e. g., rumination, worry). The primary goal {{of this study was}} the development and evaluation of the <b>Positive</b> Beliefs <b>about</b> Anticipatory Processing Questionnaire (PB-APQ) with a sample of 301 undergraduate students. Further, it was predicted that anticipatory processing would mediate the relationship between <b>positive</b> beliefs <b>about</b> anticipatory processing and social interaction anxiety. The findings from this study suggest that PB-APQ is a valid and reliable construct. Anticipatory processing was shown to partially mediate the relationship between <b>positive</b> beliefs <b>about</b> anticipatory processing and social interaction anxiety. The results provide initial evidence for the suggestion that individuals who tend to hold <b>positive</b> beliefs <b>about</b> anticipatory processing tend to engage in anticipatory processing, which may increase social interaction anxiety...|$|R

5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the change of mood and development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E

The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square.

5|$|The concept, {{which was}} set within the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, {{was for a}} much darker {{scenario}} than other Final Fantasy games. The main cast were designed by Nomura and Naora, while side characters were handled by Nakaaki. Multiple pieces of merchandise and additional media have been created around the characters, including trading cards and multiple manga. They {{have been the subject}} of positive reviews in Japan and import reviews: the main praise has gone to their interactions and writing, while the main criticism was difficulties arising from handling the large cast. Western reviews were also generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the character portrayals, but there were criticisms about dialogue, character interactions, and the quality of the localization.|$|E
5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence {{as well as a}} perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu Weekly {{found the}} story enjoyable, though noted {{that those who}} had played Destiny would get more {{enjoyment}} out of it, and praised the voice acting. They also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable, positively noting the option to auto-battle. The game ranked as the 89th all-time favorite game in a 2006 Famitsu readers poll. Japanese website Game Impress Watch found the story impressive, citing its use of time travel and the continued use of Destinys world and lore. The gameplay, mini-games and customization options was also generally praised, with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series. RPGFan's Woojin Lee was also positive, praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate, and was pleased that an auto-battle option was included. One point that received a more mixed response was the game's music, {{with the exception of}} the opening song. In a preview for IGN, David Smith was generally <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> the game. While he disliked the art style and its low-tech look compared to its hardware, he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly relatable. He ended by hoping that Namco would put the effort into localizing the title.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{interpretations of}} John {{have been subject}} to {{considerable}} change over the years. Medieval chroniclers provided the first contemporary, or near contemporary, histories of John's reign. One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life, or around the time of his accession, including Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto. These historians were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign. Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir – a story modern historians consider untrue.|$|E
5|$|Holden died on 1 May 1960. His {{body was}} cremated at Enfield crematorium and his ashes were {{spread in the}} garden of the Friends' Meeting House in Hertford. On 2 June 1960 a {{memorial}} service was held at St Pancras New Church, where Holden had designed the altar in 1914. Obituaries were published in daily newspapers The Manchester Guardian, The Times and The Daily Telegraph and in construction industry periodicals including The Builder, Architectural Review, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Journal of the Town Planning Institute. Generally, the obituaries were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works. The Harmer Green house and most of its contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.|$|E
5|$|Reviews for Advent Children {{have been}} mixed to positive: while critics have praised the presentation, {{graphics}} and fan appeal, all reviews agree that the story's context and delivery were confusing for people new to the series. While western critics were <b>positive</b> <b>about</b> Last Order, the OAV received heavy fan criticism in Japan due to its retconning of key events, which prompted the team {{to ensure that the}} event was faithfully recreated in Crisis Core. Before Crisis, due to remaining in Japan, has received limited attention in the west, but previews have been highly positive, with many praising the gameplay and graphics as being impressive for a mobile game. Opinions for Dirge of Cerberus were decidedly mixed. While many praised the story and characters, especially the focus on Vincent's character and development, critics were mixed to negative about the graphics and gameplay. Japanese magazine Famitsu notably gave the game a delayed and highly critical review. Crisis Core was generally praised, with many enjoying the story's intimate presentation of the characters and action-oriented gameplay, despite some criticism for it being aimed at fans of VII. Critics of the Compilation have generally cited Crisis Core as the best title of the series.|$|E
