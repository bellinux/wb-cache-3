For both the bal and cpr 1 mutants, destabilization of phenotypes was observed in more than 10 % of EMS-treated plants in the M 1 generation. In addition, exceptions to simple Mendelian inheritance were identified in the M 2 generation. Like cpr 1 × bal F 1 hybrids, cpr 1 × snc 1 F 1 hybrids and bal × snc 1 F 1 hybrids exhibited dwarf morphology. While only dwarf F 2 plants were produced from bal × snc 1 F 1 hybrids, about 10 % wild-type F 2 progeny were produced from cpr 1 × snc 1 F 1 hybrids, as well as from cpr 1 × bal hybrids. Segregation analysis suggested that the cpr 1 allele in cpr 1 × snc 1 crosses was destabilized during the late F 1 generation to early F 2 generation. Conclusion With exposure to EMS or different F 1 hybrid contexts, <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> is induced for the bal and cpr 1 alleles, but not for the snc 1 allele. Our results suggest that the RPP 5 locus can adopt different metastable genetic or epigenetic states, the stability of which is highly susceptible to mutagenesis and pairing of different alleles. </p...|$|E

Neoallopolyploids display sterility, lethality, <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability,</b> gene silencing and epigenetic changes. Little {{is known about}} the molecular basis of these phenomena, and how much genomic remodeling happens upon allopolyploidization. Extensive genomic remodeling has been documented in wheat, but little remodeling occurs in cotton. Newly synthesized Arabidopsis allopolyploids, which display <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> and low fertility, displayed several, possibly related mechanisms that can remodel genomes. We detected transcriptional activity of several transposons although their transposition was limited. One represents a new family of conditionally active En-Spm-like transposons of Arabidopsis thaliana, which underwent remodeling of CG methylation upon allopolyploidization. A random amplified fragment length polymorphism survey suggested remodeling at few, specific loci. Meiotic analyses revealed the appearance of chromosomal fragments in a substantial fraction of anther meiocytes. In several individuals produced by hybrids between the synthetic and a natural allopolyploid pollen viability inversely correlated with meiotic instability. Activity of selected DNA transposons and the possibly related chromosomal breaks could cause changes by inducing translocations and rearrangements...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{phenotypic}} diversity or variation {{exists in}} clonal populations of microorganisms and {{is thought to}} play a role in adaptation to novel environments. This <b>phenotypic</b> variation or <b>instability,</b> which occurs by multiple mechanisms, may be a form of cellular differentiation and a stochastic means for modulating gene expression. This work dissects a case of phenotypic variation in a clinically derived Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain involving a cox 15 ochre mutation, which acts as a reporter. The ochre mutation reverts to sense at a low frequency while tRNA-Tyr ochre suppressors (SUP-o) arise at a very high frequency to produce this phenotypic variation. The SUP-o mutations are highly pleiotropic. In addition, although all SUP-o mutations within the eight-member tRNA-Tyr gene family suppress the ochre mutation reporter, there are considerable phenotypic differences among the different SUP-o mutants. Finally, and of particular interest, there is a strong position effect on mutation frequency within the eight-member tRNA-Tyr gene family, with one locus, SUP 6, mutating at a much higher than average frequency and two other loci, SUP 2 and SUP 8, mutating at much lower than average frequencies. Mechanisms for the position effect on mutation frequency are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Environmental stimuli {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on gene expression patterns and this impact is not always confined to a single cell cycle, but can sometimes persist through multiple divisions or even transgenerationally. Such phenomena are often classified as epigenetic because genetic mutations are not thought to behave in such a directed, nonrandom manner. Studies concerning epigenetics often overlook unstable variation in repetitive heterochromatic sequences as a potential mode of transgenerational inheritance. Although they constitute a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes, technological limitations have greatly hindered our understanding of the functional importance of such sequences. Copy number variation in the unstable ribosomal RNA gene array (rDNA) -a specific class of repetitive sequence- modulates heterochromatin formation and influences the expression of a large fraction of the Drosophila genome. The primary aim of this study was to identify an environmental source of rDNA instability and to characterize the phenotypic consequences of the variation generated by that instability. Using genetic, cytological, and molecular assays, I discovered that increased dietary yeast concentration results in rDNA instability and copy number reduction in the soma and germline. Modulation of Insulin/TOR signaling produces similar results, indicating a role for known nutrient sensing signaling pathways in this process. Previous studies suggest that rDNA deletions influence the regulation of a number of metabolically important genes. Supporting this, I found that variation in rDNA modulates the Drosophila starvation response and affects lipid metabolism. This effect is potentially mediated by differential rDNA transcription, suggesting a link between the cause of <b>instability</b> and its <b>phenotypic</b> outcome. <b>Instability</b> is not just thought to be a property of rDNA, but seems to occur via similar mechanisms in other repetitive sequences. I developed a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to quantify simple pentameric sequence repeats and used it to discover previously uncharacterized natural and mutationally-induced variation on the heterochromatic Y chromosome. Taken together, these findings suggest a non-epigenetic mechanism through which the environment can influence gene expression patterns in a manner that is specific, heritable, and consequential...|$|R

We have investigated allopolyploidization between Arabidopsis thaliana (2 n � 2 x � 10; n, gametic chromosome number; x, haploid chromosome number) and Cardaminopsis arenosa (2 n � 4 x � 32). The variable phenotype of the allotetraploids could not be explained by cytological abnormalities. However, we found suppression of 20 of the 700 genes examined by amplified fragment length polymorphism of cDNA. Independent reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analyses of 10 of these 20 genes confirmed silencing in three of them, suggesting that � 0. 4 % of the genes in the allotetraploids are silenced. These three silenced genes were characterized. One, called K 7, is repeated and similar to transposons. Another is RAP 2. 1, a member of the large APETALA 2 (AP 2) gene family, and has a repeated element upstream of its 5 � end. The last, L 6, is an unknown gene close to ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE on chromosome 1. CNG DNA methylation of K 7 was less in the allotetraploids than in the parents, and the element varied in copy number. That K 7 could be reactivated suggests epigenetic regulation.

Reprogramming a committed cell back to pluripotence to then instruct it toward a particular specialized cell type is demanding and may increase risks of neoplasia and undesired cell types. Precursor/progenitor cells from the organ of therapeutic concern typically lack only one critical attribute—the capacity for sustained self-renewal. We speculated that this could be induced in a regulatable manner such that cells proliferate only in vitro and differentiate in vivo without the need for promoting pluripotence or specifying lineage identity. As proof-of-concept, we generated and tested the efficiency, safety, engraftability, and therapeutic utility of “induced conditional self-renewing progenitor (ICSP) cells” derived from the human central nervous system (CNS); we conditionally induced self-renewal efficiently within neural progenitors solely by introducing v-myc tightly regulated by a tetracycline (Tet) -on gene expression system. Tet in the culture medium activated myc transcription and translation, allowing efficient expansion of homogeneous, clonal, karyotypically normal human CNS precursors ex vivo; in vivo, where Tet was absent, myc was not expressed, and self-renewal was entirely inactivated (as was tumorigenic potential). Cell proliferation ceased, and differentiation into electrophysiologically active neurons and other CNS cell types in vivo ensued upon transplantation into rats, both during development and after adult injury—with functional improvement and without neoplasia, overgrowth, deformation, emergence of non-neural cell types, <b>phenotypic</b> or genomic <b>instability,</b> or need for immunosuppression.

40|$|To date, {{the lack}} of a {{suitable}} human cardiac cell source has been the major setback in regenerating the human myocardium, either by cell-based transplantation or by cardiac tissue engineering 1 - 3. Cardiomyocytes become terminally-differentiated soon after birth and lose their ability to proliferate. There is no evidence that stem/progenitor cells derived from other sources, such as the bone marrow or the cord blood, are able to give rise to the contractile heart muscle cells following transplantation into the heart 1 - 3. The need to regenerate or repair the damaged heart muscle has not been met by adult stem cell therapy, either endogenous or via cell delivery 1 - 3. The genetically stable human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have unlimited expansion ability and unrestricted plasticity, proffering a pluripotent reservoir for in vitro derivation of large supplies of human somatic cells that are restricted to the lineage in need of repair and regeneration 4, 5. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and acute shortage of donor organs, there is intense interest in developing hESC-based therapies as an alternative approach. However, how to channel the wide differentiation potential of pluripotent hESCs efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype has been a major challenge for both developmental study and clinical translation. Conventional approaches rely on multi-lineage inclination of pluripotent cells through spontaneous germ layer differentiation, resulting in inefficient and uncontrollable lineage-commitment that is often followed by <b>phenotypic</b> heterogeneity and <b>instability,</b> hence, a high risk of tumorigenicity 6 - 8 (see a schematic in Fig. 1 A). In addition, undefined foreign/animal biological supplements and/or feeders that have typically been used for the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of hESCs may make direct use of such cell-specialized grafts in patients problematic 9 - 11. To overcome these obstacles, we have resolved the elements of a defined culture system necessary and sufficient for sustaining the epiblast pluripotence of hESCs, serving as a platform for de novo derivation of clinically-suitable hESCs and effectively directing such hESCs uniformly towards clinically-relevant lineages by small molecules 12 (see a schematic in Fig. 1 B). After screening a variety of small molecules and growth factors, we found that such defined conditions rendered nicotinamide (NAM) sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from pluripotent hESCs that further progressed to cardioblasts that generated human beating cardiomyocytes with high efficiency (Fig. 2).

Differences in the sensitivity of the clonal lines of wild-type caMT in various passages were observed and this would appear to be due to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> in these lines. This suggests that to use survival data from clones which have been passaged many times for predicting the response of the parent tumour may be misleading. Many tumours {{have been shown to be}} heterogeneous with respect to drug sensitivity. Highly drug-resistant cells have been isolated following drug treatment (Clements, 1975) and differences in sensitivity of untreated sub-lines, clonal or nonclonal, have been demonstrated (Heppner et al. ...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{applications}} of human hepatocytes, such as bioartificial livers and toxicity assays, require thoroughly testing of human cell lines prior to {{using them as}} alternative cell sources. The reversibly immortalized NKNT- 3 cell line was reported to show clear in vivo functionality. Here, NKNT- 3 cells were tested for their in vitro applicability. Low-passage (P 2) and high-passage (P 28) NKNT- 3 cells and clonal derivatives were characterized for reversion of immortalization, heterogeneity, and hepatic functionality. Reversion with reduced expression of immortalizing agent could be established. However, during culturing the cells lost the capacity to be selected for completed reversion. The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> is probably associated with heterogeneity in the culture, as clonal derivatives of P 2 cells varied in morphology, growth, and reversion characteristics. The mRNA levels of genes related with hepatic differentiation increased 4 - 20 -fold after reversion. However, the levels never exceeded 0. 1 % of that detected in liver and no urea production nor ammonia elimination was detected. Additionally, activities of different cytochrome P 450 s were limited. In conclusion, the NKNT- 3 culture is heterogeneous and unstable and the in vitro functionality is relatively low. These findings emphasize that in vivo testing of hepatic cell lines is little informative for predicting their value for in vitro application...|$|E
40|$|The most {{striking}} characteristic of CHO cells is their adaptability, which enables efficient production of proteins {{as well as}} growth {{under a variety of}} culture conditions, but also results in genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability.</b> To investigate the relative contribution of genomic and epigenetic modifications towards phenotype evolution, comprehensive genome and epigenome data are presented for six related CHO cell lines, both in response to perturbations (different culture conditions and media as well as selection of a specific phenotype with increased transient productivity) and in steady state (prolonged time in culture under constant conditions). Clear transitions were observed in DNA-methylation patterns upon each perturbation, while few changes occurred over time under constant conditions. Only minor DNA-methylation changes were observed between exponential and stationary growth phase; however, throughout a batch culture the histone modification pattern underwent continuous adaptation. Variation in genome sequence between the six cell lines on the level of SNPs, InDels, and structural variants is high, both upon perturbation and under constant conditions over time. The here presented comprehensive resource may open the door to improved control and manipulation of gene expression during industrial bioprocesses based on epigenetic mechanisms. Biotechnol.

40|$|The {{constancy}} of phenotypic {{variation and}} covariation is {{an assumption that}} underlies most recent investigations of past selective regimes and attempts to predict future responses to selection. Few studies have tested this assumption of constancy despite good reasons to expect that the pattern of phenotypic variation and covariation may vary in space and time. We compared phenotypic variance-covariance matrices (P) estimated for Populations of six species of distantly related coral reef fishes sampled at two locations on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Great Barrier Reef separated by more than 1000 km. The intraspecific similarity between these matrices was estimated using two methods: matrix correlation and common principal component analysis. Although {{there was no evidence}} of equality between pairs of P, both statistical approaches indicated a high degree of similarity in morphology between the two populations for each species. In general, the hierarchical decomposition of the variance-covariance structure of these populations indicated that all principal components of phenotypic variance-covariance were shared but that they differed in the degree of variation associated with each of these components. The consistency of this pattern is remarkable given the diversity of morphologies and life histories encompassed by these species. Although some <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> was indicated, these results were consistent with a generally conserved pattern of multivariate selection between populations...|$|E
40|$|The major {{complications}} for tumor therapy are (i) tumor spread (metastasis); (ii) {{the mixed}} nature of tumors (heterogeneity); and (iii) {{the capacity of}} tumors to evolve (progress). To study these tumor characteristics, the rat 13762 NF mammary adenocarcinoma was cloned and studied for metastatic properties and sensitivities to therapy (chemotherapy, radiation and hyperthermia). The cell clones were heterogeneous and no correlation between metastatic potential and therapeutic sensitivities was observed. Further, these phenotypes were unstable during passage in vitro; yet, the changes were clone dependent and reproducible using different cryoprotected cell stocks. To understand the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability,</b> subclones were isolated from low and high passage cell clones. Each subclone possessed a unique composite phenotype. Again, no apparent correlation was seen between metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapy. The results demonstrated that (1) tumor cells are heterogeneous for multiple phenotypes; (2) tumor cells are unstable for multiple phenotypes; (3) the magnitude, direction and time of occurrence of phenotypic drift is clone dependent; (4) the sensitivity of cell clones to ionizing radiation (gamma or heat) and chemotherapy agents is independent of their metastatic potential; (5) shifts in metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapy may occur simultaneously but are not linked; and (6) tumor cells independently diverge to form several subpopulations with unique phenotypic profiles. ...|$|E
40|$|The M antigen, {{a primary}} {{determinant}} of virulence in group A streptococci that is expressed biologically as resistance to phagocytosis, {{is known to}} undergo a variety of phenotypic changes both in vivo and in vitro. These changes are nonrandom and can occur at a high frequency. Using the previously described relationship between the serum opacity reaction (associated with certain strains) {{and the presence of}} the M antigen, the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> of the M antigen was analyzed. The results support the conclusion that M protein synthesis and the serum opacity reaction are directly or indirectly controlled by the same gene or by genes which are linked and can segregate as a unit. Moreover, growth conditions and the curing agents rifampin and ethidium bromide had a discernible influence on the segregation of clones unable to exhibit serum opacity factor and to resist phagocytosis by human leukocytes. Serial transfer of stationary-phase cultures of four strains of group A streptococci significantly increased the number of colonies negative for the serum opacity reaction and the M antigen. For two of four strains both ethidium bromide and rifampin also increased the segregation of colonies with this phenotype. In light of these experiments and the necessary controls, the possible influence of plasmids or bacteriophage in regulating M protein synthesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Metastases {{that are}} {{resistant}} to conventional therapies are {{the main cause of}} most cancer-related deaths in humans. Tumor cell heterogeneity, which associates with genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability,</b> represents a major problem for cancer therapy. Additional factors, such as the attack of immune cells or organ-specific microenvironments, also influence metastatic cell behavior and the response to therapy. Interaction of cancer and endothelial cells in capillary beds, involving mechanical contact and transient adhesion, is a critical step in the initiation of metastasis. This interaction initiates a cascade of activation pathways that involves cytokines, growth factors, bioactive lipids and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) produced by either the cancer cell or the endothelium. Vascular endothelium-derived NO and H 2 O 2 are cytotoxic for the cancer cells, but also help to identify some critical molecular targets that appear essential for survival of invasive metastatic cell subsets. Surviving cancer cells that extravasate and start colonization of an organ or tissue can still be attacked by macrophages and be influenced by specific intraorgan microenvironment conditions. At all steps; from the primary tumor until colonization of a distant organ; metastatic cells undergo a dynamic process of constant adaptations that may lead to the survival of highly resistant malignant cell subsets. In this sequence of molecular events both ROS and RNS play key roles...|$|E
40|$|Derivatives of Myxococcus xanthus FBt {{resistant}} to chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) arose spontaneously with a frequency of approximately 10 − 7. One of these organisms (FBtCam 1 r) was characterized. FBtCam 1 r showed a unique type of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability.</b> After transfer from medium containing chloramphenicol to medium lacking the drug, resistance was lost after approximately one generation. The loss {{resulted in a}} sharp drop in the total number of chloramphenicol-resistant organisms and was not due to segregation of chloramphenicol-susceptible organisms during growth. Cell-free extracts of strain FBtCam 1 r converted chloramphenicol to acetyl chloramphenicols in a fashion implicating activity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. This activity was lost simultaneously with the loss of chloramphenicol resistance after removal of the drug from cultures. Organisms with a similar phenotype to FBtCam 1 r could be produced at high frequencies when strain FBt was exposed to low concentrations of chloramphenicol (2 to 5 μg/ml), to 3 -acetylchloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), or to 1, 3 -diacetylchloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). Since strain FBt is capable of deacetylating acetyl chloramphenicols, these effects are probably all due to low concentrations of chloramphenicol. In the presence of chloramphenicol, FBtCam 1 r produced fruiting bodies and myxospores on fruiting agar; however, glycerol-induced myxospore formation was inhibited. In the absence of the antibiotic, chloramphenicol resistance was maintained by glycerol-induced myxospores...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{appearance}} of transformed properties following infection of human epidermal keratinocytes by the oncogenic virus SV 40. Shortly after infection, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells are positive for SV 40. Shortly after infections, {{only a small fraction of}} the cells are positive for SV 40 T antigen by immunofluorescence; this fraction progressively increase in plating/ colony-forming efficiency and growth rate. The capacity of the cells to differentiate progressively decreases, as indicated by cytochemical staining and cornfied cell-envelope formation induced by suspension in methyl cellulose. The infected cells enter a period of growth crisis characterized by cytopathology and cell death as the level of T antigen synthesis reaches about 90 precent positive cells at about the tenth serial passage. Viable cells emerging from the crisis period are found to exhibit anchorage-independent growth, as indicated by the formation of viable colonies in semisolid media, but there is considered variability in colony formation among clones isolated from anchorage-independent populations. The emergent population also manifests <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> in terms of the appearance of variants, which in contrast to uninfected cells, expresses a well-defined actins cytoskeleton. The infected cells eventually become “immortalized,” as evidenced by an indefinite lifespan, i. e., replication capability maintained well beyond the ordinary time of senescence for uninfected cells, We present these findings in the context of a stage-specific model of epithelial transformation in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Two {{isolates}} of Candida glabrata, one susceptible and one {{resistant to}} azole antifungals, were previously shown to differ in quantity and {{activity of the}} cytochrome P- 450 14 a-lanosterol demethylase which is the target for azole antifungals. The resistant isolate also had a lower intracellular level of fluconazole, but not of ketoconazole or itraconazole, than the susceptible isolate. In the present study a 3. 7 -fold increase in the copy number of the CYP 51 gene, encoding the 14 a-lanosterol demethylase, was found. The amount of CYP 51 mRNA transcript in the resistant isolate was eight times greater {{than it was in}} the susceptible isolate. Hybridization experiments on chromosomal blots indicated that this increase in copy number was due to duplication of the entire chromosome containing the CYP 51 gene. The <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> of the resistant isolate was demon-strated genotypically: a gradual loss of the duplicated chromosome was seen in successive subcultures of the isolate in fluconazole-free medium and correlated with reversion to susceptibility. The greater abundance of the amplified chromosome induced pronounced differences in the protein patterns of the susceptible and revertant isolates versus that of the resistant isolate, as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 D-GE). Densitometry of the 2 D-GE product indicated upregulation of at least 25 proteins and downregulation of at least 76 proteins in the resistant isolate. The incidence of life-threatening fungal infections has in...|$|E
40|$|Sucrose has {{economic}} and environmental advantages over glucose as a feedstock for bioprocesses. E. coli is widely used in industry, {{but the majority of}} current industrial E. coli strains cannot utilize sucrose. Previous attempts to transfer sucrose catabolic capabilities into non-sucrose-utilizing strains have met with limited success due to low growth rates on sucrose and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>instability</b> of the engineered strains. To address these problems, we developed a transferrable sucrose utilization cassette which confers efficient sucrose catabolism when integrated onto the E. coli chromosome. The cassette was based on the csc genes from E. coli W, a strain which grows very quickly on sucrose. Both plasmid-borne expression and chromosomal integration of a repressor-less sucrose utilizing cassette were investigated in E. coli strains K- 12, B and C. In contrast to previous studies, strains harboring chromosomal cassettes could grow {{at the same rate as}} they do on glucose. Interestingly, we also discovered that spontaneous chromosomal integration of the csc genes was required to allow efficient growth from plasmid-transformed strains. The ability to engineer industrial strains for efficient sucrose utilization will allow substitution of sucrose for glucose in industrial fermentations. This will encourage the use of sucrose as a carbon source and assist in transition of our petrochemical-based economy to a bio-based economy. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.
