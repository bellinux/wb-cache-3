2500|$|Since then, various {{detection}} {{methods have been}} used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by photomultiplier tubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a solid <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillator</b> coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the NOνA detector uses liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes.

5000|$|The term [...] "plastic scintillator" [...] {{typically}} {{refers to}} a scintillating material in which the primary fluorescent emitter, called a fluor, is suspended in the base, a solid polymer matrix. While this combination is typically accomplished through {{the dissolution of the}} fluor prior to bulk polymerization, the fluor is sometimes associated with the polymer directly, either covalently or through coordination, {{as is the case with}} many Li6 <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators.</b> Polyethylene naphthalate has been found to exhibit scintillation by itself without any additives and is expected to replace existing <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> due to higher performance and lower price. The advantages of <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> include fairly high light output and a relatively quick signal, with a decay time of 2-4 nanoseconds, but perhaps the biggest advantage of <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> is their ability to be shaped, through the use of molds or other means, into almost any desired form with what is often a high degree of durability. <b>Plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> are known to show light output saturation when the energy density is large (Birks' Law).|$|R

Preliminary EPR results investigate four different types of <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators.</b> These include three polyvinyl-toluene based Eljen technologies: EJ 200, EJ 208 and EJ 260, and one polystyrene based Dubna sample.

The scintillators in the gap region were exposed to a radiation environment of up to 10 kGy/year during the first run of data taking and with the luminosity being increased by a factor of 10, the radiation environment will be extremely harsh. We report on the radiation damage to the optical properties of <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> following irradiation using a neutron beam of the IBR- 2 pulsed reactor in Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna. A comparison is drawn between polyvinyl toluene based commercial scintillators EJ 200, EJ 208 and EJ 260 as well as polystyrene based scintillator from Kharkov. The samples were subjected to irradiation with high energy neutrons and a flux density range of 1 × 10 (6) – 7. 7 × 10 (6). Light transmission, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and light yield testing was performed to characterize the damage induced in the samples.

50|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{detecting}} individual gamma rays ranging from 30 MeV to 30 GeV, EGRET was equipped with a <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillator</b> anti-coincidence dome, spark chamber, and calorimeter. Starting from {{the outside of the}} telescope, scientists covered EGRET with a <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillator</b> anti-coincidence dome. The dome acted as a shield, blocking any unwanted energy waves from entering the telescope and skewing the data. To actually create recordable, usable data, scientists used a process called electron-positron pair production, which is creating an electron and positron simultaneously near a nucleus or subatomic particle. In order to induce this process, scientists assembled a multilevel thin-plate spark chamber within the telescope. A spark chamber is basically a chamber with many plates of metal and gases such as helium or neon. Finally, to record the data from the electron or positron about the gamma ray, scientists equipped EGRET with a thallium-activated sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) calorimeter at its base. The calorimeter captured the resolution of the gamma rays that entered EGRET.|$|E

40|$|The Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS detector, is a hadronic {{calorimeter}} {{responsible for}} detecting hadrons {{as well as}} accommodating for the missing transverse energy that result from the p-p collisions within the LHC. <b>Plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> form an integral component of this calorimeter due {{to their ability to}} undergo prompt fluorescence when exposed to ionising particles. The scintillators employed are specifically chosen for their properties of high optical transmission and fast rise and decay time which enables efficient data capture since fast signal pulses can be generated. The main draw-back of <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> however is their susceptibility to radiation damage. The damage caused by radiation exposure reduces the scintillation light yield and introduces an error into the time-of flight data acquired. During Run 1 of the LHC data taking period, <b>plastic</b> <b>scintillators</b> employed within the GAP region between the Tile Calorimeter’s central and extended barrels sustained a significant amount of damage. With operational beam energy set to increase in successive data taking periods to come, these scintillators will be exposed to a much harsher radiation environment.
