High-pressure liquid chromatography of the activated intermediates formed during in vitro early embryonic development indicated that the onset of <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> activation coincided with blastocyst formation. Comparison of individual oxygenated intermediates metabolically formed from embryos genetically "responsive" or "nonresponsive" to aromatic hydrocarbons revealed significant quantitative differences {{in the production of}} dihydrodiol, quinone, and phenolic derivatives. In addition to exhibiting basal mixed-function oxidase activity, blastocysts were also responsive to enzymatic induction when exposed to 2,- 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The presence of operative metabolite-detoxifying pathways was also assayed. Enzymatic treatment of water-soluble metabolites with beta-glucuronidase or arylsulfatase revealed that neither glucuronic acid conjugates nor sulfate ester derivatives were present. These data, therefore, provide direct evidence that late preimplantation mouse embryos (day 3 1 / 2 of gestation) are similar to later developmental stages in having the enzymatic capability for xenobiotic activation and enzyme induction but are dissimilar with respect to their detoxification mechanism(s). Moreover, the ability of preimplantation embryos to activate directly <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> to bioreactive intermediates may be of importance in assessing the ontological susceptibility of the developing embryo to carcinogenic or teratogenic chemicals...|$|E

Skin contamination with pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene was assessed by skin wipe sampling. As a biomarker of exposure to <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and as an integral of all possible absorption routes of pyrene, 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration was measured from post-shift urine samples. Eighteen percent of the personal air samples exceeded the Finnish threshold limit value of benzol[a]pyrene (10 micrograms/m 3). Mean values for benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene were 5. 7 micrograms/m 3 and 8. 1 micrograms/m 3, respectively. Based on skin wipe sample analyses, the skin contamination was also obvious. The mean value of benzo[a]pyrene on the samples collected after the shift was 1. 2 ng/cm 2. In control samples, benzo[a]pyrene was not found. The mean value of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration was 6. 0 nmol/mmol creatinine for the exposed workers and 0. 5 nmol/mmol creatinine for the controls.

40|$|Density {{functional}} {{theory has}} been used to model the selective catalytic oxidation of model polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular pyrene. Two transition metal catalysts have been employed, ruthenium tetroxide and a peroxy tungsten complex. The B 3 LYP method was used in all calculations. The LANL 2 DZ effective core potential was used for ruthenium and tungsten atoms. The 6 - 31 G(d,p) basis set was used for all other atoms. Selectivity studies show that catalyst-substrate adducts will form at the carbon-carbon bond of the <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> that will give the least reduction in aromaticity. The strain induced in planar <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> structures did not have a bearing on catalyst selectivity. Interior carbon-carbon bonds of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons will not be attacked, meaning that oxidative fragmentation of these compounds starts at the exposed carbon-carbon bonds. For the ruthenium catalysed oxidation system, multiple catalyst attacks at similar sites on polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons is possible but unlikely due to the catalytic amounts used. It is indicated that the presence of aliphatic functional groups at the adduct formation sites for the ruthenium catalyst will not hinder adduct formation. Water is necessary for the success of both catalysts. The pathway found for ruthenium catalysed oxidation shows a stable dione intermediate, this intermediate has been confirmed by experimental findings and the literature. For the ruthenium catalyst water is required as it is involved in the reaction mechanism, facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms adjacent to the catalyst adduct formation site. Water is not as directly involved in the tungsten catalyst mechanism, taking the role of a stabilising agent for transition state structures. The reaction pathways found for both catalysts show that the final reaction intermediate before breaking the carbon-carbon bond is an organic anhydride.
