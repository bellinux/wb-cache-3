40|$|Germinating conidiospores of Neurospora crassa {{that were}} exposed to 45 degrees C, a {{temperature}} that induces a heat shock response, were protected from injury caused by freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing at 0 degrees C. Whereas up to 90 % of the control spores were killed by this freezing and slow thawing, a prior heat shock increased cell survival four- to fivefold. Survival was determined by three assays: the extent of spore germination in liquid medium, the number of colonies that grew on solid medium, and dry-weight accumulation during exponential growth in liquid culture. The heat shock-induced <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing</b> injury was transient. Spores transferred to normal growth temperature after exposure to heat shock and before freezing lost the heat shock-induced protection within 30 min. Spores subjected to freezing and thawing stress synthesized small amounts of the heat shock proteins that are synthesized in large quantities by cells exposed to 45 degrees C. Pulse-labeling studies demonstrated that neither chilling the spores to 10 degrees C or 0 degrees C {{in the absence of}} freezing nor warming the spores from 0 degrees C to 30 degrees C induced heat shock protein synthesis. The presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide during spore exposure to 45 degrees C did not abolish the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing</b> injury induced by heat shock. Treatment of the cells with cycloheximide before freezing, without exposure to heat shock, itself increased spore survival...|$|E
40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) {{prevent the}} growth of ice, and are used by some organisms that live in sub-zero environments for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing.</b> All AFPs are thought to function by an adsorption inhibition process. In order to elucidate the ice-binding mechanism, the structures of several AFPs have been determined, and {{have been shown to}} consist of different folds. Recently, the first structures of the highly active insect AFPs have been characterized. These proteins have a b-helix structure, which adds yet another fold to the AFP family. The 90 -residue spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) AFP consists of a b-helix with 15 residues per coil. The structure contains two ranks of aligned threonine residues (known as the TXT motif), which were shown by mutagenesis experiments to be located in the ice-binding face. In our previous NMR study of this AFP at 30 8 C, we found that the TXT face was not optimally defined because of the broadening of NMR resonances potentially due to weak oligomerization. We present here a structure of spruce budworm AFP determined at 5 8 C, where this broadening is reduced. In addition, the 1 H – 15 N NMR dynamics of the protein were examined at 30 8 C and 5 8 C. The results show that the spruce budworm AFP is more structured at 5 8 C, and support the general observation that AFPs become more rigid as the temperature is lowered...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{developing}} alternative vitrification solutions, modified {{either from the}} original PVS 2 vitrification solution, by increasing glycerol and sucrose and/or decreasing dimethylsulfoxide and ethylene glycol concentration, or from the original PVS 3 vitrification solution by decreasing glycerol and sucrose concentration. The application of these vitrification solutions to two model species, i. e. garlic and chrysanthemum in a droplet-vitrification procedure, revealed that PVS 3 and variants were superior to PVS 2 and variants and that most PVS 2 variants were comparable to the original PVS 2. Both species were sensitive to chemical toxicity of permeating cryoprotectants and chrysanthemum was also sensitive to osmotic stress. The lower recovery of cryopreserved garlic shoot apices dehydrated with PVS 2 and variants compared with those dehydrated with PVS 3 and variants seemed attributed to cytotoxicity of the vitrification solutions tested {{as well as to}} insufficient <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing</b> injury. Chrysanthemum shoot tips were very sensitive to both chemical toxicity and osmotic stress and therefore, induction of cytotoxity tolerance during preconditioning was required for successful cryopreservation. The present study revealed that some of the PVS 2 variants tested which have increased glycerol and sucrose and/or decreased dimethylsulfoxide and ethylene glycol concentration can be applied when explants are of medium size, tolerant to chemical toxicity and moderately sensitive to osmotic stress. PVS 3 and variants can be used widely when samples are heterogeneous, of large size and/or very sensitive to chemical toxicity and tolerant to osmotic stress...|$|E

40|$|Notothenioid fish, the {{dominant}} {{species in the}} Southern Ocean, {{is one of the}} most intriguing group of species from evolutionary viewpoint. One major reason of their evolutionary success is the acquisition of anti-freeze glycopeptides (AFGP) by the modification of trypsinogen, which enables them to survive even under harsh environment of the Southern Ocean where temperature can become as low as about - 2 ℃. Another peculiar example of adaptive evolution is nonfunctionalization of hemoglobin genes in icefish. Although loss of hemoglobin is generally lethal for vertebrates, extensive modification of cardiovascular system in icefish has compensated such disadvantage with ensuring sufficient oxygen transport. Recent studies of mitochondrial genes, furthermore, have shown that the evolutionary rates of genes involved in cellular respiration are much higher compared with other teleosts (see also Nagata and Ota in this symposium). In order to shed light on the molecular evolution of notothenioid genes in larger scale, we are currently investigating the genes expressed in Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) spleen, one of important tissue of hematopoiesis, with taking advantage of technological progress of next generation sequencer. So far 55180 nucleotide sequences were assembled from about 11 million 50 -mers by using velvet program (table 1). Subsequent analysis of assembled sequences then revealed that genes highly expressed are those involved in protein synthesis and folding, protein degradation, cellular respiration, cellular movement, innate and adaptive immunity, oxygen transport, iron ion storage and homeostasis, and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing,</b> as shown in table 2.

40|$|Low-temperature {{adaptation}} and cryoprotection were {{studied in the}} lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis MG 1363. An approximately 100 -fold increased survival after freezing was observed when cells were shocked to 10 °C for 4 h compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at 30 °C, indicating an active <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing.</b> Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis a group of 7 kDa cold-induced proteins (CSPs) was identified that corresponds to a previously described family of csp genes of L. lactis MG 1363. The 7 kDa CSPs {{appeared to be the}} most strongly induced proteins upon cold shock to 10 °C. Northern blotting and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the csp genes were maximally expressed at 10 °C, while induction was lower at 20 and 4 °C. However, pre-incubation at 20 and 4 °C, as well as stationary-phase conditions, also induced cryoprotection (approx. 30 -, 130 - and 20 -fold, respectively, compared to 30 °C mid-exponential phase). For all treatments leading to an increased freeze survival (exposure to 4, 10 and 20 °C and stationary-phase conditions), increased levels of three proteins (26, 43 and 45 kDa) were observed for which a role in cryoprotection might be suggested. Increased freeze survival coincides with increased CSP expression, except for stationary-phase conditions. However, the level of observed freeze protection does not directly correlate with the csp gene expression levels. In addition, for the first time specific overproduction of a CSP in relation to freeze survival was studied. This revealed that L. lactis cells overproducing CspD at 30 °C show a 2 – 10 -fold increased survival after freezing compared to control cells. This indicates that the 7 kDa cold-shock protein CspD may enhance the survival capacity after freezing but that other factors supply additional cryoprotection. ...|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation induces {{injuries}} to fish spermatozoa {{that in turn}} affect sperm quality in terms of fertilization ability, motility, DNA and protein integrity and larval survival. To reduce the loss of sperm quality due to freezing-thawing, {{it is necessary to}} improve these procedures. In the present study we investigated the ability of two antifreeze proteins (AFPI and AFPIII) to reduce the loss of quality of sea bream spermatozoa due to cryopreservation. To do so, we compared viability, motility, straight-line velocity and curvilinear velocity of fresh and (AFPs) -cryopreserved spermatozoa. AFPIII addition to cryopreservation medium improved viability, motility and straight-line velocity with respect to DMSO or DMSO plus AFPI. To clarify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying these findings, the protein profile of two different cryopreserved sperm domains, flagella and head plasma membranes, was analysed. The protein profiles differed between fresh and frozen-thawed semen and results of the image analysis demonstrated that, after cryopreservation, out of 270 proteins 12 were decreased and 7 were increased in isolated flagella, and out of 150 proteins 6 showed a significant decrease and 4 showed a significant increase in head membranes. Mass spectrometry analysis identified 6 proteins (4 from isolated flagella and 2 present both in flagella and head plasma membranes) within the protein spots affected by the freezing-thawing procedure. 3 out of 4 proteins from isolated flagella were involved in the sperm bioenergetic system. Our results indicate that the ability of AFPIII to protect sea bream sperm quality can be, at least in part, ascribed to reducing changes in the sperm protein profile occurring during the freezing-thawing procedure. Our results clearly demonstrated that AFPIII addition to cryopreservation medium improved the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing</b> respect to DMSO or DMSO plus AFPI. In addition we propose specific proteins of spermatozoa as markers related to the procedures of fish sperm cryopreservation...|$|E
30|$|A common {{response}} of organisms to drought, salinity, and temperature stresses is {{the accumulation of}} sugars and compatible solutes including trehalose. The increased trehalose accumulation correlates with elevated capacity for photosynthesis under both stress and non-stress conditions in rice (Garg et al. 2002). Trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase (TPS) {{plays an important role}} in trehalose metabolism and signalling. Overexpression of the trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase gene OsTPS 1 enhances the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought stress without other significant phenotypic changes (Li et al. 2011). Similarly, the over-expression of trehalose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase in maize ears increases both kernel set and harvest index in drought stress condition. Increase in yield to the tune of 9 % to 49 % under non-drought or mild-drought conditions, and 31 % - 123 % under more severe drought conditions, relative to yields from non-transgenic controls was observed (Nuccio et al. 2015). Similarly, trehalose concentration increased upon 4  h of heat stress at 40  °C and 4  days after cold stress at 4  °C in Arabidopsis thaliana (Kaplan et al. 2004). Over-expression of ScTPS 1 and ScTPS 2 under stress associated rd 29 A promoter provided <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> drought, salt, <b>freezing,</b> and heat stress (Miranda et al. 2007). Hence, trehalose synthase and trehalose phosphate synthase are a probable candidate genes underlying QTL qSSIY 5.1 /qSTIY 5.1 for yield under heat stress.|$|R

40|$|Dehydrins (DHNs), group II LEA (Late Embryogenesis Abundant) proteins, {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} observed proteins which accumulate in plants in response to cold and any other environmental factors, causing the dehydration of cells. In previous studies, we isolated a YSK 2 -type VvcDHN 1 a gene from table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Cardinal) which presented two spliced variants (the spliced, DHN 1 a_s and the unspliced, DHN 1 a_u). Their expression was induced by low temperature storage and CO 2, although with different accumulation patterns. DHN 1 a_u codifies for a truncated YS protein lacking ¿- and K-segments, which might affect its functionality. In this work, we expressed both DHN 1 a_s and DHN 1 a_u recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. We carried out a number of in vitro assays to analyze the implications that ¿- and K-segments have in the protective role of VvcDHN 1 against different abiotic stresses and their antifungal activity against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our results showed that unlike DHN 1 a_u, DHN 1 a_s has a potent cryoprotective effect on lactate dehydrogenase activity, protects malate dehydrogenase against dehydration and partially inhibits B. cinerea growth. Moreover, the DHN 1 a promoter presented cis-regulatory elements related to cold and drought, as well as biotic stress-related elements. We also observed that both spliced variants interact weakly with DNA, suggesting that K-segments are not involved in DNA binding. Overall, this work highlights the crucial role of ¿- and K-segments in DHNs function in plant response to abiotic stress showing for the first time, the potential role of the V. vinifera DHN 1 a_s in the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>freezing</b> and dehydration as well as inhibiting B. cinerea growth.
