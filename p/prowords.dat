50|$|Procedure {{words or}} <b>prowords</b> are words or phrases limited to radio {{telephone}} procedure used to facilitate communication by conveying {{information in a}} condensed standard verbal format. <b>Prowords</b> {{are similar to the}} much older prosigns for Morse code first developed in the 1860s for Morse telegraphy.|$|E

50|$|During {{transmission}} {{with lots}} of information, this <b>proword</b> can be used between transmissions, to ensure all information is passed on correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Again, however, {{things might}} not go as planned; the rounds fired {{might not be}} {{sufficient}} to destroy the target. The FO would then send the <b>proword</b> [...] "Repeat, over." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Protocol feature {{words are}} byte subsequences within traffic payload that can {{distinguish}} application protocols, and they form {{the building blocks}} of many constructions of deep packet analysis rules in network management, measurement, and security systems. However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose <b>ProWord,</b> an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. <b>ProWord</b> builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare <b>ProWord</b> and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that <b>ProWord</b> captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.

5000|$|At this juncture, Solent Coastguard would reply, {{giving the}} {{position}} of the shipping vessel preceded with the <b>prowords</b> [...] "I say again": ...|$|E
50|$|Each area of usage {{will have}} its own subset of <b>prowords,</b> usually derived from the NATO set, but {{sometimes}} from earlier Q-code and morse operator practices.|$|E
50|$|The {{omission}} of comment on signal strength and readability {{is understood to}} mean that reception is loud and clear. Ifreception is other than loud and clear, it must be described with the appropriate <b>prowords.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>proword</b> [...] "repeat" [...] {{is never}} used {{anywhere}} {{on a radio}} but when communicating that a forward observer wants the previous artillery battery to fire the mission again. [...] "Repeat, out." ...|$|R
5000|$|This <b>proword</b> is {{used when}} {{addressing}} an unidentified station {{which has just}} hailed the receiver. For example, Cowes VTS has received a transmission from an unidentified station. The correct reply would be: ...|$|R
5000|$|Instruction to {{receiving}} station to read back the information {{it has received}} for confirmation. It {{is the same as}} [...] "how copy". Reply from receiving station will be preceded by [...] "I read back" [...] or [...] "I copy", confirmation by transmitting station takes the form of the <b>proword</b> [...] "correct" [...] or [...] "good copy". The U.S. Army uses [...] "how copy" [...] only.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{understood}} your message, please say again". Usually used with <b>prowords</b> [...] "all after" [...] or [...] "all before". Example: radio working between Solent Coastguard and a motor vessel, call-sign EG 93, where {{part of the}} initial transmission is unintelligible ...|$|E
5000|$|... "No" [...] or [...] "neg". Because over a {{poor quality}} {{connection}} the words [...] "affirmative" [...] and [...] "negative" [...] can {{be mistaken for}} one another (for example over a sound-powered telephone circuit), United States Navy instruction omits the use of either as <b>prowords.</b> Sailors are instructed to instead use [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no".|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{the use of}} {{some special}} <b>prowords</b> is tightly controlled, with that word never used {{on the air in}} other {{contexts}} within that area of usage. Examples include [...] "repeat" [...] (for additional artillery fire in military communications), [...] "take off" [...] (granting permission for aircraft take off in airfield tower communications), [...] "rescue" [...] (rescue in progress in surf life saving), and [...] "mayday" [...] (safety-of-life emergency in maritime and aeronautics).|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "repeat" [...] is in {{most cases}} not used in place of [...] "say again", {{especially}} {{in the vicinity of}} naval or other firing ranges, as [...] "repeat" [...] is an artillery <b>proword</b> with a wholly different meaning. However, in aviation pilots say [...] "Please say again" [...] or [...] "please repeat". Also, [...] "repeat" [...] may be used {{in the middle of a}} signal to emphasise information. Example: ...|$|R
5000|$|Flash Override (Y): The National Command Authority (usually the President of the United States) {{has access}} to a FLASH OVERRIDE (FO) capability. FO is not a precedence, but instead {{represents}} the authority and means to override all other traffic, including FLASH precedence messages. In written message traffic, the <b>proword</b> 'Y' is used to indicate a message having the authority to override all other traffic and is usually assigned to Emergency Action Messages (EAM).|$|R
5000|$|The {{plaintext}} {{character set}} in BATCO consists of 12 symbols, the digits 0 to 9, the decimal point and a [...] "change" [...] character denoted as CH. The BATCO ciphertext character set is the letters A through Z. BATCO {{can also be}} used to transmit numeric information, such as grid coordinates. Switching to this mode is accomplished by sending the vocabulary code for an appropriate <b>proword,</b> such as FIGURES or GRID. The decimal point plaintext character is used as needed in numeric mode, having its normal meaning. The CH symbol is used to mark the end of a numeric string transmission, returning to the vocabulary card codes.|$|R
5000|$|Radio silence {{can be used}} in {{nautical}} and aeronautical communications {{to allow}} faint distress calls to be heard (see Mayday). In the latter case, the controlling station can order other stations to stop transmitting with the proword [...] "Seelonce Seelonce Seelonce". (The word uses the French pronunciation of the word silence, [...] "See-LAWNCE."). Once the need for radio silence is finished, the controlling station lifts radio silence by the <b>prowords</b> [...] "Seelonce FINI." [...] Disobeying a Seelonce Mayday order constitutes a serious criminal offence in most countries. The aviation equivalent of Seelonce Mayday is the phrase or command [...] "Stop Transmitting - Distress (or Mayday)". [...] "Distress traffic ended" [...] is the phrase used when the emergency is over. Again, disobeying such an order is extremely dangerous and is therefore a criminal offence in most countries.|$|E
