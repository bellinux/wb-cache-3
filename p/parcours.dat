5|$|The race's only {{individual}} {{time trial}} of an extensive length was held as an out-and-back loop around Villars-les-Dombes in the Ain department. The <b>parcours</b> of the -long stage was almost entirely flat. The stage finished at the Parc des Oiseaux, {{one of the}} largest ornithological parks in Europe. Race organisers had expected the quickest times for the course to be around forty minutes. Several of the general classification leaders regarded the time trial as a test for an individual time trial of similar length due to be held in July, at the Tour de France. As is customary in time trial stages, cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification {{at the end of the}} previous stage. Thus, Larry Warbasse of the , who was in 172nd place of the 176 starters, trailing overall leader David Veilleux by thirty-five minutes and fourteen seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The <b>parcours</b> began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{our initial}} work {{as part of}} the <b>PARCOUR</b> (Public Accountability to Residents in COntractual Urban Redevelopment) {{research}} project this paper will investigate the forms of governance arrangements developed in three UK case studies (Bristol, Gloucester and Taunton) of public-private urban development partnerships and the associated planning and regulatory tools utilised as part of this process. Contracts, deeds, by-laws and other regulatory instruments are used as planning tools to regulate actors (from the public, private and civil sectors) involved in the regeneration of previously developed land. <b>PARCOUR</b> argues that contractual relationships create a specific form of governance that have important implications for the democratic legitimacy of projects for Sustainable Urban Development (SUD). More specifically by studying diverse planning tools in Brazil, UK and the Netherlands, <b>PARCOUR</b> will engage in the comparative evaluation of public accountability in relation to residents. In terms of the UK case studies selected range from completed (Bristol), largely completed (Gloucester) to partially completed (Taunton) and their development ranges from the 1990 s to the late 2000 s (Bristol), the 2000 s (Gloucester) and 2000 s to the present day (Taunton). Although each was either conceived or being worked on during a period of time in which the prevailing discursive framework operated within an overarching neo-liberal discourse emphasising economic development and competitiveness over social and environmental outcomes. We seek to identify two types of planning and regulatory tools: 1) those deriving from national legislation (and how they were deployed in each of our case studies); 2) any specific, more informal or ad hoc planning and regulatory tools developed with reference to the specific case study. At this stage of the research we are assuming that in each case the relevant partnerships drew upon (1) and (2) in the light of their past experience in urban development partnerships and in relation to each case and its goals. Moreover, {{as part of the}} wider PACOUR project we seek to assess the extent/degree to which these planning and regulatory tools were able to provide some form of accountability to residents and other interested/affected parties as well as to deliver outcomes that were in the ‘public interest’. Indeed {{it is part of the}} project’s aims to determine how the notion of the ‘public interest’ was constructed/understood and operationalised by the various parties involved in the development process in each case study. Part of what we hope to do is to understand how contractual relationships, particularly between the public and private sectors, affected/influenced public accountability (in terms of transparency of decision-making) and the delivery of outcomes that were, at least in part, in the ‘public interest’. The risk we perceive is that contractual relationships are shrouded in ‘secrecy’ under the guise of commercial confidentiality that obscures the ‘public gaze’ and runs the risk of effectively undermining both accountability and the ‘public interest’. Thereby creating a form of ‘subterranean governance’ that structures the way in which these partnerships operate without being subject to any rigorous public scrutiny and accountability...|$|R
40|$|In 2015 I {{completed}} my PhD {{exploring the}} delivery of sustainable transport initiatives by local authorities. My research was designed to explore whether social practice theory, particularly Shove et al. ’s (2012) 3 -Elements model {{could be used to}} provide an alternative way of understanding how people travel and thereby developing transport initiatives that reduced harmful emissions. At the end of my second year {{it was clear that the}} system for delivering sustainable transport initiatives was an important part of the explanation of how and why we travel, yet this could not accurately be represented by the 3 -Elements model. The 3 -Elements model failed to deal the importance of funding and the power associated with it. I therefore decided to explore systems approaches that would be compatible with the 3 -Elements model and I found Fine’s (1993, 2002) Systems of Provision. Through the combination of the two models it was possible to incorporate the transfer of power and funding from the different levels of the transport planning system and demonstrate that Ministers’ and civil servants’ views of what a sustainable transport initiative should be ultimately influenced what was delivered by local authorities. I am now working on a research project called <b>PARCOUR,</b> which is designed to understand how the public interest is delivered through the redevelopment of brownfield sites. The research focuses on three UK case studies: Bristol Harbourside, Gloucester Quays and Firepool, Taunton. Delivery of urban regeneration forms a complex system of systems which involves agreements between both the public and private sector. This paper will provide a first attempt to apply the System of Provisions model developed in my PhD research to the complexity of urban regeneration in the UK. The initial findings have shown that {{the delivery of}} brownfield regeneration requires substantial government funding to deliver key infrastructure to allow development to occur. The Systems of Provision model offers a new means of understanding this in the context of the wider delivery system and how it ultimately leads to brownfield regeneration taking place.

40|$|In the UK {{public-private}} partnerships are currently the only method of developing previously used land. How these partnerships are formed {{and how they}} work can differ considerably however, depending on the approach taken by the partners. Through interviews with the key actors, including the developers, local authorities and interest groups, the paper explores three case studies of urban regeneration projects in the south-west of England: Harbourside Bristol; Gloucester Quays; and Firepool, Taunton. The paper is designed to identify the processes, procedures, contracts and relationships that exist and enabled the regeneration process to occur. At the time of selecting the case studies there were over 600 regeneration projects {{taking place in the}} UK. These were predominantly focused to the south and south west of the country. Many of the large-scale regeneration schemes such as London Docklands have been studied extensively and it was noted that there has been little research on the impact of development on small-medium towns and cities in the UK, and this is a knowledge gap that the paper has been designed to address. The background to each of the selected case study, shows why they are of interest. The first case study is Bristol Harbourside, a city centre location that had been awaiting redevelopment for a number of decades. The land owners and City Council created the Harbourside Sponsors’ Group in 1993 to identify the appropriate developers for the site and bring funding to the city. Developers Crest Nicholson were chosen to develop the area in 1997, and had to go through several planning applications and met with considerable public opposition before the final masterplan was approved in 2001 and was completed in 2015. The second case study is Gloucester Quays, a small to medium city location. Gloucestershire County Council, along with the now defunct Regional Authority founded a regeneration company in 2004 to bring investment to the city and this included the £ 200 m development of the Quays by Peel Holdings and British Waterways (the landowners). Firepool, Taunton is a property led development of the former livestock market and railway yards, close to the mainline railway station. The local authority set up the Taunton Vision in 2002 to develop the consultation process for the redevelopment of the town. In addition to the development the County Council were awarded funding for a new distributor road adjacent to the western section of the development to ease traffic movements within the city centre. The similarities and differences between the partnerships and how the developments proceeded was examined to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each approach, with an institutional map developed to provide a greater level of understanding and will help identify the best practices for future public-private partnership developments.
