40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South AfricaIn the forestry industry the requirement {{for the maintenance of}} a broad genetic base is integral to the success of breeding programmes such as those for Eucalyptus grandis, an important species to the South African forestry industry. Plant cryopreservation is an economical option to maintain such a genetic base, as it allows storage of vegetative materials at sub-zero temperatures, while maintaining juvenility. However, successful cryopreservation of this sub-tropical species has been restricted by its sensitivity to cryopreparative drying. As a consequence, the viability of material is reduced even before reaching the freezing stage. Despite this abiotic stress restriction, evidence of upstream ‘cross-talk’ implying downstream ‘cross-tolerance’ has suggested the possibility that cold acclimation may improve the tolerance responses towards dehydration stress by means of ‘cross-acclimation’. It was therefore the aim of the study to understand some of the physiological and biochemical responses of in vitro E. grandis shoots to different non-freezing low (chilling) temperatures and exposure periods, and to establish an appropriate ‘cross-acclimation’ regime for the <b>physical</b> <b>drying</b> pre-treatment. E. grandis shoot clusters (4 - 8 leaves and 2 - 5 axillary buds) were exposed to the chilling temperatures of 5 °C, 10 °C or 15 °C for 1 or 3 days. The physiological and biochemical responses were evaluated, and thereafter the appropriate cold acclimation (or ‘cross-acclimation’) regime selected. The appropriate <b>physical</b> <b>drying</b> time was also selected for shoot clusters according to their physiological responses. When the appropriate regimes had been determined, the physiological and biochemical responses of shoot clusters treated consecutively to cold acclimation and then <b>physical</b> <b>drying</b> were evaluated. The physiological responses evaluated were water content, viability, and vigour (i. e. the number of visible axillary buds and shoots produced over 2 weeks). The biochemical responses measured were the concentrations of: 1) total soluble sugars, 2) starch, 3) phenolic acid, and 4) superoxide. The data suggested that the appropriate cold acclimation regime was treatment at 10 °C for 3 days. This was based on the accumulation of the high levels of phenolic acid (3. 05 ± 0. 09 mg GAE. g- 1 FWS) and positive vigour responses (11. 90 ± 0. 60 visible axillary buds/week and 3. 10 ± 0. 20 visible shoots/week), compared with the other chilling temperature treatments. The appropriate drying time selected for shoot clusters was 80 min over activated silica gel to achieve a water content of 0. 32 ± 0. 04 g water. g- 1 FWS.

40|$|Melamine {{formaldehyde}} (MF) resins {{are widely}} used for the gluing and surface coating of wood-based consumer products in the interior design of living environments. MF resins are especially relevant in decorative laminate applications because of their good performance-to-price ratio. In their industrial processing, an important intermediate state is the liquid MF prepolymer that is used for decorative paper impregnation. Here, the drying of impregnated papers is investigated with respect to premature curing. A new method to quantify water release upon drying that allows estimation {{of the degree of}} undesired precuring is described. Since curing proceeds via polycondensation, crosslinking brings about the release of water molecules. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), drying was studied in terms of water release due to <b>physical</b> <b>drying</b> (elimination of “dilution water”) and chemical crosslinking of the prepolymer to a three-dimensional MF network (elimination of chemically liberated water). The results obtained by TGA/IR spectroscopic analysis of the liberated volatiles show that the emission of water from b-stage MF can be clearly analytically separated into a physical (evaporation of dilution water) and a chemical (liberation via condensation) sequence. TGA experiments were correlated with curing experiments performed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate the residual crosslinking capacities of the impregnated papers. The drying conditions used during the preparation of impregnated decorative papers seemed to significantly affect their remaining reactivity only when harsh drying conditions were used.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop hybrid {{copolymers}} through the copolymerisation of a novel low molecular weight oleic acid-based macromer with methyl methacrylate (MMA), with the aim of combining the good properties of alkyd and acrylic binders. Design/methodology/approach - The macromer was synthesised from phthalic anhydride, oleic acid and glycerol. It was copolymerised with MMA using a free radical initiator. The ratio of the macromer and MMA was varied and the glass transition temperature, molecular weight, thermal stability, and film properties of the copolymers were characterised. Findings - Under similar conditions of temperature and reaction time, the lower macromer to MMA ratio has led to faster polymerisation rate, higher molecular weight and higher T g of the copolymer. Generally, all the coatings showed excellent adhesion properties, while the coatings with the higher content of MMA exhibited better alkali and water resistance. Research limitations/implications - The macromer used in the present context was synthesised from oleic acid and glycerol supplied by a local palm oil oleochemicals manufacturer. Presumably the same raw materials from other vegetable oils could also be used. In addition, the macromer structure could be changed by varying the formulation so that it would have different molecular weight and functionality. Practical implications - The method has managed to combine the properties of alkyd and acrylic, resulting in coatings that exhibit good mechanical and chemical properties, fast <b>physical</b> <b>drying</b> as well as excellent adhesion. Originality/value - Oleic acid and glycerol are palm oil derivatives which are from natural resources and are sustainable raw materials. Although the macromer by itself cannot air-dry due low iodine value, this could be overcome through copolymerisation with methyl methacrylate to find numerous applications in surface coating...|$|E

Simulations show that for permittivity-based sensing, the optimum thickness of the sensing film is slightly more than half the wavelength of the IDEs structure. On the other hand, sensing films that are thinner than half wavelength should be used if the required sensing mechanism is based on structural swelling.

In this work <b>physical</b> (<b>dry</b> mass content, hardness, bulk density, and colour), sensory (appearance, colour, odour, taste, texture) and nutritional (antioxidant activity and total phenolics) properties of dried apple snack were investigated as a function of pre-drying, microwave energy input, and batch weight.

According to the results, the physical properties of products produced by microwave vacuum drying combined with hot-air pre-drying (CMVD) mainly depend on the specific energy input. Higher specific energy input results higher dry mass content, which is associated with harder consistency, lower bulk density, and positive consumer perception as well. Bulk density had an optimum point of batch weight at 336 g. Higher value of pre-dried dry mass content resulted lighter colour but less antioxidant activity and less total phenolics, therefore shorter hot-air drying and prolonged microwave vacuum drying is recommended...|$|R

To demonstrate gas cluster cleaning performance, particle removal efficiency (PRE) and gate structure pattern damages were evaluated.

The cleaning force of the CO 2 gas cluster {{is related to the}} flow rate of the CO 2 gas. The optimum CO 2 gas flow rate for the particle removal without pattern damage was found to be 6 L/min (LPM).

This study is part of an experimental and computational analysis of dry cask storage of waste nuclear fuel rods. This study will present simplifications and their justification for the electric cartridge heaters being used to simulate the waste nuclear fuel in the dry cask analysis. Specific Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the simplifications that can be made to the CFD simulation to reduce the computational load while maintaining the integrity and relevance of the simulation to the physical experiment. The heating elements of the cartridge heaters in question are comprised of tightly wound helical coils which are computationally expensive to model in CFD simulation. The desired outcome of the study is to determine if the cartridge heaters can be replaced by a specified heat flux boundary condition in the full CFD models of the dry cask storage system. Method: The approach of this study will be to make a series of simplifications to the full model of the cartridge heaters and compare the outer surface temperature and heat flux profiles from each simplification step to determine the validity of the simplifications. Results: Preliminary CFD simulations of both fully detailed and simplified cartridge heater models indicate that the geometric simplifications to the cartridge heater models have a minimal effect on the outer surface temperature and heat flux profiles thereby justifying the elimination of the cartridge heaters from the CFD model of the dry cask storage system.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} three {{current issues}} in maritime economics by {{the application of}} semi-parametric estimations within a generalized additive model framework. First, this thesis shows that there are vessel and contract specific differences in time charter rates for dry bulk vessels. The literature on microeconomic factors of time charter rates could show {{the emergence of a}} two-tier tanker market during the post-OPA 90 period. However, previous results do not allow for any safe conclusions about the existence of a two-tier dry bulk market. This thesis extends the results of previous research by showing that {{a good part of the}} variation in physical time charter rates is due to microeconomic factors. It empirically proves the existence of a two-tier dry-bulk market. Controlling for a variety of contract specific effects as well as vessel specific factors the presented model quantifies quality induced differences in <b>physical</b> <b>dry</b> bulk charter rates. Second, the literature on the formation of ship prices focuses exclusively on rather homogeneous shipping segments, such as tankers and dry bulk carriers. Due to the comparatively low number of sales and the complexity of the ships, vessel valuation in highly specialised and small sectors, such as chemical tankers, is a much more challenging task. The empirical results of this thesis confirm the findings in recent literature that ship valuation is a non-linear function of size, age and market conditions, whilst other parameters that are particular to the chemicals market also play a significant role. The third topic addresses the recent increase in operational expenses of merchant vessels (opex). The available literature cannot explain the development nor provides information on vessel individual level. This thesis considers a quantitative model of opex that is particularly successful in explaining the variation in opex across vessels of different type, size, age and specification. The results confirm that differences in opex are due to the behaviour of a vessel's operator and to regulatory requirements. Furthermore, it shows that there are significant differences in opex due to earnings and employment status of a vessel. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Because in-situ cleaning {{becomes more and}} more important for nanotechnology the paper concentrates on <b>physical</b> and <b>dry</b> chemical techniques. As standard ex-situ wet chemical cleaning has a significant impact on surface quality und thus device properties, its influence on further processes is also considered. Oxygen and carbon are unavoidable contaminations after wet chemical treatment and therefore we discuss their in-situ removal as one of the main goals of modern silicon substrate cleaning. As surface roughness strongly influences the electrical quality of interfaces for epitaxy and dielectric growth, we concentrate on techniques, which meet this requirement. It will be shown that multi-step thermal sequences in combination with simultaneous passivation of the clean surface are necessary in order to avoid recontamination.
