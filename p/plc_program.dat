40|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacle}} that prevents model checking from being widely used in industrial control systems is the complexity of building formal models out of <b>PLC</b> <b>programs,</b> especially when timing aspects need to be integrated. This paper brings an answer to this obstacle by proposing a methodology to model and verify timing aspects of <b>PLC</b> <b>programs.</b> Two approaches are proposed to allow the users to balance the trade-off between {{the complexity of the}} model, i. e. its number of states, and the set of specifications possible to be verified. A tool supporting the methodology which allows to produce models for different model checkers directly from <b>PLC</b> <b>programs</b> has been developed.

5000|$|In ladder diagram, {{the contact}} symbols {{represent}} {{the state of}} bits in processor memory, which corresponds {{to the state of}} physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a [...] "normally open" [...] contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic [...] "true" [...] signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the <b>PLC</b> <b>program</b> that [...] "read" [...] or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be [...] "opposite" [...] or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>PLC</b> <b>program</b> {{generally}} loops i.e. executes repeatedly, {{as long as}} {{the controlled}} system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the [...] "I/O Image Table", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs. Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.|$|E

Generally the software provides functions for debugging and troubleshooting the PLC software, for example, by highlighting portions of the logic to show current status during operation or via simulation.

AVROC, similar in nature to the Marine Corps' Platoon Leaders Class (<b>PLC)</b> <b>program,</b> split the AOCS curriculum in half, with college and university juniors attending the first half during the summer between their junior and senior years, then returning the following summer after college graduation to complete {{the second half of the}} program and receive their commissions. During the summer months, AVROC classes would typically enter every other week, with their graduations on alternating weeks from AOCS graduations. For AVROCs, the advantage of their program was that their Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD) was adjusted to the day they signed up for the AVROC program, typically two to three years before their commissioning. As a result, when they were finally commissioned, they received a higher base pay rate reflecting two to three years of service (i.e., O-1 over 2 years or O-1 over 3 years) versus their traditional non-prior service AOCS counterparts (i.e., O-1 less than 2 years).

40|$|Abstract – Formal {{verification}} of <b>PLC</b> <b>programs</b> using model-checking requires to elaborate previously temporal logic formulae that {{state in a}} formal way the properties that must be checked. Unfortunately temporal logic is a formalism totally unknown by automation engineers.

Fault-tree analysis is a quite popular analysis method often used in industry when designing critical systems.

40|$|Traditional {{control system}} design can’t fulfill the needs in mass {{customization}} manufacturing (MCM). Under MCM, {{programmable logic controller}} (PLC) should be reconfigurable to execute multiple material routings, to deliver parts/tools to different workstations. However, traditional <b>PLC</b> <b>program</b> design only support one control operation, which is inflexible to be reconfigured frequently at system run time. Regenerating PLC code for every change in control operation will result in significant efficiency lost. In this thesis, the reconfigurable control system design is presented. Reconfigurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs, based on PLC Statechart and design methodology in (Schreyer M. H., 200 l), are developed for the controls in mass customization manufacturing. All feasible operations that PLC should execute are identified and programmed in PLC. The PLC response can be altered online, by triggering the control logic for the pending operation. <b>PLC</b> <b>program</b> reconfiguration can be achieved without code download and system shut down, thus enhancing the control system efficiency.
