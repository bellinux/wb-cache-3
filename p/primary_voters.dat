5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar <b>primary</b> <b>voters</b> were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar <b>primary</b> <b>voters</b> were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|Aide Greg Schneiders {{suggested}} an unusual strategy, inspired by Glenn's personal campaign and voting style, of avoiding appealing to {{special interest groups}} and instead seeking support from ordinary Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>voters.</b> After Mondale defeated him for the nomination, Glenn carried $3million in campaign debt for over 20years before receiving a reprieve from the Federal Election Commission. He was considered as a vice-presidential candidate in 1984, 1988, and 1992.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, {{the last}} day for {{candidates}} to file, Bevin announced he would seek the Republican nomination for governor. During his announcement, he introduced his running mate, Jenean Hampton, a Tea Party activist who lost her bid to unseat State Representative Jody Richards the previous year. Bevin joined a field that included Commissioner of Agriculture James Comer, former Louisville Councilman Hal Heiner, and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott. The National Journal predicted that Bevin would draw support away from Comer, the early front-runner, who had been appealing to Tea Party groups and already secured Congressman Massie's endorsement. The crowded primary was also projected to damage the Republican nominee's chances in the general election, since Attorney General Jack Conway was the only major Democratic candidate, allowing him to conserve resources for the general election. McConnell allies also predicted that Bevin's refusal to endorse McConnell would hurt him with <b>primary</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

5|$|Republican {{president}} Dwight D. Eisenhower convinced John Sherman Cooper, {{a former}} senator and ambassador who was immensely popular in Kentucky, to challenge Wetherby, hoping his {{presence on the}} ticket would aid his own re-election bid. In the Republican <b>primary,</b> <b>voters</b> chose Thruston B. Morton to challenge Clements. With two of his factional enemies as candidates for the Senate, Governor Chandler bolted the party and supported the Republican candidates. Further complicating Clements' campaign {{was the fact that}} Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956, and as majority whip, Clements had to spend much of his time in Washington, D.C. covering Johnson's duties in the Senate. What time he was in Kentucky was usually devoted to Wetherby's campaign, since the Democrats believed Clements would be re-elected easily while Wetherby faced much stiffer odds. These factors, combined with the landslide of support for Eisenhower, the Republican presidential candidate, contributed to the defeat of both Wetherby and Clements. Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes, while Clements lost to Morton by a margin of 7,000 votes out of more than 1 million that were cast in the election. It was Clements' first defeat for elected office in a career that spanned thirty years.|$|E

25|$|Former Texas Secretary of State Jack Rains {{contacted}} the Chronicle's James Howard Gibbons, {{alleging that the}} poll appeared to incorrectly count non-Republican <b>Primary</b> <b>voters</b> in its sample.

25|$|Although Corzine was unpopular among {{independents and}} Republicans, he polled much more highly among {{registered}} Democrats. His three opponents were former Glen Ridge mayor Carl Bergmanson, who ran {{on a platform}} of fiscal discipline, governmental reform, and removing the tolls on the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway; perennial candidate Jeff Boss; and businessman and former Congressional candidate Roger Bacon. A Quinnipiac poll conducted shortly before the primary and released on May 20, 2009, indicated that 65% of Democratic <b>primary</b> <b>voters</b> would vote for Corzine, with the other three candidates each receiving 4%–5%.

500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. Rick Lazio, a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican <b>primary</b> <b>voters.</b> [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think he needs to get into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{his more}} stridently [...] "non-interventionist" [...] father, Paul concedes {{a role for}} American armed forces abroad, {{including}} permanent foreign military bases. He {{has said that he}} blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War [...] "emboldened" [...] Iran. Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP <b>primary</b> <b>voters</b> as support for his position. Paul stated: [...] "I personally believe that this group [...] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [...]" [...] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016. In 2011, shortly after being elected, he proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 2008, the five-term Republican Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter made clear {{his plans to}} seek re-election. Specter had {{narrowly}} avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger Pat Toomey during his 2004 Senate race, and {{he was expected to}} face an even greater challenge from Toomey in 2010, particularly since the conservative faction of the Pennsylvania Republican Party had vowed to defeat Specter in the upcoming primary. Some high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Rendell, began encouraging Specter to join the Democratic Party by publicly offering to help Specter raise money if he switched. A March 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll found Specter trailing Toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among Republican <b>primary</b> <b>voters,</b> in large part due to voter angst over Specter's support for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was supported by President Obama. Since the Pennsylvania primaries are closed, the poll noted that Specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or Democrats. Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of the poll results, [...] "Pennsylvania Republicans are so unhappy with Sen. Specter’s vote for President Barack Obama's Stimulus Package and so-called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former Congressman they hardly know." ...|$|E
