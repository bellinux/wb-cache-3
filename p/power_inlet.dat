3000|$|Low-bypass {{system is}} more fuel {{efficient}} and is much quieter. Low bypass ratios do not {{tend to be}} favored for civilian aircraft because of the compromise between improved fuel economy and {{the requirements of the}} performance of the aircraft in terms of flight paths and its stability. The behavior of thrust is common and does not present any sharp nor sudden fluctuations. Constraints on engine parameters can easily impact on the engine pressure and its temperature, and could be critical at some operating points. This is why fuel consumption has a significant role and is associated with engine performance. This association has the advantage of giving lower thrust values for extending engine life and reducing loads. Engine performance of modern engines depends on requirements of accessories, engine size, inlet and duct design, air conditioning system compressor, hydraulic pumps power, alternators <b>power,</b> <b>inlet</b> and exhaust duct losses, [...]... Because of the technological development of these engines, thrust is reduced; but fuel consumption can increase. Optimization of the flight path associated with new technological developments contribute significantly to the reduction of fuel consumption. Environmental impact and fuel consumption are reduced by the use of optimization process for departures and arrivals. Operation management could be also improved by using optimized flight path. In addition, these flight path parameters can be integrated in the flight management system of the aircraft, and used in the autopilot system. This is a promising objective of this research. This bypass ratio study could contribute to provide numerical results and data for the future generation engines which will have a higher bypass ratio. In association with passive control noise systems, the primary advantage of this contribution should be engine efficiency analysis and weight savings. The second advantage, linked to the first, is the drag reduction. The third advantage, related to the increase of the bypass ratio, helps airline manufacturers to suggest the best arrangement of nacelle components to facilitate convenient removal and replacement of engines without subjecting nacelle to high stresses. To conclude, optimization of flight path induces fuel consumption savings, noise reduction and improvement of the engines-BPR knowledge.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} a defendable and {{systematic}} uncertainty and sensitivity approach that conforms to the Code Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty (CSAU) process, {{and that could be}} used for a wide variety of software codes, was defined in 2008. The GRS (Gesellschaft für Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit) company of Germany has developed one type of CSAU approach that is particularly well suited for legacy coupled core analysis codes, and a trial version of their commercial software product SUSA (Software for Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses) was acquired on May 12, 2010. This report summarized the results of the initial investigations performed with SUSA, utilizing a typical High Temperature Reactor benchmark (the IAEA CRP- 5 PBMR 400 MW Exercise 2) and the PEBBED-THERMIX suite of codes. The following steps were performed as part of the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis: 1. Eight PEBBED-THERMIX model input parameters were selected for inclusion in the uncertainty study: the total reactor <b>power,</b> <b>inlet</b> gas temperature, decay heat, and the specific heat capability and thermal conductivity of the fuel, pebble bed and reflector graphite. 2. The input parameters variations and probability density functions were specified, and a total of 800 PEBBED-THERMIX model calculations were performed, divided into 4 sets of 100 and 2 sets of 200 Steady State and Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC) transient calculations each. 3. The steady state and DLOFC maximum fuel temperature, as well as the daily pebble fuel load rate data, were supplied to SUSA as model output parameters of interest. The 6 data sets were statistically analyzed to determine the 5 % and 95 % percentile values for each of the 3 output parameters with a 95 % confidence level, and typical statistical indictors were also generated (e. g. Kendall, Pearson and Spearman coefficients). 4. A SUSA sensitivity study was performed to obtain correlation data between the input and output parameters, and to identify the primary contributors to the output data uncertainties. It was found that the uncertainties in the decay heat, pebble bed and reflector thermal conductivities were responsible for the bulk of the propagated uncertainty in the DLOFC maximum fuel temperature. It was also determined that the two standard deviation (2 s) uncertainty on the maximum fuel temperature was between ± 58 oC (3. 6 %) and ± 76 oC (4. 7 %) on a mean value of 1604 oC. These values mostly depended on the selection of the distributions types, and not on the number of model calculations above the required Wilks criteria (a (95 %, 95 %) statement would usually require 93 model runs) ...|$|E

One dimensional homogeneous equilibrium {{model has been}} used to simulate the two-phase flow. The nonlinear mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are solved along the characteristic directions by using implicit finite difference scheme. The virtue of this scheme is that it handles the boundary conditions naturally. This scheme is fast because the time steps can be greater than that given by Courant-Friedrichs-Levvy condition. The numerical scheme is sufficiently general and can handle axially varying heat flux and different combinations of inlet and exit boundary conditions of enthalpy, mass flux and pressure and multiple channels. No assumptions regarding constant properties and incompressibility have been taken.
