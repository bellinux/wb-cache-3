5|$|The {{design for}} the album's artwork was by Hipgnosis, the company {{responsible}} for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars (1975) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation (1978). The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room, looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open hatchway in the floor; the <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by photographer John Shaw at his London studio. Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover, credited to Linda and Paul McCartney.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken.</b> Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E

25|$|The George Washington Air Junction {{airport was}} {{introduced}} with much fanfare by Woodhouse, the main {{owner of the}} airport. In May 1929 for a publicity stunt there was a gathering of George Washington's descendants at the christening ceremonies of {{the opening of the}} airport. A <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> of them, that was promoted through various newspapers nationwide, next to a replica of the first passenger balloon that flew in the Western Hemisphere that was watched by Washington himself.

25|$|Rakes was {{swinging}} {{the flag and}} trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident. An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing his glasses and suffering a broken nose, {{by the time he}} got up the famous <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken.</b>|$|E

25|$|When this <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken,</b> {{almost every}} {{building}} immediately around St Paul's had burned down, with the cathedral surviving in a wasteland of destruction. Its survival was mainly {{due to the}} efforts of a special group of firewatchers who were urged by prime minister Winston Churchill to protect the cathedral. Twenty-nine incendiaries fell on and around the cathedral, with one burning through the lead dome and threatening to fall into the dome's wooden support beams. Members of the volunteer St Paul's Watch would have had to climb through the rafters to have any chance of putting it out, but the bomb fell outwards from the roof onto the Stone Gallery, where it was quickly extinguished.|$|E

It was released through Doubleday in the United States. 400,000 hardcover copies were printed for the launch for the UK and US markets. The jacket artwork featured the model Tuuli Shipster, muse of the British photographer, Rankin. Shipster said: [...] "I was thrilled that Penguin chose me to be their Bond girl. It’s fantastic to be involved with something so iconic." [...] The cover <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by British photographer and commercials director, Kevin Summers.

500|$|After {{at first}} {{having failed to}} see {{the appeal of the}} image, Tittle {{eventually}} grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography.

[...] Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken,</b> ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool.

500|$|The album's title {{came from}} a spoonerism by Jackson, who once said, [...] "I'll {{go down to the}} studio and dub on some more porn harts", meaning [...] "horn parts". The cover was {{designed}} by regular Charisma album artist Paul Whitehead, who was told by Hammill, [...] "no matter if you're a king, a pauper or whatever – you're a pawn" [...] which led to a design containing the earth and a curtain. The inner gatefold <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by Keith Morris and featured the band playing Crowborough Tennis while appearing to give Nazi salutes to each other, though Banton later said this was simply the band attempting to look ridiculous in the vein of Monty Python.|$|E
500|$|A {{parody of}} da Vinci's The Last Supper, the <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by Hollywood glamour {{photographer}} Ken Marcus. Clayson has speculated on the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, {{set back from}} {{and to the left}} of the dining table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Allison finds evidence of Harrison's antipathy towards organised religion in this inner-gatefold photo, following on from the lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". In order to add to Harrison's [...] "mystique", author Bruce Spizer writes, Wilkes placed a colour image of him over the main, black-and-white print. The same detail echoed the contrast in [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] between the illusory nature of human existence and what Allison describes as the [...] "vital, eternal reality" [...] offered by spiritual enlightenment.|$|E
500|$|The {{photos on}} the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison's then wife Janet Planet, {{in the town of}} Fairfax. The {{original}} LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. [...] This rural setting depicting a bygone era was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split. A lot of people seem to think that album covers are your life or something." ...|$|E
