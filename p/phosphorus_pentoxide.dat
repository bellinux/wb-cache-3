5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide.</b> It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{more active}} benzoic {{anhydride}} is formed by dehydration using acetic anhydride or <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} its {{resistance}} to oxidation, arsenic trioxide differs from phosphorus trioxide, which readily combusts to <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (P4O10) is {{the acid}} {{anhydride}} of phosphoric acid, but several intermediates {{between the two}} are known. This waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water.|$|E
25|$|Phosphate {{glasses with}} low melting {{temperature}} were developed. One of such compositions is <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> lead(II) oxide, and zinc oxide, with addition of lithium {{and some other}} oxides.|$|E
25|$|In the Bischler–Napieralski {{reaction}} an β-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a Lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide.</b> The resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline {{can then}} be dehydrogenated using palladium. The following Bischler–Napieralski reaction produces papaverine.|$|E
25|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, many metallic oxide form alkaline solutions, while many oxides of nonmetals form acidic solutions. For example, sodium oxide in solution forms the strong base sodium hydroxide, while <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> in solution forms phosphoric acid.|$|E
25|$|The Feist–Benary {{synthesis}} is {{a classic}} way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed. One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of 1,4-diketones with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (P2O5) in the Paal–Knorr synthesis. The thiophene formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with Lawesson's reagent also forms furans as side products. Many routes exist for the synthesis of substituted furans.|$|E
25|$|Elemental {{phosphorus}} {{is produced}} by an electric furnace. At a high temperature, a mixture of phosphate ore, silica and carbonaceous material (coke, coal etc.) produces calcium silicate, phosphorus gas and carbon monoxide. The P and CO off-gases from this reaction are cooled under water to isolate solid phosphorus. Alternatively, the P and CO off-gases can be burned with air to produce <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Very pure {{phosphoric acid}} is {{obtained}} by burning elemental phosphorus to produce <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> which is subsequently dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid. This route produces a very pure phosphoric acid, since most impurities {{present in the}} rock have been removed when extracting phosphorus from the rock in a furnace. The end result is food-grade, thermal phosphoric acid; however, for critical applications, additional processing to remove arsenic compounds may be needed.|$|E
25|$|This reaction, {{which is}} {{conducted}} on large scale industrially, requires {{the removal of}} the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. Diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> respectively. Diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis. Ethyl nitrite, prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a diuretic.|$|E
25|$|Upon heating orthophosphoric acid, {{condensation}} of the phosphoric units can {{be induced}} by driving {{off the water}} formed from condensation. When one molecule of water has been removed for each two molecules of phosphoric acid, the result is pyrophosphoric acid (H4P2O7). When an average of one molecule of water per phosphoric unit has been driven off, the resulting substance is a glassy solid having an empirical formula of HPO3 and is called metaphosphoric acid. Metaphosphoric acid is a singly anhydrous version of orthophosphoic acid and is sometimes used as a water- or moisture-absorbing reagent. Further dehydrating is very difficult and can be accomplished only {{by means of an}} extremely strong desiccant (and not by heating alone). It produces phosphoric anhydride (<b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide),</b> which has an empirical formula P2O5, although an actual molecule has a chemical formula of P4O10. Phosphoric anhydride is a solid, which is very strongly moisture-absorbing and is used as a desiccant.|$|E
25|$|Grazers {{as well as}} browsers, the chital mainly feed on grasses {{throughout}} the year. They prefer young shoots, {{in the absence of}} whose tall and coarse grasses will be nibbled off at the tips. Browse forms a major portion of the diet only in the winter months-October to January-when the grasses, tall or dried up, are no more palatable. Browse includes herbs, shrubs, foliage, fruits and forbs; Moghania species are often preferred while browsing. Fruits eaten by chital in the Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) include those of Ficus species from January to May, Cordia myxa from May to June, Syzygium cumini from June to July. Individuals tend to group together and forage while moving slowly. Chital are generally silent when grazing together. Males often stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches. Water holes are visited nearly twice daily, with great caution. In the Kanha National Park, mineral licks rich in calcium and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> were scraped at by the incisors. Chital in the Sunderbans may be omnivores; remains of red crabs have been found in the rumen of individuals.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the RAF how their white phosphorus {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers– this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.|$|E

500|$|The {{thermally}} {{unstable and}} very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is the anhydride of nitric acid, {{and can be}} made from it by dehydration with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide.</b> It is of interest for the preparation of explosives. It is a deliquescent, colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light. In the solid state it is ionic with structure +−; as a gas and in solution it is molecular O2N–O–NO2. Hydration to nitric acid comes readily, as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid (HOONO2). It is a violent oxidising agent. Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The chemists {{had to find}} a way of {{producing}} quantities of uranium tetrachloride (...) from uranium oxide. (Nier had used uranium bromide.) Initially, they produced it by using hydrogen to reduce uranium trioxide (...) to uranium dioxide (...) , which was then reacted with carbon tetrachloride (...) to produce uranium tetrachloride. Charles A. Kraus proposed a better method for large-scale production that involved reacting the uranium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at high temperature and pressure. This produced uranium pentachloride (...) and phosgene (...) [...] While nowhere near as nasty as the uranium hexafluoride used by the gaseous diffusion process, uranium tetrachloride is hygroscopic, so work with it had to be undertaken in gloveboxes that were kept dry with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (...) [...] The presence of phosgene, a lethal gas, required that the chemists wore gas masks when handling it.|$|E
500|$|Nitric acid (HNO3) {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids. It is one of the three most used acids (the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid) and was first discovered by the alchemists in the 13th century. It is made by catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide, which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide, and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid. In the United States of America, over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year, most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives, among other uses. Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark. It can only be made in the solid state, because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide, and liquid nitric acid undergoes self-ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Phosphate glass {{constitutes}} {{a class of}} optical glasses composed of metaphosphates of various metals. Instead of the SiO4 [...] tetrahedra observed in silicate glasses, the building block for this glass former is <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (P2O5), which crystallizes in at least four different forms. The most familiar polymorph (see figure) comprises molecules of P4O10.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{molecules}} adopt adamantane-like cage structures. Those include phosphorus trioxide P4O6, {{arsenic trioxide}} As4O6, <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide</b> P4O10 = (PO)4O6, phosphorus pentasulfide P4S10 = (PS)4S6, and hexamethylenetetramine C6N4H12 = N4(CH2)6. Particularly notorious is tetramethylenedisulfotetramine, often shortened to [...] "tetramine", a rodenticide banned {{in most countries}} for extreme toxicity to humans. The silicon analogue of adamantane, sila-adamantane, was synthesized in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{conditions}} {{can be used}} to carry out these reactions, most of which are mild. [...] The Paal–Knorr Furan synthesis is normally carried out under aqueous acidic conditions with protic acids such as aqueous sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or anhydrous conditions with a Lewis acid or dehydrating agent. [...] Common dehydrating agents include <b>phosphorus</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> anhydrides, or zinc chloride. [...] The pyrrole synthesis requires a primary amine under similar conditions, or ammonia (or ammonia precursors) can be used. [...] Synthesis of a thiophene requires a sulfurizing agent which is typically a sufficient dehydrator, such as phosphorus pentasulfide, Lawesson's reagent, or hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
