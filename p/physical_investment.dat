40|$|This thesis conducts {{empirical}} {{analysis on}} the determinants of migration and remittance sending decisions in Kenya and {{the impact on the}} expenditure patterns of households using cross-sectional household survey data. The first empirical chapter explores the factors that influence the subsequent migration decisions of Kenyan siblings using binary logit models. The findings reveal that preceding sibling migrants have a strong negative effect on the probability of migration for other siblings. Evidence in support of migration as a joint household level decision is obtained as preceding sibling and non-sibling migrants are found to exhibit similar effects. Conditional on migrating, siblings are shown to utilize existing sibling networks by moving to the same internal or external destination as preceding migrants. Discrete failure time models are also employed so as to account for any neglected heterogeneity at the household level. Controlling for neglected heterogeneity, the overall effect of preceding sibling migrants is found to be statistically insignificant. However, non-sibling migrants are found to decrease the probability of migrating. The second empirical chapter examines the remittance behaviour of multiple compared to sole sibling migrants, and the motivations of Kenyan siblings in sending remittances to their household of origin. No evidence of selection bias in the decision to remit is detected when a Heckman selection model is estimated. Using probit and OLS models, the presence of other siblings is found to decrease the probability of remitting but to have no effect on the amount of remittances sent. The amount of remittances sent by other siblings is also found to have no statistically significant effect on the remittances sent by a sibling using IV regression methods. In the third empirical chapter, the expenditure patterns of Kenyan households are investigated according to whether the household is a migrant or non-migrant household, and whether a migrant household is in receipt of remittances or not using an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) approach. The analysis reveals that remitters who are spouses and siblings of the household have higher bargaining power towards the allocation of remittances to <b>physical</b> <b>investments</b> and durable goods, respectively. The expenditure patterns also show that remittances are not pooled together with general income when allocating the household budget towards durable goods and <b>physical</b> <b>investments.</b> In addition, the findings reveal that the reported uses of remittances by Kenyan households contrast with their actual uses. In the fourth chapter, the uses of remittances for the acquisition of <b>physical</b> <b>investments</b> and durable goods are analysed in more detail using IV and bivariate probit models. Remittances are found to be exogenous for the durable goods category but endogenous for <b>physical</b> <b>investments.</b> The evidence obtained is supportive of remittances being used by households to purchase these categories of commodities...|$|R
50|$|The savings {{identity}} or the savings-investment identity {{is a concept}} in national income accounting stating that the amount saved in an economy will be the amount invested in new physical machinery, new inventories, and alike.

50|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in its classic form {{is defined as}} a company from one country making a <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> into building a factory in another country. It is the establishment of an enterprise by a foreigner. Its definition can be extended to include investments made to acquire lasting interest in enterprises operating outside of the economy of the investor. The FDI relationship consists of a parent enterprise and a foreign affiliate which together form a multinational corporation (MNC). In order to qualify as FDI the investment must afford the parent enterprise control over its foreign affiliate. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines control in this case as owning 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated firm or its equivalent for an unincorporated firm; lower ownership shares are known as portfolio investment.|$|E

50|$|The {{link between}} the real economy and {{financial}} markets stems from firms’ need for external finance to engage in <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities. Firms’ ability to borrow depends essentially on {{the market value of}} their net worth. The reason for this is asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers. Lenders are likely to have little information about the reliability of any given borrower. As such, they usually require borrowers to set forth their ability to repay, often in the form of collateralized assets. It follows that a fall in asset prices deteriorates the balance sheets of the firms and their net worth. The resulting deterioration of their ability to borrow has a negative impact on their investment. Decreased economic activity further cuts the asset prices down, which leads to a feedback cycle of falling asset prices, deteriorating balance sheets, tightening financing conditions and declining economic activity. This vicious cycle is called a financial accelerator. It is a financial feedback loop or a loan/credit cycle, which, starting from a small change in financial markets, is, in principle, able to produce a large change in economic conditions.|$|E

I propose a model in which R&D investment drives an embodiedtechnological change to physical capital production. Therefore R&D investment reduces marginal cost of <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> hence future <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return is increasing in R&D investment. Physical capital production is diminishingmarginal-returns in <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> so future <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return is decreasing in <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> In the model stock return is a weighted average of <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return and R&D investment return.

It is demonstrated that their results do not hold, after extending the sample that matches their criteria by including more time periods and/or more firms. Namely, {{it is found that}} the Granger causality between R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> occurs both ways. It is also shown that their contemporary relationship, derived by dynamic simultaneous expressions, is positive in both ways, from current R&D to current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and from current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> to current R&D. Moreover, previous R&D affects current <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> and previous <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> also affects current R&D. ...|$|E

Economies with high initial ratios of human to physical capital are, however, predicted to grow quickly in the short run.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the hypothesis by Hall (1992) who claims that firms prefer to use debt to finance <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> but not R&D, due to the risky nature of R&D. Employing a dynamic simultaneous approach and R&D Master File, the relationship between debt, R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> is reestimated with the full sample and two sub-samples, including firms in all industries, in science-based industries, and in nonscience-based industries, respectively. First, {{the results show that}} the contemporary relationship between R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> is positively reciprocal, particularly in science-based industries. That is, current R&D positively affects and is positively affected by current <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> Second, it is shown that, in (non-) science-based industries, current R&D (raises) lowers current debt and current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> raises current debt; and that current debt raises current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and (raises) reduces R&D. In other words, the evidence supports that debt is a resource to finance both <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and R&D in nonscience-based industries, but debt is only a resource to finance <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> but not R&D in science-based industries. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a multivariate}} autoregressive framework, {{we have found}} a simple causal {{structure}} for the variables of interest q, s, r, and i, {{which is consistent with}} our data. As expected from the stock market efficiency hypothesis, q, the stock market one period holding rate of return, is exogenous relative to the other three variables (or Granger causes them). As postulated in the traditional accelerator model of investment, the rate of growth of sales, s, can be also treated as exogenous to the rates of growth of R&D and <b>physical.</b> <b>investment,</b> r and i. Moreover, no strong feed- back interaction is detected between the last two (r and i). Within the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the substantive conclusion is that R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> react very similarly to the growth of the sales and to movements in q; the response of R&D is, however, more stable or less irregular than that of <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> Expected demand and expected profitability thus both appear to be important determinants for R&D expenditures and <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} production-based asset pricing model (PCAPM) using industry-level data. Specifically, I examine the pricing {{relationship}} between <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns and equity returns by testing the hypothesis (spanning assumption) that the payoff space of <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> spans the payoff space of financial securities. Instead of following {{the traditional approach}} of testing a linear <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> factor pricing model, I propose a new testing procedure based on entropic principles and no-arbitrage constraints. The proposed nonparametric method recovers and compares the state price densities for <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns and equity returns. The new testing procedure has two main advantages over the traditional approach. First, the new method is consistent with no-arbitrage conditions while the traditional approach leads to a stochastic discount factor that may take negative values. Second, the new method alleviates the joint hypothesis test problem suffered by the traditional approach. I apply the proposed procedure to the following six industries: mining, construction, manufacturing, transportation, communication, and public utilities. The empirical {{results show that the}} state price density recovered from <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns is able to correctly price the corresponding equity returns. This provides supporting evidence that the spanning assumption holds at the cross-industry level. Furthermore, this study highlights the fact that physical capital investment conveys important information for pricing financial securities. Hence, to explain both the time series and the cross-sectional variations in equity returns, it is useful to develop models that explicitly address the impact of key production characteristics on financial asset pricing...|$|E
