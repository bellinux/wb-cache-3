5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> woman {{in front of}} a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in her head. In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E
5|$|Before {{accretion}} {{of material}} <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> white dwarf {{close to the}} Chandrasekhar limit, accreted hydrogen-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by hydrogen fusion. These surface explosions can be repeated {{as long as the}} white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) nova. Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic variables. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known, including polars and intermediate polars, both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs. Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> grapefruit against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He {{became one of}} Hollywood's biggest stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for Angels with Dirty Faces, for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan. In 1942, Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend time on his farm with his family. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.|$|E

5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest {{a man who}} had daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood <b>pushed</b> <b>a</b> man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood <b>push</b> <b>a</b> third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|R
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

50|$|In QBillion {{you control}} a mouse that, {{for reasons that}} are left unclear, has to reduce stacks of blocks to units one block high. This is {{represented}} by a grid in which several squares have numbers, representing how many blocks are there. The player can move a single block around, or <b>push</b> <b>a</b> block down off a stack. However, to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> block the player must be standing on a block one level lower than the block - i.e. to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> block off the top of a three-block stack, the player must be standing on a two-block stack.|$|R
25|$|The JetStick, {{designed}} by Control Engineering, Inc., {{was first used}} in 1998. The computer-integrated design allows the skipper to control and dock the boat {{through the use of}} a joystick. To use the JetStick the driver <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> button to engage docking mode, this in turn disengages the wheel while a computer determines the amount of bow thruster and jet needed to move the boat sideways.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} {{positive feedback}} <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> coastal system away from equilibrium by modifying its morphology until a threshold is reached, whereby {{a different type}} of response occurs. For example; if a storm event was to breach the foredune of a beach that is not in equilibrium, a vulnerable area would be created, which in turn would become susceptible to the formation of a blowout due to wind exploiting the absence of vegetation.|$|E

25|$|The most glamorous Billings Girl, Kiran is a {{model with}} brownish-gold eyes, brown hair, and tan skin. She has {{extremely}} good sense in fashion, and is capable of turning people into superstar lookalikes. She is also known to be shallow and 'bratty' to others. Beneath the surface, Kiran is troubled by alcoholism, {{which can lead to}} repercussions for herself and the others. She becomes a secondary character following the completion of the series' first arc. She makes an appearance in the Privilege series, during which Ariana <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> drunken Kiran off a bridge.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the ruling, Diane Duke, CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, stated,While this {{intermediate}} decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn’t {{mean they}} should be. We {{have spent the}} last two years fighting for the rights of adult performers {{to make their own decisions}} about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.|$|E
25|$|The cells {{which are}} {{actively}} undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is {{made use of}} in cancer treatment; by {{a process known as}} debulking, a significant mass of the tumor is removed which <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to G1 phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.|$|E

25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the flush valve seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> lever, which lifts the flush valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|E
25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the right hand {{have at least one}} {{assignment}} each. The index finger stays over one hole, except that when E4 is played a side key {{at the top of the}} boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it, and this ring and other pads are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hand <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used, typically for B2 and B3, in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 (G1) and A2 (G2) but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A1 and A2.|$|E

25|$|The video {{depicts the}} Yojiro Noda at night {{time in a}} playground, as he <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> girl with a {{blindfold}} and headphones in a wheelchair through the park. The girl holds a flash light as they move. Through the park, the pair pass a facially deformed man and men who are fighting. Further through the park is a makeshift slum, where they pas a man on fire. The sky begins to dawn, and the people around Noda and the girl are shot. A man sets a car on fire, and is later shot down {{by a group of}} men with guns. Near the end of the song, the pair come up to a pile of bodies and severed limbs, along with people crying over their bodies. The rest of the band members perform the song in this scene. Noda leaves the girl to close the eyes of a dead boy, and covers him with his jacket. The girl gets up from her wheelchair, and drops her flash light. She screams, removing her headphones and blindfold to reveal that her eyes have been sewn shut.|$|E
25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt <b>pushes</b> <b>a</b> new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E
