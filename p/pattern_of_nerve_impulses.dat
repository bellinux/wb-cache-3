40|$|Neuromuscular {{junctions}} (NMJs) on {{fast and}} slow muscle fibers display different transmitter release characteristics that appear well {{adapted to the}} different <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> that they transmit in vivo. Here, we ask whether the release properties of such NMJs, termed fast and slow, can be transformed by chronic nerve stimulation. In young adult rats, <b>nerve</b> <b>impulse</b> conduction in the sciatic nerve was blocked by TTX, and the nerve to the fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) or the slow soleus (SOL) muscle stimulated directly below the block with slow (20 Hz for 10 sec every 30 sec) or fast (150 Hz for 1 sec every 60 sec) stimulus patterns, respectively. After 3 – 4 weeks, originally fast EDL-NMJs and slow SOL-NMJs had become almost fully transformed to slow and fast NMJs, respectively, with respect to maintenance of transmitter release during tonic 20 Hz stimulation in vitro and ratio of quantal content to vesicle pool size. TTX block alone had no such transforming effect. Vesicle recycle time was unaffected by the stimulation, whereas initial quantal content and vesicl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{neuromatrix}} {{theory of}} pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic “neurosignature ” <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> {{generated by a}} widely distributed neural network—the “body-self neuromatrix”—in the brain. These neurosignature patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but {{they may also be}} generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix...|$|R
40|$|Following {{numerous}} recent {{reviews of}} the cutaneous senses, the present effort may appropriately emphasize a particular aspect of sensory function. The underlying concept will be that all sensory messages, on their passage through nerves from the periphery to the center, must consist <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> non-specific <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses.</b> The consequent problem is then to correlate the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> the impulses with the sensation induced, considering the <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> as the coin in terms of which we may evaluate sensation on the one hand, and stimulation on the other. These patterns can vary only in limited respects to account for varia-tions in sensation. First, different fibers, for instance large and small, may carry impulses of differ-ent energy value, i. e., of different denominations as coins. The significance of this is little understood. Second, any one fiber may fire at different frequencies, and for different durations, resulting in an accumulation or increase of sensory value in terms of temporal summation. Third, fibers ending at different points of the skin or even {{at the same point}} may be activated together, at the same or a...|$|R
40|$|The brain {{constructs}} {{representations of}} what is sensed and thought about in the 					form <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> that propagate in circuits and network assemblies 					(Circuit Impulse Patterns, CIPs). CIP representations of which humans are 					consciously aware occur {{in the context of}} a sense of self. Thus, research on 					mechanisms of consciousness might benefit from a focus on how a conscious sense 					of self is represented in brain. Like all senses, the sense of self must be 					contained in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses.</b> Unlike the traditional senses that are 					registered by impulse flow in relatively simple, pauci-synaptic projection 					pathways, the sense of self is a system- level phenomenon that may be generated 					by impulse patterns in widely distributed complex and interacting circuits. The 					problem for researchers then is to identify the CIPs that are unique to 					conscious experience. Also likely to be of great relevance to constructing the 					representation of self are the coherence shifts in activity timing relations 					among the circuits. Consider that an embodied sense of self is generated and 					contained as unique combinatorial temporal patterns across multiple neurons in 					each circuit that contributes to constructing the sense of self. As with other 					kinds of CIPs, those representing the sense of self can be learned from 					experience, stored in memory, modified by subsequent experiences, and expressed 					in the form of decisions, choices, and commands. These CIPs are proposed here to 					be the actual physical basis for conscious thought and the sense of self. When 					active in wakefulness or dream states, the CIP representations of self act as an 					agent of the brain, metaphorically as an avatar. Because the selfhood CIP 					patterns may only have to represent the self and not directly represent the 					inner and outer worlds of embodied brain, the self representation should have 					more degrees of freedom than subconscious mind and may therefore have some 					capacity for a free-will mind of its own. S everal lines of evidence for this 					theory are reviewed. Suggested new research includes identifying distinct 					combinatorially coded impulse patterns and their temporal coherence shifts in 					defined circuitry, such as neocortical microcolumns. This task might be 					facilitated by identifying the micro-topography of field-potential oscillatory 					coherences among various regions and between different frequencies associated 					with specific conscious mentation. Other approaches can include identifying the 					changes in discrete conscious operations produced by focal trans-cranial 					magnetic stimulation...|$|R
40|$|In many insects {{flight is}} {{preceded by a}} period of muscular activity, during which the {{temperature}} of the thorax is raised (Dotterweich, 1928; Krogh & Zeuthen, 1941). The temperature changes accompanying this phenomenon in hawk-moths have recently been reinvestigated by Dorsett (1962) and the influence of temperature on the performance of flight muscles from various species has been considered by Neville & Weis-Fogh (1963), Machin, Pringle & Tamasige (1962) and Miller (1964), but little attention appears to have been paid to the mechanisms by which mechanical activity is generated. In the case of those insects (Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata) where the flight muscles are of the synchronous type with the rhythm of muscular activity determined by the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses</b> there is little difficulty in understanding how movements of small amplitude can be produced by twitches of the flight muscles.

40|$|The {{cortical}} {{representation of}} various body parts constantly changes {{based on the}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> afferent <b>nerve</b> <b>impulses.</b> As peripheral <b>nerve</b> injury results in a cortical and subcortical reorganisation this has been suggested as one explanation for the poor clinical outcome seen after peripheral nerve repair in humans. Cutaneous anaesthesia of the forearm in healthy subjects and in patients with nerve injuries results in rapid improvement of hand sensitivity. The mechanism behind the improvement is probably based on a rapid cortical and subcortical reorganisation. The aim of this work was to study cortical changes following temporary cutaneous forearm anaesthesia. Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study. Twenty grams of a local anaesthetic cream (EMLA) {{was applied to the}} volar aspect of the right forearm. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during sensory stimulation of all fingers of the right hand before and during cutaneous forearm anaesthesia. Sensitivity was also clinically assessed before and during forearm anaesthesia. A group analysis of functional magnetic resonance image data showed that, during anaesthesia, the hand area in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex expanded cranially over the anaesthetised forearm area. Clinically right hand sensitivity in the volunteers improved during forearm anaesthesia. No significant changes were seen in the left hand. The clinically improved hand sensitivity following forearm anaesthesia is probably based on a rapid expansion of the hand area in the primary somatosensory cortex which presumably results in more nerve cells being made available for the hand in the primary somatosensory cortex...|$|R
