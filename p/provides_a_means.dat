5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> for an operator {{to start and}} stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

5|$|Through Steamworks, Steam <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of server {{browsing}} for multiplayer {{games that}} use the Steam Community features, allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups. Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added. Starting in beta in December 2014 and publicly released in January 2015, the Steam client allows players to broadcast video streams to the public or Steam friends while playing video games.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. They also have a single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|A void is when {{a player}} {{does not have any}} cards of a certain suit. Generally this is a highly {{advantageous}} situation, because it prevents the player from winning any points in that suit, and <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> to dispose of poor cards. These can be intentionally created with good passing strategy, or appear by themselves.|$|E
25|$|The general {{concept of}} a {{function}} requires that a function of x {{be defined as a}} number given for each x and varying gradually with x.

25|$|Current {{technology}} {{limits the}} testing of important Rare Earth Criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and biosignatures are currently undetectable. Though planets the size of Earth are difficult to detect and classify, scientists now think that rocky planets are common around Sun-like stars. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) of mass, radius and temperature <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of measurement, but falls short of the full Rare Earth criteria.|$|E

25|$|A major {{function}} of the Commission is to regulate the use of violence. For instance, a mafioso who wants to commit a murder in another clan's territory must ask {{the permission of the}} local boss; the commission enforces this rule. Any murder of a mafioso or prominent individual (police, lawyers, politicians, journalists, etc.) must be approved by the commission. Such acts can potentially upset other clans and spark a war, so the Commission <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> by which to obtain their approval.|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis testing <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> {{of finding}} test {{statistics}} used in significance testing. The concept {{of power is}} useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the significance level and is heavily used in sample size determination. The two methods remain philosophically distinct. They usually (but not always) produce the same mathematical answer. The preferred answer is context dependent. While the existing merger of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson theories has been heavily criticized, modifying the merger to achieve Bayesian goals has been considered.|$|E
