5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a <b>photomultiplier</b> tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic <b>photomultiplier</b> tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photomultiplier</b> tube is an {{extremely}} sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and secondary emission, rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use <b>photomultiplier</b> tube arrays to detect low-intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation.|$|E
25|$|Common {{detector}} setups utilize a monochromator and a <b>photomultiplier</b> {{for filtering}} and detecting.|$|E

25|$|The {{ingredients}} for inventing the <b>photomultiplier</b> were coming together during the 1920s as {{the pace of}} vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was {{the need for a}} practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. <b>Photomultiplier</b> technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical <b>photomultiplier.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>photomultiplier</b> is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission.|$|E
25|$|Light {{detection}} {{systems that}} may use amplification e.g. by a photodiode or a <b>photomultiplier</b> tube or a cooled charge coupled device.|$|E
25|$|After 50 years, {{during which}} {{solid-state}} electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the <b>photomultiplier</b> remains {{a unique and}} important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with <b>photomultiplier</b> signal currents, {{even though they are}} greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} {{of the interaction between}} the gamma ray and the crystal can be determined by processing the voltage signals from the photomultipliers; in simple terms, the location can be found by weighting the position of each <b>photomultiplier</b> tube by the strength of its signal, and then calculating a mean position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the voltages from each <b>photomultiplier,</b> measured by a pulse height analyzer is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray interaction, thus allowing discrimination between different isotopes or between scattered and direct photons.|$|E
25|$|A <b>photomultiplier</b> {{will produce}} a small current even without {{incident}} photons; {{this is called the}} dark current. Photon-counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current.|$|E
25|$|Scanner: an {{instrument}} {{used to detect}} and quantify the intensity of fluorescence of spots on a microarray slide, by selectively exciting fluorophores with a laser and measuring the fluorescence with a filter (optics) <b>photomultiplier</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{corporate}} break-up {{in the late}} 1980s involving the acquisition of RCA by General Electric and disposition of the divisions of RCA to numerous third parties, RCA's <b>photomultiplier</b> business became an independent company.|$|E
25|$|The first {{documented}} <b>photomultiplier</b> demonstration {{dates to}} the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg {{were the first to}} integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a <b>photomultiplier</b> with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized prior to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers (Proc. IRE). The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode, a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10kHz.|$|E
25|$|P–n photodiodes are {{not used}} to measure {{extremely}} low light intensities. Instead, if high sensitivity is needed, avalanche photodiodes, intensified charge-coupled devices or <b>photomultiplier</b> tubes are used for applications such as astronomy, spectroscopy, night vision equipment and laser rangefinding.|$|E
25|$|Scintillation {{counters}} {{consist of}} a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a <b>photomultiplier.</b> The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the <b>photomultiplier</b> of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits {{the use of the}} detector to wavelengths below 0.25nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{these early}} photomultipliers used the {{magnetic}} field principle, electrostatic photomultipliers (with no magnetic field) were demonstrated by Jan Rajchman of RCA Laboratories in Princeton, NJ in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers. The first mass-produced <b>photomultiplier,</b> the Type 931, was of this design and is still commercially produced today.|$|E
25|$|A <b>photomultiplier</b> is a {{phototube}} whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of <b>photomultiplier</b> tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E
25|$|Although Leonard's {{attempts}} to disprove {{the existence of}} dark matter were made moot {{by the work of}} another physicist, Leonard helped to solidify proof of the hypothetical matter's existence with a <b>photomultiplier,</b> and was invited as keynote speaker to a topical conference by the Institute of Experimental Physics for his successful research on super solids.|$|E
25|$|P–n photodiodes {{are used}} in similar {{applications}} to other photodetectors, such as photoconductors, charge-coupled devices, and <b>photomultiplier</b> tubes. They {{may be used to}} generate an output which is dependent upon the illumination (analog; for measurement and the like), or to change the state of circuitry (digital; either for control and switching, or digital signal processing).|$|E
25|$|The Japan-based company Hamamatsu Photonics (also {{known as}} Hamamatsu) has emerged since the 1950s {{as a leader}} in the <b>photomultiplier</b> industry. Hamamatsu, in the {{tradition}} of RCA, has published its own handbook, which is available without cost on the company's website. Hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on Hamamatsu's proprietary research and development.|$|E
25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the <b>photomultiplier</b> compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|By October 1935, Vladimir Zworykin, George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ {{submitted}} their manuscript {{describing the}} first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube — the device later called a <b>photomultiplier</b> — to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs (silver oxide-caesium) photocathode. They exhibited a peak quantum efficiency of 0.4% at 800 nm.|$|E
25|$|Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be {{electronically}} {{amplified by}} a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path {{subsequent to the}} <b>photomultiplier),</b> thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons.|$|E
25|$|Burle Industries, as a {{successor}} to the RCA Corporation, carried the RCA <b>photomultiplier</b> business forward after 1986, based in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility. The 1986 acquisition of RCA by General Electric resulted in the divestiture of the RCA Lancaster New Products Division. Hence, 45 years after being founded by the U.S. Navy, its management team, led by Erich Burlefinger, purchased the division and in 1987 founded Burle Industries.|$|E
25|$|For decades, RCA was {{responsible}} for performing the most important work in developing and refining photomultipliers. RCA was also {{largely responsible for the}} commercialization of photomultiplers. The company compiled and published an authoritative and widely used <b>Photomultiplier</b> Handbook. RCA provided printed copies free upon request. The handbook, which continues to be made available online at no cost by the successors to RCA, is considered to be an essential reference.|$|E
25|$|The Lancaster, Pennsylvania {{facility}} was opened by the U.S. Navy in 1942 {{and operated by}} RCA for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes. Following World War II, the naval {{facility was}} acquired by RCA. RCA Lancaster, as it became known, was the base for development and production of commercial television products. In subsequent years other products were added, such as cathode ray tubes, <b>photomultiplier</b> tubes, motion-sensing light control switches, and closed-circuit television systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photomultiplier</b> tubes (photomultipliers or PMTs for short), {{members of}} the class of vacuum tubes, and more {{specifically}} vacuum phototubes, are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 dB), in multiple dynode stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a <b>photomultiplier</b> tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|In May 1940 Kron {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, {{and participated in}} the {{development}} of microwave radar. He would later use devices and equipment that he became familiar with at the Radiation Laboratory such as the RCA IP21 <b>photomultiplier</b> and Direct-coupled amplifiers in looking at the stars. Later in World War II he became head of the Special Devices Group at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) at Inyokern, California, where he conducted studies on solid fuel rockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of <b>photomultiplier</b> technology, when integrated differently, {{are the basis}} of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution often use a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.|$|E
25|$|In {{wavelength}} dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation {{produced by}} the monochromator is passed into a <b>photomultiplier,</b> a detector similar to a Geiger counter, which counts individual photons as they pass through. The counter is a chamber containing a gas that is ionised by X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V {{with respect to the}} conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.|$|E
25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. <b>Photomultiplier</b> tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{gains were}} sought than those {{available}} from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage <b>photomultiplier</b> is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages.|$|E
500|$|The DK was {{ten times}} faster than the DR, but not quite as accurate. [...] It used a <b>photomultiplier,</b> which had {{introduced}} a source of error. The DK's speed made it preferred to the DR. [...] Kaye eventually developed the DKU, [...] combining infrared and ultraviolet features in one instrument, but it was more expensive than other models.|$|E
500|$|Other {{systems may}} be used in {{conjunction}} with the rest of an atomic line filter for practicality. For instance, the polarizers used in the actual Faraday filter don't block most radiation, [...] "because these polarizers only work over a limited wavelength region ... a broad band interference filter is used in conjunction with the Faraday filter". The passband of the interference filter may be 200 times that of the actual filter. <b>Photomultiplier</b> tubes, too, are often used for increasing the intensity of the output signal to a usable level. Avalanche photomultipliers, which are more efficient, {{may be used}} instead of a PMT.|$|E
