30|$|Theoretically, <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> is {{the maximum}} stress {{to which a}} natural soil mass in the field has been {{subjected}} in the past during its geological life time [9], or, {{it is the largest}} overburden under which the soil had been consolidated [12, 13]. Whereas, artificially compacted soil mass also exhibits a characteristic termed as yield stress (σy), similar to the <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> exhibited by the natural soil [9]. In the construction of earthen embankment, earthen dams, engineered landfills, pavements, and also for ground improvement, this induced yield stress becomes vital for the settlement analysis of compacted soil mass or structures founded on such engineered land fills. In fact, yield stress is the quantitative parameter to examine the performance of the artificially compacted soil mass against failure and consolidation settlement.|$|E
40|$|To further our {{understanding}} {{on the impact}} of wetting-drying cycles on the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils, this paper presents experimental results from suction-controlled isotropic compression tests on an unsaturated compacted clay subjected to different wetting-drying histories. This clay exhibited complicated volumetric response to wetting-drying cycles such as irreversible swelling upon wetting, irreversible shrinkage upon subsequent drying and accumulated swelling after a wetting-drying-wetting cycle. The wetting-induced irreversible swelling contributes to a significant reduction in <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> It was observed that a wetting-drying cycle leads to a smaller <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> and downward shifting of the post-yield compression curve at a given suction, whereas a wetting-drying-wetting cycle shows an opposite effect. These observations are attributed to both irreversible swelling and irreversible change in the degree of saturation resulting from wetting-drying cycles. It was found that irreversible swelling or an irreversible increase in degree of saturation makes the soil more susceptible to yield, exhibiting a softening effect. Regarding water phase, its response to isotropic compression is mostly related to the recent wetting-drying history rather than the overall wetting-drying history. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

In the present work, the hydro-mechanical behaviour of Boom clay samples from the borehole Essen- 1 {{at a depth of}} 220 - 260 m and from HADES that is the underground rock laboratory at Mol in Belgium, at 223 -m depth was investigated in the laboratory by performing low pressure oedometer tests (vertical effective stress ranging from 0. 05 to 3. 2 MPa), high pressure oedometer tests (vertical effective stress ranging from 0. 125 to 32 MPa), isotropic consolidation tests (confining effective stress ranging from the in-situ stress to 20 MPa) and triaxial shear tests. It has been observed that the mineralogy, geotechnical properties and hydro-mechanical behaviour of Boom clay from Essen at 227 -m, 240 -m and 248 -m depths are similar to that of Boom clay from Mol. As in the case of Boom clay at Mol, the failure envelope of Boom clay at Essen in the p'-q plane is not linear. The slope of the portion beyond the <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> of Boom clay from Essen is almost the same as that from Mol, suggesting a similar internal friction angle of about 13 °. The compression curves (void index Iv versus logarithm of vertical stress) beyond the <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> are the same for both samples from Mol and Essen, and situated between the intrinsic compression line (ICL) and the sedimentation compression line (SCL).

High-rise buildings, towers, bridges etc., founded on sensitive clays usually suffer from reduction of the safety factor during its life span.

40|$|Sensitive clay is {{the type}} of clay, which loses its shear {{strength}} when it is subjected to cyclic loading. High-rise buildings, towers, bridges etc., founded on sensitive clays and subjected to overturning moment are usually suffer from a steady reduction of the bearing capacity of their foundations and accordingly the safety factor. Cyclic loading of foundation on sensitive clay during the undrained period may lead to quick clay condition and catastrophic failure of the structure. In the literature, governing parameters are listed as: cyclic deviator stress, pore water pressure, axial strain, <b>pre-consolidation</b> pressure, confining <b>stress,</b> initial degree of saturation, water content, liquidity index and the number of cycles. The present study has introduced the governing parameters in two categories; namely physical and mechanical as a function of sensitivity number of the clay material. A well planned experimental investigation was conducted to examine the effect of these governing parameters during the undrained and the drained periods of sensitive clay subjected to static or cyclic loadings. The soil samples, known as “Champlain clay” were obtained from the city of Rigaud, Quebec (Canada). Consolidation tests, static and cyclic undrained and drained triaxial tests were performed on representative samples of this clay. Tests were conducted to identify the role of the key parameters governing this complex behavior during the drained and the undrained periods. The study examined individually the effect of cyclic loading, deviator <b>stress,</b> frequency, <b>pre-consolidation</b> pressure/OCR, and the confining pressure during the drained and undrained conditions. Absence or presence of the matric suction in fully saturated or partially saturated clay, effect of sensitivity number and liquidity index were also examined. Based on {{the results of the present}} experimental investigation, a hypothetical model was introduced to explain the process of shear strength reduction for the case of static and cyclic loading of sensitive clay subjected to cycling loading. The model was capable to define the term remolding agent or degree of remolding, the reduction in shear strength due to remolding. The increase in the water content is identified as the most critical or intrinsic shear strength for sensitive clay. The present study used the “Modified Cam Clay Model” to predict the factor of safety for a foundation on sensitive clay subjected to cyclic loading as function of the physical and mechanical parameters. A design procedure is developed to determine the safe zone for the undrained and drained responses, within which a combination of the cyclic deviator stress and the number of cycles for a given soil/loading/site conditions can achieve a quasi-elastic resilient state without reaching failure. The proposed design procedure is applicable to all regions around the world, where sensitive clays can be found. Furthermore, this procedure can be adopted to examine the conditions of existing foundations built on sensitive clay at any time during its lifespan. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{parameter}} {{often used}} in soil mechanics to quantify the ductility or brittleness of clays is the over-consolidation ratio (OCR). It {{is defined as the}} ratio between the maximum effective vertical stress and the present effective vertical stress. Soil mechanics makes a clear distinction between materials that have been loaded previously to a higher effective stress level and then unloaded to its current in situ effective stress. These materials are called over-consolidated (OC) materials. If the current effective vertical stress in the material is as high or higher {{than at any time in}} its history, then the material is normally consolidated (NC). Over-consolidation in mudrocks and shales is caused by a combination of mechanical compaction and other non-mechanical factors leading to an apparent pre-consolidation. Shales which reach effective confining stresses above the apparent <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> are normally consolidated (NC), while those at effective confining stresses below apparent pre-consolidation are over-consolidated (OC). NC shales or those with low OCR show ductile behavior. OC shales with high OCR show brittle behavior (Nygård et al. 2006).|$|E

The increase in shear strength of the granular soil stabilized with fibers was mostly from the apparent cohesion, and the contribution from the increase in normal confining stress was quite limited. Estabragh et al. [20] studied the mechanical behavior of a fiber-clay composite with natural fiber. They found that the inclusion of the fiber reinforcement within the soil causes a decrease in <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> and increases compressibility and swelling indices.

O experimento foi realizado em áreas da Usina Triunfo Industrial, AL, onde se avaliaram os manejos: MA - mata nativa; MSI - manejo sem irrigação; MCI - manejo com irrigação e MCV - manejo com fertirrigação (vinhaça). Todas as áreas estudadas, exceto no MA, vêm utilizando o preparo convencional do solo com uso de grades pesadas. As amostras de solo foram coletadas nas profundidades de 0 - 20 e 20 - 40 cm. Trincheiras foram abertas nas quatro áreas de manejo em estudo, quando amostras de solo indeformadas foram retiradas com auxílio de aneis metálicos de 6, 4 cm diâmetro e 2, 5 cm de altura em cada profundidade. Após coletadas, as amostras foram saturadas e submetidas a sucções de 0, 1 a 10 kPa; 50, 500 e 1500 kPa, levadas à prensa mecânica e realizado o ensaio de compressibilidade.

The testing area was composed by four distinct sub-areas: a preserved forest (NF), an area without irrigation (MWOI), an irrigated area (MWI), and an area with vinasse (MWV). All investigated areas, except the forest, were prepared using conventional equipment for soil preparation. Soil samples were collected within depths ranging from 0 to 20 cm, 20 to 40 cm, and 40 to 60 cm. A trench was dug in the four selected areas and four undeformed samples were collected in each depth. The samples were collected with metallic rings with dimensions of 6. 4 cm in diameter and 2. 5 cm in height. In the laboratory, the samples were previously saturated and submitted to soil suctions raging from 0. 1 to 1500 kPa in order to build the soil-water characteristic curves.

30|$|Brittleness and {{ductility}} of shale {{are closely}} related to shale gas exploration and production. How to predict brittleness and ductility of shale {{is one of the key}} issues in the study of shale gas preservation and hydraulic fracturing treatments. The magnitude of shale brittleness was often determined by brittle mineral content (for example, quartz and feldspars) in shale gas exploration. However, the shale brittleness is also controlled by burial depth. Shale brittle/ductile properties such as brittle, semi-brittle and ductile can mutually transform with burial depth variation. We established a work flow of determining the burial depth interval of brittle–ductile transition zone for a given shale. Two boundaries were employed to divide the burial depth interval of shale brittle/ductile properties. One is the bottom boundary of the brittle zone (BZ), and the other is the top boundary of the ductile zone (DZ). The brittle–ductile transition zone (BDTZ) is between them. The bottom boundary of BZ was determined by the over-consolidation ratio (OCR) threshold value combined with <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> which the shale experienced over geological time. The top boundary of DZ was determined based on the critical confining pressure of brittle–ductile transition. The OCR threshold value and the critical confining pressure were obtained from uniaxial strain and triaxial compression tests. The BZ, DZ and BDTZ of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale in some representative shale gas exploration wells in eastern Sichuan and western Hubei areas were determined according to the above work flow. The results show that the BZ varies with the maximum burial depth and the DZ varies with the density of the overlying rocks except for the critical confining pressure. Moreover, the BDTZ determined by the above work flow is probably the best burial depth interval for marine shale gas exploration and production in Southern China. Shale located in the BDTZ is semi-brittle and is not prone to be severely naturally fractured but likely to respond well to hydraulic fracturing. The depth interval of BDTZ determined by our work flow could be a valuable parameter of shale gas estimation in geology and engineering.|$|E
40|$|Highlights • The Danube deep-sea fan offers best {{conditions}} for hydrate production. • Gas production {{out of a}} hypothetical methane hydrate reservoir was simulated. • Hazard assessment to investigate the hazard of production-induced slope failures. • Factor of Safety against slope failure is not affected by the production process. • Mobilized mass could hit the production site if landslide were to happen. Methane production from gas hydrate reservoirs is only economically viable for hydrate reservoirs in permeable sediments. The most suitable known prospect in European waters is the paleo Danube deep-sea fan in the Bulgarian exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea where a gas hydrate reservoir is found 60 m below the seafloor in water depths of about 1500 m. To investigate the hazards associated with gas production-induced slope failures we carried out a slope stability analysis for this area. Screening of the area based on multibeam bathymetry data shows that the area is overall stable with some critical slopes at the inner levees of the paleo channels. Hydrate production using the depressurization method will increase the effective stresses in the reservoir beyond <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress,</b> which results in sediment compaction and seafloor subsidence. The modeling results show that subsidence would locally be {{in the order of}} up to 0. 4 m, but it remains confined to the immediate vicinity above the production site. Our simulations show that the Factor of Safety against slope failure (1. 27) is not affected by the production process, and {{it is more likely that}} a landslide is triggered by an earthquake than by production itself. If a landslide were to happen, the mobilized sediments on the most likely failure plane could generate a landslide that would hit the production site with velocities of up to 10 m s- 1. This case study shows that even in the case of production from very shallow gas hydrate reservoirs the threat of naturally occurring slope failures may be greater than that of hydrate production itself and has to be considered carefully in hazard assessments...|$|E
40|$|Compaction {{occurs in}} many {{consolidated}} hydrocarbon reservoirs and {{is responsible for}} both improvement and loss of recovery. This study assesses the effects of rock compaction and the consequences on the production and recovery in unconsolidated shallow gas reservoir a topic of which little is known. The compaction behaviour in unconsolidated to weakly-consolidated reservoirs is studied by compiling a large data set from published laboratory experiments data. Analysis of the data set indicates that the initial porosity, the <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> {{and the degree of}} consolidation of the reservoir formation are the main controlling parameters on the rock compressibility. To account for compaction in unconsolidated sands, a set of equations describing plastic deformation is derived fromthe equations describing linear elastic compressibility. The pore volume reduction and permeability reduction calculated based on these equations tend to over predict the effects of compaction when compared to measured data. Empirical relationships are derived for pore volume and permeability reduction based on compaction behaviour trends which can be applied to unconsolidated reservoirs. With these derived empirical trends compaction is simulated on shallow gas reservoirs. A simplified reservoir model is built capturing the main characteristic of shallow gas reservoirs in the Netherlands. The integration of the effects of compaction within the simulations is done by incorporating the range observed in the pressure-dependent rock characteristics i. e. pore volume (porosity) and permeability. The assumption of a constant reservoir compressibility leads to an uncertainty in the recovery factor of up to 10 %when compared to the pressure-dependent assumption. Two effects of pore volume reduction are visible in P/Z plots (mass balance plots) of compaction-sensitive gas reservoirs: 1) the P/Z line decreases more gradually than when no pore volume reduction occurs, 2) P/Z line deflects downwards with ongoing production and deviates from the straight-line. The higher the pore volume reduction, the more pronounced is this bending of the P/Z-line. The effect of permeability reduction is not visible on the shape of the P/Z plot. In all cases, it is observed that the effect of reservoir compaction is, with respect to the no-compaction case, positive for the recovery of gas. The predicted recoveries show differences which can amount up to 20 % additional recovery. For a typical shallow gas reservoir of 1 BCM, these difference translate to a potential underestimation of 0. 2 Bcm of gas produced.

40|$|Eight whole core {{sediment}} {{samples were}} obtained from ODP Site 1244, Hydrate Ridge, Cascadia Continental Margin {{with the goal of}} understanding the stress history, consolidation behavior and strength characteristics of the soil. A series of Constant Rate of Strain Consolidation (CRSC) and Ko- Consolidated Undrained triaxial (CKoU) tests were performed in order to study the behavior. In addition, Atterberg limits and x-ray diffraction were performed in order to better classify the material. One of the key issues regarding this soil is the level of disturbance imparted during sampling and transportation. Evidence of the disturbance are cracks and voids in x-rays, as well as highly rounded compression curves. Established soil quality criteria have shown the soil to have poor quality. A new criterion comparing the initial loading to the reload cycle shows that soil quality varies, but has no pattern with depth. Nonetheless, highly disturbed samples and trimmings from previous tests were resedimented to produce better quality specimens for consolidation and strength testing. Conventional application of the strain energy method yielded high preconsolidation pressures that indicate the soil is normal to overconsolidated (1 <OCR< 8). An alternative method used to estimate the <b>pre-consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> based on extrapolation of the virgin consolidation curve to the in-situ void ratio predicts that samples shallower than 33 mbsf are near normally consolidated (OCR- 1. 2) whereas deeper sediments are underconsolidated (OCR< 1). However, analysis of the stress path history from a horizontally-oriented CRSC sample gives evidence that the in-situ horizontal effective stress is greater than the vertical effective stress. (cont.) This analysis provides an upper and lower bound factor that is applied to the strain energy preconsolidation pressure. The result is a reduced preconsolidation pressure that indicates the soil is underconsolidated (0. 2 <OCR< 0. 8). The in-situ hydraulic conductivity (ko) is found to vary between 1. 5 x 10 - 7 to 3 x 10 - 8 cm/s with no trend with depth. The compression ratio (Cc) ranges from 0. 473 to 0. 704 and is fairly constant up to a depth of 79 mbsf, after which, Cc decreases. The triaxial tests have revealed that the site may be divided into two layers, with the shallow layer extending up to 20. 3 mbsf and the deep layer extending below 20. 3 mbsf. The resedimented specimens exhibited behavior similar to the specimens from the shallow layer. The average normalized undrained strength for the shallow and deep layers are 0. 35 and 0. 31 respectively. The average friction angle in triaxial compression for the shallow layer is 36 ⁰ and 33 ⁰ for the deep layer. The laboratory test results were used to determine the SHANSEP parameters of the soil, which, when combined with the stress history at the site, gives the strength profile of the site. Finally, the input parameters for the MIT E- 3 soil model were estimated, which will allow further study of the behavior of the soil. by Brian B. Tan. Thesis (S. M.)
