5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Chinese {{women have}} {{significantly}} {{lower rates of}} Papanicolaou (<b>Pap)</b> <b>testing</b> than Euro-Canadian women despite efforts to promote testing. Evidence suggests that Chinese women’s reluctance to undergo <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> {{may be related to}} culture-linked discomfort with sexuality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the role of sexuality in the interaction between acculturation and <b>Pap</b> <b>testing.</b> Design: Euro-Canadian (n! 213) and Chinese (n! 260) female university students completed a battery of questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaires assessing sexual knowledge, sexual func-tion, acculturation, and <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> frequency. Results: Euro-Canadian women had significantly more accurate sexual knowledge, higher levels of sexual functioning, a broader repertoire of sexual activities, and higher <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> rates. Chinese women were more likely to cite embarrassment as a barrier to <b>Pap</b> <b>testing.</b> Heritage acculturation, but not mainstream acculturation, predicted Chinese women’s <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> behavior. Mainstream acculturation was associated with more accurate sexual knowledge and greater sexual desire and satisfaction. Conclusion: The findings provide support for the hypothesis that low <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> rates in Chinese women may be associated with heritage acculturation, although the hypothesis that sexual function would predict <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> behavior was not supported...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Papanicolaou (<b>Pap)</b> <b>testing</b> has transitioned from {{conventional}} preparations (CPs) to liquid-based preparations (LBPs) {{because of the}} perceived superiority of LBPs. Many studies conclude that LBPs reduce unsatisfactory Pap tests; however, some believe that the evidence substantiating this claim is weak. The authors studied {{the effect of the}} transition from CPs to LBPs on the proportion of unsatisfactory <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> in 4 health care systems in the United States participating in the National Institutes of Health-funded Screening Effectiveness and Research in Community-Based Healthcare (SEARCH) project. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 548, 174 women ages 21 to 65 years who had 1443, 725 total <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> between 2000 and 2010. Segmented regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of adopting LBPs on the proportion of unsatisfactory <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> after adjusting for age.

40|$|Although Southeast Asian {{women are}} at {{exceedingly}} {{high risk for}} cervical cancer, low rates of the <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> necessary for early detection and successful treatment continue among this group. Previous research suggests that discussions about <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> with important people in a woman's life, particularly her doctor, may {{increase the likelihood of}} screening; therefore increasing women's discussions about cancer screenings is an important step toward behavior change. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, seven-minute video intervention in reducing barriers to discussions about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> among Thai women. This unique video presented Thai actors, speaking in Thai, in a soap opera format. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at 3 -month follow-up. The comparison group received an educational pamphlet. Although the results indicated that both groups experienced reductions in barriers to communicating with others about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests,</b> the intervention group had significantly stronger outcomes than the comparison group for communicating about <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> in general as well as to doctors. These findings suggest that intermediate communication effects such as self-efficacy, collective efficacy and perhaps interpersonal communication may reduce barriers to discussion and positive decision making regarding <b>Pap</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{endometrium}} is {{not directly}} sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix.

25|$|The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> known earlier as Pap smear, {{cervical}} smear, or smear test) is {{a method}} of cervical screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.|$|E
25|$|Liquid-based {{cytology}} {{is another}} potential screening method. Although {{it was probably}} intended to improve on {{the accuracy of the}} <b>Pap</b> <b>test,</b> its main advantage has been {{to reduce the number of}} inadequate smears from around 9% to around 1%. This reduces the need to recall women for a further smear. The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports screening every 5 years in those who are between 30 and 65 years when cytology is used in combination with HPV testing.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{efficacy}} of a Maryland law requiring <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> to be offered during hospital admissions. "In-reach" strategies emphasize cancer screening within existing health care contacts (such as inpatient stays) rather than additional visits solely for screening. METHODS. Data from a 1986 telephone survey of Maryland women were used to examine the effect of hospitalization on self-reported <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> in a 3 -year period. The effect of hospitalization on screening was examined by age and income to assess whether inpatient screening was more prevalent among certain subgroups of women. RESULTS. For the group as a whole, the odds of Pap screening did not vary with hospitalization. However, among women aged 45 to 54 years with annual household incomes over $ 20, 000, hospitalized women were more likely than nonhospitalized women to report recent <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> For low-income women aged 75 years and older, hospitalization actually decreased the likelihood of reporting <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> CONCLUSIONS. Despite legislation, inpatient cervical cancer screening appears to mirror outpatient patterns, leaving elderly and low-income women unscreened. Methods for increasing inpatient <b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> for underscreened women are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pap</b> <b>testing</b> {{is one of}} the few {{effective}} preventive health practices {{available to}} primary care physicians. Yet we know little about how well this procedure is being done. Using data from the province of Manitoba's universal health insurance plan for the years 1976, 1978 and 1982, we determined the proportion of all <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> of women over 25 years of age performed by the various physician specialties; the percentage of physicians in each specialty who performed tests; and the mean number of tests per specialty group. We also determined the mean number of tests by age and training of the physician. The number of physicians performing <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> increased from 749 in 1976 to 780 in 1982. About 2 % of <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> performed in the province were done by internists, 5 % by general surgeons, about 33 % by obstetrician/gynecologists, 40 % by urban general practitioners, and 22 % by rural general practitioners. Other physicians accounted for less than 0. 2 % of all tests. The mean number of <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> performed increased with increasing physician age up to age 60 and declined thereafter. Manitoba-trained physicians performed the highest rate of <b>Pap</b> <b>testing,</b> and this pattern was maintained over time. In 1982, only 22 % of internists, 29 % of general surgeons, and 78 % of family physicians/general practitioners were performing tests.

25|$|For best results, a <b>Pap</b> <b>test</b> {{should not}} occur {{when a woman}} is menstruating, partly because the {{additional}} cells can obscure cervical cells, and partly because {{this part of the}} menstrual cycle is when the female organs are most inflamed/LINK/. However, Pap smears can be performed during a woman's menstrual period, especially if the physician is using a liquid-based test; if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and it is therefore inadvisable to have a Pap smear if bleeding is excessive.|$|E
25|$|The {{finding of}} coccoid {{bacteria}} on a <b>pap</b> <b>test</b> {{is of no}} consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atypical glandular cells (AGC) {{is a very}} {{important}} diagnosis in gynecological cytology. In the current study, the authors investigated the usefulness of Cellient cell blocks (CB) for characterizing AGC on Papanicolaou (<b>Pap)</b> <b>tests.</b> METHODS: A total of 148 patients with an AGC diagnosis based on <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> by cytotechnologists and referred to cytopathologists were studied. Among these patients, there were 68 patients with CB preparations and 80 patients with <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> only (TP-AGC group). Follow-up results by <b>Pap</b> <b>tests</b> or biopsies were obtained in 117 of 148 patients. The median follow-up was 13 months (range, 1 month- 36 months). RESULTS: Of the 68 patients with CBs, 31 (46 %) were reclassified as negative for dysplasia or low-grade intraepithelial lesion; 30 patients (44 %) retained a diagnosis of AGC (CB-AGC group); and 7 patients (10 %) were given specific diagnoses of high-grade intraepithelial lesion (3 patients), endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ (1 patient), and invasive adenocarcinoma (3 patients). On follow-up, the CB-AGC group was found to have a significantly lower rate of negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion diagnoses compared with the TP-AGC group (55 % vs 85 %; P =. 006). The CB-AGC group had a significantly higher rate of endocervical or endometrial adenocarcinoma compared with the TP-AGC group (36 % vs 8 %; P =. 003) at the time of follow-up. The rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were not found to be statistically different between these 2 groups (9 % vs 7 %; P =. 66). CONCLUSIONS: The Cellient CB is a useful technique to further categorize a diagnosis of AGC on <b>Pap</b> <b>tests.</b> Using the Cellient CB system, the pathologist has the ability to improve the diagnostic accuracy of AGC so that unnecessary colposcopic evaluation or biopsies can be avoided...|$|R
2500|$|Romalis again {{encountered}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1962, during his internship at Cook County Hospital in Illinois, when he spent a month on the septic obstetrics ward.

[...] The ward had about 40 beds plus extra beds lining the halls for the overflow. Each day, the hospital admitted 10-30 patients with septic abortion. Each morning, the interns prepared 40 - 60 litres of intravenous fluid containing tetracycline, oxytocin and ergometrine for inocoming patients. Thanks to the discovery of antibiotics, only about one woman died each month. The cause was usually septic shock associated with hemorrhage. In the mid-1970s, a US report revealed a large drop in maternal mortality since abortion was legalized.
