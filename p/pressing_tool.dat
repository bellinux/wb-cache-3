However, a push nut once installed is normally destroyed in the removal process, which potentially prevents removal of mechanisms captive to the shaft for replacement or servicing without having the correct replacement push nut on hand—if the part number and specification for the push nut is even known—and possibly also requires a specialized <b>pressing</b> <b>tool</b> to conform with manufacturer's guidance.|$|E

The reinforcement of such aluminum-based profiles with high-strength materials offers a high potential for weight reduction and an improvement of functional and mechanical properties. In comparison to conventional composite extrusion using fiber or particle reinforced billets, the alternatively developed process for the embedding of endless reinforcing elements provides enormous advantages regarding extrusion forces, load-adapted reinforcement, and tool abrasion. In this extrusion process with conventional billets, modified tools with portholes are used to position reinforcing elements from outside the <b>pressing</b> <b>tool</b> and to embed them into the material flow during the pressing operation.

40|$|Since {{many years}} {{titanium}} based hard coatings have been routinely applied for forming tools {{to increase their}} lifetime drastically. The rising use of stainless steel, aluminum and magnesium causes new requirements for coatings e. g. on <b>pressing</b> <b>tools</b> because the potential of conventional hard coatings to reduce cold welding is limited in these cases. At the Same time there is a cleas demand to reduce or eliminate the use of lubricants and separation agents. Amorphous carbon (a-C:H and a-C:H:Me) films have a high potential to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, compased to the high hardness, wear resistance and excellent friction properties, {{in many cases the}} life time of a-C:H films is relatively insufficient. For example during forming tool operation, hard abrasive particles and locally high Stresses on the coating surface can cause crack initiation and early coating failure.

Especially ductile metallic nitride inter-layers, like CrN, have a supporting function and they stop crack propagation. Additional metal-carbon gradient layers can improve the adhesion of a-C:H coatings supplementary.
