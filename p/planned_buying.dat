40|$|Middle {{class is}} an {{interesting}} topic in social studies to do a research. Based on Mckenzie, there are currently 45 million people in Indonesia can be categorized as middle class, and in 2030 will reach 135 million people. The middle class is the biggest support of drive economic growth from the demand side. This study aims to perform a simple modeling of middle-class’s cuncumption behavior, which study middle-class subculture {{in the city of}} Surabaya. This study uses an econometric tool called the logistic regression with two purchases decision, impulse buying and <b>planned</b> <b>buying,</b> as dependent variables in the model. Results of this study also show that the income effect variables, motivational variables and variable materialistic values ??consume has a significant and positive effect on impulse buying purchasing decisions. While product involvement variable have positive influence on planned purchases buying behavior...|$|E
40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{thematic analysis}} is presented of 32 interviews, which examined commonsense definitions of impulsive and <b>planned</b> <b>buying,</b> characteristics of typical impulse buy episodes, motivations for impulsive buying, issues of self-image and self-presentation, and regret. Ten interviews each {{were conducted with}} ‘‘ordinary’ ’ men and women consumers, and a further 10 with women classified as ‘‘excessive shoppers’ ’ (more {{commonly referred to as}} ‘‘compulsive buyers’’). Two male excessive consumers were also interviewed. Distinctive patterns emerged for each dierent shopper group. Findings show that impulse buying, regret and other con-cepts have complex meanings beyond those that can be measured easily in survey research, and that the level of sophistication and reflexivity about oneÕs shopping behaviour is far greater in excessive shoppers. On the basis of the gender dierences found, it is proposed that self and shopping are more closely linked for women than for men. Ó 2000 Elsevier Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Current {{theories}} in economics, marketing, and psychology fail to explain underlying reasons for impulse buying and, crucially, why certain goods (e. g., clothes) are bought impulsively {{more than others}} (e. g., basic kitchen equipment). We propose and examine a social psychological model, which predicts that people impulse buy to acquire material symbols of personal and social identity. We predict that consumers will differ systematically in the goods they buy on impulse, and in their reasons for doing so, depending on their attitudes towards shopping, and also along important social categories, such as gender. Specifically, our theoretical model - drawing on a social constructionist model of material possessions (e. g., Dittmar, 1992) and symbolic self-completion theory (e. g. Wicklund and Gollwitzer, 1982) - leads to three sets of hypotheses: (i) some consumer durables {{are more likely to}} be bought on impulse than others, and there may be gender differences in object choices, (ii) differences will emerge in the buying considerations (e. g., functional, emotional, symbolic) that are used for impulse and <b>planned</b> <b>buying,</b> and (iii) magnitude of self-discrepancies will predict relative impulse buying frequency and the buying considerations used, if the individual uses consumption as a self-completion strategy. These predictions were expected to hold particularly strongly for individuals high in compulsive shopping tendencies. We test our model in a questionnaire study with a sample of British consumers (n = 61). The results lend support to all three sets of hypotheses. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to economic and consumer theory, and the treatment offered to the increasing number of ‘addicted’ shoppers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile {{numerous}} studies have demonstrated the impact of out-of-store marketing (e. g. shopping trip goals and price promotion) and in-store marketing (e. g. shelf design) on customer buying behavior, few studies have investigated the influence of social effects on unplanned in-store purchasing. In store-social influences refer to purchase behavior arising from a recommendation or advice from a closely connected and important person to the customer. The current study conducted two focus group interviews with respect to research participants’ grocery shopping experiences. The first focus group composed of 6 university staff and 8 university students were recruited for the second group. Most focus group participants are female. This is salient for the Thai cultural context whereby shopping is still considered the domain for females or housewives particularly for the university staff group. Research findings revealed that both groups mostly prepared shopping lists {{before going to the}} store. However, the list could be an unwritten note. Unplanned purchases were driven by economic value, such as discounted price and sales promotion. However it was found that an accompanying person could alter the research participant's <b>planned</b> <b>buying</b> list and even loyal brand purchases. Specifically, a customer's friend and/or relative may affect the respondent's purchasing pattern. For example, a friend or spouse or relative may give information about defects or the quality of products during in-store shopping. As a result, a customer's unplanned buying decision may be affected by social effect in terms of buying or not-buying even though the customer is motivated by purchase impulses from shelf-exposure. Based on the current research's findings, {{there is a need to}} develop the current theoretical models for the unplanned buying by including the social effect. Furthermore, logical explanations why and how social effect has an impact on unplanned in-store buying are required and resulted in relevant construct development. Social media that is an important route of social effects on in-store buying behavior should be investigated. Strategic management implication is that market practitioners are required to consider the marketing program investments on the customer's social effect for enhancing the in-store unplanned product performance...|$|E

In addition, holiday shoppers are <b>planning</b> to <b>buy</b> even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they <b>planned</b> to <b>buy</b> last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) <b>plan</b> to <b>buy</b> 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give gift cards because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they <b>plan</b> to <b>buy</b> them for those recipients.|$|R
