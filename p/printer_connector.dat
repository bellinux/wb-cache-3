50|$|Usually device programmers are {{connected}} to a personal computer through a <b>printer</b> <b>connector,</b> USB port or LAN interface. A software program on the computer then transfers the data to the programmer, selects the device and interface type, and starts the programming process to read/ write/ erase/ blank the data inside the device.|$|E
50|$|The {{calculator}} had a BASIC interpreter, MEMO function, {{a formula}} library. The built-in 8 kB memory could be expanded using the optional Casio RP-8 (8 kB) or RP-33 (32 kB) RAM expansion modules. An optional Casio FA-6 interface board provided a cassette tape recorder connector, a Centronics <b>printer</b> <b>connector</b> and an RS-232C port. The calculator could print data and listings on any Centronics printer; printing graphics required the Casio FP-100 plotter-printer.|$|E
5000|$|The ZX Printer {{was also}} {{compatible}} with the earlier ZX80 computer (when fitted with the 8kB ROM upgrade) and the later ZX Spectrum, and plugged directly into the expansion bus connector via a short cable. The expansion bus was duplicated {{on the outside of}} the <b>printer's</b> <b>connector,</b> allowing other peripherals to be connected concurrently. The printer drew its power directly from the expansion bus, and was sold with a larger (1-2A) power supply for the ZX81 to accommodate the additional power drain. [...] The Spectrum's user manual noted that this was not needed for the Spectrum as its default 1.1A power supply was sufficient.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Printer</b> port {{forwarding}} <b>connectors</b> — {{allowed to}} plug printer into the Covox and use both (playing audio and printing) without reconnections, although {{not at the}} same time. Whenever something is printed, loud noise is created.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "Crossfire", the HP TouchSmart IQ770 {{featured}} a 19-inch touchscreen, an AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-52 processor, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600. It had {{a wide array of}} ports, including Ethernet, two FireWire, six USB 2.0 ports, one with HP <b>printer</b> power Y-cable <b>connector,</b> 5.1 + digital audio out, IR out, mini-VGA, FM coax, TV coax, ATSC, and two S-Video; however, the IQ770 did not have HDMI ports. PC World gave the machine a [...] "very good" [...] rating of 81/100, but noted that the use of mobile components slowed the computer ...|$|R
50|$|Stock from SAM Computers Ltd. {{were bought}} by West Coast Computers in November 1992. They revamped the SAM Coupés and marketed {{them under the}} new name SAM Élite. The only changes made were that 512 KB became {{standard}} and an external <b>printer</b> <b>connector</b> was added. The slim-line floppy drives from Citizen, who had withdrawn them from the European market in 1990, were replaced with standard 3.5 inch drives. Little {{is known about the}} company, other than that it was based in Gloucester and closed in August 1994, presumably after the last of the SAMCo stock had sold. No new computers made by West Coast are known and this was likely the full extent of their business. For a long period the only point of contact was Format Publications, run by Bob Brenchley, which faded out of existence sometime around 1998.|$|E
5000|$|Early SCSI {{interfaces}} {{commonly used}} a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. This connector {{is similar to}} the 36-pin connector used by Centronics for the parallel interface on their <b>printers,</b> thus the <b>connector</b> became popularly known as [...] "Centronics SCSI" [...] or [...] "CN-50". It is also referred to as a [...] "SCSI-1 connector"; since many connectors have been used for SCSI-1, this can be confusing.Apple used DB-25 connectors, which, having only 25 pins rather than 50, were less expensive to make, but compromised functionality. Further, DB-25s were commonly used for RS-232 serial cables and also to connect parallel printers, meaning that users might accidentally try to use completely inappropriate cables, since the printer and serial cables would fit the connector properly and be hard to visually distinguish. The DB-25's only advantage was that it was smaller than a CN50.|$|R
5000|$|The Centronics Model 101 <b>printer,</b> {{featuring}} this <b>connector,</b> {{was released}} in 1970. The host sent ASCII characters to the printer using 7 of 8 data pins, pulling them high to +5V to represent a 1. When the data was ready, the host pulled the STROBE pin low, to 0 V. The printer responded by pulling the BUSY line high, printing the character, and then returning BUSY to low again. The host could then send another character. Control characters in the data caused other actions, like the [...] or [...] The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the AUTOFEED line high, and keeping it there. The host had to carefully watch the BUSY line to ensure it did not feed data to the printer too rapidly, especially given variable-time operations like a paper feed.|$|R
