40|$|Many of the {{findings}} of previous studies have indicated that there is a direct correlation between water quality and urbanization. Increasing impervious coverage typically results in a decrease in water quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to adapt an automated tool for assessing the Pollutant Load Application (<b>PLOAD).</b> Created by CH 2 M HILL, a fullservice engineering and construction enterprise, <b>PLOAD</b> is a simplified GIS-based model used to calculate pollutants within a watershed. The so-called ?simple method? implemented by <b>PLOAD</b> and discussed in this thesis has been endorsed by the EPA as a viable screening tool for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater projects. This model was designed to be used with ArcView 3. 3. ArcView 3. 3 is a depreciated product, the capabilities of which have been replaced by ArcGIS 9. 1. Using the same GIS data and tabular data required by <b>PLOAD</b> and custom ArcObjects scripting, a replacement, ArcGIS-PLOAD, was created. The current version of ArcGISPLOAD implements the ?simple method? to calculate total pollutant load in pounds per year based on basin boundaries, precipitation in inches per year, ratio of storms producing runoff, parcel land use and parcel area, runoff coefficient for each land use, event mean pollutant concentrations for each land use. Time comparisons between the original <b>PLOAD</b> and the new ArcGIS-PLOAD revealed significant improvements. Both versions of <b>PLOAD</b> produce an intersection between the basin boundary and the land use layer. Calculations are actually done to the intersect layer. It was also found that the original <b>PLOAD</b> disregarded an albeit small portion of the intersection polygons. The new version does not. With the creation of ArcGIS-PLOAD, it is anticipated that it will become a small step in assist the State of Texas in improving water quality...|$|E
40|$|Now a days {{a mobile}} device like a smart phone is {{becoming}} one of the major information processing devices for users. On the other hand, a mobile device is still resource constrained, and some applications, generally demand more resources than a mobile device can pay for. To overcome this, a mobile device should get resources from an externalsource. One of such sources present is cloud computing platforms. In Mobile Cloud computing generally front-endconsist of users who possess mobile devices and back-end cloud servers. This pattern enables users to access a large volume of storage resources with portable devices in a distributed and cooperative manner. In between the times of <b>ploading</b> and downloading files or data, the privacy and integrity of files need to be guaranteed. In this paper a cloud platform is shaped for storage outsourcing, security necessities in mobile cloud are addressed and equivalent algorithms are addressed for guiding off-the-shelf implementation of mobile cloud communications...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{interaction}} between {{land use and}} water quality in urban catchments is closely linked. As pollutants accumulate on land surfaces they are carried in runoff. This has led to increasing concerns that stormwater is responsible for adversely affecting the quality of freshwater resources. Total phosphorus and total suspended solids represent two forms of pollutants that are commonly found in non point source discharge [...] . This study evaluated water quality modelling as an alternative monitoring technique. The study was aimed at determining the potential use of a simple water quality model to evaluate pollution in stormwater runoff. The {{study was conducted in}} the Kuils River catchment using the BASINS <b>PLOAD</b> model (<b>PLOAD)</b> to estimate pollutant loads of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) in runoff [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{concern has}} been {{addressed}} on non-point source (NPS) pollution, due to the serious lake eutrophication worldwide. The best management practices (BMPs) could provide a rational approach to control the agricultural NPS pollution, which is of great significance for the environmental protection and comprehensive watershed management. The authors calculated the discharge of total nitrogen and phosphorus in Wuliangsuhai watershed by using the pollutant load estimator (<b>PLOAD)</b> model. Fifty-nine watersheds were divided, among which thirty-three watersheds with higher agriculture land percentage (above 50 %) were targeted for BMPs, as the pollutant load is heavier in agricultural land {{than in any other}} types of land use in Wuliangsuhai watershed. Scenarios of the total NI'S pollutant emission with or without agricultural BMPs were calculated and compared by using the <b>PLOAD</b> model. The results indicated that the emissions of total nitrogen and total phosphorus could be reduced by 54. 68 % and 41. 54 %. respectively, which means agricultural BMPs is a rational option for watershed restoration. The result could provide technical support and scientific reference for the protection of aquatic environment and for the formulation of conservation policy in Wuliangsuhai watershed...|$|E
30|$|As {{depicted}} in Fig.  1, five typical power components with associated directions, Pnet, Pcap, Pbat, Pflex, and Pde, are defined. Pnet {{is the power}} gap between Pgen and <b>Pload,</b> and is also the active net power of the microgrid. Pcap and Pbat are defined as the power shares (portions) of the ultra-capacitor and the battery. Pflex is the power dissipation of the flexible load and Pde is the power production of the diesel generator set. In addition, the minimum power production limit of the diesel engine is defined as PDE, which is within 30 %- 40 % of its nameplate capacity.|$|E
40|$|The {{non-point source}} (NPS) {{pollution}} {{is difficult to}} manage and control due to its complicated generation and formation. In large scale watersheds, the priority sources areas (PSAs) identification is an important and necessary process for efficient aquatic environmental management. Here, a framework for the PSAs identification and pollution load estimation in PSAs screened for Best Management Practices (BMPs) is proposed. Fujiang Watershed, a branch of Jialingjiang, the upper reach of Yangtze River, was chosen for evaluation of the method proposed here. The entire Fujiang Watershed was divided into 21 subbasins, after which the Agricultural Pollution Potential Index (APPI) was used to identify the PSAs, and a modified runoff coefficient was introduced to mitigate {{the impact of the}} rainfall heterogeneity in the process. Next, the identified PSAs were further divided into 34 subbasins, after which quantification of the pollution load was conducted using the Pollution Load (<b>PLOAD)</b> model. The results indicated that there are five subbasins have much higher NPS pollution load intensities, with an average value of 6. 05 Â t/km 2 /year for TN and 0. 31 Â t/km 2 /year for TP. According to the cluster analysis on land use structure, these five subbasins were featured by higher proportion of agricultural land, suggesting a need for better fertilizer application management. The method developed here provided a helpful framework for conducting NPS pollution management in a large watershed.

40|$|American Rivers is {{advocating for}} {{implementation}} of Green Infrastructure (GI) as a stormwater management strategy within the City of Raleigh. Incorporation of GI into future development plans is an appealing option for growing urban centers to minimize their impact upon surrounding aquatic ecosystems. Since Raleigh lies outside the regulatory {{boundary of the}} Falls Lake Nutrient Strategy, {{there is not a}} significant driver in place to encourage a shift towards GI. This study provided American Rivers with estimates of potential scale of GI retrofit implementation within a highly developed stormwater drainage basin, as well as the benefits those retrofits would provide in terms of nutrient load and peak flow reductions from stormwater flow. This was accomplished through the development of a GIS tool that identifies potential GI retrofit locations within Raleigh stormwater drainage basins, expediting the retrofit field reconnaissance process. The outputs of this tool were then incorporated into <b>PLOAD,</b> a GIS-based pollutant load modeling application for watershed-scale management, which provided estimates of mass loading rates of TN, TP, and TSS. The study area consisted of 11 subcatchments within Pigeon House Branch stormwater drainage basin (3200 acres, ~ 32 % mean impervious coverage). Estimated annual pollutant load reductions resulting from GI implementation were 0. 67, 9. 92, and 16. 82 tons of TP, TN, and TSS, respectively, although the accuracy of these numbers is questionable due to the coarse scale at which <b>PLOAD</b> operates. Ideally, other modeling efforts can be applied within this study’s framework to produce more informed scenarios within other drainage basins throughout the Neuse River Basin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. At present, {{there are}} over 34, 000 {{impaired}} waters and over 58, 000 associated impairments officially listed in the U. S. Nutrients and sediment {{are two of the}} most common pollutants included in the list. States are required to identify and list those waters within their boundaries that are not meeting standards, to prioritize them, and to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for the pollutants of concern. Models are used to support development of TMDLs, typically to estimate source loading inputs, evaluate receiving water quality, and determine source load allocations so that receiving water quality standards are met. Numerous models are available today, and selection of the most suitable model for a specific TMDL project can be daunting. This article presents a critical review of models simulating sediment and nutrients in watersheds and receiving waters that have potential for use with TMDL development and implementation. The water quality models discussed, especially those with sediment and/or nutrient components, include loading models (GWLF and <b>PLOAD),</b> receiving water models (AQUATOX, BATHTUB, CE-QUAL-W 2, QUAL 2 E, and QUAL 2 K), and watershed models havin...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality in}} Coon, Jordan, and Fishing Creeks of Granville County, NC was {{assessed}} using geospatial modeling, toxicity testing, community surveys and interviews, and risk assessment. Field data combined with existing data from the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources provided the bases for the analyses. Our research suggests that water quality is not heavily impacted by local industry and infrastructure. However, conservation priority analysis indicates that downstream Fishing and Coon Creeks are potential conservation areas. In addition, geospatial analysis with <b>PLOAD</b> model shows exceedances of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in certain urban and agricultural areas, which may negatively impact downstream water quality. Preliminary results from acute toxicity tests indicate that stream water at six out of seven sample locations in these streams is of sufficient quality to support medaka (Oryzias latipes) fish hatchlings for 96 -hours (p > 0. 05). Community surveys revealed great citizen concern, yet limited knowledge and awareness about local streams. Risk assessment of metal concentrations in {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} effluent discharging into Fishing Creek indicated a potential risk to aquatic life from copper and zinc. Given limited industry, infrastructure, and environmental data in Granville County, our work lays a foundation for future water quality studies...|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. Transmission {{networks}} change continuously {{when new}} supply requests are made, network reinforcements are installed and equipment configuration changes. Therefore, network design, operation and control requirements change. To manage this, controllers {{are being developed}} to assist human network controllers who might not always be specialists in equipment operation and characteristics. A transmission network comprises multiple variables, some dependent on others. The resistive portion of a load (<b>PLoad)</b> and the total reactive power (Q) installed close to the load can be set in relation to each other. This relationship forms the basic concept of the QP ratio for a transmission network. This ratio is not standardly used as a variable in network operation or control. This thesis explores this new QP ratio in more depth for application in different networks. This concept is developed and investigated in detail and equations are derived from first principles. The usability of the QP ratio is described and calculations are done for existing networks. It is shown that each network has its own unique QP ratio {{that can be used}} as information for human operators or as part of a controller device. This information can assist in determining actions required to be taken by controllers and operators. This thesis investigates aspects related to the use of a QP ratio in transmission networks as far as system operation and network control is concerned. The information provided in this thesis could be developed further to assist in implementing of the QP ratio in transmission network control rooms or systems. This will contribute to the provision of more reliable, robust and controlled electrical networks...|$|E
