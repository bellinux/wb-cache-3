5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation.

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> {{international waters}} {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this situation, a small, D-shaped stone fortification was built to protect Fowey Harbour in Cornwall, then an important centre for trade. The harbour was reached through the Fowey estuary, which the local town had <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> the previous century with two blockhouses positioned along the river's edge—the Fowey and Polruan blockhouses—and a boom chain strung between them. The new castle replaced these and was located high on the headland overlooking {{the entrance to the}} estuary itself, St Catherine's Point, from which it took its name.|$|E

This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb.

The number of wolves in Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{wildlife}} {{importance of the}} area, {{much of what is}} now the SSSI has been <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> nature reserves, starting in 1912 when Charles Rothschild bought Blakeney Point and donated it to the National Trust, which has managed it since. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7million day visitors and 5.5million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds), Cley Marshes (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) and Holkham National Nature Reserve each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually. The SSSI ownership outside the listed areas is a mixture of private land and areas owned by the National Trust or wildfowling associations which are not actively managed as nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The pygmy slow loris is <b>protected</b> <b>in</b> most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the pygmy slow loris is illegal. However, enforcement is poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of international protection, the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of pygmy slow loris from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
