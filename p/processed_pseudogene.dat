50|$|Two splice {{variants}} of the PKP2 gene have been identified. The first has a molecular weight of 97.4 kDa (881 amino acids) {{and the second}} of molecular weight of 92.7 kDa (837 amino acids). A <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> with high similarity to this locus has been mapped to chromosome 12p13.|$|E
40|$|<b>Processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> {{result from}} reverse {{transcribed}} mRNAs. In general, because <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> lack promoters, {{they are no}} longer functional from the moment they are inserted into the genome. Subsequently, they freely accumulate substitutions, insertions and deletions. Moreover, the ancestral structure of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> could be easily inferred using the sequence of their functional homologous genes. Owing to these characteristics, <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> represent good neutral markers for studying genome evolution. Recently, there is an increasing interest for these markers, particularly to help gene prediction in the field of genome annotation, functional genomics and genome evolution analysis (patterns of substitution). For these reasons, we have developed a method to annotate <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> in complete genomes. To make them useful to different fields of research, we stored them in a nucleic acid database after having annotated them. In this work, we screened both mouse and human complete genomes from ENSEMBL to find <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> generated from functional genes with introns. We used a conservative method to detect <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> in order to minimize the rate of false positive sequences. Within <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes,</b> some are still having a conserved open reading frame and some have overlapping gene locations. We designated as retroelements all reverse transcribed sequences and more strictly, we designated as <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes,</b> all retroelements not falling in the two former categories (having a conserved open reading or overlapping gene locations). We annotated 5823 retroelements (5206 <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes)</b> in the human genome and 3934 (3428 <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes)</b> in the mouse genome. Compared to previous estimations, the total number of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> was underestimated but the aim of this procedure was to generate a high-quality dataset. To facilitate the use of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> in studying genome structure and evolution, DNA sequences from <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes,</b> and their functional reverse transcribed homologs, are now stored in a nucleic acid database, HOPPSIGEN. HOPPSIGEN can be browsed on the PBIL (Pole Bioinformatique Lyonnais) World Wide Web server ([URL] or fully downloaded for local installation...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{kinetic model}} is {{developed}} {{that describes the}} accumulation of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> in a functional gene family. Insertion of new pseudogenes occurs at rate ν per gene and is countered by spontaneous deletion (at rate δ per DNA segment) of segments containing <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes.</b> If there are k functional genes in a gene family, the equilibrium number of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> is k(ν/δ), {{and the percentage of}} functional genes in the gene family at equilibrium is 1 /[1 + (ν/δ) ]. ν/δ values estimated for five gene families ranged from 1. 7 to 15. This fairly narrow range suggests that the rates of formation and deletion of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> may be positively correlated for these families. If δ is sufficiently large relative to the per nucleotide mutation rate µ (δ > 20 µ), <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> will show high homology with each other, {{even in the absence of}} gene conversion between pseudogenes. We argue that formation of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> may share common pathways with transposable elements and retroviruses, creating the potential for correlated responses in the evolution of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> due to direct selection for control of transposable elements and/or retroviruses. Finally, we discuss the nature of the selective forces that may act directly or indirectly to influence the evolution of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> often pose {{a problem}} for gene {{prediction}} programs, often being misidentified as real genes or exons. It has been proposed that identification of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> can help improve the accuracy of gene prediction methods.|$|R

40|$|<b>Processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> {{were created}} by reverse-transcription of mRNAs; they provide {{snapshots}} of ancient genes existing {{millions of years ago}} in the genome. To find them in the present-day human, we developed a pipeline using features such as intron-absence, frame-disruption, polyadenylation, and truncation. This has enabled us to identify in recent genome drafts ∼ 8000 <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> (distributed from [URL] Overall, <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> are very similar to their closest corresponding human gene, being 94 % complete in coding regions, with sequence similarity of 75 % for amino acids and 86 % for nucleotides. Their chromosomal distribution appears random and dispersed, with the numbers on chromosomes proportional to length, suggesting sustained “bombardment” over evolution. However, it does vary with GC-content: <b>Processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> occur mostly in intermediate GC-content regions. This is similar to Alus but contrasts with functional genes and L 1 -repeats. Pseudogenes, moreover, have age profiles similar to Alus. The number of pseudogenes associated with a given gene follows a power-law relationship, with a few genes giving rise to many pseudogenes and most giving rise to few. The prevalence of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> agrees well with germ-line gene expression. Highly expressed ribosomal proteins account for ∼ 20 % of the total.

50|$|The PTEN gene is a known tumor {{suppressor}} gene. The PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1 is a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> that is {{very similar}} in its genetic sequence to the wild-type gene. However, PTENP1 has a missense mutation which eliminates the codon for the initiating methionine and thus prevents translation of the normal PTEN protein. In spite of that, PTENP1 appears {{to play a role}} in oncogenesis. The 3' UTR of PTENP1 mRNA functions as a decoy of PTEN mRNA by targeting micro RNAs due to its similarity to the PTEN gene, and overexpression of the 3' UTR resulted in an increase of PTEN protein level. That is, overexpression of the PTENP1 3' UTR leads to increased regulation and suppression of cancerous tumors. The biology of this system is basically the inverse of the BRAF system described above.|$|E
50|$|The Drosophila {{embryonic}} protein SNAI1, {{commonly known}} as Snail, is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor which downregulates the expression of ectodermal genes within the mesoderm. The nuclear protein encoded by this gene is structurally similar to the Drosophila snail protein, and is also thought to be critical for mesoderm formation in the developing embryo. At least two variants of a similar <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> have been found on chromosome 2. SNAI1 zinc-fingers (ZF) binds to E-box, an E-cadherin promoter region, and represses {{the expression of the}} adhesion molecule, which induces the tightly bound epithelial cells to break loose from each other and migrate into the developing embryo to become mesenchymal cells. This process allows for the formation of the mesodermal layer in the developing embryo. Though SNAI1 is shown to repress expression of E-cadherin in epithelial cells, studies have shown homozygous mutant embryos are still able to form a mesodermal layer. However, the mesodermal layer present shows characteristics of epithelial cells and not mesenchymal cells (the mutant mesoderm cells exhibited a polarized state). Other studies show that mutation of specific ZFs contribute to a decrease in SNAI1 E-cadherin repression.|$|E
40|$|A {{chromosomal}} DNA sequence harboring a processed AK 2 B pseudogene {{was isolated}} {{from a human}} genomic library. It was {{a variant of the}} AK 2 B gene sequence including several point mutations, deletions, and insertions. The nucleotide sequence of the ORF of the AK 2 B pseudogene predicted a truncated form of the AK 2 B mutant suggesting that the <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> is nonfunctional. A repetitive sequence, AAAAGAGAG, found in the 5 ' and 3 ' flanking regions of the pseudogene and the poly(A) tract in the 3 ' end junction suggest that a mRNA of AK 2 B may have been converted to the <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> by retrotransposition events. Previously, it was suggested that an adenylate kinase (AK) 2 related gene on chromosome 2, confirmed by Southern analysis using somatic cell hybrid cell lines, may be a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene.</b> It is proposed that the <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> isolated in this study may be the AK 2 related nonfunctional gene localized on human chromosomes 2. ope...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Processed</b> (or retrotransposed) <b>pseudogenes.</b> In higher eukaryotes, {{particularly}} mammals, retrotransposition is {{a fairly}} common event that has had {{a huge impact on}} the composition of the genome. For example, somewhere between 30-44% of the human genome consists of repetitive elements such as SINEs and LINEs (see retrotransposons). In the process of retrotransposition, a portion of the mRNA or hnRNA transcript of a gene is spontaneously reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into chromosomal DNA. Although retrotransposons usually create copies of themselves, it has been shown in an in vitro system that they can create retrotransposed copies of random genes, too. Once these pseudogenes are inserted back into the genome, they usually contain a poly-A tail, and usually have had their introns spliced out; these are both hallmark features of cDNAs. However, because they are derived from an RNA product, <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> also lack the upstream promoters of normal genes; thus, they are considered [...] "dead on arrival", becoming non-functional pseudogenes immediately upon the retrotransposition event. However, these insertions occasionally contribute exons to existing genes, usually via alternatively spliced transcripts. A further characteristic of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> is common truncation of the 5' end relative to the parent sequence, which {{is a result of the}} relatively non-processive retrotransposition mechanism that creates <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes.</b> <b>Processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> are continually being created in primates. Human populations, for example, have distinct sets of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> across its individuals.|$|R

40|$|Correct gene {{prediction}} is impaired {{by the presence}} of processed pseudogenes: nonfunctional, intronless copies of real genes found elsewhere in the genome. Gene prediction programs frequently mistake processed pseudogenes for real genes or exons, leading to biologically irrelevant gene predictions. While methods exist to identify processed pseudogenes in genomes, no attempt has been made to integrate pseudogene removal with gene prediction, or even to provide a freestanding tool that identifies such erroneous gene predictions. We have created PPFINDER (for <b>Processed</b> <b>Pseudogene</b> finder), a program that integrates several methods of <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> finding in mammalian gene annotations. We used PPFINDER to remove pseudogenes from N-SCAN gene predictions, and show that gene prediction improves substantially when gene prediction and pseudogene masking are interleaved. In addition, we used PPFINDER with gene predictions as a parent database, eliminating the need for libraries of known genes. This allows us to run the gene prediction/PPFINDER procedure on newly sequenced genomes for which few genes are known...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} the carbohydrate-deficient {{glycoprotein}} syndrome type I (CDG 1) gene has revealed {{the existence of a}} family of phosphomannomutase (PMM) genes in humans. Two expressed PMM genes, PMM 1 and PMM 2, are located on chromosome bands 22 q 13 and 16 p 13, respectively, and a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> PMM 2 psi is located on chromosome 18 p. Mutations in PMM 2 are the cause of CDG type IA whereas no disorder has been associated with defects in PMM 1 as yet. Here, we describe the genomic organization of these paralogous genes. There is a 65 % identity of the coding sequence, and all intron/exon boundaries have been conserved. The <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> is more closely related to PMM 2. Remarkably, several base substitutions in PMM 2 that are associated with disease are also present at the corresponding positions in the pseudogene.

40|$|We {{isolated}} and sequenced {{the first known}} cytochrome P 450 gene and pseudogene from an arachnid, the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. Bath the gene and pseudogene belong to the family CYP 4, but a new subfamily, CYP 4 W, had to be created for these genes because they are substantially different to other CYP 4 genes. The gene, CPP 4 W 1, has greatest homology with CYP 4 C 1 from a cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis. The predicted molecular weight of the protein encoded by CYP 4 W 1 (63 KDa) is {{greater than that of}} the other CYP 4 genes. The pseudogene, CYP 4 W 1 P, is probably a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> derived from the functional gene CYP 4 W 1. This is only the third CYP <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> to be identified. The pseudogene is 98 % identical to the functional gene, CYP 4 W 1, therefore we hypothesise that this pseudogene evolved recently from the functional gene. The CYP 4 genes from arthropods have diverged from each other more than those of mammals; consequently the phylogeny of the arthropod genes could not be resolved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In our study towards understanding cellular adaptations to stress using a rat histiocytic tumor model, we have identified mis-sense mutation in p 53 that led to premature termination of translation at the carboxyl-termi- nus. Further, the cDNA isolated from heat stre- ssed cells producing two amplicons with cDNA specific primers (N-terminus) suggested occurrence of possible pseudogene(s). A comparative analysis between different tumor cell lines of rat origin and rat genomic DNA using p 53 gene specific primers resulted in the amplification of a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> and its positive interaction with wild type p 53 probe on Southern blot analysis. The genomic DNA sequence analysis, and sequence comparison with cDNA discovered that the <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> lacks DNA binding domain and nuclear localization signal, however, contains the ribosomal entry and stop signals.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the origin and}} evolution of a mouse <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene,</b> Makorin 1 -p 1, whose transcripts stabilize functional Makorin 1 mRNAs. It is shown that Makorin 1 -p 1 originated almost immediately before the musculus and cervicolor species groups diverged from each other some 4 million years ago and that the Makorin 1 -p 1 orthologs in various Mus species are transcribed. However, Mus caroli in the cervicolor species group expresses not only Makorin 1 -p 1, but also another older Makorin 1 -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene,</b> demonstrating the rapid generation and turnover in subgenus Mus. Under this circumstance, transcribed processed pseudogenes (TPPs) of Makorin 1 evolved in a strictly neutral fashion even with an enhanced substitution rate at CpG dinucleotide sites. Next, we extend our analyses to rats and other mammals. It is shown that although these species also possess their own Makorin 1 -derived TPPs, they occur rather infrequently in simian primates. Under this circumstance, it is hypothesized that already existing TPPs must be prevented from accumulating detrimental mutations by negative selection. This hypothesis is substantiated {{by the presence of}} two rather old TPPs, MKRNP 1 and MKRN 4, in humans and New World monkeys. The evolutionary rate and pattern of Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes depend heavily on how frequently they are disseminated in the genome...|$|E

40|$|Genomic {{sequencing}} and chromosomal {{assignment of}} the gene encoding rat APEX nuclease, a multifunctional DNA repair enzyme, were performed. An active Apex gene and a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> were isolated from a rat genomic library. The active Apex gene consists of 5 exons and 4 introns spanning 2. 1 kb. The putative promoter region of the Apex gene lacks the typical TATA box, but contains CAAT boxes and a CpG island having putative binding sites for several transcription factors, such as Sp 1, AP- 2, GATA- 1 and ATF. A putative O-sialoglycoprotease (a homologue of Pasteurella haemolytica glycoprotease, gcp; abbreviated as Prsmg 1 /Gcpl 1) gene consisting of 11 exons and 10 introns spanning 7. 3 kb lies immediately adjacent to the Apex gene in a 5 '-to- 5 ' orientation.

40|$|Processed pseudogenes are {{produced}} from the reverse transcription of mRNA followed by {{integration into the}} genome. This process is mediated by enzymes encoded by retrotransposable elements such as LINE- 1 in mammals. In most cases, processed pseudogenes can not produce transcripts because of lacking functional promoter. Therefore, processed pseudogenes are treated as genomic `fossil records 2 ̆ 7. However, recently, <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> {{has been shown to}} carry out biochemical function. In mice, the Makorinl-pl <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> regulates the mRNA stability of its homologous coding gene (Makorin 1) by competitive interaction for degradation factors. In this thesis, molecular evolutionary and population genetics approaches are used to investigate the origin and evolution of Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes. 　　　　　It is shown that Makorin 1 -p 1 originated almost immediately before the musculus and cervicolor species groups diverged from each other some 4 mi 11 ion years ago and that the Makorinl-pl orthologs in various Mus species are transcribed. However, Mus caroli in the cervicolor species group transcribes not only Makorinl-pl, but also another older Makorinl -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene,</b> demonstrating the rapid generation and turnover of the pseudogenes in the subgenus Mus. Under this circumstance, transcribed processed pseudogenes of Makorin 1 evolve in a strictly neutral fashion even with an enchanced substitution rate at CpG dinucleotide sites. Makorin 1 -pl is divided into three regions by its function and the homology to Makorin 1; region A has no homology with Makorin 1, region B has homology with Makorin 1 and includes the target region of degradation factors, and region C has homology with Makorin 1 but has no relationship with its mRNA stability. In mouse Makorin 1 -p 1 orthologs, there is no difference at the nucleotide substitution rate between regions. 　　　　　Extended analyses of Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes in the genome database and genomic PCRs show that rats have their own Makorin 1 -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene.</b> Furthermore, RT-PCRs using testis tota 1 RNA demonstrate the cotranscription of Makorin 1 and Makorinl -derived processed pseudogenes in rats. These results suggest that the rat specific Makorin 1 -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> can take over the role of Makorin 1 -p 1 in the subgenus Mus. Extended analyses to other mammals (dogs, cows, chimpanzees and humans) using genome databases also shows that each species has its own Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes, except for chimpanzees and humans. In dogs, they have three relatively recently originated Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes, suggesting that Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes are rapidly generated in dogs as in mice. Thus, {{there is a possibility that}} Makorin 1 mRNA stability has been maintained by its processed pseudogenes in dogs. In cows, chimpanzees and humans, however, relatively recent Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes do not exist. In cows, due to incompleteness of the genome database, such newly emerged sequences may not be identified. In humans and chimpanzees, seven Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes exist, and all of them show the relatively old origin. For stability of Makorin 1 mRNA, the impormt featue is sequence similarity and transcription. RT-PCRs using testis total RNA demonstrate the cotranscription of Makorin 1 and Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes in humans too. If humans and chimpanzees do not have relatively recent Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes, preexisting pseudogenes must be prevented from accumulating detrimental mutations by negative selection on functionally related region (B region). In fact, comparison between human and chimpanzee orthologs reveals that the B region in two Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes, MKRN 4 and MKRNP 1, isconserved. 　　　　　To examine whether this conservation is general in primale lineage and human populations, extended analyses to simian primates and human populations using genomic PCRs and genome database searches were carried out. Prosimians have their own specific Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes. Galagoides demidoff (Demidoff’s galago) has one Makorinl -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> which has high homology with Makorin 1 in humans and mice, while Galago moholi (South African galago) and Otolemur crassieaudatus (thick-tailed bush baby) have two pairs of orthlogous Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes and one of them indicates the conservation of the B region. New World monkeys and Catarrhini have orthologous pairs of human Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes. Unlike rodents, Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes occur rather infrequently in simian primates. Under this circumstance, it is hypothesized that preexisting transcribed processed pseudogenes must be prevented from accumulating detrimental mutations by negative selection. Comparison of MKRN 4 orthologous pairs shows that the conservation of the B region is limited to humans and chimpanzees. 　In contrast to MKRN 4, comparison of MKRNP 1 orthlogous pairs shows that the conservation of the B region is general, and especially, the strict conservation is observed in hominoids. In human populations, both MKRN 4 and MKRNPI 1 show the reduction of the nucleotide diversity in the B region, compared with other region. 　　　　　From the above observation it is concluded as follows: 1) The transcription of Makorinl -derived <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene</b> is not limited to mice. The phenomenon is rather general in mammals. 2) The rate of emergence of these pseudogenes is, however, different from species to species. And 3) The evolutionary rate and pattern of Makorin 1 -derived processed pseudogenes depend heavily on how frequently they are disseminated in the genome...|$|E
40|$|Two {{human genes}} that are {{homologous}} {{to both the}} murine transforming gene (oncogene) v-raf and the chicken transforming gene v-mil have been mapped by means of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids to human chromosomes previously devoid of known oncogenes. One gene, c-raf- 2, {{which appears to be}} a <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogene,</b> is located on chromosome 4. The other gene, c-raf- 1, which appears to be the active gene, is located on chromosome 3 and has been regionally mapped by chromosomal in situ hybridization to 3 p 25. This assignment correlates with specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with certain human malignancies...|$|E

While the functional dihydrofolate reductase gene has been mapped to chromosome 5, multiple intronless <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> or dihydrofolate reductase-like genes have been identified on separate chromosomes.|$|R
40|$|Nanog is a {{recently}} discovered ANTP class homeobox gene. Mouse Nanog {{is expressed in}} the inner cell mass and in embryonic stem cells and has roles in self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency. Here we describe the location, genomic organization, and relative ages of all human NANOG <b>pseudogenes,</b> comprising ten <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes</b> and one tandem duplicate. These are compared to the original, intact human NANOG gene. Eleven is an unusually high number of pseudogenes for a homeobox gene and must reflect expression in the human germ line. A pseudogene orthologous to NANOGP 4 was found in chimpanzee and an expressed pseudogene in macaque. Examining pseudogenes of differing ages gives insight into pseudogene decay, which involves an excess of deletion mutations over insertions. The mouse genome has two <b>processed</b> <b>pseudogenes,</b> which are not clear orthologues of the primate pseudogenes...|$|R
