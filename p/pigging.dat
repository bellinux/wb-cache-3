The study team conducted an exploratory qualitative study by interviewing backyard <b>pig</b> raisers and nomadic herders (n = 34), observing daily interactions between <b>pigs</b> and humans (n = 18) and drawing seasonal diagrams (n = 6) with herders to understand the reasons for movement of nomadic herds. <b>Pig</b> raisers had regular close interaction with <b>pigs.</b> They often touched, caressed and fed their <b>pigs</b> which exposed them to pigs' saliva and feces.

The Weitzman approach which was accepted as a framework for assessment of genetic diversity on AnGR was exploited. In this study, several measurement indexes of genetic diversity, involving total genetic diversity, contributions of each breed to the total diversity, marginal diversities, conservation potential, were calculated based on microsatellite marker data of 20 Central-China type <b>pig</b> populations. Total genetic diversity of twenty Central-China <b>pig</b> breeds was 11, 707 and expected diversity was 66. 96 % of the total genetic diversity. Jinhua <b>pig</b> had the greatest contribution to overall genetic diversity (8. 90 %), followed by Wannan Spotted <b>pig</b> (7. 46 %), Shengxian Spotted <b>pig</b> (7. 40 %), and Leping <b>pig</b> (7. 04 %).

50|$|Ice <b>Pigging</b> is {{the process}} in which an ice slurry is pumped into a pipe and forced along inside in order to remove {{sediment}} and other unwanted deposits to leave the pipe clean. It has many applications in the water, sewage and food industries. The University of Bristol has held many laboratory trials to investigate various key factors and refine the process. Ice <b>Pigging</b> was invented and patented by Professor Joe Quarini of the University of Bristol.|$|E
50|$|The Ice <b>Pigging</b> method {{occupies}} a ‘middle ground’ {{between two of}} the traditional methods of cleaning pipes; that of ‘flushing’, which involves pumping high velocity water through pipes in order to carry away residue, and <b>pigging,</b> forcing a solid object through the pipe to push away any loose material. Ice <b>Pigging</b> utilises the main principles behind these two methods. An ice-water slurry, typically between 50 and 90% ice fraction is introduced to and removed from pipes with little complication, provided the presence of suitable hydrants and valves. The high ice fraction, lends several attributes which are particularly appealing for application in pigging; It is able to hold itself together under continuous shear. If the ice becomes stuck then given enough time it will just melt and be carried away. It is fairly inexpensive to make. It leaves the pipe walls themselves undamaged, and only removes waste residue. Because Ice <b>Pigging</b> is a relatively quick process (when compared to alternative methods), it can be use for a number of applications including: underground pipes for fresh water and sewage, food manufacturing pipe work and many others.|$|E
