5000|$|Vacuum molding (V-process) is a {{variation}} of the sand casting process for most ferrous and non-ferrous metals, in which unbonded sand is held in the flask with a vacuum. The pattern is specially vented so that a vacuum can be pulled through it. A heat-softened thin sheet (0.003 to 0.008 in) of plastic film is draped over the pattern and a vacuum is drawn (...) [...] A special vacuum forming flask is placed over the plastic pattern and is filled with a free-flowing sand. The sand is vibrated to compact the sand and a sprue and <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> are formed in the cope. Another sheet of plastic is placed {{over the top of the}} sand in the flask and a vacuum is drawn through the special flask; this hardens and strengthens the unbonded sand. The vacuum is then released on the pattern and the cope is removed. The drag is made in the same way (without the sprue and <b>pouring</b> <b>cup).</b> Any cores are set in place and the mold is closed. The molten metal is poured while the cope and drag are still under a vacuum, because the plastic vaporizes but the vacuum keeps the shape of the sand while the metal solidifies. When the metal has solidified, the vacuum is turned off and the sand runs out freely, releasing the casting.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{production}} mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a core is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins {{of the same}} metal used for casting. One or more wax sprues are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> {{to the bottom of}} the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for ceramic shell casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all free moisture is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.|$|E
40|$|Advanced vision {{solutions}} enable {{manufacturers in}} the technology sector to reconcile both competitive and regulatory concerns and address the need for immaculate fault detection and quality assurance. The modern manufacturing has completely shifted from the manual inspections to the machine assisted vision inspection methodology. Furthermore, the research outcomes in industrial automation have revolutionized the whole product development strategy. The purpose of this research paper is to introduce a new scheme of automation in the sand casting process by means of machine vision based technology for mold positioning. Automation has been achieved by developing a novel system in which casting molds of different sizes, having different <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> location and radius, position themselves {{in front of the}} induction furnace such that the center of <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> comes directly beneath the pouring point of furnace. The coordinates of the center of <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> are found by using computer vision algorithms. The output is then transferred to a microcontroller which controls the alignment mechanism on which the mold is placed at the optimum location...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} investigation on shape replication and surface roughness of Al- 12 wt% Si alloy casting produced by lost foam casting process was conducted. 5 -step shape patterns incorporated with {{top and bottom}} gates were used. Four top gating systems with different <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> configurations namely single-middle, single-side, double and single-wide and a simple bottom gate design were investigated to appropriate filling to produces sound casting. Three sand vibration times of 1, 2 and 3 min {{were used for the}} moulding process. Molten metal was poured at five different temperatures of 660, 680, 700, 720 and 740 °C. Shape replication and surface roughness of the cast samples were analysed visually and by roughness tester, respectively. The results showed that <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> design has a significant effect on the replication and surface integrity of the castings. It was also found that single top-wide <b>pouring</b> <b>cup</b> as well as lower vibration time and higher pouring temperature provided castings with better shape replication and smoother surface finish with a surface roughness of 19 – 20 µm compared to 25 – 31 µm for castings produced with other cup configurations...|$|E

2500|$|Irregular cast silver ingots {{circulated}} {{from about}} 11th to early 12th centuries. Only one such example is known from Lithuania, found in 1938 in Graužiai. Around {{the second half}} of the 12th century, supply of minted Western European coins dried up and there was no centralized power in Eastern Europe to take up coin mintage. The period is known as [...] "coinless period". However, merchants needed a means of exchange. Therefore, a local system of cast silver ingots was developed. While silver was imported (there are no silver mines in the region; the main mining area was in the Upper Harz in Germany), the ingots were cast locally. At first, a wax model was created. Then it was coated with clay and fired in a furnace inside a clay or sand pit. The wax would melt leaving a mold for the ingot. Molten silver was poured into the mold using a special clay scoop. After cooling off, the mold was broken to remove the ingot. Therefore, most molds were one-time use though a few examples of ingots are known that were cast using the same mold. Because of this technique, archaeologists have not discovered any furnaces or molds, only clay spoons and <b>pouring</b> <b>cups.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{gating system}} may be {{designed}} to minimize turbulence, depending on the material being cast. For example, steel, cast iron, and most copper alloys are turbulent insensitive, but aluminium and magnesium alloys are turbulent sensitive. The turbulent insensitive materials usually have a short and open gating system to fill the mold as quickly as possible. However, for turbulent sensitive materials short sprues are used to minimize the distance the material must fall when entering the mold. Rectangular <b>pouring</b> <b>cups</b> and tapered sprues are used to prevent {{the formation of a}} vortex as the material flows into the mold; these vortices tend to suck gas and oxides into the mold. A large sprue well is used to dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid material as it falls down the sprue, decreasing turbulence. The choke, which is the smallest cross-sectional area in the gating system used to control flow, can be placed near the sprue well to slow down and smooth out the flow. Note that on some molds the choke is still placed on the gates to make separation of the part easier, but induces extreme turbulence. The gates are usually attached {{to the bottom of the}} casting to minimize turbulence and splashing.|$|R

5000|$|Vygotsky studied child {{development}} and the significant roles of cultural mediation and interpersonal communication. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as internalization.

For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or <b>pouring</b> a <b>cup</b> of milk are initially outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through {{the activity of the}} child within society. A further aspect of internalization is appropriation, in which the child takes a tool and makes it his own, perhaps using it in a way unique to himself. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for his own ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.|$|R
40|$|J ust as online {{shopping}} is a bellwether of advancedonline technologies, so do museums and galleries showcase {{the best in}} computer display and interface technology. In the first case, commerce demands that speed and reliability get priority; in the latter, techno-logical invisibility is foremost. The museum experience is an unusually tactile, sensual one, and the standard keyboard-mouse-and-screen setup might seem out of place. Further, while “museums tend to draw educated visitors,” 1 not all “educated ” people are computer liter-ate. For these reasons, museums and galleries have actively sought out creative interface systems to encour-age interaction with computer-mediated displays, while keeping the technology in the background. This trend toward sensual involvement is particu-larly noticeable in tabletop displays, as they appeal to two aspects of familiar daily life: the horizontal sur-face as a workspace, and hand gestures (or common objects) as tools for manipulating information. Of the nine exhibits I surveyed for this article, only one used anything resembling a mouse, and the two others that used physical objects for mouse-like functions did so in a disguised fashion. Another exhibit used radio fre-quency identifier (RFID) -tagged paper as a physical token, and flashlights as surrogates for shovels. Overall, the systems seem to consciously strive to return the desktop metaphor back to {{its roots in the}} physical, corporeal world. The exhibits In choosing the exhibits to feature in this article, I con-centrated on those that ■ have been accessible to the public, even if only briefly; ■ used a horizontal display surface; ■ were displayed in a museum or art gallery; and ■ substantially incorporated computer technology for I/O systems. Undoubtedly, there are many exhibits that I simply didn’t know about and others that blur the lines of sev-eral of these criteria. For example, among the exhibits featured in this article, should the Dialog Table (which has a slightly inclined surface) be considered horizon-tal? What about exhibits that use both horizontal and vertical displays, as does etx?
