In this debate, we question whether one single {{standard of}} success can cover the complexity of assisted reproduction technology (ART). To emphasize the use of different parameters as standards of success, we calculated data from all IVF and ICSI cycles initiated at the Fertility Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark between 1999 and 2001. Several already established parameters were computed and, additionally, new suggestions for end-points were calculated. Three parameters were proposed as the best standards of success in ART: (i) number of oocytes per aspiration (8. 7); (ii) number of ongoing implantations per embryo transferred (20 %); and (iii) number of deliveries per embryo transferred (14 %). These parameters cover aspects of all steps in ART, i. e. the stimulation, laboratory and embryo transfer/outcome phase, also termed the <b>pre-in</b> vitro, in vitro and post-in vitro phase. We suggest that the ®nal description of an ART programme should be a balanced choice of the three standards of success proposed herein.

Validity was expressed as sensitivity and specificity, and reliability was expressed by the kappa statistic and overall agreement between self-reports and medical records for various subfertility categories. The sensitivity for subfertility attributed to tubal, male, hormonal, cervical, uterine, and idiopathic factors and for endometriosis was 84 %, 78 %, 65 %, 40 %, 46 %, 59 %, and 83 %, respectively. The corresponding kappas were 0. 79, 0. 71, 0. 38, 0. 34, 0. 13, 0. 50, and 0. 52, respectively. For 54 % of all women who reported two or more causes of subfertility, the medical record revealed only one major factor. Conversely, for 43 % of all women whose subfertility was attributed to two or more major factors in the record, only one factor was reported by the women. Older age {{at the time of}} filling out the questionnaire, low educational level, long duration of subfertility, and <b>pre-in</b> vitro fertilization treatment were associated with less accurate reporting. The results indicate that the validity of self-reports for tubal and male subfertility is satisfactory. For unexplained subfertility, the validity is moderate; for other causes of subfertility and when two causes of subfertility play a role, the validity is low.

Fuelled by the pressure to find agreements for closer cooperation of the Euro Member States, new measures like the Fiscal Compact, the Euro-Plus-Pact or Enhanced Cooperation for the financial transaction tax have been adopted only by subgroups of member states. In practice, the EU is therefore splitting into three groups - the Euro- 17, the <b>pre-ins</b> like Poland who are committing to joining the common currency and the permanent outsiders like the UK. As a result, the EU has already arrived at a 'core Europe' changing the governance, balance of power and cohesion in the EU.

This conversation must begin with the understanding that deeper integration, intended as a strategy for overcoming the European debt crisis, can only be achieved by means of differentiated integration. In this context, this research paper explores the overall impacts of differentiated integration on the EU to date and examines how its uses have affected EU structures during the European debt crisis.

Applying the principle of subsidiarity to the problem of power sharing between ECB and NCBs, the following suggestions for a revision of the institutional design are obtained: i) ECB should be assigned the task of coordinating regulation activities to avoid regulatory arbitrage, while prudential supervision should be managed jointly in a two-tier system by ECB and NCBs; the decision process pertaining the use of discount window and the Lending of Last Resort function should be centralized; ii) the rules pertaining the working of TARGET and EMS 2 should be changed in order to limit the risk of a financial crises imported from <b>pre-ins</b> countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Craniosynostosis is a {{developmental}} disorder characterised by the premature fusion of skull sutures in children, necessitating repetitive surgical interventions throughout infancy. A major goal of craniosynostosis {{research is to}} develop molecular adjunctive treatments to reduce the morbidity and complications associated with multiple craniofacial surgery. Recent progress in molecular biology has highlighted the regulatory effects of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) antagonists, including glypicans (GPC 1 and GPC 3), on suture morphogenesis and cellular functions. Moreover, the availability of genetically-engineered murine models of human craniosynostosis and drug-delivery systems (DDS) has assisted towards investigation of the glypican-based therapeutics in vivo. However, the conventional DDS are limited by their uncontrolled release patterns and undesired pharmacokinetics. The development of clinically viable implantable DDS, prior to human trials, require preclinical studies to investigate their characterisation, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and toxicity both in vitro and in vivo (in animal models). Medical Titanium (Ti) implants nanoengineered with Titania nanotubes (TNTs) have been recognised as a superior delivery platform in complex bone therapies (i. e. orthopaedics, cancer etc.) to localise the release of therapeutics in a controlled and sustained manner. This thesis presents the use of therapeutic-releasing TNT/Ti implant technology in a murine model, to address a key clinical challenge of delaying post-operative sutural bone growth in craniosynostosis. This interdisciplinary project has three aspects and specific aims including: (i) engineering and in vitro study: to fabricate and optimise TNT/Ti implants to study glypican release in vitro and bioactivity in murine C 2 C 12 cells, (ii) <b>pre-in</b> vivo cell study: to evaluate the biological response at TNT-cell interface of heterogeneous (human) suture mesenchymal cells (SMCs) and (iii) in vivo study: to assess in vivo implant biocompatibility and efficacy as a glypican delivery system in TNT/Ti implants with controllable nanotube dimensions were fabricated via electrochemical anodisation process, and their protein-releasing capability and protein functionality were tested spectrophotometrically in physiological buffer and transfected C 2 C 12 cells (BMP reporter cells), respectively. A metabolic activity assay was performed to investigate human SMC behavior at TNT-cell interface. The in vivo performance was assessed using micro- CT and histology in a surgical cranial defect model to verify TNT/Ti implant biocompatibility and glypican release efficiency. A protein loaded, mechanically robust TNT/Ti implant (120 ± 10 nm pore-diameter) displayed a biphasic in vitro release profile, with high loading efficiencies and prolonged release durations, spanning across 1 to 4 weeks. The pharmacokinetic modelling, based on the protein release parameters, showed an anomalous burst release and a zero-ordered sustained release. GPC 1 and GPC 3 released from TNTs were biologically active and reduced the BMP 2 -osteogenic activity in C 2 C 12 cells. A decrease in adhesion and proliferation of SMCs at the TNT-cell interface, rendered the implant nanotopography and surface chemistry suitable for craniosynostosis therapy. The murine studies confirmed the implant biocompatibility and reiterated the sustained delivery of glypicans in vivo, demonstrated by decreased bone volume and surface area in therapeutically-intervened cranial defects. These findings confirm {{the potential of the}} nanoengineered TNT/Ti implants as an effective glypican delivery system to delay rapid post-operative bone re-growth in a murine model. This approach may evolve into a non-surgical molecular adjunct to minimise the need for recurrent re-operations in human craniosynostosis management. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|STUDY QUESTION Does heparin ablate the {{advantageous}} {{effects of}} cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) modulators during <b>pre-in</b> vitro maturation (IVM) {{and have a}} deleterious effect in standard oocyte IVM? SUMMARY ANSWER Heparin interrupts energy metabolism and meiotic progression and adversely affects subsequent development of oocytes under conditions of elevated cAMP levels in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) after pre-IVM treatment with forskolin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY In animal IVM studies, artificial regulation of meiotic resumption by cAMP-elevating agents improves subsequent oocyte developmental competence. Heparin {{has no effect on}} spontaneous, FSH- or epidermal growth factor (EGF) -stimulated meiotic maturation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION An in vitro cross-sectional study was conducted using immature mouse and human COCs. Depending on individual experimental design, COCs were treated during pre-IVM with or without heparin, in {{the presence or absence of}} forskolin and/or 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), and then COC function was assessed by various means. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS Forty-two women with polycystic ovaries (PCOs) or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) donated COCs after oocyte retrieval in a non-hCG-triggered IVM cycle. COCs were collected in pre-IVM treatments and then cultured for 40 h and meiotic progression was assessed. COCs from 21 - to 24 -day-old female CBA F 1 mice were collected 46 h after stimulation with equine chorionic gonadotrophin. Following treatments, COCs were checked for meiotic progression. Effects on mouse oocyte metabolism were measured by assessing oocyte mitochondrial membrane potential using JC- 1 staining and oocyte ATP content. Post-IVM mouse oocyte developmental competence was assessed by in vitro fertilization and embryo production. Blastocyst quality was evaluated by differential staining of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) layers. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In the absence of heparin in pre-IVM culture, the addition of cAMP modulators did not affect human oocyte MII competence after 40 h. In standard IVM, heparin supplementation in pre-IVM did not affect MII competence; however, when heparin was combined with cAMP modulators, MII competence was significantly reduced from 65 to 15 % (P < 0. 05). In mouse experiments, heparin alone in pre-IVM significantly delayed germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) so that fewer GVBDs were observed at 0 and 1 h of IVM (P < 0. 05), but not by 2 or 3 h of IVM. Combined treatment with IBMX and forskolin in the pre-IVM medium produced a large delay in GVBD such that no COCs exhibited GVBD in the first 1 h of IVM, and the addition of heparin in pre-IVM further significantly delayed the progression of GVBD (P < 0. 05), in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 01). Combined IBMX and forskolin treatment of mouse COCs during pre-IVM significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in the oocyte at the end of pre-IVM (P < 0. 05), and significantly improved fertilization, embryo development and quality (P < 0. 05). However, heparin abolished the IBMX + forskolin-stimulated increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production (P < 0. 05), and adversely affected embryonic cleavage, development rates and embryo quality (P < 0. 05). This latter adverse combinational effect was negated when mouse COCs were collected in heparin and IBMX for 15 min, washed and then cultured for 45 min in IBMX and forskolin without heparin. LIMITATION, REASONS FOR CAUTION Experiments in mice found that heparin ablation of the advantageous effects of cAMP modulators during pre-IVM was associated with altered oocyte metabolism, but the mechanism by which heparin affects metabolism remains unclear. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study has revealed a novel and unexpected interaction between heparin and cAMP modulators in pre-IVM in immature mouse and human oocytes, and established a means to collect oocytes using heparin [...] .

Summary answer: Lengthening the duration of cAMP-modulated pre-IVM elevates intra-oocyte reduced glutathione (GSH) content and reduces hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) via increased cumulus cell-oocyte gap-junctional communication (GJC), associated with an improvement in subsequent embryo development and quality. What is known already: Oocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress and the oocyte’s most important antioxidant glutathione is supplied, at least in part, by cumulus cells. A temporary inhibition of spontaneous meiotic resumption in oocytes {{can be achieved by}} preventing a fall in cAMP, and cyclic AMP-modulated pre-IVM maintains cumulus-oocyte GJC and improves subsequent embryo development. Study design, size, duration: This study consisted of a series of 10 experiments using bovine oocytes in vitro, each with multiple replicates. Arange of pre-IVM durations were examined as the key study treatments which were compared with a control. The study was designed to examine if one of the oocyte’s major antioxidant defences can be enhanced by pre-IVM with cAMP modulators, and to examine the contribution of cumulus-oocyte GJC on these processes. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes were treated in vitro without (control) or with the cAMP modulators; 100 mM forskolin (FSK) and 500 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methyxanthine (IBMX), for 0, 2, 4 or 6 h (pre-IVM phase) prior to IVM. Oocyte developmental competence was assessed by embryo development and quality post-IVM/IVF. Cumulus-oocyte GJC, intra-oocyte GSH and H 2 O 2 were quantified at various time points during pre-IVM and IVM, in the presence and the absence of functional inhibitors: carbenoxolone (CBX) to block GJC and buthionine sulfoximide (BSO) to inhibit glutathione synthesis. Main results and the role of chance: Pre-IVM with FSK + IBMX increased subsequent blastocyst formation rate and quality compared with standard IVM (P, 0. 05), regardless of pre-IVM duration. The final blastocyst yields (proportion of blastocysts/immature oocyte) were 26. 3 % for the control, compared with 39. 2, 35. 2 and 34. 2 %, for the 2, 4 and 6 h pre-IVM FSK + IBMXtreatments, respectively. In contrast to standard IVM (control), pre-IVM with cAMP modulators maintained open gap junctions between cumulus cells and oocytes for the duration (6 h) of pre-IVM examined, and persisted for a further 8 h in the IVM phase. Cyclic AMP-modulated pre-IVM increased intra-oocyte GSH levels at the completion of both pre-IVM and IVM, in a pre-IVM duration-dependent manner (P, 0. 05), whichwas ablated when GJC was blocked usingCBX (P, 0. 05). By 4 h of pre-IVM treatment with cAMP modulators, oocyte H 2 O 2 levels were reduced compared the control (P, 0. 05), although this beneficial effect was lost when oocytes were co-treated with BSO. Inhibiting glutathione synthesis with BSO during pre-IVM ablated any positive benefits of cAMP-mediated pre-IVM on oocyte developmental competence (P, 0. 01). Limitations, reasons for caution: It is unclear if the improvement in oocyte antioxidant defence and developmental competence reported here is due to direct transfer of total and/or reduced glutathione from cumulus cells to the oocyte via gap junctions, or whether a GSH synthesis signal and/or amino acid substrates are supplied to the oocyte via gap junctions. Embryo transfer experiments are required to determine if the cAMP-mediated improvement in blastocyst rates leads to improved live birth rates. Wider implications of the findings: IVM offers significant benefits to infertile and cancer patients and has the potential to significantly alter ART practice, if IVM efficiency in embryo production could be improved closer to that of conventional IVF (using ovarian hyperstimulation). Pre-IVM with cAMP modulators is a simple and reliable means to improve IVM outcomes.
