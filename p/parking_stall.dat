Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored. Arnie tells the car, [...] "Show me." [...] Christine flips on its lights and restores itself to showroom quality, then, driving itself, seeks out the vandals. Moochie Wells (Malcolm Danare) is targeted first and crushed to death in an alley.

50|$|Canada's Worst Parking Lot: In {{the annual}} parking lot challenge, the seven contestants are given seven cars, and must park in {{whatever}} parking stalls are available. However, any moving violation (including hitting other cars, parking {{so that the}} car is not between the lines, or parking in no-parking zones) {{will result in the}} contestant penalized by being forced to drive {{out of the parking lot}} and take a penalty lap. As the challenge goes on, blocker cars (which include the Cool Bus) will also attempt to either serve as moving obstacles or park momentarily in one of the available stalls. As the challenge starts, Jason is the first to be penalized by inadvertently backing into Marnie out of the gate. Billie-Jean is the first to park (and is the only one to do so before any blockers appear), followed by Ed when Jason is forced to take a penalty lap when he hits a car while backing into a stall. When Ed is asked to take the role of a blocker, it allows Thomas to back into the stall he vacates, making him the third to park. Shelby (assisted by Billie-Jean and Nicola from outside the car) parks next, and he does so without taking penalty laps, while Jason finally finds a spot to parallel park. In the battle for the last spot, Marnie (having taken 9 penalty laps already, two from simultaneously parking in a no <b>parking</b> <b>stall</b> while one tire was over the line) is in the best position to take it, but is forced to take a penalty lap when she hits a barrel. Jennifer takes the spot, leaving Marnie out of luck.|$|E
5000|$|Canada's Worst Gas Station: In this musical chairs-like challenge, {{the seven}} drivers have to manage to find spaces in six pumps at a {{makeshift}} gas station with two entrances. At the start, three pumps are occupied and three are empty, {{with the three}} cars in occupied pumps serving as obstacles - one car (driven by Scott Marshall) will back into a <b>parking</b> <b>stall</b> before leaving, while the other two blocker cars will repeatedly leave and enter the same pump until their spaces are occupied. The seven cars are initially arranged in a line, with Karen and Henrietta on the outside, with Jodi and Michael next to them, while Sean has the initial disadvantage with his car in the center, with Shannon and Colin on either side. Despite the initial disadvantage, Sean finds an opening, beating Jodi and Shannon to one entrance. Karen, against her husband's advice to secure one unoccupied pump, manages to secure another one. Sean would fill the space that Allan had pointed out, while Henrietta secures the last vacant pump. Scott's departure allows Shannon to secure a pump, though in leaving Henrietta is forced to move her car slightly. Jodi could not beat a blocker car to the pump, although she manages to take the pump vacated by the other blocker car (despite some parking trouble). Colin was left the odd man out after allowing Jodi to take the spot at a pump that {{he had already been}} sitting in when he saw how much trouble she was having with the exercise. After numerous block attempts against Colin from the 3rd party drivers in the exercise, Michael finally managed to take the final spot.|$|E

40|$|In-vehicle {{rearview}} camera displays {{may soon}} be required in all new vehicles {{as a means of}} providing drivers with increased capability to monitor the area directly behind the rear bumper. The present work extends findings reported by Kim et al. (2012) by conducting more in-depth examinations of drivers ’ eye movements to rearview camera displays during backing. Drivers performed a series of backing maneuvers on a closed test course in a vehicle equipped with one of three rearview camera displays (in-mirror (IMD), small console (SD), or large console (LD)) or no display (ND). Drivers wore a head-mounted eye tracker, and eye movements were evaluated with particular focus on four areas-of-interest: the rearview camera display, the rearview mirror, and the two side mirrors. In the present paper, the proportion of time spent gazing at the rearview camera display was evaluated as a function of display location, the type of backing maneuver, and driver age. Gaze durations were longest for the IMD relative to the two console displays, for drivers 18 - 39 years old compared to older drivers, and when drivers backed into a <b>parking</b> <b>stall</b> between two parked cars relative to other types of backing maneuvers. The age and task factors operated independently of display location...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{problems}} could arise when drivers leave their parking stalls and merge {{into the main}} traffic stream. These {{problems could}} partly be attributed to finding acceptable gaps to merge into with safety and without causing undue difficulties to following vehicles. Observations {{from a variety of}} sites show different distributions of gap acceptance depending mainly upon the design and layout of parking stalls. Three chosen sites, including parallel parking and angle parking (both at 45 and 90 degrees) have been selected for this study. The surveys have been conducted using videoing techniques. The results show that the mean accepted gaps for angle parking are higher than that for parallel parking. The statistical tests indicate that there is {{no significant difference between the}} two types of angle parking. However, significant differences exist between them and those for parallel parking. This could be attributed to the type of manoeuvres associated with merging operations which are likely to involve backing-out (reversing) from the stalls in the case of angle parking. Some drivers experience difficulties with such manoeuvres which could lead into forced merging situations. This behaviour requires further investigation.

40|$|AVM and Low Speed Maneuvers: Human Factors Issues ProjectTwo {{evaluations}} {{were completed}} to characterize where, how often, and how accurately people normally park. A telephone survey of 30 drivers examined where people park most frequently {{and the problems}} drivers have parking. The focus was on executing maneuvers, not the availability of parking. Depending on how the question was asked, approximately 74 to 84 percent of the parking events involved perpendicular parking. Of the 8 parking-related crashes reported by subjects, 6 involved backing, usually with a vehicle traveling down an aisle or backing up from a <b>parking</b> <b>stall.</b> A field survey examined the parking accuracy of 102 vehicles in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a college town. For parallel parking, drivers parked about 4 in from the curb in spaces averaging 24 feet long. For angle parking, distances {{to the front of}} the space were bimodal, with some drivers parking about 10 inches from the end of the space and others overlapping by 10 in on average. Overall, drivers parked slightly to the right of center (by 1 inch for parallel parking and 4 inches for perpendicular parking) for 8. 5 feet wide spaces. Yaw angles were almost always less than 1 degree for perpendicular and angle parking, but as much as 3 degrees for parallel parking, which is a more difficult task. The data from this experiment provide both a basis for establishing the conditions for parking experiments and baseline data on how well people park without assistance...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{at several}} on-street parking areas showed that parking and imparking {{processes}} could produce severe traffic interruptions if parking locations were not designed properly. This study is {{aimed to develop}} an on-street parking simulation model to investigate traffic performances adjacent to on-street parking areas during parking operations. A microscopic simulation model has been developed to investigate those cases. The model was used to represent parking and imparking behaviours and its interactions with adjacent traffic. Four types of on-street parking layouts were included i. e. parallel with marking, parallel with no marking, angle 45 ° and angle 90 °. Site surveys have been conducted using video camcorder within the Greater Manchester area for model development, {{as well as for}} calibration and validation. Data extractions were carried out using video playbacks with personal computer. The simulation model was developed mainly based on car-following rules, gap acceptance rules and parking and unparking behaviour. Verification, calibration and validation of the simulation model have been conducted. The capability of simulation model to produce free flow and congested traffic has been examined. Parking and unparking operation have also been verified. Spot speed distributions have been used to calibrate and validate the parameters of vehicle movements and the effects of parking and unparking interactions. It can be concluded that the simulation model could mimic parking and unparking operations. For a case study of on- street parking simulations, four schemes of on-street parking designs and behaviours have been simulated sneli as (lie effects of <b>parking</b> <b>stall</b> geometric designs, different parking durations, different parking manoeuvres with different parking durations, and development of parking prohibition criteria. In general, it was shown that on-street parking operations would affect severely adjacent traffic flow when the level of traffic volume was high.

40|$|As an {{outgrowth}} of series of projects focused on mobility of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), an omnidirectional (ODV), multi-robot, autonomous mobile parking security system has been developed. The system has two types of robots: the low-profile Omni-Directional Inspection System (ODIS), {{which can be used}} for under-vehicle inspections, and the mid-sized T 4 robot, which serves as a “marsupial mothership ” for the ODIS vehicles and performs coarse resolution inspection. A key task for the T 4 robot is license plate recognition (LPR). For a successful LPR task without compromising the recognition rate, the robot must be able to identify the bumper locations of vehicles in the parking area and then precisely position the LPR camera relative to the bumper. This paper describes a 2 D-laser scanner based approach to bumper identification and laser servoing for the T 4 robot. The system uses a gimbal-mounted scanning laser. As the T 4 robot travels down a row of parking stalls, data is collected from the laser every 100 ms. For each <b>parking</b> <b>stall</b> in the range of the laser during the scan, the data is matched to a “bumper box ” corresponding to where a car bumper is expected, resulting in a point cloud of data corresponding to a vehicle bumper for each stall. Next, recursive line-fitting algorithms are used to determine a line for the data in each stall’s “bumper box. ” The fitting technique uses Hough based transforms, which are robust against segmentation problems and fast enough for real-time line fitting. Once a bumper line is fitted with an acceptable confidence, the bumper location is passed to the T 4 motion controller, which moves to position the LPR camera properly relative to the bumper. The paper includes examples and results that show the effectiveness of the technique, including its ability to work in real-time...|$|E
