5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E

5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> is invisible when facing them).|$|E
25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> On the south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over one door is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} drystone wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Exhibition Building is a two-storey, {{concrete}} block building, with steel framed windows with large <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> The main entrance {{is located at}} the corner of Gregory Terrace and Costin Street. The ground floor is a large, open space with concrete floors and concrete piers supporting the concrete floor above. The first floor has a two-storey volume space and numerous skylights. The building has a suspended ceiling which houses a ducted air-conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} {{effects are}} {{the work of}} Claude Engle, world-renowned engineer and theatrical lighting consultant, notable for his lighting schemes in The Louvre and the Reichstag. The colours slowly cycle through the colour spectrum, and come alive as sun sets. Every 15 minutes, the pods change to different colours: red, green, blue, purple, and orange. Also, a reflection from the inside with different lights illuminating the pods causes mirror images over <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> creating 6 more pods. The lighting is computer-controlled and uses simple PAR can spotlights and gels.|$|E

25|$|A {{new method}} of {{producing}} glass, {{known as the}} cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process {{was used by the}} Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.|$|E
25|$|The second batch {{units were}} built to operate outer-suburban trains on the Great Northern route from London King's Cross to Stevenage, Cambridge and Peterborough. Like {{the first batch}} units, they were {{delivered}} in BR Blue/Grey livery. The units replaced the slam-door Class 312 units, dating from 1975, which subsequently transferred to the Great Eastern Main Line and London-Tilbury-Southend routes. Like the DC class 455 units, several aspects of the exterior were modified, with metal hopper ventilators replaced with larger <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and the 'headcode indicator' flat front replaced with a rounded design.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of the Crystal Palace was {{a classic example of}} the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations- the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.|$|E

25|$|Lambert's book is {{fundamentally}} experimental. The forty experiments described in Photometria {{were conducted by}} Lambert between 1755 and 1760, after he decided to write a treatise on light measurement. His interest in acquiring experimental data spanned several fields: optics, thermometry, pyrometry, hydrometry, and magnetics. This interest in experimental data and its analysis, so evident in Photometria, is also present in other articles and books Lambert produced. For his optics work, extremely limited equipment sufficed: a few <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> convex and concave lenses, mirrors, prisms, paper and cardboard, pigments, candles {{and the means to}} measure distances and angles.|$|E
25|$|The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is {{a covered}} square at {{the centre of}} the British Museum {{designed}} by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners. The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company, with 1,656 uniquely shaped <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> At {{the centre of the}} Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the sale}} of the store to The May Department Stores Company, in 1995, the Wanamaker's name was removed from the store (first as Wanamaker-Hecht's) in favor of Hecht's, but the organ and its concerts were retained. During the local {{renaming}} of the Hecht's stores to Strawbridge's, the historic Wanamaker Store briefly took the name of its longtime rival Strawbridge's. The May Company began a complete restoration of the organ in 1997, as part of the store's final May Co. conversion into a Lord & Taylor. At that time the store area was reduced to three floors and additional <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> were put around the Grand Court on floors four and five, greatly enhancing the reverberation of the room.|$|E

25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
25|$|The Street family {{considered}} Harrison a skyscraper architect, so {{his decision}} to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone {{in the shape of}} an L, with a short stone wall extending {{from the back of the}} house, and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along the front of the house to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed. The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass porthole windows, and large <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and doors on the back of the house—it was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style, and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, one that did not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration.|$|E
