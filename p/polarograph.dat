40|$|A {{study of}} the Ni(II) -o-phenylenediamine prewave has shown that a {{pronounced}} double-layer effect is observed when measurements are made of <b>polarographs</b> obtained with various types and concentrations of supporting electrolytes. The effect on the prewave is qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions when the concentration of the electrolyte is not so high as to invalidate the assumptions employed in the theoretical treatment. The results of this investigation support {{the existence of a}} surface-controlled chemical reaction involving an adsorbed ligand and the nickel ion diffusing to the electrode. The conclusion by Tur'yan and Malyavinskaya that the chemical rate-limiting reaction involves the formation of an electroactive Ni(II) -o-phenylenediamine complex in the bulk of the solution well beyond the influence of the electrode double layer is therefore incorrect.

Early voltammetric techniques had many problems, limiting their viability for everyday use in analytical chemistry.

Another problem included the residual current obtained from the charging of the large capacitance of the electrode surface. When Heyrovsky first recorded the first dependence on the current flowing through the dropping mercury electrode on the applied potential in 1922, he took point-by-point measurements and he plotted a current-voltage curve.

40|$|The {{nomenclature}} of polarography is {{made clear}} by the diagram which shows a typical current-voltage curve or polarogram, as the automatically recorded photographic record is called. The growth and falling of the mercury drop {{gives rise to}} a condenser current (1) which causes the polarograms to [Diagram] exhibit a jagged appearance, often very marked. In all polarographic work it is the mean current which is measured. When a potential difference is applied across a solution, only a very slight residual current flows till the P. D. reaches a sufficiently high value to decompose one component. As the P. D. increases from the decomposition voltage, the current increases rapidly, till it reaches a constant value; the polarographic diffusion current. The <b>polarograph</b> records variations in current as the P. D. changes, for just one electrode. This is made possible by using a large unpolarisable electrode (usually anode) and a dropping mercury electrode (usually cathode). The latter is subject to concentration polarisation only, for the current flowing depends upon {{the rate at which the}} electro-oxidisable or electroreducible substance can diffuse to the mercury drop. To prevent this substance from undergoing a nett attraction or repulsion by electrostatic forces, a large amount of an indifferent electrolyte (supporting electrolyte) is added to make a homogeneous electrostatic field round the drop. This eliminates the migration current, leaving the current to be carried by the diffusion of ions alone. Generally the dropping mercury electrode is the cathode and the reducible substance is an ion, either cation or anion. The diffusion current is reached when the rate of discharge of ions equals the rate at which the ions diffuse to the surface of the mercury drop. This is the concentration polarisation of the cathode for the amount of current flowing is controlled by the rate at which ions reach the drop. [Diagram] A simple circuit of the <b>polarograph</b> is shown. The resistances R₂ and R₃ are of equal value, so that when the pointer P. is on the centre of R₄ no current flows through the cell. Moving P to the right puts an increasing negative potential on the dropping electrode.

Copper and zinc are two elements that add in infant food. Lead and cadmium are heavy metals that enter to food chain unavoidably. DPASV is a benefit and applicable method for measurement of trace elements in food products. In this study, concentration of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in four brands of baby food (rice and wheat based) and powder milk was analyzed with DPASV and <b>polarograph</b> set. Total Mean ± SE of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in baby foods (n = 240) were 11. 86 ± 1. 474 mg/ 100 g, 508. 197 ± 83. 154 µg/ 100 g, 0. 445 ± 0. 006, 0. 050 ± 0. 005 mg/Kg respectively. Also these amount in powder milk (n = 240) were 3. 621 ± 0. 529 mg/ 100 g, 403. 822 ± 133. 953 µg/ 100 g, 0. 007 ± 0. 003, 0. 060 ± 0. 040 mg/Kg respectively. Zinc level in baby food type I was higher than lablled value (P = 0. 030), but in other brands was not difference. Concentration of copper in all of samples was in labeled range (P> 0. 05). In each four products, level of lead and cadmium were lower than the standard limit (P < 0. 05). Amount of zinc and lead in baby food I, had difference versus other products. Concentratio...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{electrochemistry}} of the lithium-potassium-sodium carbonate-borate melt was {{explored by}} voltammetry and chrono-amperometry. In support of this, a controlled-potential <b>polarograph</b> and associated hardware was constructed. Several {{different types of}} reference electrodes were tried before choosing a porcelain membrane electrode containing a silver wire immersed in a silver sulfate melt. The special porcelain compounded was used also to construct a planar gold disk electrode. The theory of stationary electrode polarography was summarized and denormalized to provide an overall view. A new approach {{to the theory of}} the cyclic background current was also advanced. A computer program was written to facilitate data processing. In addition to providing peak potentials, currents, and n-values, the program also resolves overlapping peaks and furnishes plots of both processed and unprocessed data. Rapid-scan voltammetry was employed to explore the electro- chemical behavior of Zn, Co, Fe, Tl, Sb, As, Ni, Sn, Cd, Te, Bi, Cr, Pb, Cu, and U in the carbonate-borate melt. Most substances gave reasonably well-defined peaks with characteristic peak potentials and n-values. Metal deposition was commonly accompanied by adsorption prepeaks indicative of strong adsorption, and there was also evidence of a preceding chemical reaction for several elements, suggesting decomplexation before reduction. Chromium exhibited behavior indicative of a succeeding irreversible chemical reaction. Diffusion coefficients for copper and chromium were determined by chrono-amperometry. For Cu(II) to Cu(O), D = 1. 94 ±. 37 x 10 ⁻⁶ cm²/sec, while for Cr(VI) to Cr(III), D = 2. 14 ±. 42 x 10 ⁻⁶ cm²/sec...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{metallothionein}} (Cu-MT) was {{extracted from}} the induced biomass of Aspergillus niger. The crude extract (FI), obtained by cell homogenization, was partially purified by heat treatment (FII) and ultrafiltration (FIII). Further purification of the Cu-MT extract by affinity chromatography resulted in three major fractions, FIVa, FIVb and FIVc, of which fraction FIVc {{was considered to be}} the Cu-MT extract fraction. Fraction FIVc was re-chromatography on affinity chromatography and the eluted fraction showed a single peak (FIVc'). Spectrophotometric analysis of fraction FIVc' demonstrated a maximum absorption peak at 268 nm. Native and denatured electrophoretic analysis of fraction FIVc ' showed the presence of a single band with an estimated molecular weight of 9. 5 and 10. 0 kDa, respectively. Inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase (PPO) by the Cu-MT extracts was investigated, using selected phenolic substrates, including catechin, chlorogenic acid, catechol, 4 -methylcatechol, caffeic acid, L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, p- and m-cresol. The results showed that the inhibitory effect of the Cu-MT extract increased with the degree of purification. The results revealed that the Cu-MT extracts were effective inhibitors of PPO activity and the best inhibitory effect was demonstrated with catechin as substrate; however, PPO activity was not inhibited by the Cu-MT extract when p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and p- and m-cresol were used as substrates. The results also showed that the Cu-MT extracts exhibited different types of inhibition, including mixed, competitive and uncompetitive on PPO activity. In addition, the experimental findings indicated that the nature and degree of enzymatic inhibitions by the Cu-MT extracts were dependent upon the structural nature of the substrates as well as the methods including, spectrophotometer and <b>polarograph,</b> used for the detection of enzym...|$|E
