5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked <b>psychoanalysis</b> with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of <b>Psychoanalysis</b> and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Between 1922 and 1932 {{the clinic}} offered free or reduced-cost <b>psychoanalysis</b> to 1,445 men and 800 women, many {{suffering}} from shell shock after World War I. It {{was the second}} such clinic to open under Freud's direction; {{the first was the}} Poliklinik in Berlin, set up in 1920 by Max Eitingon and Ernst Simmel.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} the {{development}} of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of <b>psychoanalysis.</b> Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{published}} what Robert Corrington {{called his}} masterpiece, Charakteranalyse: Technik und Grundlagen für studierende und praktizierende Analytiker, in 1933. It was revised {{and published in}} English in 1946 and 1949 as Character Analysis. The book sought to move <b>psychoanalysis</b> toward a reconfiguration of character structure.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist <b>psychoanalysis</b> and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and <b>psychoanalysis</b> this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if she and her father were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Many of Wagner's concepts, {{including}} his speculation about dreams, predated their investigation by Sigmund Freud. Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud {{was born in}} terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety. Georg Groddeck considered the Ring as the first manual of <b>psychoanalysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|She grew {{close to}} Strasberg {{and his wife}} Paula, {{receiving}} private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became like a family member. She dismissed her old drama coach, Natasha Lytess, and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence {{for the rest of}} her career. Monroe also started undergoing <b>psychoanalysis</b> at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on <b>psychoanalysis.</b> Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational <b>psychoanalysis</b> and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, <b>psychoanalysis</b> and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and <b>psychoanalysis</b> at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that <b>psychoanalysis</b> posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} <b>psychoanalysis</b> the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly cold room she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis {{and his love}} of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions of this book, and similar application of <b>psychoanalysis</b> {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was <b>psychoanalysis.</b> Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Feminist cinema, advocating or {{illustrating}} feminist perspectives, arose largely {{with the}} development of feminist film theory in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and <b>psychoanalysis</b> fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this <b>psychoanalysis,</b> was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and <b>psychoanalysis</b> under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and <b>psychoanalysis.</b> The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian <b>psychoanalysis,</b> that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E

25|$|The {{legacy of}} <b>psychoanalysis</b> {{in art history}} has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The {{prominent}} feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon <b>psychoanalysis</b> both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With Griselda Pollock's reading of French feminist <b>psychoanalysis</b> {{and in particular the}} writings of Julia Kristeva and Bracha L. Ettinger, as with Rosalind Krauss readings of Jacques Lacan and Jean-François Lyotard and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, Feminist theory written in the fields of French feminism and <b>Psychoanalysis</b> has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.|$|E
25|$|Bond {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} person with autism – {{specifically}} Asperger's Syndrome. He has had both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and <b>psychoanalysis</b> for this condition.

25|$|Largely through Jones' {{energetic}} advocacy, the British Medical Association officially recognised <b>psychoanalysis</b> in 1929.

25|$|In 1947, he {{was awarded}} a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, {{and at that time}} Ellis had come to believe that <b>psychoanalysis</b> was the deepest and most {{effective}} form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of Sigmund Freud. He sought additional training in <b>psychoanalysis</b> and then began to practice classical <b>psychoanalysis.</b> Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with Richard Hulbeck, a leading analyst at the Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been Hermann Rorschach, the developer of the Rorschach inkblot test). At that time he taught at New York University, Rutgers University, and Pittsburg State University and held a couple of leading staff positions. At this time, Ellis' faith in <b>psychoanalysis</b> was gradually crumbling.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the use of}} posthumous {{material}} to perform <b>psychoanalysis</b> is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted.
