The results obtained were as follows : 1) In rabbits with mild lesions of the hematopoietic "function (leukocytopenia, showing a reduction. rate of leukocyte count within 67 % as compared with normal), the response to these hormones was followed with recovery of the function, increasing granulocytes in the marrows and in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pictures,</b> similar to that of normal rabbits. On the other hand, in the group receiving more intense marrow disorder (leukocytopenia, showing a reduction rate of leukocyte count over 80 % as compared with normal), the red and white blood cell counts decreased consistently after reinjection of these hormones. By simultaneous administration of the hormones with these agents, on the other hand, the development of the hematopoietic disorders of the rabbits, following the application of the marrow depressants, was inhibited remarkably. 2) In rabbits, having bone marrow hyperfunction caused by inflammatory stimulant injections (tur-pentine oil), transient hematopoiesis of a higher degree was noted following hormone treatment, {{as in the case of}} normal rabbits.

40|$|After {{inducing}} {{lymphocytic leukemia}} by painting {{the skin of}} the mice of dba strain and other group of uncertain origin with 20 -methylcholanthrene, the author carried out tissuc cultures of bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen of these test animals and also cytological and histological examinations for purpose of clarifying the origin and development of lymphocytic leukemia. On the basis of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pictures,</b> the author classified the development of lymphocytic leukemia into the following three stages, i. e., (1) preleukemic stage (with leucopenia but no lymphoblasts in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood),</b> (2) initial stage of leukemia (with slight leucocytosis and a few lymphoblasts in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood),</b> and (3) advanced stage of leukemia (with marked leucocytosis and many lymphoblasts in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood).</b> The following are the results and conclusions of the present experiment. (1) The changes in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pictures</b> observed during the preleukemic stage as described in Part I, that is, leucopenia and lymphopenia, are caused by the arrest of maturation in lymph follicles of the spleen and by hypoplasia of lymph nodes. Eosinophilia can be observed in bone marrow of every single case and the stimulation of the reticuloendothelial system is believed to be one of its causes. Lymphoblasts of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> during the initial stage of leukemia are mainly derived from the spleen. The distribution curve of the greatest diameters of lymphocytes in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> gradually shifts to the right as lymphocytic leukemia develops. This phenomenon coincides with the increase in large lymphocytes during the preleukemic stage and with the appearance of lymphoblasts during the initial stage of leukemia. (2) In tissue cultures, the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes of leukemic mice show the growth patterns specific to acute lymphocytic leukemia, though these ars not so typical in mice as in men. Namely, the margin of growth zone is sharply defined, the density of cells is very high, and the growth zone is consisted mainly of lymphoblasts with some mature lymphocytes. In the preleukemic stage, the spleen shows relatively leukemic growth pattern, but the lymph nodes show hypoplasia or slight hyperplasia, In the initial stage of leukemia, the spleen shows the leukemic growth pattern, but the lymph nodes and thymus show hyperplasia or leukemic growth pattern. In the advanced stage of leukemia, the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and the bone marrow begin to show the leukemic growth pattern. (3) Cytomorphologically, leukemic cells appear first of all in the lymph follicles of the spleen, and they increase in the lymph nodes and bone marrow along with progress of leukemia. The lymphoblats in the lymph nodes during the preleukemic and initial stages of leukemia are little atypical, but they show prominent nucleoli and lobulation of the nucleus in the advanced stage and also mitochondria increase in number. The distribution curve of the greatest diameters of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes shifts gradually to the right through the development of lymphocytic leukemia {{as in the case of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood.</b> (4) In autopsy findings, there can be observed a slight enlargement of spleen in the preleukemic stage, moderately enlarged spleen and slightly enlarged lymph nodes in the initial stage, and marked enlargement of spleen, lymph nodes, and liver in the advanced stage. (5) Histologically, the lymph follicles of spleen are enlarged due to the proliferation of reticulum cells and lymphoblasts in the preleukemic stage. Lymph nodes show hypoplasia or slight hyperplasia. Namely, lymphocytic leukemia can be understood to be circumscribed to the spleen in this stage. In the initial stage, lymphoblasts infiltrate diffusely through the whole spleen and lymph nodes show hyperplasia or gradual enlargement of germinal centers due to the proliferation of lymphoblasts with the formation of lymph follicles. In the bone marrow, diffuse infiltration of leukemic cells can be observed. In the advanced stage, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus become totally leukemic, and leukemic cells metastasize to various other organs including bone marrow, liver, and kidneys through the hematogenous and lymphogenous channels. (6) Leukemia sets in about the time when papilloma appears on the skin, and by the time when papilloma begins to be transformed into skin cancer most of the mice with lymphocytic leukemia die. The mice with skin carcinoma show myelogenous leukemoid reaction, and some of them reveal the complication of reticulosis or reticulosarcomatosis...|$|R
40|$|Lymphography {{has been}} {{performed}} in 46 patients with leukemia {{and the common}} distinctive features are evaluated. There is a general increase in the size and number of the lymph node. Their outline is well-defined and saucer-shaped and their internal pattern is coarsely dotted. Lymphographically, {{there is no significant}} difference between myeloid leukemia and lymphatic leukemia. Sometimes, the lymph nodes in chronic lymphatic leukemia are gigantic and the internal basophilic is frothy (ecumeux) or fantomatique. The internal pattern of the lymph nodes in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia presents a similar finding and that in monocytic leukemia, basophilic leukemia and erythroleukemia is not specific. Although there is no pathognomonic finding for each form of leukemia, the leukemic patterns are certainly different from those of normal, inflammatory or metastatic lymph nodes. Lymphography also is useful for the detection of leukemic involvement of the deep-seated lymph nodes, and allows sequential observations or their size changes following therapy. The side effects of lymphography include a transiert fever and pulmonary embolism, but serious untoward reactions are rare. The author experienced 3 patients with clinical signs compatible with pulmonary embolism and 17 cases of fever among 76 cases examined.

In chronic glomerulonephritis there was the intermediate pattern of the two. From the results obtained, it is most likely that renal anemia results from the deleterious effects upon bone marrow hematopoiesis, particularly upon erythropoiesis of the noxious substances present in azotemia.

40|$|The {{association}} of anemia with pregnancy is well recognized. In this country the anemia is commonly due to iron deficiencies and is hypochromic. In the tropics a macrocytic, hyperchromic anemia of pregnancy has attracted attention {{and has been}} the subject of many recent investigations. Its counterpart in the temperate climates, the macrocytic or so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy, has been considered a relatively rare dyscrasia. ', The macrocytic anemia of pregnancy was first recognized over a century ago when Channing 2 reported ten fatal cases. In 1919 Osler 7 differentiated the so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy from typical Addisonian anemia by pointing out that when recovery from the former disease took place it was permanent and the woman might escape it in subsequent pregnancies. In macrocytic anemia of pregnancy the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> may vgry from one identical with that of true pernicous anemia to one lacking all characteristic features of this anemia. 1 13 On the other hand, examination of the bone marrow reveals pictures identical with those found in true Addisonian pernicious anemia and clearly indicates that macrocytic anemia of pregnancy has for its immediate cause arrested maturation of the megaloblasts. The two features which may be relied upon for the certain diagnosis of macrocytic anemia of pregnancy are the appearance of megaloblasts in the peripheral blood and the finding of a megaloblastic change in the bone marrow. 1 If the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> is not diagnostic, bone marrow biopsy by means of sternal puncture is necessary or some cases will be missed.

The major factor for determining blood lead levels in this group was their habit of sniffing gasoline. An increased frequency of neurological symptoms and signs were detected in this group which besides lead poisoning could be attributed to direct CNS effects of gasoline, glue, and alcohol; habits attained by street children Children residing in industrial areas differed considerably in their blood lead levels but most (76 %) were in the mild to moderate range. 16 % had safe levels and 8 % had severe elevation of lead. The determining factor for increased blood lead in this group was the habit of pica. The same was true for the control group, the majority of whom (48. 2 %) had safe blood lead levels. There were positive associations with the increase in blood lead level. Constipation, pallor, abnormal behaviour, hearing problems, abnormal gait, and hyperreflexia were features of increased lead.

As the result the following conclusions were drawn. 1. After one whole body irradiation of 350 r on the RF strain of mice, leukemia developed in 77. 3 % of them. Out of them 75. 4 % proved to be lymphocytic leukemia while 1. 8 % myelogenous leukemia. In the former group some were of the thymoma type that presented swelling of the thymus and the others of the non-thymoma type without such swelling of the thymus. 2. After the X-irradiation, these mice showed hypoplasia of hematopoietic organs, which was followed by reactive proliferation, and in those of the thymoma type leukemic changes originated in the thymus whereas in those of the non-thymoma type the changes commenced in the spleen or in lymph node. 3. One month {{before the onset of}} leukemia, that is, in the so-called preleukemic stage, there could be observed a decrease in the leukocyte counts and an increase in the eosinophil counts, and in addition, the splean, lymph nodes or thymus showed such findings what might be histologically considered as leukemia, but by the clinical tissue cultures the findings rather suggested that it was in the stage showing hypoplasia. From these findings it has been concluded that leukemia induced by X-ray irradiation originates in the thymus in the case of lymphocytic leukemia of the thymoma type, while in the case of lympocytic leukemia of the non-thymoma type leukemia makes its appearance first in the spleen or in lymph nodes after passing a hypoplastic stage...|$|R

The mode of development of the lymphocytic leukemia was serially studied. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pictures</b> showed in the pre-leukemie stage a normochromic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and reticulocytopenia; in the early leukemic stage, a slight leukocytosis with a few lymphoblasts; and in the progessive leukemiç stage, a hyperchromatic or normochomic anemia, anisocytosis, polychromasia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis with many lymphoblasts. The imprint preparations disclosed an increase of lymphocytes in the lymphnodes and thymus in the pre-leukemic stage. In the early to progessive leukemic stage, there was a marked increase of lymphoblasts in the lymphnodes, spleen and thymus. In the bone-marrow, increare of lymphocytes and lymphoblasts were noted {{in the early to}} progessive leukemic stage. Histological examination revealed a hypertrophie of the lymphfollicles and an increase of lymphoblasts in the spleen and lymphnodes in the initial leukemic stage of the non-thymic type leukemia. In the thymic type leukemia, a similar increase of lymphoblasts occarred in the thymus. In the early to progessive leukemic stage, an infiltration of lymphoblasts was seen in the spleen, lymphnodes, thymus and bone-marrow. In the liver, the infiltration was pronounced in the peripotal and perivascular spaces. Tissue culture studies indicated a hypoplasia of the lymphnodes and thymus in the preleukemic stage. However, in the early leukemic stage, an acute leukemic growth pattern was exhibited by the spleen and lymphnodes in the non-thymic type while the thymus of the thymic type showed the same pattern. In the progressive leukemic stage, the spleen, lymphnodes, thymus and bone-marrow presented a culture pattern of acute leukemia. The incidence of lymphocytic leukemia in splenectomiged RF mice painted with 20 -Methylcholanthrene was 42. 8 %, and that of thymectomiged RF mice with a similar treatment was 18. 2 %. From these finding, it is suggested that in RF mice painted with 20 MC the spleen, lymphnodes and thymus are the target organs which first manifest injurious effects and become hypoplastic {{and in the course of}} repair and regenerative process, hyperplastic changes untimately result in the leukemic proliferation in these organs...|$|R
40|$|For the elucidation of leukemogenesis of mouse leukemia {{induced by}} X-ray, a study {{was carried out}} on various factors {{influencing}} the development of leukemia.

Also a comparative study was made of the types of mouse leukemia elicited by X-ray. The results of the study are stated as follows. 1. In mice of the RF strain given one whole body X-irradiation of 350 r, and in both C(57) BL and C(3) Hf mice given four who 1 e body irradiations of 160 r each at the interval of 4 days to the total dosage of 600 r, the rate of leukemia induction was 77. 3 %, 88 %, and 20 % in the respective groups. 2. It has been demonstrated that the rate of leukemia induction was highest in mice of the RF strain 30 - 40 days old, and this rate decreased along with advancement in the age (several months old) of the mice. 3. As for the rate of leukemia induction in mice of the RF strain 30 - 40 days old, that received one whole body X-irradiation of 350 r, 22 (78. 5 %) out of 28 male mice developed leukemia while 19 (73. 0 %) out of 26 female mice, developed leukemia, showing no significant difference in sex. 4. It has been found that the rate of leukemia induction in the RF strain mice of 30 - 40 days old after one whole body X-irradiation increases with the dose of the irradiation, reaching its maximum at the dose of 350 r, but with the dose of 450 r the rate of leukemia induction rather decreases. 5. Of lymphocytic leukemia induced in the RF strain mice by X-irradiation, there were two types, that is, thymoma type and non-thymoma type, and there could be observed distinct differences in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pictures</b> {{as well as in the}} patterns of cell infiltration into the liver between these two types. In addition, some of these lymphocytic leukemic mice presented a neutrophilic leukemoid reaction. There was only one mouse that developed myelogenous leukemia...|$|R

In the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> a transient decrease is brought about in the erythrocyte count and hemoglobin content, {{and it seems to}} present the so-called 'splenic anemia'. 2. An increase in the percentage of the erythroblast series can be observed in bone marrow. 3. The respiration of bone marrow is transiently accelerated, but changes in aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis show no fixed tendency. 4. By ligating splenic and coronary veins of the stomach it is possible to induce a transient congestion in the spleen, but the anemia observable 2 - 3 weeks after the operation seems to be caused by the blood cell arrest or the disturbance in the discharge of erythrocytes in bone marrow...|$|E
40|$|After the {{abdominal}} sympathectomy of splenic branches in nomal rabbits, the auther studied {{the blood and}} bone marrow pictures and iron metaborism, and obtained the following results. 1) In the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> a transient decrease in the erythrocyte count, hemoglobin content and platelet count could be observed. 2) In the bone marrow picture an increase and inhibition of maturation in the erythroid system could be observed. 3) Serum iron decreased conspicuously. However, the depot iron was as usual or increased a little. 4) In the bone marrow picture a little decrease in Sideroblast could be observed. 5) In the serum and spleen extracts, the existence of anemia producing toxic factor could not be observed. 6) From these observation, the author concluded that the principal cause of this anemia produced by ligating splenic and coronary Veins of the stomach lay in the inhibition on the mobilization of depot iron...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that females are more immunocompetent than males as evidenced by higher humoral antibody titers, lowered susceptibility to infection, and more efficient graft rejection. Furthermore, females also exhibit a much higher incidence of autoimmune disease. These observations have led investigators {{to believe that the}} male hormonal environment may {{play a key role in}} the regulation of immune response. For this reason, this study is concerned with the expression of autoimmunity and of immune function in the mouse. This study included the New Zealand Black (NZB) mouse strain, as an animal model for human SLE, as well as normal DBA/ 2 and Balb/c strains. Animals were administered testosterone via subcutaneous implants in silastic tubing or by injection. Mice used were intact females, intact males and castrated males. Animals were otherwise untreated or had been exposed to a sublethal dose (400 - 550 rads) of irradiation.

40|$|Mononuclear {{cells in}} pleural fluid from {{patients}} with tuberculous pleurisy were predominantly T cells. Responsiveness of pleural fluid T cells to {{purified protein derivative}} of tuberculin were studied by the assay of cell proliferation and production of lymphocyte mitogenic factor by the stimulation with purified protein derivative. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes were also studied from patients and tuberculin-positive healthy controls. The order of responsiveness was as follows: pleural fluid lymphocytes greater than <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes of patients without effusion = <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes of healthy controls greater than <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes of patients with effusion. The poor response of <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes from pleurisy patients were recovered by the elimination of adherent cells in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes {{to the level of}} the response of <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> lymphocytes from healthy controls.

40|$|The authors {{report the}} clinical, {{pathological}} and immunological {{features of a}} case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma presenting with protein-losing enteropathy. There was extensive multifocal involvement of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The mediastinum was not enlarged; the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> and bilateral bone marrow trephine biopsies were unremarkable. The tumor cells were positive for terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, CD 3, CD 2, CD 7 and CD 10; they were negative for CD 1, CD 5, CD 4, CD 8 and HLA-DR. The immunophenotype was that of an immature thymic T-cell. Monocytic and B-cell markers were negative. Despite initial dose reduction in chemotherapy, the patient still developed massive intestinal hemorrhage and succumbed 2 wks after treatment. Postmortem examination confirmed absence of thymic involvement. The overall picture strongly suggests a primary intestinal origin of this T-lymphoblastic lymphoma which contradicts {{the conventional wisdom that}} T-lymphoblastic lymphoma arises in the thymus from primitive cortical lymphocytes before rapidly disseminating. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|SINGLE {{episodes of}} acute {{agranulocytosis}} caused by drugs, poisons, roentgen-ray or ionizing radiation are common, and their pathology and clinical course are well known. Transient neutropenia occurs following many infectious diseases, and chronic neutropenia {{is present in}} cases of bone marrow hypoplasia {{as well as in}} conditions associated with infiltration of the bone marrow. Since the concept of hypersplenism was first advanced by Wiseman and Doan, 1 a variety of clinical syndromes has been described in which either acute or chronic neutropenia or a combination of both phases occurs as a selective entity or as part of a pancytopenia affecting all elements produced in the bone marrow. True spontaneous agranulocytosis occurring in cycles has rarely been de-scribed. The reported cases are characterized by episodes of partial or complete disappearance of neutrophil cells from the blood at regular intervals of about three weeks. Fever, oral ulcerations, abdominal pain and varying degrees of prostration have closely paralleled cyclic fluctuations in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture...</b>|$|E
40|$|Myelofibrosis is {{a chronic}} {{myeloproliferative}} disorder characterised by splenomegaly, leukoerythroblastic anaemia, tear-drop poikilocytosis and marrow fibrosis. Splenectomy is indicated for patients requiring frequent transfusions or massive splenomegaly causing distressing symptoms and severe thrombocytopenia secondary to hypersplenism. A 56 year-old lady diagnosed to have primary myelofibrosis in year 2000 {{was referred to}} HUKM for further management of her increasing requirement of blood transfusion and massive splenomegaly. She has had two episodes of acute cholecytitis. Investigations done in our hospital showed that her hemoglobin level was 6. 4 g/dl, white cell count of 23. 4 x 109 /l, platelet count 163 x 109 /l and peripheral blood showing leukoerythroblastic picture and tear-drop poikilocytosis. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score (NAP) was 184 / 100 neutrophils. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed massive splenomegaly with multiple gall stones. In view of the frequent transfusion requirements and symptomatic massive splenomegaly, splenectomy and cholecystectomy was performed. A review of her <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture,</b> post-splenectomy, showed marked reduction of the tear-drop poikilocytosis and leukoerythroblastosis.

40|$|By intraperitoneally injecting {{to normal}} guinea pigs the {{antiserum}} of bone marrow {{obtained from the}} normal rabbits to which the intraperitoneal injection of the guinea-pig bone marrow had been previously given, the author studied {{the changes in the}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> and bone-marrow <b>pictures</b> in these guinea pigs; and arrived at the following conclusions: 1. By the intraperitoneal injection of bone-marrow anti-serum a transient hyperchromic anemia can be recognized in the test guinea pigs. Namely, the number of erythrocytes and the hemoglobin (Hb) content are decreased, and anisocytosis, erythroblasts, polychromatic erythrocytes, and the erythrocytes possessing basophilic spots are recognized. Reticulocytes have been found to have increased in some of the test animals. 2. The number of leucocytes fluctuates with the injection of the anti-serum of bone marrow, and in the relatively greater number of animals leucocytes tend to decrease at first and later increase. In the leucocyte percentage, a decrease in pseudoeosinophils, and an increase in lymphocytes can be observed in most of animals, and also eosinophils increase in number. Besides these, the appearance cf young granulocytes such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes as well as the regressive degeneration of various leucocyte cells can be recognized. 3. Platelets are decreased in number in all cases with the injection of bone-marrow anti-serum. 4. As for the bone-marrow picture in the majority of the test guinea pigs the interferance with the production of erythroblasts can be observed, and in some of the test animals the impairment of maturation of erythroblasts and {{in another part of the}} test animals the left shift of nuclei in pseudo-eosinophils can be seen. 5. Judging from the relatively slight effect of the normal rabbit serum on the <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> and bone marrow of guinea pigs, it is assumed that the anemia inducing action of the bone-marrow anti-serum is specific...|$|R
