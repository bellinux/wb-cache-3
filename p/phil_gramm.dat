5|$|In October 1987, {{encouraged}} by Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> of Texas, McEwen {{announced he would}} challenge Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat, in his 1988 bid for re-election, but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich. He {{dropped out of the}} race in December. McEwen's name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio's other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2008, Kemp {{endorsed}} McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries {{shortly before}} the New Hampshire primary, which surprised conservative Republican tax cutters. However, as McCain neared the official nomination, the press associated McCain with Kemp more and more. Kemp prepared {{an open letter to}} Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCain's behalf to quell their dissatisfactions. In addition, Kemp and <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> advised McCain on economic policy.|$|E
5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> proposed the flat tax.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Roth, {{he has had}} numerous political allies. At times, he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and tax cuts, collaborated with McCain and <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> on tax cuts and spending restraints, legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman, and fought poverty with James Pinkerton. Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally. After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet, Kemp remained close to Gingrich, Lott, Weber, and Mack. Kemp {{was a member of}} the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. As a progressive voter, he had civil rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks, Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. Loury and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends. He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III, Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia. Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp. During the Reagan presidency, when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting, a leading United States Senate tax-cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley, a former basketball star. Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress: Steve Largent, J. C. Watts, and Heath Shuler.|$|E

25|$|Boll weevils was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} political epithet by Democratic Party leaders, implying that the boll weevils were unreliable on key votes or not team players. Most of the boll weevils eventually retired from office, {{or in the case}} of some such as Senators <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> and Richard Shelby, switched parties and joined the Republicans. Since 1988 the term boll weevils has fallen out of favor.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that Pawlenty would be serving in a lead role for McCain as a national co-chair of his presidential exploratory committee which led to Pawlenty's becoming co-chairman of McCain's campaign (along with <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> and Tom Loeffler). In January 2008, a reporter for the Minneapolis Star Tribune suggested Pawlenty's renewed focus on his proposed immigration reform plans might be politically motivated as counterbalance to McCain's less favorable guest worker program.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1990, Atwater {{suffered}} a seizure during a fundraising breakfast for Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> Doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, {{in his right}} parietal lobe. He underwent interstitial implant radiation – then a new treatment – at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, followed by conventional radiation therapy at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. The treatment left him paralyzed on his left side, robbed him of his tone discrimination, and swelled his face and body.|$|E
25|$|Barton {{made his}} first run for elected office in 1984, {{when he entered the}} Republican primary for Texas's 6th congressional {{district}} after three-term incumbent <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> left his seat to run for the United States Senate that year. He finished first in the five-candidate field with 42% and very narrowly defeated Max Hoyt in the runoff with 50%. He then defeated Democratic nominee and former State Representative Dan Kubiak 57%–43%. Barton was one of six freshmen Republican U.S. congressmen elected from Texas in 1984 known as the Texas Six Pack.|$|E
25|$|In the 2002 U.S. Senate Primary in Texas, Cornyn was the {{candidate}} promoted {{and supported by}} the Texas Republican Party. He easily defeated the five other candidates in the Republican Primary while disdaining the opportunity to debate the other candidates. Cornyn defeated his closest Republican challenger, Bruce Rusty Lang, a self-financed Dallas-based international physician, in the Republican Primary election by a ten to one electoral margin. In the 2002 General election, Cornyn defeated Democrat Ron Kirk in a campaign that cost each candidate over $18 million. Cornyn's predecessor, <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm,</b> resigned early, effective November 30, 2002, so that Senator-Elect Cornyn could take office early, and move into Gramm's office suite in order to begin organizing his staff. Cornyn did not, however, gain seniority, owing to a 1980 Rules Committee policy that no longer gave seniority to senators who entered Congress early for the purpose of gaining advantageous office space.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of the committee's findings, McCain {{said that he and}} Kerry had convinced the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, and that he had spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans. [...] McCain's push for normalization was opposed by some leading Senate Republicans, including <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. [...] In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam. [...] McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement gave Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{proposed}} term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four {{terms in}} the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order {{to run for the}} U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that [...] "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests {{the power of the state}} to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic." [...] Paul lost the Republican primary to <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm,</b> who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr.|$|E
500|$|McCain became {{chairman}} of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995, and would hold that position into 1997. [...] McCain's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg's well-received The Nightingale's Song, a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military in American life. [...] At {{the start of the}} 1996 presidential election, McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> [...] After Gramm dropped out, McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks. [...] McCain formed a close bond with Dole, based in part on their shared near-death war experiences; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{was head}} of the local chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas during his time at Baylor University. In 1984, Paul took a {{semester}} off to aid his father's primary challenge to Republican Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm.</b> While attending Duke University School of Medicine, Paul volunteered for his father's 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign. In response to President Bush breaking his election promise to not , Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991. In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception. He has often cited his involvement with KTU as the foundation of his involvement with state politics. Described as [...] "ideological and conservative" [...] by the Lexington Herald-Leader, the group considered itself nonpartisan, examining Kentucky legislators' records on taxation and spending and encouraging politicians to publicly pledge to vote uniformly against tax increases. Paul managed his father's successful 1996 Congressional campaign, in which the elder Paul returned to the House after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Greg Laughlin in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the NRCC and Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush.|$|E
500|$|The coin {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the nation's senators. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> of Texas described United States currency as [...] "crummy". Gramm, {{who was one of}} the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his White House appointments, he is {{credited}} with the 1994 and 1998 Texas gubernatorial victories of George W. Bush, as well as Bush's 2000 and 2004 successful presidential campaigns. In his 2004 victory speech Bush referred to Rove as [...] "the Architect". Rove has also been credited for the successful campaigns of John Ashcroft (1994 U.S. Senate election), Bill Clements (1986 Texas gubernatorial election), Senator John Cornyn (2002 U.S. Senate election), Governor Rick Perry (1990 Texas Agriculture Commission election), and <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> (1982 U.S. House and 1984 U.S. Senate elections).|$|E
2500|$|The National Journal ranked Hutchison {{as follows}} in its 2004 rankings, {{which are based}} on various key votes {{relating}} to economic policy, social policy, and foreign policy: [...] "Economic: 26% Liberal, 73% Conservative; Social: 38% Liberal, 60% Conservative; Foreign: 0% Liberal, 67% Conservative. Although a loyal conservative Republican, she has been known to cross {{over to the other side}} on a few issues. She is more likely to do this than either <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> or his successor John Cornyn." [...] A poll that was released on June 19, 2007, showed that Hutchison had an approval rating of 58%, with 34% disapproving.|$|E
2500|$|... 1996 saw Buchanan's most {{successful}} attempt {{to win the}} Republican nomination. [...] With a Democratic President (Bill Clinton) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President George H. W. Bush having made clear he {{was not interested in}} re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who was considered to have many weaknesses. [...] Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> of Texas, former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and the multi-millionaire publisher Steve Forbes.|$|E
2500|$|National Republicans soon followed. Ronald Reagan {{spoke at}} the school in 1980, {{although}} the Joneses supported his opponent, John Connally, in the South Carolina primary. Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as [...] "a traitor to God's people" [...] for choosing George H. W. Bush—whom Jones called a [...] "devil"—as his vice president. Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president. In the 1990s, other Republicans such as Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm,</b> Bob Dole, and Alan Keyes also spoke at BJU. Democrats were rarely invited {{to speak at the}} university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for abortion rights) opposed by the Religious Right.|$|E
2500|$|Tower {{announced}} {{in the summer of}} 1983 that he would not seek a fifth term. Grover, who had disagreed with Tower on many issues, therefore, entered the Republican primary held in May 1984. [...] He fared poorly in that race. In the first primary, Republicans nominated Congressman <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> of College Station, another convert to the GOP. Also seeking the 1984 Senate nomination were Robert Mosbacher, Jr., of Houston, son of later U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, and conservative-to-libertarian Congressman Ron Paul of the district southwest of Houston. Gramm in turn defeated the Democratic nominee, then state Senator and later U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett, and went on to serve three terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Since September 1994, Miers {{has contributed}} to the campaigns of various Republicans (at about the same time she began to work for George W. Bush), {{including}} Kay Bailey Hutchison, <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm,</b> and Pete Sessions, with recorded contributions to Republican candidates and causes totaling nearly $12,000. Her earlier political history shows support for the Democrats during the 1980s, with recorded contributions to Democratic candidates and causes, including the Democratic National Committee, the Senate campaign of Lloyd Bentsen and the 1988 presidential campaign of Al Gore, totaling $3,000. Her last recorded contribution to a Democratic cause or campaign was in 1988. Ed Gillespie said that she was a [...] "conservative Democrat" [...] at the time.|$|E

[...] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Koechner {{landed a}} year-long stint on Saturday Night Live, joining {{the show with}} Second City friends Nancy Walls and Adam McKay. During his time at SNL, he befriended guest-writer David 'Gruber' Allen, and castmate Will Ferrell. Some of Koechner's {{recurring}} skits included Bill Brasky, the British Fops (playing Fagan, opposite Mark McKinney), Gary Macdonald (the fictional younger brother of Weekend Update anchor/SNL castmember Norm Macdonald, based on [...] "Jokey", a character he originated at Second City), Will Ferrell's [...] "Get Off the Shed" [...] sketches (playing his neighbor, Tom Taylor), and Gerald [...] "T-Bones" [...] Tibbons. Koechner impersonated several celebrities, including Burt Reynolds, Mike Ditka, Charlie Sheen, Robert Shapiro, Willard Scott, Oliver Stone, <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm,</b> David Kaczynski, and Pat Buchanan. After his one-season on SNL, Koechner joined the 1996–97 sketch cast of Late Night with Conan O'Brien.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the Congress enacted and President Clinton {{signed into}} law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, {{also known as the}} Financial Services Modernization Act. This law {{repealed}} the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933. A similar bill was introduced in 1998 by Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> but it was unable to complete the legislative process into law. Resistance to enacting the 1998 bill, as well as the subsequent 1999 bill, centered around the legislation's language which would expand the types of banking institutions of the time into other areas of service but would not be subject to CRA compliance in order to do so. The Senator also demanded full disclosure of any financial [...] "deals" [...] which community groups had with banks, accusing such groups of [...] "extortion".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{campaign}} Krueger charged that Hutchison was a [...] "country club Republican" [...] and {{insensitive to the}} feelings of minorities. In January, the Houston Chronicle reported that both Hutchison and Fields had promised to serve a maximum of two six-year terms in the Senate {{as part of her}} support for term-limit legislation for members of Congress. In April, the Dallas Morning News reported that Hutchison had repeated her pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate, if elected, and had also said term limits ought to cover all senators, including Senator <b>Phil</b> <b>Gramm</b> (Republican), who had been elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1990. (He would stay in the Senate until 2002.) The term-limits legislation never passed, and Hutchison has said that she would not leave the Senate in the absence of such legislation, because doing so would unilaterally hurt Texas {{at the expense of other}} states in the seniority-driven institution.|$|E
