5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> been {{rejected}} by the company. Such a center section would be low-floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> been made for new trams to be ordered.|$|E
5|$|As a result, <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} for a major urban {{extension}} in the town, mainly {{to the east of}} the railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would be built on 'Stanton Cross' site, with new schools, bus stops, community centres, shops, a doctor's surgery and new open spaces.|$|E

5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} the conflict, and after the war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} in 1972, Highway427 follows {{what was}} originally a two lane roadway known as Highway27, {{as well as}} a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway7 over the following twenty years. A short arterial extension was later built, though this section is designated as York Regional Road99 (Zenway Boulevard). <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> been announced to extend Highway427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive; construction will begin in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.|$|E

5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{has been}} proposed, contingent upon {{the allocation of}} funding. This includes {{the second phase of}} the Silicon Valley extension, which would bring the system to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion and run 5.5 miles (8.9 km) along interstate 580 to Isabel Avenue. The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. Other <b>plans</b> <b>have</b> included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California High Speed Rail system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges.|$|E

Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. <b>Plans</b> <b>have</b> since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E
