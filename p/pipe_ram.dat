40|$|ABSTRACT: Drivability {{analyses}} performed {{using the}} one-dimensional wave equation {{have been an}} accepted engineering practice for the installation of driven piles for over thirty-five years, due {{to the ability to}} accurately predict driving performance. <b>Pipe</b> <b>ramming</b> represents an analogous application to pile driving, yet drivability analyses are not yet common, despite the ability to predict the rate of driving and the driving stresses that are induced by the impact energy delivered by the <b>pipe</b> <b>ramming</b> hammer. This paper presents a case history of an instrumented, 2, 440 mm diameter pipe driven through an active highway embankment using <b>pipe</b> <b>ramming.</b> The performance of the <b>rammed</b> <b>pipe</b> is described in terms of pipe-hammer energy transfer, ramming-induced stresses, and total, static and dynamic soil resistance. Drivability analyses calibrated using new pipe ramming-specific static soil resistance model and dynamic soil parameters generated using the results of several instrumented <b>pipe</b> <b>rams</b> are performed and compared to the observed field results. The comparison of observed and predicted driving performance indicates that drivability analyses can satisfactorily predict the penetration resistance and ramming-induced stresses and be used to plan <b>pipe</b> <b>ramming</b> installations...|$|R

5000|$|Documents {{discussed}} during {{congressional hearings}} June 17, 2010, {{suggested that a}} battery in the device's control pod was flat and that the rig's owner, Transocean, may have [...] "modified" [...] Cameron's equipment for the Macondo site (including incorrectly routing hydraulic pressure to a stack test valve instead of a <b>pipe</b> <b>ram</b> BOP) which increased the risk of BOP failure, in spite of warnings from their contractor to that effect. Another hypothesis was that a junction in the drilling pipe may have been positioned in the BOP stack {{in such a way}} that its shear rams had an insurmountable thickness of material to cut through.|$|E
50|$|On 30 April, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked Halliburton {{to brief}} {{it as well}} as provide any {{documents}} it might have related to its work on the Macondo well. Attention has focused on the cementing procedure and the blowout preventer, which failed to fully engage. A number of significant problems were identified with the blowout preventer: There was a leak in the hydraulic system that provides power to the shear rams. The underwater control panel had been disconnected from the <b>pipe</b> <b>ram,</b> and instead connected to a test ram. The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, did not correspond to the structure that was on the ocean bottom. The shear rams were not designed to function on the joints where the drill pipes were screwed together or on tools that were passed through the blowout preventer during well construction. The explosion may have severed the communication line between the rig and the sub-surface blowout preventer control unit such that the blowout preventer would have never received the instruction to engage. Before the backup dead man's switch could engage, communications, power and hydraulic lines must all be severed, but it is possible hydraulic lines were intact after the explosion. Of the two control pods for the deadman switch, the one that was inspected had a dead battery. Employee Tyrone Benton told the BBC on 21 June that a leak was spotted on a crucial piece of equipment in the oil rig's blowout preventer weeks before the accident, and that Transocean and BP were emailed about it.|$|E

40|$|The blowout {{preventer}} system is acting the secondary safety barrier in a hydrocarbon well, where the drilling mud column {{is defined as}} the primary safety barrier. However, in pratical industry, there is a new demand for improved methods of assessing the reliability and availability of {{blowout preventer}} systems. The objective of this master thesis is to propose the relatively new method for reliability and availability assessment based on Bayesian Network, focusing on the comparsion between the various blowout preventers stack and the influence of the external information in the case study. The thesis starting with introduction of safety critical system including the basic terminology for reliability and availability assessment. The relevant standards regarding oil and gas industry are also introduced. The brief review about the blowout preventer is presented next. The basic structure of blowout preventer and the three main subsystems are identified and introduced. The classification of possible failure and desired functions of main components are reported. Finally, the brief research review about the previous reliability assessment method of subsea blowout preventer is presented, pointing out some potential weakness of the traditional methods, which indicating the Bayesian Network is the one possible solution when new requirement of reliability and availability is demanded. Then the introduction of Bayesian Network is mainly investigated for those who are not very familiar with this method. The possible allocation of Bayesian Network in reliability assessment and the comparsion between Bayesian Network model and the traditional method are mainly discussed. Then in the end of this chapter, there are two examples to show how the traditional method used in the assessment of blowout preventer can be transferred into Bayesian Network model without losing any details, in addtion, the advanced modeling powers regarding introduction of probabilistic gates, multiple states for variables and updating information when scanerio is known are revealed in both examples. Finally the case study about reliability and availability assessment of different blowout preventers is created. There are mainly three different type of blowout preventer stacks withing different degrees of performing the desired functions under the most demanding situations. The Bayesian Network model is able to perform such assessment effectively and one addtional information is taken into account since the contribution of the wellbore pressure has significant implications on the blowout preventer's ability to seal around or seal off the wellbore. Finally, the conclusion and discussion are provided. The main conclusion are summarized as three key findings. First, Bayesian Network is proven to carry out the reliability and availability assessment when there is the new requirement in pratical situations, especially for updating the information when the test data is available during the operation. Second, Bayesian Network based reliability and availability assessment is possible for applying in the large scale model since it can handle probabilistic gates and multiple states of components, where the traditional method such as Fault Tree Analysis {{may not be able to}} deal with such challenges. Third, according to the analysis results of the case study, the blowout preventer equipped with the Deepwater Horizon type of stack is considered as the most reliable one in the most demanding situation, if the correct repair strategy is applied. In addition, this kind of blowout preventer is relatively very stable under the high wellbore pressure condition even though withing lower redundancy of the <b>pipe</b> <b>ram</b> subsystem, due to inclusion of casing shear ram which improves the shearing ability significantly...|$|E
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{accident}} {{and the role}} played by the blowout preventer (BOP), formed the basis for this Master thesis. The purpose of this report is to identify some of the challenges related to the BOP. This has been done through studying the technical aspect of the system and safety-critical functions performed by the BOP. Possible failures with a main focus on systematic failures introduced during operation and maintenance have been investigated. Key requirements in relation to the operation and maintenance of the BOP have been identified and the current maintenance practice has been inquired into. Based on this, recommendations to a systematic follow-up of BOP performance that may solve some of the identified challenges shall be presented. Both drilling specific standards and more general standards have been studied in the work with identifying key requirements. Much of the topside equipment has independent protection layers installed to mitigate the risk associated with the operation of a specified hazardous system. This is called safety instrumented systems (SIS). In the event of a demand the SIS can function independently of control system and by this mitigating the risk. For SIS there are two standards, IEC 61508 / 61511, and they apply to all safety instrumented systems in the oil and gas industry. It is these standards which are referred to as “general standards” in this report. The key findings and challenges identified in this report: The main difference between the BOP and other top side equipment is accessibility. BOPs are most of the time stationed subsea, and the time available to perform maintenance is limited. Usually maintenance is performed during the time between wells, and typically the time frame to perform all the necessary activities is too short. The requirements given for maintenance of BOPs (disregarding the test regime of the BOP) is imprecise and insufficient. Therefore maintenance program today is based much on recommendations from the suppliers. This causes problems because very often the recommendations from the supplier are so extensive that {{it is not possible to}} execute them during the time available. In connection with SIL verification it is also a problem with exaggerated performance claims made by equipment manufacturers. In regards to BOP failures the control pod is the component which seems to have the highest failure rate. This is because of increasing complexity in the system during the course of time. The annular preventer also has a higher failure rate in comparison to other components. The reason is because the annular preventer is more frequently subjected to wear than other components during well control activities. It could also be subjected to excessive stress more frequently. Systematic failures are believed to be a contributing factor to BOP failures, both for the control pods, annular preventers and other components. Regarding reliability of the BOP system the drilling specific standards do not state any specific requirements. In OLF 070 on the other hand, which is a guide to the application of IEC 61508 / 61511 in the Norwegian oil industry, there are given three minimum SIL requirements for the three most important safety-critical functions of the BOP. This is the closing of the annular preventer, the <b>pipe</b> <b>ram</b> and the blind shear ram, and they have all been given a minimum SIL 2 requirement. There are however several limitations with these requirements, and factors needed to be considered when verifying SIL requirements for the BOP:. The PFD value is very dependent on the test interval, and with extensive testing it is theoretically possible to meet high SIL requirement with less reliable systems.. Not all failures reveal themselves trough functional testing, and therefore the calculated PFD can give a false sense of safety.. Systematic failures are usually not quantified according to IEC 61508 and therefore most systematic failures are not included in the SIL verification calculations Recommendations: It is important to try to identify all possible failures and failure modes, including systematic failures. Not only is it important to identify systematic failures in order to prevent them, but to the extent possible systematic failures should also be quantified. By doing so it is possible to get a more accurate calculation of the PFD for BOPs. To address systematic errors for BOP systems it can be favorable to look at the IEC 61508 standard. The techniques recommended to be utilized in this report to address systematic errors are: - Project / Lifecycle management - Documentation - Checklists - Inspection of the specification The limited time available to perform necessary maintenance activities for the BOP has also been a recurring theme throughout this report. It is reason to believe that the time period between wells when maintenance work is being done, also is a time period where systematic failures are implemented into the system. Together with other systematic failures such as manufacturing defects, specification mistakes and implementation errors, all should be addressed by the lifecycle management. This then could result in new activities in the maintenance program / testing regime, for instance actual shear testing with pipe (destructive testing). Control function monitoring should be utilized in respect of documenting and analyzing to optimize the preventive maintenance. Effective BOP preventive maintenance requires accurate record keeping on all BOP function cycles, and this can be provided by such a system. By optimizing the preventive maintenance several advantages can be experienced, like for instance reduced downtime, a reduction of unnecessary maintenance, a reduction in systematic errors and increased reliability of the BOP. To address the challenge with limited time to perform maintenance, a second solution should be looked at as well. This involves equipping every drilling rig with two BOPs, which would give the rig crew much more time to insure the integrity of the BOP. Already some rigs do have one spare pod that is installed after each well. The pod taken out is then overhauled and ready to be re-installed after the next well and this method is suggested to be applied for not only the control pod but the entire BOP system. A problem is that most rigs today are not built for having two BOPs onboard. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amount of}} energy {{transfer}} from the hammer to the casing is a critical consideration for assessing of the constructability of the required length and diameter of pipe with a given hammer. Due to various contractor-selected pipe-hammer connections and natural sources of energy loss (e. g., thermal, frictional, etc.), the energy transfer efficiency of <b>pipe</b> <b>ramming</b> hammers must be less than 100 percent; however, actual hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies, defined as the ratio of actual energy transferred to the rated hammer energy, have not been reported to-date. Overestimates of hammer- pipe energy transfer could result in corresponding overestimates of driving stresses and penetration rates; likewise, over-estimates of driving stress could lead to excessive and uneconomical wall thickness. This study focuses on the characterization of hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies for commonly used pneumatic and hydraulic hammers observed during production and test <b>pipe</b> <b>ramming</b> installations. The observed energy transfer was found {{to depend on the}} type of hammer, the hammer-pipe connection (e. g., collets vs. ram cones), the hammer alignment, and the degree of tension on restraining chains. Observations of energy transfer indicate that hammer efficiency can vary widely; average observed efficiencies ranged from 20 to 50 percent. Additionally, a parametric study on pipe drivability is presented, and confirmed the importance of energy transfer on the rate of pipe penetration. The characterization of pipe-hammer energy transfer provided herein can form the basis for a rational evaluation of pipe drivability for a given hammer and pipe geometry, and can help owners, engineers, consultants, and contractors determine the likelihood of a successful casing installation...|$|R

30|$|Different {{preventer}} configurations provide {{different levels}} of performance for subsea BOP systems. Specifically, a blind shear ram preventer, which is regarded as an emergency device, is used to shear the pipe and seal the well. As shown in Fig.  1, the typical subsea BOP is equipped with two annular preventers and four or five ram preventers, including two blind shear rams {{and two or three}} <b>pipe</b> <b>rams.</b> The configuration of the stack is dependent on the expected operations, redundancy, flexibility and the trade-off between {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each configuration (Januarilham 2012). Besides the annular preventers, ram preventers, connectors and other components such as the flexible joint, choke/kill valves and choke/kill lines are integrated to form the whole subsea BOP stack (Cai et al. 2012). There are several types of rams which have different tasks in addition to sealing the well. One may be designed to grip and hold equipment lowered into the well, while others are designed to cut equipment and pipes which are blocking the ram. The latter is the shear seal ram (Østby 2008). The subsea BOP stack is usually equipped with two hydraulic connectors, the LMRP connector and the wellhead connector. The LMRP contains the control system of the BOP and one or two annular preventers, depending on the BOP configuration. The LMRP connector enables retrieval of the control system, and the annular preventer enables maintenance without the necessity of removing the whole BOP stack, therefore saving time and making it safer, besides being used to connect the LMRP to the BOP stack. The wellhead connector is used to connect the BOP stack to the wellhead (Cai et al. 2012).|$|R

Troopers Lyle Baker and Ray Rich identified the driver of the death car as Mrs. Smith. She is the wife of Lothar Smith, employed by the state fire inspection office and a former Edmond fireman. [...] -Women Pinned in Wreck [...] - Both victims were pinned in the wreckage. Troopers said Mrs. Smith was killed instantly. Miss Milam died en route to Edmond Hospital. Riggs told troopers he was driving 30 miles an hour {{at the time of the}} accident. He said the car, driven by Mrs. Smith, was passing another truck and ran head-on into his truck. Riggs' truck-trailer was loaded with heavy pipe and a fuel tank. One six-inch pipe crashed through the windows of the automobile. Both women taught classes in College Campus school at Central State College and were well known to Edmond residents. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{aerodynamic}} bodywork {{was largely}} {{the work of}} Malcolm Sayer, who had joined Jaguar following a stint with the Bristol Aeroplane Company during the Second World War and later worked on the C-Type. For the D-Type, he insisted on a minimal frontal area. To reduce the XK engine's height, Jaguar's chief engineer, William Haynes, and former Bentley engineer, Walter Hassan, developed dry sump lubrication, {{and it has been}} said that the car's frontal area was also a consideration in canting the engine at 8½° from the vertical (which necessitated the offset bonnet bulge). Philip Porter, in his book Jaguar Sports Racing Cars, says that [...] "a more likely reason was to provide extra space for the <b>ram</b> <b>pipes</b> feeding the three twin-choke Weber carburettors." [...] Reducing underbody drag contributed to the car's high top speed; for the long Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans, a fin was mounted behind the driver for aerodynamic stability. For the 1955 season, factory cars were fitted with a longer nose, which lengthened the car by 7½ inches and further increased maximum speed; and the headrest fairing and aerodynamic fin were combined as a single unit that smoothed the aerodynamics and saved weight.|$|R
50|$|A ram newly {{placed into}} {{operation}} or which has stopped cycling must be started as follows. If the waste valve {{is in the}} raised (closed) position, which is most common, it must be pushed down manually into the open position and released. If the flow is sufficient, it will then cycle at least once. If it does not continue to cycle, it must be pushed down repeatedly until it cycles continuously on its own, usually after three or four manual cycles. If the ram stops with the waste valve in the down (open) position it must be lifted manually and kept up {{for as long as}} necessary for the supply pipe to fill with water and for any air bubbles to travel up the pipe to the source. This may take a minute or more. Then it can be started manually by pushing it down a few times as described above. Having a valve on the delivery <b>pipe</b> at the <b>ram</b> makes starting easier. Close the valve until the ram starts cycling, then gradually open it to fill the delivery pipe. If opened too quickly it will stop the cycling. Once the delivery pipe is full the valve can be left open.|$|R
50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting <b>pipe</b> between the <b>ram</b> shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|R
