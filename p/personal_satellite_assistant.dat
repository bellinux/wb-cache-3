40|$|The <b>Personal</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Assistant</b> (PSA) {{is a small}} robot {{proposed}} by NASA to assist astronauts who are living and working aboard the space shuttle or space station. To help the astronaut, it has to move around safely. Navigation is made difficult by the arrangement of thrusters. Only forward and leftward thrust is available and rotation will introduce translation. This paper shows how stable navigation can be achieved through neuroevolution in three basic navigation tasks: (1) Stopping autorotation, (2) Turning 90 degrees, and (3) Moving forward to a position.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{spacecraft}} mobile robots—free-flying sensor platforms and communications devices intended to accompany astronauts or remotely operate on space missions {{both inside and}} outside of a spacecraft—has demanded the development of a simple and effective navigation schema. One such system under exploration involves the use of a laser-camera arrangement to predict relative positioning of the mobile robot. By projecting laser beams from the robot, a 3 D reference frame can be introduced. Thus, as the robot shifts in position, the position reference frame produced by the laser images is correspondingly altered. Using normalization and camera registration techniques presented in this paper, the relative translation and rotation of the robot in 3 D are determined from these reference frame transformations.

40|$|We {{describe}} an architecture for implementing spoken natural language dialogue interfaces to semi-autonomous systems, {{in which the}} central idea is to transform the input speech signal through successive levels of representation corresponding roughly to linguistic knowledge, dialogue knowledge, and domain knowledge. The final representation is an executable program in a simple scripting language equivalent to a subset of Cshell. At each stage of the translation process, an input is transformed into an output, producing as a byproduct a "meta-output" which describes {{the nature of the}} transformation performed. We show how consistent use of the output/meta-output distinction permits a simple and perspicuous treatment of apparently diverse topics including resolution of pronouns, correction of user misconceptions, and optimization of scripts.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{evolution}} of a neural controller for a simulated <b>Personal</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Assistant</b> (PSA) using the Enforced Sub-Populations (ESP) neuroevolutionary algorithm, as described by Sit et al. in 2005 [8]. ESP has previously been shown to be a very efficient algorithm for neuroevolution. As opposed to the original paper, we are not primarily concerned with the solutions discovered by the system, but rather with how ESP performs its evolutionary search; using the unstable PSA control task as a vehicle for fitness evaluation. We propose several changes to the original ESP algorithm. Our experiments suggest that these improve both the internal consistency, and the success rate of the algorithm. We further analyze the ability of ESP to go beyond classic weight evolution. We compare our evolutionary results with those of a simple hill-climbing algorithm, and propose that improved heuristics for the modifications of network topology in ESP may be necessary to evolve increasingly complex and robust controllers...|$|E
40|$|We use an {{approach}} to simultaneous localization and mapping to determine a path between two points for a mobile robot experiencing localization error in a known environment. Simply instructing a robot {{to move to a}} point (x# y) is not sufficient because the mobile robot's accrueddead-reckoning error prevents the robot from ascertaining its current location and thus it cannot position itself at any location, including the goal. If we knew how dead-reckoning error grew, then perhaps we can direct the mobile robottoagoal location, module an "error margin. " Instead, we do not assume an explicit error model, and send the robot to the goal via a sequence of way points, called meet points, whose locations are known a priori. Meet points arenodes of the generalizedVoronoi graph and have the property that a robot can use its range sensors to reliably converge on them via a stable control law. The challenge is then to navigate from the final meet point to the goal location (not necessarily on the generalizedVoronoi diagram) which constitutes the contribution of this paper. Experiments on the Nomad 200 and soon on the <b>Personal</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Assistant</b> Test-bed validate this approach...|$|E

40|$|Planning and {{scheduling}} {{in the face}} of uncertainty and change pushes the capabilities of both planning and dialogue technologies by requiring complex negotiation to arrive at a workable plan. Planning for use of semi-autonomous robots involves negotiation among multiple participants with competing scientific and engineering goals to co-construct a complex plan. In NASA applications this plan construction is done under severe time pressure so having a dialogue interface to the plan construction tools can aid rapid completion of the process. But, this will put significant demands on spoken dialogue technology, particularly in the areas of dialogue management and generation. The dialogue interface will {{need to be able to}} handle the complex dialogue strategies that occur in negotiation dialogues, including hypotheticals and revisions, and the generation component will require an ability to summarize complex plans. This demonstration will describe a work in progress towards building a spoken dialogue interface to the EUROPA planner for the purposes of planning {{and scheduling}} the activities of a semi-autonomous robot. A prototype interface has been built for planning the schedule of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Assistant</b> (PSA), a mobile robot designed for micro-gravity environments that is intended for use on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. The spoken dialogue interface gives the user the capability to ask for a description of the plan, ask specific questions about the plan, and update or modify the plan. We anticipate that a spoken dialogue interface to the planner will provide a natural augmentation or alternative to the visualization interface, in situations in which the user needs very targeted information about the plan, in situations where natural language can express complex ideas more concisely than GUI actions, or in situations in which a graphical user interface is not appropriate...|$|E
