50|$|From {{a railway}} {{signalling}} point of view, the 925 m-long Schwarzkopftunnel lies within Heigenbrücken railway station. This peculiarity {{stems from a}} <b>pushing</b> <b>operation,</b> still undertaken today, between Laufach and Heigenbrücken. Heavy goods trains {{come to a stop}} at Laufach station, where a helper locomotive joins the train’s tail end to help the train’s main locomotive get the train up the Spessart Ramp, which reaches a steepness of 1:47 (some 21‰). The tunnel itself is built with no gradients to speak of. Just before the tunnel portal, the helper locomotive leaves the goods train, which has now covered the steepest gradient and continues on its way southeastwards. So that the helper locomotive does not need to go through the tunnel and into the passenger transport complex (which would lead to disruption of normal operations), the tracks at the Aschaffenburg (that is to say, far) end of the tunnel are so arranged as to allow it to cross over to the other track and travel back to Laufach. The points needed for this also belong to the Heigenbrücken signal box, meaning that Heigenbrücken station stretches right through the tunnel.|$|E

In this article, we further study the same topic and answer some of the questions asked in the above mentioned work. The anti-twinned graph of an oriented graph is obtained by adding and pushing a copy of each of its vertices. In particular, we show that two oriented graphs are in a push relation if and only if they have isomorphic anti-twinned graphs.

30|$|As stated earlier, the {{transport}} method using handcarts and mobile robots faces {{the following two}} problems. One problem is the sliding of the already inserted handcarts during the second tilting work. This {{is a result of}} the low friction force between the handcarts and the floor surface. If the friction force is too high, it will be difficult to push the object. In brief, during the tilting operation and during the <b>pushing</b> <b>operation,</b> there is a big difference in the required coefficient of friction between the handcarts and the floor surface. The second problem is the danger of tilting or sliding caused by the reaction force generated while the robot is tilting the object. Thus, while operating the object, the robots are fixed in position, and when moving, they are released. To address the two problems, functions that fix and release the object according to the tasks that both robots are performing is required. Regarding the former, handcarts are equipped with a controllable lock mechanism that can lock or unlock the handcarts. The latter problem is resolved by using an outrigger.|$|E

40|$|Pushing {{micro-objects}} using {{point contact}} provides more flexibility and less complexity compared {{to pick and}} place operation. Due {{to the fact that}} in micro-world surface forces are much more dominant than inertial forces and these forces are distributed unevenly, pushing through the center of mass of the micro-object may not yield a pure translational motion. In order to translate a micro-object, the line of pushing should pass through the center of friction. In this paper, a semi-autonomous scheme based on hybrid vision/force feedback procedure is proposed to push micro-objects with human assistance using a custom built tele-micromanipulation setup to achieve translational motion. In the semi-autonomous pushing process, velocity controlled pushing with force feedback is realized along x-axis by the human operator while y-axis orientation is undertaken automatically using visual feedback. This way the desired line of pushing for the micro-object is controlled to pass through the varying center of friction.

An edge-coloured graph G is π-permutably homomorphic (respectively π-permutably isomorphic) to an edge-coloured graph H if some sequence of switches on G produces an edge-coloured graph homomorphic (respectively isomorphic) to H. We study the π-homomorphism and π-isomorphism operations, relating them to homomorphisms and isomorphisms of a constructed edge-coloured graph that we introduce called a colour switching graph. Finally, we identify those edge-coloured graphs H with the property that G is homomorphic to H {{if and only if}} any switch of G is homomorphic to H. It turns out that such an H is precisely a colour switching graph. As a corollary to our work, we settle an open problem of Klostermeyer and MacGillivray...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{capabilities}} of a microrobotic platform, driven by vibrating motors, to generate and impart micromanipulation forces of desired type and magnitude. First, an analysis is carried out {{on the nature of}} the actuation forces of the motion mechanism of the platform. The results demonstrate that the oscillating nature of these forces does not allow their direct use for micromanipulations. Consequently, further analysis is conducted to identify the conditions, under which the platform's actuation forces can be exploited for micromanipulations. To this end, a dynamic model of a single-dimensional <b>pushing</b> <b>operation</b> is developed, comprising the dynamics of the platform, the manipulator and the object. It is demonstrated by simulation that the forces imparted on the manipulated object depend on the physical parameters of the platform-manipulator system. Accordingly, a set of nonlinear equations involving platform-manipulator system parameters, is formulated that describes the conditions for developing micromanipulation forces of appropriate type and magnitude. The solution of this set of equations yields a range of parameter values, which are used as guidelines in the design and construction of a manipulator that is capable of applying smooth and controllable forces to manipulated objects. Using the parameter values suggested by the developed analysis, a needle type manipulator, appropriate for force feedback applications, is designed, built, and mounted on an experimental prototype of the microrobotic platform. Using this manipulator, experiments demonstrate the force capabilities of the microrobotic platform and verified the analytical and simulation results. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Prather, DennisDemands {{for high}} data rate and {{multifunctional}} apertures from both civilian and military users have motivated development of ultra-wideband (UWB) electrically steered phased arrays. Meanwhile, the need for large contiguous frequency is <b>pushing</b> <b>operation</b> of radio systems into the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) range. Therefore, modern radio systems require UWB performance from VHF to mm-wave. However, traditional electronic systems suffer many challenges that make achieving these requirements difficult. Several examples includes: voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) cannot provide a tunable range of several octaves, distribution of wideband local oscillator signals undergo high loss and dispersion through RF transmission lines, and antennas have very limited bandwidth or bulky sizes. Recently, RF photonics technology has drawn considerable attention because of its advantages over traditional systems, with the capability of offering extreme power efficiency, information capacity, frequency agility, and spatial beam diversity. A hybrid RF photonic communication system utilizing optical links and an RF transducer at the antenna potentially provides ultra-wideband data transmission, i. e., over 100 GHz. A successful implementation of such an optically addressed phased array requires addressing several key challenges. Photonic generation of an RF source with over a seven-octave bandwidth has been demonstrated {{in the last few}} years. However, one challenge which still remains is how to convey phased optical signals to downconversion modules and antennas. Therefore, a feed network with phase sweeping capability and low excessive phase noise needs to be developed. Another key challenge is to develop an ultra-wideband array antenna. Modern frontends require antennas to be compact, planar, and low-profile in addition to possessing broad bandwidth, conforming to stringent space, weight, cost, and power constraints. To address these issues, I will study broadband and miniaturization techniques for both single and array antennas. In addition, a prototype transmitting phased array system is developed and shown to demonstrate large bandwidth as well as a beam steering capability. The architecture of this system can be further developed to a large-scale array at higher frequencies such as mm-wave. This solution serves as a candidate for UWB multifunctional frontends.
