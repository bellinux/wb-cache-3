However, on 28 January 2009 VT Group announced its intention to sell its share. VT Group's <b>put</b> <b>option</b> valued its share at a minimum of £380million subject to conditions; however it received £346 million after various payments to BAE. In addition, VT Group agreed to pay £43 million compensation to BVT for cost overruns on contracts with Trinidad & Tobago and Oman that BVT had inherited from VT Shipbuilding.

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that one who exercises a <b>put</b> <b>option,</b> does not necessarily need to own the underlying asset. Specifically, one does not need to own the underlying stock in order to sell it. The reason for this is that one can short sell that underlying stock.|$|E

40|$|Mellin {{transforms}} {{in option}} pricing theory were introduced by Panini and Srivastav (2004). In this contribution, we generalize their results to European power options. We derive Black-Scholes-Merton-like valuation formulas for European power <b>put</b> <b>options</b> using Mellin transforms. Thereafter, we restrict {{our attention to}} plain vanilla options on dividend-paying stocks and derive the integral equations to determine the free boundary {{and the price of}} American <b>put</b> <b>options</b> using Mellin transforms. We recover a result found by Kim (1990) regarding the optimal exercise price of American <b>put</b> <b>options</b> at expiry and prove the equivalence of integral representations herein, the representation derived by Kim (1990), Jacka (1991), and by Carr et al.

25|$|In words, the {{standardized}} moneyness {{is the number}} of standard deviations the current forward price is above the strike price. Thus the moneyness is zero when the forward price of the underlying equals the strike price, when the option is at-the-money-forward. Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money call option and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money call option (with signs reversed for a <b>put</b> <b>option).</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{strategic}} interaction between large institutional investors and firms that issue <b>put</b> <b>options</b> written {{on their own}} stock. The firms experience large positive abnormal annual returns after they sell <b>put</b> <b>options.</b> The vast majority of issued <b>put</b> <b>options</b> expire without being exercised, and the buyers of these options, which are predominantly investment banks, lose money. We propose a model that gives a rationale why an uniformed party, an investment bank will trade in <b>put</b> <b>options</b> with an informed party, the issuing firm, although the expected profits from this trade are negative. The model shows how trading with an informed party can be profitable because the bank can acquire valuable information and afterwards earn abnormal returns on trades in other securities of the same firm. Finally, we outline several predictions from the model, and propose empirical tests to establish our proposition that an investment bank can legally acquire private information and trade The seminal work of Akerlof (1970) showed how asymmetric information migh...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{expand the}} idea of Samuelson[3] and Shepp[2, 5, 6] for stock {{optimization}} using the Bachelier model [4] as our models for the stock price at the money (X[stock price]= K[strike price]) for the American call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> [1]. At the money (X= K) for American options, the expected payoff of both the call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> is zero. Shepp investigated several stochastic optimization problems using martingale and stopping time theories [2, 5, 6]. One of the problems he investigated was how to optimize the stock price using both the Black-Scholes (multiplicative) and the Bachelier (additive) models [7, 6] for the American option above the strike price K (exercise price) to a stopping point. In order to explore the non-relativistic quantum effect on the expected payoff for both the call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> at the money, we assumed the stock price to undergo a stochastic process governed by the Bachelier (additive) model [4]. Further, using Ito calculus and martingale theory, we obtained a differential equation for the expected payoff for both the call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> in terms of delta and gamma. We also obtained {{the solution to the}} non-relativistic Schroedinger equation as the expected payoff for both the call and <b>put</b> <b>options.</b> Then, we expressed the stochastic process that is the expected payoff for both the call and <b>put</b> <b>options</b> at the money in terms of the solution to the Schroedinger equation. We concluded the stochastic process that is the expected payoff at the money for both options to be an oscillatory function with quantized interest rates. ...|$|R

25|$|Another {{very common}} {{strategy}} is the protective put, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and buys a put. This strategy acts as an insurance when investing on the underlying stock, hedging the investor's potential loses, but also shrinking an otherwise larger profit, if just purchasing the stock without the put. The maximum profit of a protective put is theoretically unlimited as the strategy involves being long on the underlying stock. The maximum loss {{is limited to the}} purchase price of the underlying stock less the strike price of the <b>put</b> <b>option</b> and the premium paid. A protective put is also known as a married put.|$|E
25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} <b>put</b> <b>option</b> to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E
25|$|The seller may grant {{an option}} to a buyer as part of another transaction, such as a share issue {{or as part of}} an {{employee}} incentive scheme, otherwise a buyer would pay a premium to the seller for the option. A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a <b>put</b> <b>option</b> would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{persistent}} mispricing of options, especially the overpricing of out-of-money <b>put</b> <b>options,</b> is a major reason for the often observed negative skewness in the risk-neutral price distributions of equity indices. This article investigates whether the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Shares index <b>put</b> <b>options</b> are overpriced compared with call options of the same moneyness and, if they are, whether this gives rise to profit opportunities in the market.
