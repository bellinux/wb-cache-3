The key parameters to control, in order to minimise the device failures due to electrostatic discharge (ESD), are peak ESD current and charge transfer in a direct discharge and device charging by induction and rubbing.

Use of ESD <b>protective</b> <b>garments</b> over normal clothes of operators is highly recommended in order to minimise ESD failures of devices.

50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, oiled silk was used as a {{waterproofing}} medium in adult clothing, but not until latex rubber was commercially available from the 1920s did the idea of wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>garment</b> became commonplace.

5000|$|Medical {{historians have}} {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the [...] "beak doctor" [...] costume to Charles de Lorme, who adopted in 1619 the idea of a full head-to-toe <b>protective</b> <b>garment,</b> modeled after a soldier's armour. This consisted of a bird-like mask with spectacles, and a long leather (Moroccan or Levantine) or waxed-canvas gown which went from the neck to the ankle. The over-clothing garment, as well as leggings, gloves, boots, and a hat, were made of waxed leather. The garment was impregnated with similar fragrant items as the beak mask. The costume may have older roots as some authors have described fourteenth-century plague doctors as wearing bird-like masks.|$|E

The pukupuku weaving technique uses the whatu-aho-patahi (single pair twine) method, which is very similar to the decorative geometric tāniko (fine embroidery or weaving in a geometric pattern) border designs usually seen on the kaitaka (fine flax cloak) class of cloak, and forms a thick and heavy <b>protective</b> <b>garment.</b> The awe (the tassels that fringe the outside length of the cloak) is likely to have been taken from the underside of the dog's tail. The kurupatu (plaited hem on the cloak edge) is entirely separate to the main kaupapa and made by threading separate strips together to form a length of collar that has been sewn onto the neck of the finished garment.|$|E

5000|$|Anecdotes {{describing}} garments {{designed to}} protect the wearer from penetrating weapons can be found far back into recorded history. Two types of <b>protective</b> <b>garment</b> from the American Civil War in the 1860s had a basic design similar to the flak jacket or ballistic armor of modern times in that solid plates were used as the main ballistic protection. The [...] "Soldiers' Bullet Proof Vest" [...] was manufactured by the G. & D. Cook & Company of New Haven, Connecticut. It consisted of two pieces of steel inserted into the pockets of a regular black military vest. Versions for infantry weighed 3 ½ pounds while a version for cavalry and artillery weighed 7 pounds. They sold for $5-$7. A more medieval-looking type of armor was made by the Atwater Armor Company, also of New Haven. It consisted of four large plates of steel held on the body by broad metal hooks over the shoulders and a belt around the waist. The Atwater vest was heavier than the Cook models and cost about twice as much.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} more insight in {{attenuation}} characteristics and corresponding lead (Pb) equivalences of {{a broad range of}} commercially available lead composite and nonlead <b>protective</b> <b>garments.</b> Thirty garments of five manufacturers (listed as 0. 25 - 0. 35 - 0. 50 mm Pb equivalent) were tested.

A substantial variability in photon transmission across garments was found. Differences between lead composite and nonlead garments were not statistically significant. Depending on tube voltage, between 9 and 12 out of 30 garments had a lower Pb equivalence than the indicated value.
