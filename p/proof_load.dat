40|$|Many bridges in The Netherlands {{are built}} around 1960 - 1970 and {{currently}} reach their designed service life of 50 years. The traffic loads are increasing and new insights in the behaviour of constructions are obtained. Therefore there are doubts about safety of these bridges and viaducts and these must be assessed. As the current safety codes {{have changed over}} the years, not all structures fulfil the current safety requirements, however replacement of the bridges brings undesirable high cost with it. Therefore alternative ways are sought to demonstrate the safety requirements. One way {{to do so is}} by <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> during which the structure is loaded in a controlled way. During <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> stop criteria are used, which are measurable parameters that indicate the condition of the structure during the <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> test.

50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the <b>proof</b> <b>load,</b> it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to estimate reliability for stress rupture of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) and similar composite structures.

In addition, the model predicts that even though there is strength decay due to <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> a significant overall increase in reliability is gained by eliminating any weak vessels, which would fail early. The model predicts that there should be significant periods of safe life following <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> because time is required for the strength to decay from the proof stress level to the subsequent loading level.

40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic load tests that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, and to evaluate during the test that the load does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests, a series of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for load testing, load testing for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> testing for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tested in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|Proof pile load {{tests are}} an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests.
