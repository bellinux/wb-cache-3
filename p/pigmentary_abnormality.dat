40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the early signs of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the risk of developing exudative AMD (typical AMD or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy [PCV]) in the fellow eye of Japanese patients with unilateral exudative AMD, focusing particularly on eyes with only <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Methods. This study is a retrospective observational consecutive case series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients who revisited the AMD clinic from 2010 to 2011 and confirmed 129 cases with unilateral exudative AMD at their first visit (baseline). The non-affected eyes at baseline (the second eye) were categorized by the presence of early signs of AMD. The incidence of exudative AMD (typical AMD or PCV) in the fellow eye was confirmed by fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. Results. Of the 129 patients, 14 (10. 9 %) developed exudative AMD in the fellow eye (median follow-up, 3. 2 years; n = 7 typical AMD and n = 7 PCV). Eyes with both pigmentary abnormalities and large drusen were more likely to develop typical AMD (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 9. 46, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 05 to 85. 0), whereas pigmentary abnormalities without large drusen were associated with PCV (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 15. 9, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 8 to 140. 5). Conclusions. There was a difference in the association between early signs of AMD and incident development of eithe...|$|E

40|$|Chickens of the {{autoimmune}} delayed-amelanotic (DAM or Smyth) line develop postnatal feather amelanosis {{and severe}} visual defects, {{both of which}} are presumed to be due to a dysfunction of melanocytes and a subsequent autoimmune response that eliminates pigment cells. In this report we elucidate further the melanocytic defect. We present a morphologic analysis of the mildly affected erratic (eDAM) group of Smyth chicken whose partial depigmentation and lack of visual impairment resemble human vitiligo more so than do the complete amelanosis and blindness in the classical Smyth line. Histologically, the sequential events leading to amelanosis in the young Smyth chicken occur simultaneously in the feathers of adult eDAM Smyth chickens, and the infiltration of the feather pulp with mononuclear leukocytes correlates with the extent of local <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Cytochemical localizations of dopa-oxidase and acid-phosphatase activities in eDAM feather melanocytes suggest that melanogenesis and autophagocytosis of melanosomes occur in tandem and that the rates of both are higher in these cells than in melanocytes of normally pigmented control chickens. Assays for tyrosinase activity in feather follicles indicate a hypermelanization in eDAM feathers and in the pigmented feathers of young Smyth chicks prior to the onset of depigmentation. Finally, we report on the establishment of pure, proliferative cultures of neural crest-derived melanocytes from control and Smyth chicken embryos. The degenerative events in Smyth chicken melanocyte cultures mimic in part those of the cells in vivo and are therefore indicative of a genetic defect that is independent of the immune system...|$|E

DESIGN: Population-based, prospective cohort study, and risk analysis. METHODS: A random sample from the Reykjavik Population Census for individuals 50 years and older was selected. We took fundus stereo color photographs and used standard grading system to study the five-year incidence of drusen, <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and AMD and to examine possible risk factors. A questionnaire including information on disease, medication, diet, and lifestyle from the Reykjavik Eye Study database provided additional information. RESULTS: Current alcohol consumption decreased the risk for drusen. Being married rather than divorced or widowed decreased the risk for soft drusen; being single decreased the risk of hypopigmentation as compared with being divorced or married.

40|$|The faded mouse is a coat color mutant {{that shows}} faded coat color and age-related loss of pigmentation. This {{mutation}} is transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene with 100 % penetrance. In the present study, we carried out linkage {{analysis of the}} faded (fe) gene using intra-specific backcross panels. Affected faded mice were carefully confirmed by their faded coat color at about 4 weeks of age. In the intra-specific backcross between faded and CBA mice (n= 198), the fe gene was mapped to a region 2. 1 cM distal to D 10 mit 191. Therefore, the gene order was defined as follows: centromere-D 10 mit 51 (12. 4 ± 2. 4 cM) -D 10 mit 191 (2. 1 ± 1. 0 cM) -fe-D 10 mit 44 (13. 3 ± 2. 4 cM) -D 10 mit 42 (14. 4 ± 2. 5 cM).

40|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) {{is a rare}} {{condition}} inherited as an {{autosomal recessive}} trait and it is characterized by photosensitivity, pigmentary changes, premature skin ageing and malignant tumors development resulting from the defect in DNA repair. The skin cancers, that include squamous and basal cell carcinomas and melanomas, are predominantly caused by exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, although UVA cannot be excluded. The mean age of onset of the neoplasms is 8 years of age in XP patients, in contrast of 60 years {{of age in the}} general population. In addition to cutaneous findings, patients often have ocular abnormalities including ectropion, corneal opacities, neoplasms and neurologic abnormalities as ataxia, loss of reflexes, sensorineural hearing loss, dysphagia, and decreasing cognition. The maximal form of neurological involvement has been defined the De Sanctis-Cacchione Syndrome that is characterized by retarded growth, spasticity and serious intelligence debility. Segmental demyelinisation, microcephaly, inner ear deafness and epilepsy may also be additional neurological signs of xeroderma pigmentosum patientsXP was described in Vienna by a Hungarian professor of dermatology Moriz Kaposi in 1870 and in 1874 it was first called ‘‘xeroderma or parchment skin’’ while in 1882, the term ‘‘pigmentosum’’ was added to emphasize the striking <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Estimated incidences vary from 1 in 20, 000 in Japan to 1 in 250, 000 in the USA. It affects males and females equally and it is frequently symptomatic in childhood. Xeroderma pigmentosum must be distinguished from other so-called DNA-Repair Deficiency Syndromes as the Cockayne Syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and other rare disease characterized by pigmentation changes as Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, LEOPARD syndrome, Carney complex and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The prognosis of patients with XP includes a high morbidity and early mortality. Although there is no cure for XP, the skin effects can be minimized by rigorous protection from sunlight and early removal of pre-cancerous lesions. Oral 13 -cis retinoic acid has shown to reduce the incidence of epithelial new cancers in XP patients because of retinoids modulate keratinocyte differentiation. We present the case of a 30 -year-old man who was diagnosed with XP at age 9. The first skin lesions had appeared five years, and over time had increased. Other clinical signs included photophobia and loss of eyelashes.

40|$|Objective: To clarify {{possible}} {{associations between}} cataract surgery and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design: Clinic-based cohort. Participants: We followed cataract surgical patients aged 65 +years in the Australian Cataract Surgery and Age-related Macular Degeneration (CSAMD) study. Patients who remained unilaterally phakic {{for at least}} 24 months after recruitment were included. Methods: We performed annual examinations with retinal photography. We assessed AMD using side-byside grading of images from all visits. Paired comparisons between operated and nonoperated fellow eyes (defined as nonoperated or operated 12 months previously) were made using generalized estimating equation models. Main Outcome Measures: Incident early AMD {{was defined as the}} new appearance of soft indistinct/reticular drusen or coexisting retinal <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormality</b> and soft distinct drusen in eyes at risk of early AMD. Incident late AMD was defined as the new appearance of neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy (GA) in eyes at risk of late AMD. Results: Among 2029 recruited, eligible participants, 1851 had cataract surgery performed at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, and 1244 (70. 7 %) had 36 -month postoperative visits. Of these participants, 1178 had gradable photographs at baseline and at least 1 follow-up visit. Of 308 unilaterally operated participants at risk of late AMD, this developed in 4 (1. 3 %) operated and 7 (2. 3 %) nonoperated fellow eyes (odds ratio [OR], 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 23 – 2. 36) after adjusting for the presence of early AMD at baseline. Of 217 unilaterally operated participants at risk of early AMD, this developed in 23 (10. 6 %) operated and 21 (9. 7 %) nonoperated fellow eyes (OR, 1. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 74 – 1. 65). Incident retinal pigment abnormalities were more frequent in operated than nonoperated fellow eyes (15. 3 % vs. 9. 9 %; OR, 1. 64; 95 % CI, 1. 07 – 2. 52).

Purpose: To determine the prevalence of age-related maculopathy (ARM) lesions in residents of the state of Victoria, Australia. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: Total of 5147 residential and institutionalized persons aged 40 years and older, living in Victoria. Methods: Participants were recruited through a cluster, stratified, random sampling from nine urban clusters and four rural clusters. The presence of ARM lesions was graded from color stereo fundus photographs as well as slit-lamp stereo biomicroscopy according to the International Classification and Grading System. Main Outcome Measures: The presence of ARM lesions. Results: The mean age of participants was 60. 2 years, and 55 % were females. Gradable fundus photographs were available for at least one eye in 4345 (92 %) of the participants. The weighted prevalence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was 0. 39 % (95 % confidence limits [CL] = 0. 20, 0. 58), atrophic AMD was 0. 27 % (95 % CL = 0. 04, 0. 50), and total AMD was 0. 68 % (95 % CL = 0. 30, 1. 1). Prevalence of AMD was strongly related to age (P< 0. 001). Prevalence of early ARM was 15. 1 % (95 % CL = 13. 7, 16. 4). Large drusen, 125 µm or more, were present in 6. 3 % of the participants. There was a higher prevalence of soft distinct drusen (7. 5 %) than soft indistinct drusen (4. 3 %). Retinal <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were present in 8. 2 % (95 % CL = 7. 2, 9. 2). The prevalence of large drusen, soft drusen, and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> increased with age (P < 0. 001). Prevalence of retinal <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> increased with increasing drusen size (P < 0. 001). Soft indistinct drusen were more common in women aged 70 years or older (P < 0. 001). Bilaterality of any ARM was strongly age related, and women appeared to have a higher risk of both bilateral early ARM and AMD. Conclusions: These data provide age- and gender-specific prevalence of ARM and its component lesions in an ethnically diverse Australian population. Early ARM and AMD prevalence rates increased sharply from ages 70 and 80 years, respectively, in all ethnic groups. These higher rates will continue to increase the importance of AMD as our population ages. Restricted Access: This resource is not available from the Digital Repository for copyright reasons.

Of these, 14 % were born in Southern Europe (Greece, Italy or Malta), with the remaining 86 % of Anglo-Celtic origin, born in Australia, the United Kingdom or New Zealand. Results: Overall, 2694 participants (12. 7 %) had early stages of AMD, defined as either one or more drusen &# 8805; 125 &# 8201;&# 0956;m (with or without <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities)</b> or one or more drusen 63 &# 8211; 124 &# 8201;&# 0956;m with <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in a 6000 -&# 0956;m diameter grading grid, {{in the absence of}} late AMD in either eye. A total of 122 participants (0. 6 %) had late AMD, defined as either geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD. In logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education and physical activity, Southern Europeans compared to Anglo-Celts had a higher prevalence of the early stages of AMD (odds ratio, OR, 1. 15, 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1. 00 &# 8211; 1. 34), and lower prevalence of late AMD (OR 0. 36, 95 % CI 0. 17 &# 8211; 0. 78). Conclusions: Australians of Southern European origin have a higher prevalence of the early stages of AMD and lower prevalence of late AMD compared to those of Anglo-Celtic origin. Although AMD prevalence in the older age group(s) of Southern Europeans could be underestimated due to disparity in participation rates, it is likely that both lifestyle and genetic factors play their parts in differential AMD prevalence in these ethnic groups...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} phenotype {{characteristics of}} fellow eyes {{in patients with}} early onset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD). METHODS: Patients with new-onset unilateral NVAMD between 50 and 65 years (n = 57, early-onset choroidal neovascularization [CNV] group) or > 80 years (n = 47, late-onset CNV group) or with nonneovascular AMD (n = 98, no-CNV group) were included. Fellow eyes in both CNV groups and the eyes with the more severe AMD staging in the no-CNV group were used to evaluate number and size of macular drusen, extramacular drusen (EMD), <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy on color photographs and hyperreflective dots (HRD) and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) scans.

RESULTS: Occurrence of > 20 macular drusen was more frequent in the early-onset CNV group than the late-onset CNV group (odds ratio [OR] 2. 93; P = 0. 01) or the no-CNV group (OR 2. 17; P = 0. 02). Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, RPD, and HRD appeared less frequently in the early-onset CNV group than in the late-onset CNV group (RPE atrophy: OR 0. 11; P = 0. 005; RPD: OR 0. 04; P = 9. 38 x 10 - 10, HRD: OR 0. 30; P = 0. 004) and no-CNV group (RPE atrophy: OR 0. 12; P = 0. 005; RPD: OR 0. 40, P = 0. 03, HRD: not significant).

40|$|Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterised by <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and sensorineural deafness. It is subcategorised into type 1 (WS 1) and type 2 (WS 2) {{on the basis}} of the presence (WS 1) or absence (WS 2) of dystopia canthorum. WS 1 is always caused by mutations in the PAX 3 gene, whereas WS 2 is caused by mutations in the microphthalmia (MITF) gene in some but not all families. An association of WS symptoms with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) has been reported in many families. We report here a patient with characteristics of WS 2 and a de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 13 q. We also describe a family with two sibs who have both WS 2 and HSCR. In this family, all possible genes for WS and HSCR, but not chromosome 13 q, could be excluded. As an association between chromosome 13 q and HSCR/WS has been reported previously, these data suggest that there is a gene on chromosome 13 q that is responsible for WS or HSCR or both...|$|R

The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease hemochromatosis, is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin <b>pigmentary</b> melanin <b>abnormalities,</b> deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The free-radical theory of aging proposes that free radicals underlie the aging process itself. Similarly, the process of mitohormesis suggests that repeated exposure to free radicals may extend life span.|$|R
40|$|Myosin Va is an actin-associated motor protein {{involved}} in organelle transport such as melanosomes and neuron synaptic vesicles {{and has always}} been proposed as the candidate gene for the autosomal recessive Griscelli-Pruniéras syndrome, one of the silvery hair syndromes, which is a lethal disease combining immunodeficiency and neurologic and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Thus far, two mutations in the myosin Va gene have been described {{to be associated with}} this syndrome. One of these mutations was a homozygous mis-sense mutation causing an arginine to cysteine alteration at codon 1246. Because we also found this particular substitution after mutation analysis of a Griscelli patient, we checked its relevance in a control group of 124 unrelated healthy individuals and found it to be present, even in homozygous state, in normal unaffected individuals. It is clear that this arg 1246 cys substitution is a polymorphism occurring in the human population and not occurring in association with Griscelli syndrome. Distinguishing a polymorphism from a bona fide mutation is of utmost importance and has major ethical implications with regard to prenatal genetic counseling in affected families.

Mutations in SOX 10 are associated with several neurocristopathies such as Waardenburg syndrome type IV (WS 4), a congenital disorder characterized by the association of hearing loss, <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexus of the gastrointestinal tract, also known as aganglionic megacolon or Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Several mutations at this locus are known to cause {{a high percentage of}} WS 4 cases, but no SOX 10 mutations had been ever reported associated to isolated HSCR patient. Therefore, nonsyndromic HSCR was initially thought not to be associated to mutations at this particular locus. In the present study, we describe the evaluation of the SOX 10 gene in a series of 196 isolated HSCR cases, the largest patient series evaluated so far, and report a truncating c. 153 - 155 del mutation. This {{is the first time that}} a SOX 10 mutation is detected in an isolated HSCR patient, which completely changes the scenario for the implications of SOX 10 mutations in human disease, giving us a new tool for genetic counseling...|$|R
40|$|Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS; deafness with <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities)</b> and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR; aganglionic megacolon) are congenital disorders {{caused by}} defective {{function of the}} embryonic neural crest. WS and HSCR are associated in patients with Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS 4), whose symptoms are reminiscent of the white coat-spotting and aganglionic megacolon displayed by the mouse mutants Dom (Dominant megacolon), piebald-lethal (sl) and lethal spotting (ls). The sl and ls phenotypes are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the Endothelin-B receptor (Ednrb) and Endothelin 3 (Edn 3), respectively. The identification of Sox 10 as the gene mutated in Dom mice (B. H. et al., manuscript submitted) prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SOX 10 in neural crest defects. Here we show that patients from four families with WS 4 have mutations in SOX 10, whereas no mutation could be detected in patients with HSCR alone. These mutations are {{likely to result in}} haploinsufficiency of the SOX 10 product. Our findings further define the locus heterogeneity of Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndromes, and point to an essential role of SOX 10 in the development of two neural crest-derived human cell lineages. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS; deafness with <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities)</b> is a congenital disorder {{caused by}} defective {{function of the}} embryonic neural crest. Depending on additional symptoms, WS is classified into four types: WS 1, WS 2, WS 3 and WS 4. WS 1 and WS 3 are caused by mutations in PAX 3, whereas WS 2 is heterogenous, being caused by mutations in the microphthalmia (MITF) gene in some but not all affected families. The identification of Slugh, a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in migratory neural crest cells, as the gene responsible for pigmentary disturbances in mice prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SLUG in neural crest defects. Here we show that two unrelated patients with WS 2 have homozygous deletions in SLUG which result in absence of the SLUG product. We further show that Mitf is present in Slug-deficient cells and transactivates the SLUG promoter, and that Slugh and Kit genetically interact in vivo. Our findings further define the locus heterogeneity of WS 2 and point to an essential role of SLUG {{in the development of}} neural crest-derived human cell lineages: its absence causes the auditory– pigmentary symptoms in at least some individuals with WS 2...|$|R
40|$|NoHere, {{we studied}} how {{epithelial}} energy metabolism impacts overall skin development by selectively deleting intraepithelial mtDNA in mice by ablating a key maintenance factor (TfamEKO), which induces {{loss of function}} of the electron transport chain (ETC). Quantitative (immuno) histomorphometry demonstrated that TfamEKO mice showed significantly reduced hair follicle (HF) density and morphogenesis, fewer intrafollicular keratin 15 + epithelial progenitor cells, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation. TfamEKO mice also displayed premature entry into (aborted) HF cycling by apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Ultrastructurally, TfamEKO mice exhibited severe HF dystrophy, <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and telogen-like condensed dermal papillae. Epithelial HF progenitor cell differentiation (Plet 1, Lrig 1 Lef 1, and β-catenin), sebaceous gland development (adipophilin, Scd 1, and oil red), and key mediators/markers of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions during skin morphogenesis (NCAM, versican, and alkaline phosphatase) were all severely altered in TfamEKO mice. Moreover, the number of mast cells, major histocompatibility complex class II+, or CD 11 b+ immunocytes in the skin mesenchyme was increased, and essentially no subcutis developed. Therefore, in contrast to their epidermal counterparts, pilosebaceous unit stem cells depend on a functional ETC. Most importantly, our findings point toward a frontier in skin biology: the coupling of HF keratinocyte mitochondrial function with the epithelial–mesenchymal interactions that drive overall development of the skin and its appendages...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{examining}} the relative influence of familial, genetic, and environmental covariate information in flexible nonparametric risk models. Our goal is investigating {{the relative importance of}} these three sources of information as they are associated with a particular outcome. To that end, we developed {{a method for}} incorporating arbitrary pedigree information in a smoothing spline ANOVA (SS-ANOVA) model. By expressing pedigree data as a positive semidefinite kernel matrix, the SS-ANOVA model is able to estimate a log-odds ratio as a multicomponent function of several variables: one or more functional components representing information from environmental covariates and/or genetic marker data and another representing pedigree relationships. We report a case study on models for retinal <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Our model verifies known facts about the epidemiology of this eye lesion—found in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration—and shows significantly increased predictive ability in models that include all three of the genetic, environmental, and familial data sources. The case study also shows that models that contain only two of these data sources, that is, pedigree-environmental covariates, or pedigree-genetic markers, or environmental covariates-genetic markers, have comparable predictive ability, but less than the model with all three. This result is consistent with the notions that genetic marker data encode—at least in part—pedigree data, and that familial correlations encode shared environment data as well...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory {{processes}} are {{implicated in the}} development and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, there are limited data on longitudinal associations between systemic markers of inflammation and AMD. The authors examined the prospective relation between the circulating white blood cell (WBC) count and early and late AMD in a population-based cohort of 3, 654 participants, aged 49 – 97 years, in the Blue Mountains region, Australia. The main outcome of interest was the 10 -year incidence of early and late AMD among individuals free from corresponding disease at the baseline (1992 – 1994). An elevated baseline WBC count was associated with early AMD incidence, independent of smoking and other major confounders. The multivariable relative risk comparing tertile 3 of WBC count (> 6. 7 3 109 cells/liter) with tertile 1 (5. 5 3 109 cells/liter) was 1. 85 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 33, 2. 58). The association between WBC count and early AMD was present consistently in analyses of different early AMD lesions, including incident <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and soft indistinct/reticular drusen. Moreover, this association persisted in subgroup analyses by gender and smoking. An elevated WBC count at baseline was not consistently associated with late AMD incidence. This study provides population-based evidence supporting a longitudinal association between the circulating WBC count, a widely available marker of inflammation, and incidence of early AMD. aged; Australia; inflammation; leukocyte count; macular degeneratio...|$|R
40|$|Waardenburg Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal-dominant {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the eyes, hair, and skin. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene mutations account for about 15 % of WS type II (WS 2) cases. To date, fewer than 40 different MITF gene mutations {{have been identified in}} human WS 2 patients, and few of these were of Chinese descent. In this study, we report clinical findings and mutation identification in the MITF gene of 20 Chinese WS 2 patients from 14 families. A high level of clinical variability was identified. Sensorineural hearing loss (17 / 20, 85. 0 %) and heterochromia iridum (20 / 20, 100. 0 %) were the most commonly observed clinical features in Chinese WS 2 patients. Five affected individuals (5 / 20, 25. 0 %) had numerous brown freckles on the face, trunk, and limb extremities. Mutation screening of the MITF gene identified five mutations: c. 20 A>G, c. 332 C>T, c. 647 _ 649 delGAA, c. 649 A>G, and c. 763 C>T. The total mutational frequency of the MITF gene was 21. 4 % (3 / 14), which is significantly higher than the 15. 0 % observed in the fair-skinned WS 2 population. Our results indicate that MITF mutations are relatively common among Chinese WS 2 patients...|$|R
40|$|Waardenburg-Shah {{syndrome}} (Waardenburg syndrome type IV-WS 4) is an auditory-pigmentary {{disorder that}} combines clinical features of <b>pigmentary</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the skin, hair and irides, sensorineural hearing loss, and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Mutations in the endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) gene on 13 q 22 {{have been found}} to cause this syndrome. Mutations in both alleles cause the full phenotype, while heterozygous mutations cause isolated HSCR or HSCR with minor pigmentary anomalies and/or sensorineural deafness. We investigated the status of the EDNRB gene, by FISH analysis, in three patients with de novo proximal 13 q deletions detected at cytogenetic analysis and examined the clinical variability of WS 4 among these patients. Chromosome 13 q was screened with locus specific FISH probes and breakpoints were determined at 13 q 22. 1 q 31. 3 in Patients I and 3, and at 13 q 21. 1 q 31. 3 in Patient 2. An EDNRB specific FISH probe was deleted in all three patients. All patients had common facial features seen in proximal 13 q deletion syndrome and mild mental retardation. However, findings related to WS 4 were variable; Patient 1 had hypopigmentation of the irides and HSCR, Patient 2 had prominent bicolored irides and mild bilateral hearing loss, and Patient 3 had only mild unilateral hearing loss. These data contribute new insights into the pathogenesis of WS 4. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
