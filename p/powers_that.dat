Along with Marcus Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> were nearly identical to the <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> Caesar had held under his constitution. As such, the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and he committed suicide with his lover, Cleopatra. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title of Augustus ("Exalted One"). He was convinced that only a single strong ruler could restore order in Rome.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, Death Grips {{launched}} Third Worlds, {{an imprint}} label of Harvest Records. They made their subsequent releases on this label. Their {{third and fourth}} albums, Government Plates and Fashion Week, released in November 2013 and January 2015 respectively, were well received by critics. Death Grips' fifth studio album is a double album consisting of two discs titled Niggas on the Moon and Jenny Death. Niggas on the Moon was released in June 2014. Jenny Death was highly anticipated and the complete double album, The <b>Powers</b> <b>That</b> B, was released in March 2015 to positive reviews, peaking at number 72 on the Billboard 200 chart. The <b>Powers</b> <b>That</b> B was followed by an EP titled Interview 2016 a year later. In May 2016, Death Grips released their sixth studio album, Bottomless Pit, which was met with positive reviews and peaked at number 193 on the Billboard 200 chart. The compilation album Fashion Week/Interview 2016 was released in November of that year.|$|E
5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces.

5|$|After Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony, who {{had been}} Caesar's Master of the Horse, formed an {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> were nearly identical to the <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> Caesar had held under his constitution, and as such, the senate and assemblies remained powerless.

Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and committed suicide in 30 BC. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome, as the unchallenged master of the state. In 27 BC, Octavian offered to give up the Dictatorial powers which he had held since 42 BC, but the senate refused, and thus ratified his status as master of the state. He became the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire was complete.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> come with an XP cost.|$|E

In 2012 following complaints from the ANC member of parliament Nomfunelo Mabedla, all the flags were removed from the parapet apart from the current flag of South Africa and the removed flags were placed in the castle's museum.|$|E
5|$|By 48 BC, {{after having}} {{defeated}} {{the last of}} his major enemies, Julius Caesar wanted to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed. He assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Caesar held the office of Roman Dictator, and alternated between the Consulship (the chief-magistracy) and the Proconsulship (in effect, a military governorship). In 48 BC, Caesar was given the powers of a Plebeian Tribune, which made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the Senate, and allowed him to dominate the legislative process. After Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate, and held <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> were nearly identical to the <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> Caesar had held under his constitution. While the conspirators who had assassinated Caesar were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the peace that resulted was only temporary. Antony and Octavian fought against each other in one last battle in 31 BC. Antony was defeated, and in 30 BC he committed suicide. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the state. The reign of Octavian, whom history remembers as Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, marked the dividing line between the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. By the time this process was complete, Rome had completed its transition from a city-state with a network of dependencies, to the capital of an empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> are not granted to Congress by the Constitution.

More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.
