5|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, John was passed from Eleanor into {{the care of}} a wet nurse, a {{traditional}} practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was <b>probably,</b> <b>like</b> his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulf de Glanvill, a leading English administrator. John spent some time {{as a member of the}} household of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.|$|E
5|$|The bishopric of Dunblane {{was a small}} diocese, {{essentially}} {{confined to}} the earldoms of Strathearn and Menteith. Size was a problem for providing the bishopric with adequate income, a problem {{compounded by the fact}} that Gille Brígte, Mormaer of Strathearn, had established Inchaffray Priory in 1200 (promoted to Abbey in 1221). In the 1440s, Bower wrote that Gille Brígte: Divided his earldom into three equal portions. One he gave to the church and bishop of Dunblane, the second to St John the Evangelist and the canons of Inchaffray, the third he kept for himself and his own needs. If this were not enough, much of the income not granted to Inchaffray had since been given to other religious institutions; some revenue was even controlled by the Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunblane had its origins in an older Gaelic monastic establishment, that is, in an institution with an abbot-bishop heading a relatively informal establishment of smaller cells with little geographical compactness. Dunblane emerged as a bishopric in 1155, <b>probably,</b> <b>like</b> bishoprics with a similar history (e.g. Brechin), having changed in little more than name. There was a community of Céli Dé at Muthill until at least the end of the 13th century, and the base for the archdeaconry of the diocese appears to have varied between there and Dunblane until the time of Bishop Clement. The bishopric itself appears to have been without a single base, although it was probably associated with both locations.|$|E
25|$|Irritator {{probably}} nourished {{itself on}} fish, like the pterosaurs found in large {{number in the}} Santana Formation. Irritator was <b>probably,</b> <b>like</b> today's crocodiles, a food generalist, eating all other animals that it could catch besides fish. A tooth belonging to Irritator still inserted into a fossil neck vertebral column of a pterosaur, indicates that Irritator ate pterosaurs as well, {{although it is not}} known if it actively hunted these animals, or simply scavenged the remains.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "boxcar" [...] was {{apparently}} {{a starting point}} for the song's lyrics, and Francis has suggested that this was in part inspired by the song [...] "Carnival of Sorts (Box Car)" [...] by R.E.M.: [...] "I <b>probably</b> <b>liked</b> the word 'boxcar' because I heard it on the R.E.M. song, from their first record." ...|$|R

I listened to Icky Mettle, and I almost cringe when I hear it. But what the people <b>probably</b> <b>liked</b> when they heard that record was the energy we were putting out." ...|$|R
25|$|The baptismal font of gray {{polished}} marble is original to the church. It is octagonal {{in shape}} and now stands on a painted, white sandstone pedestal of unknown origin that is not original. It is on the far northwest corner of the platform holding the pulpit. It was most <b>probably,</b> <b>like</b> that of all but three surviving fonts for colonial churches, made without a pedestal and placed on a table inside the church instead. Upton notes that it closely resembles baptismal bowls in books of standardized fonts common in England at the time.|$|E
25|$|Marriage {{to a great}} heiress {{came only}} with royal patronage, which in turn meant that Ranulf had to be {{respected}} and trusted by the king. Ranulf was <b>probably,</b> <b>like</b> his father, among the earliest and most loyal of Henry's followers, and was noted as such by Orderic Vitalis. Ranulf was however not recorded often at the court of Henry I, and did not form part of the king's closest group of administrative advisers. He witnessed charters only occasionally, though this became more frequent after he became earl. In 1106 he is found serving as one of several justiciars at York hearing a case about the lordship of Ripon. In 1116 he is recorded in a similar context.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were negative. TV Equals {{called the}} episode [...] "pretty funny," [...] {{particularly}} praising the episode's cold opening. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, noting that [...] "There have been worse.

500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were <b>probably</b> <b>like,</b> 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for DVD Talk, Paul Mavis [...] "highly recommended" [...] the Volume 1 season set, saying [...] " [...] is another winner from Nickelodeon DVD, and a must-have {{for parents who}} can't {{get enough of the}} braying little yellow sponge. Oh yeah; the kids will <b>probably</b> <b>like</b> it, too." [...] Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote [...] "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the {{importance}} of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of SpongeBob SquarePants. In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only [...] "recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "SpongeBob may, and I repeat, 'may,' be starting to level off."

500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd <b>probably</b> <b>like</b> to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{deemed to be}} a {{peripheral}} album in Zappa's catalog by music critics. Allmusic's Richie Unterberger critiqued what he {{referred to as the}} [...] "growing tendency to deploy the smutty, cheap humor that would soon dominate much of Zappa's work", but said that [...] "Those who like his late-'60s/early-'70s work [...] will <b>probably</b> <b>like</b> this fine".|$|E
2500|$|Stefani {{believed}} {{that some of}} the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, [...] " [...] were <b>probably</b> <b>like,</b> 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'." [...] She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became [...] "Hollaback Girl". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, [...] "To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long." [...] Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, [...] "Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style." ...|$|E

2500|$|Demand {{for oil in}} Asia {{has been}} growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China {{replaced}} the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity – The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of [...] supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State. However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional [...] to [...] to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world. There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries. In recent years, Chinese oil companies such as China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and PetroChina have bought over $30 billion in assets in Canadian oil sands projects, so they would <b>probably</b> <b>like</b> to export some of their newly acquired oil to China.|$|E
