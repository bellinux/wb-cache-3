The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches.

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of <b>personal</b> <b>characteristics</b> as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E

Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in spiritualism and use of mediums to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of Adolf Hitler throughout the late 1930s.|$|E

In turn, many of his characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills whilst dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe smoker (until he quit in the early '80s), so much so, that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit {{in order to improve}} his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking too.|$|E

However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some <b>personal</b> <b>characteristics</b> that made him a respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia.
