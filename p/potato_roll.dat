500|$|The {{grilled chicken}} {{sandwich}} is a chicken sandwich, {{consisting of a}} [...] flame-grilled chicken breast filet, mayonnaise, lettuce and tomatoes on a <b>potato</b> <b>roll.</b> In some Asian markets, such as Singapore, the filet is made from chicken thigh meat and uses a sesame-seed bun. Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request based on its long standing slogan [...] "Have It Your Way". Additionally, Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited time offerings (LTO), such as Chicken Caesar Club, made with Romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, bacon and caesar dressing on toasted sourdough bread, or the Carolina BBQ TenderGrill made with pepper jack cheese, bacon, jalapeños, red onion and a mustard-based barbecue sauce which was sold during Burger King's 2012 and 2013 Summer BBQ Menu promotions.|$|E
2500|$|Arch Deluxe – An {{attempt to}} produce a [...] "luxury" [...] hamburger, {{promoted}} by a high-profile advertising campaign (introduced in 1996), today {{considered one of the}} most expensive failures in McDonald's history. It featured a honey mustard-type sauce, quarter-pound beef patty on a <b>potato</b> <b>roll,</b> with leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, and cheese; peppered bacon was also offered for an extra charge. The Arch Deluxe was accompanied with three other burgers at the time, the Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Crispy Chicken Sandwich), the Grilled Chicken Deluxe (later renamed the Chicken McGrill), and the Fish Filet Deluxe (since discontinued along with the Arch Deluxe itself).|$|E

50|$|The {{restaurant}} {{could no}} longer meet the demand for Martin’s Potato Rolls, so in 1978, the bakery was moved to its present location on <b>Potato</b> <b>Roll</b> Lane in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. When the facility was initially built {{it was about a}} fifth of its current size.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Miya's was {{the first}} sushi {{restaurant}} in Connecticut, specializing in Kyushi-style recipes. With {{the creation of the}} sweet <b>potato</b> <b>roll</b> in 1995, Miya's began to create an original and non-traditional plant-based sushi menu. By the late 1990's, 80% of the sushi menu at Miya's had been converted into a plant-based one, and traditional sweetened white rice was replaced with whole grain brown rice-based blend. Also in 2005, Miya's introduced its first invasive species menu featuring locally caught invasive species such as Asian shore crabs and European green crabs.|$|E

50|$|The kati part of {{the name}} came later. Like {{everyone}} else in India, Nizam's used iron skewers to make their kababs; they were easy to maintain and lasted a lifetime. However, as Nizam's popularity grew, these long heavy iron skewers became problematic; as far more was required than could be handled. In 1964, Nizam moved to bamboo skewers that were lightweight and available in large numbers. These skewers are referred to in Bengali as kati or stick, and the names kati kabab and kati roll soon stuck. The name eventually became synonymous {{with any kind of}} paratha rolled with stuffing (even when neither kati nor kabab was involved) such as the egg roll or the <b>potato</b> <b>roll,</b> and later even for other breads such as naan or roomali.|$|E

60|$|Even at tea {{the floor}} rose beneath {{their feet and}} pitched too low again, and at dinner the ship seemed to groan and strain as though a lash were descending. She {{who had been a}} broad-backed dray-horse, upon whose hind-quarters pierrots might waltz, became a colt in a field. The plates slanted away from the knives, and Mrs. Dalloway's face blanched for a second as she helped herself and saw the <b>potatoes</b> <b>roll</b> this way and that. Willoughby, of course, extolled the virtues of his ship, and quoted what had been said of her by experts and {{distinguished}} passengers, for he loved his own possessions. Still, dinner was uneasy, and directly the ladies were alone Clarissa owned that she would be better off in bed, and went, smiling bravely.|$|R

500|$|To {{appeal to}} the adult market, BK offers several {{sandwiches}} and other products made with higher-quality ingredients such as whole-breast chicken fillets, Angus beef, and other [...] "premium" [...] ingredients. These sandwiches are usually served on a better-quality roll, such as baguettes or corn-dusted <b>potato</b> <b>rolls.</b> Through 2009 and 2010, the company added other higher-end product such as barbecued ribs, grilled fish, an improved grilled chicken sandwich, kebabs, and an extra-thick burger called the Steakhouse XT. Several industry publications claimed that these new offerings disrupt the differentiation between the fast-food and casual-dining markets {{with a combination of}} taste, competitive pricing, speed of service, and convenience. The adult-oriented products of Burger King and its competitors have been criticized by restaurant industry commentators as a temporary blip. The [...] "indulgent" [...] products are seen as blurring the lines between the fast-food and casual-dining market segments and, while they draw in newer customers looking for value, the effect may only be temporary. Once the economic instabilities of the late-2000s recession fade, customers may return to such casual chains as Chili's and leave the fast food chains back where they started in terms of customer numbers and profits.|$|R

40|$|Complementary DNA clones {{representing}} approximately 6100 nucleotides of <b>potato</b> leaf <b>roll</b> virus (PLRV) were generated, restriction-mapped, {{and partially}} sequenced. Within {{one of the}} cDNA clones an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 23 K protein was identified and further characterized. Amino acid sequence comparison of this protein showed significant homology (47. 1 ~) with the {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV-PAV) coat protein. This and other observations suggested that this gene encodes the PLRV coat protein. Other similarities were observed between PLRV and BYDV sequences in this region of their genomes, including an ORF of 17 K within the ORF encoding the 23 K putative coat protein. <b>Potato</b> leaf <b>roll</b> virus (PLRV), a member of the luteovirus group (Matthews, 1982) is difficult to control and is responsible for significant economic losses in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)

40|$|The present {{work was}} aimed {{to limit the}} {{practice}} of using pesticides in the managing program of the <b>potato</b> leaf <b>roll</b> disease on <b>potato</b> plants as the misuse of some pesticides had caused severe problems. The study was focused to find compounds nontoxic and safe for the biome. The antiviral activity of essential oils and latices tapped from different plants was investigated against <b>potato</b> leaf <b>roll</b> virus (PLRV). Essential oils from Eucalyptus citriodora leaves, Clove buds, and Fennel seeds were extracted. Latex of Aloe vera, Calotropis procera and Ficus elastic were collected. Essential oil and latex spray solutions were prepared at 5 and 10 % concentration. All the sprayings were done at 7 days interval. Inhibition of viral replication was monitored by amplification of PLRV capsid protein gene and mRNA expression using RT-PCR technique. Results depicted inhibitory potential of all the tested essential oils and latices against PLRV infestation and also the effect was found concentration dependent. Our data showed that Aloe vera latex and clove essential oil caused maximum inhibition viral mRNA at 10 % concentration. Qualitatively analyzed Tannin, Phlobactanins, Saponin, Flavonoids, Sterols and Terpens from essential oils and latices gave positive results {{in most of the}} oils and lesser content in plant latices.

50|$|Shizuoka oden is a {{variation}} of oden, a stew-like Japanese food consisting of fish paste cakes, boiled eggs, daikon, <b>potatoes,</b> kelp <b>rolls,</b> konnyaku, and other ingredients that are first boiled then kept simmering in a broth until consumption. Shizuoka oden differs from other types of oden in two ways: {{the preparation of the}} broth and the way every ingredient is skewered on a stick. The broth is made with beef sinew (instead of the dried skipjack flakes used in other types of oden) and seasoned with strong soy sauce. Because the simmering broth is only replenished rather than discarded, it takes on a very deep, brown-black color; but this process of adding new broth to old is what gives Shizuoka oden the distinctive flavor that many people find so delicious.|$|R

Ultrastructural examination of apex meristem and phloem ontogeny was carried out for healthy plants. In the development of potato light sprouts of plants infected with PLRV a great many anomalies have been described. Three types of light sprouts developed from infected tubers. Anatomical investigations indicated a rapid growth of the number of necroses in the phloem, and submicroscopic observations showed the presence of virus particles and cytopathological structures: tubular and vesicular structures, paramural bodies and callose deposits. In the companion cells of the phloem the occurrence of very regular inclusions of virus particles was recorded...|$|R
