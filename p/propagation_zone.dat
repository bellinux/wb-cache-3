40|$|Dynamics of {{array of}} coupled {{self-excited}} oscillators is considered. Model of Franklin bell is adopted {{as a mechanism}} for the self-excitation. The model allows derivation of exact analytic solutions for discrete breathers (DBs), and extensive exploration of their stability {{in the space of}} parameters. The DB solutions exist for all frequencies in the attenuation zone, but lose stability via Neimark-Sacker bifurcation near the boundary of <b>propagation</b> <b>zone.</b> Besides the well-known DBs with exponential localization, the considered system possesses additional and novel type of solutions - discrete breathers with main frequency in the <b>propagation</b> <b>zone</b> of the chain. The amplitude of oscillations in this solution is maximal at the localization site and then exponentially approaches constant value at infinity. We also derive these solutions in closed analytic form. They are stable in a narrow region of system parameters bounded by Neimark-Sacker and pitchfork bifurcations...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} waves {{propagating}} in an infinite {{plate with a}} line of equally spaced point masses on it. In particular, we consider waves that are laterally decaying, i. e. waves that exist due to the point masses, not in spite of them. We begin with a simple continuum limit and then study the discrete case using a suitable Green function and a superposition method used earlier for other structures by Mead. The superposition involves a slowly decaying series that we transform to a rapidly converging one using the Poisson summation formula. The system has two non-dimensional parameters, and on this parameter plane we find a <b>propagation</b> <b>zone</b> and its boundary. The boundary involves successive point masses vibrating n radians out of phase, a situation far from the continuum limit. Outside the <b>propagation</b> <b>zone,</b> waves get attenuated; however, unlike common examples of linear periodic structures, and contrary to the usual assumption made in studies thereof, here the waves show sub-exponential attenuation. In particular, the eventual decay of the wave amplitude is like the 3 / 2 power of distance {{from the point of}} excitation. We conclude with a theoretical explanation of the 3 / 2 power in the decay...|$|E

The results show normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation</b> velocities up to several meters per second. In addition, by including the voltage-current relation into the computational model, {{the influence of the}} n-value on the normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation</b> is determined.

40|$|Abstract—An {{accurate}} {{characterization of}} the wave propagation inside tunnels is of practical importance {{for the design of}} advanced communication systems. This paper presents a five-zone propagation model for large-size vehicles inside tunnels. Compared with existing models, the proposed model considers the influence of the large size of the vehicle, and covers all propagation mechanism zones and their dividing points. When a large-size vehicle is passing the transmitter, the received power suffers a deep fading as the direct wave is blocked by the vehicle itself. This zone is called the near shadowing zone. Then, when the vehicle has moved past the transmitter, the line of sight is recovered. If the vehicle is still close to the transmitter, the free space <b>propagation</b> <b>zone</b> starts. Then, as the distance increases, the vehicle enters the multi-mode <b>propagation</b> <b>zone,</b> where higher order modes are significant. Further away, when high order modes are greatly attenuated, guided propagation is stabilized. Finally, when the vehicle is extremely far from the transmitter, the waveguide effect vanishes because of the attenuation of reflected rays. Two sets of measurements are employed to validate the model. Results show good agreement, and therefore, the model presents an effective way to predict the propagation inside tunnels for large-size vehicles...|$|E

Examination revealed an overload region preceding the progressive slow crack <b>propagation</b> <b>zone.</b> From the analysis, it appears most probable that a crack was generated at the fillet of the base due to sudden inadvertent load. The crack thus produced acted as a notch for fatigue crack initiation and propagation under the fluctuating load resulting in failure of the antenna.

An integro-differential equation for the coherent (or average) wave is derived and solved for the case of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic medium and a delta-function source. This yields the coherent Green's function of the medium. It is found that the waveform of the coherent wave depends generally on the distance from the source measured in terms of a certain dimensionless parameter. Based on the magnitude of this parameter, three <b>propagation</b> <b>zones,</b> called the near zone, the far zone, and the intermediate zone, are defined...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of superconducting magnets {{has a high}} priority for particle accelerators, since the operational time and operational collision energy depend strongly on it. Local heat dissipation due to beam loss and conductor movement is inevitable, causing local hot spots in the conductor, possibly leading to magnet quench. For stability against local and transient energy deposition, the cable is the most important unit to investigate. Most superconducting accelerator magnets are wound from Rutherford cables with a flat cable layout, consisting of twisted strands. The mechanisms of normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation</b> in Rutherford cables have been described in detail with experimental and modeling data. The onset of a local normal zone forces current to redistribute in adjacent neighboring superconducting strands, reducing the longitudinal normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation.</b> Transversal normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation</b> in adjacent and crossing strands is caused by the redistribution of current and by heat exchange. The mechanism of normal <b>zone</b> <b>propagation</b> depends on thermodynamics and electrodynamics. For the first time the criteria for the minimum quench energy of superconducting cables is described in detail. The Minimum Quench Energy is investigated for a large range of heat deposition volumes and the for the existing LHC dipole magnets and for the future SIS 300 quadrupole magnets. Possible enhancements that improve the level of stability located at the thin edge, which has the lowest minimum quench energy, are examined by calculations and discussed...|$|R
30|$|Using the {{displacements}} {{obtained for}} the resized sample, the BC are closer to the <b>propagation</b> <b>zone,</b> thus their influence is increased. Moreover, since the displacement amplitudes are smaller, the signal-to-noise ratio is slightly lower. However, the data are extracted directly from the sample surface, thus the stiffness of the glue layer and the transmission of the load are no longer factors of influence. The resized sample is chosen {{as close as possible}} to the real specimen size but a reduction in height is necessary to avoid the influence of the U-shaped grips. For each case, the BC are extracted from both the upper and the lower part of the sample.|$|E

Based on the morphology and stress environment of the microcrack, a damaged zone or <b>propagation</b> <b>zone</b> around the crack tips, similar to the cohesive zone in classical fracture theories, is applied. Especially the scale of such a damaged zone represents a scale of the crack propagation. Its fast propagation would quickly bring a longer crack or cause cracks coalesce to form another longer one.

Understanding of the risk propagation is expected to provide new directions for effective supply chain risk management. Using systems thinking approach for modeling risk propagation in supply chain, we have developed a conceptual understanding of risk propagation levels and dimensions.

The period of the structure consists of a linear stiffness and a weak linear/nonlinear damping. Adapting the transfer matrix method and using harmonic balance for the nonlinear terms, a four-dimensional linear/nonlinear map governing the dynamics is obtained. We analyze this map by applying the method of multiple scales upto first order. The resulting slow evolution equations give the amplitude decay rate in the structure. The approximations are validated by comparing with other analytical solutions for the linear case and full numerics for the nonlinear case. Good agreement is obtained.
