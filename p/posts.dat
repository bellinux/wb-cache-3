5|$|The rich fur areas {{along the}} upper Mississippi, Minnesota, Des Moines, and Missouri Rivers, {{otherwise}} occupied by {{peoples of the}} First Nations, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin {{in the late eighteenth}} century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, these traders established fur <b>posts</b> in the Minnesota River valley at Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, Lac qui Parle, and Traverse des Sioux. The large fur companies also built <b>posts,</b> including the North West Company's stations at Pembina and St. Joseph in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these <b>posts</b> became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} were related to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading <b>posts</b> established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading <b>posts</b> of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these <b>posts</b> were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E

5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal <b>posts,</b> or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high <b>posts.</b> The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches.

5|$|Competition {{between the}} French and the Portuguese {{began to show}} itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading <b>posts</b> in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading <b>posts</b> in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E
