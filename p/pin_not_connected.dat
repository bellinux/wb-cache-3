50|$|The STD-32 is a pin {{compatible}} STD interface {{that allows}} the co-existence of both 8-bit and 32-bit systems on a single bus. This is accomplished {{by the addition of}} pins between the normal <b>pins</b> that do <b>not</b> <b>connect,</b> nor do they interfere with the original specification. This allows with the proper STD-32 backplane the ability to run legacy cards used for specific applications on the same bus without having to upgrade the complete system.|$|R
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel <b>pins</b> were <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|R
5000|$|An object’s {{execution}} {{order is}} determined by object connections and the data dependency rule. In general, an object with unconnected data input and sequence input pin will operate first. If an object's sequence input <b>pin</b> is <b>not</b> <b>connected,</b> it will execute as soon as data is present on all data inputs. On the other hand, if a sequence input pin is connected, although data is present on all data input pins, the object will hold its execution until the sequence input pin is pinged. This may not be applicable to some non-primitive objects like the Junction and Collector objects. For example, if object A’s sequence output pin is connected, it will fire only after object A has executed and no further execution is possible in the objects descended from the data output pins and error pin of object A.Some examples are taken from [...] and {{can be referred to}} for further explanation.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the number}} of wires doubled, {{the number of}} {{connector}} pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect {{a larger number of}} ground wires to the ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has <b>pin</b> 28 CSEL <b>not</b> <b>connected,</b> making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem was}} how to move from mode to mode. One option would be to signal this change—"put {{yourself}} into command mode"—via {{one of the many}} pins in the RS-232 cable. However, while the 25-pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose (even some meant for this purpose), the computer side often used a much smaller 9-pin connector, and equally often many of these <b>pins</b> were <b>not</b> actually <b>connected</b> or accessible from software. In fact, there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers, mostly the data in and out, [...] "ready" [...] indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational, and sometimes flow-control pins.|$|R
