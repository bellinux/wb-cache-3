50|$|No6 Mill was a three-high {{rolling mill}} with several stands (Sets of Rolls) {{producing}} bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets {{taken from the}} reheat furnaces. The small diameter rod and bar produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates. The operators used tongs to catch hold {{of the end of}} the red hot bar as it left the rolls, passed the bar around their body allowing it to loop out onto the floor and then entered the bar into the next <b>pass</b> <b>position.</b> In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air - within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.|$|E

30|$|Another {{emerging}} analysis {{approach to}} study team tactics studies investigates team passing behavior using network approaches (Watts and Strogatz 1998). The basic rationale {{of this approach}} is to model the players of a team as nodes and the passes occurring between them as weighted vertices where the number of passes between two players determine the weights (Duarte et al. 2012 a, b; Passos et al. 2011). This representation of team passing behavior allows to easily identify key players within in a team as they display more connection to other vertices accompanied by greater vertex weights (Gama et al. 2014; Passos et al. 2011). Recent network analyses which included next to the player information also <b>pass</b> <b>position</b> information were able to predict game outcomes and the final ranking of the top teams using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier (Cintia et al. 2015). Similar, Wang et al. (2015) used Bayesian latent model approach applied to passing network and passing position information from 241 games from the Spanish First (2013 – 2014). The obtained model was able to automatically identify different tactical patterns across teams. By combining the obtained tactical information with attacking success the authors were further able to show which specific tactical patterns were more efficient across teams. By investigating the contributions by the individual players to each tactical pattern the authors were further able to determine individual contributions by the players to each tactical pattern (Wang et al. 2015). Together these results suggest that players interactions mediated through passing behavior in combination with spatial information provides an interesting new approaches to analyze tactical behavior in elite soccer thereby providing much more information compared to traditional notational analysis approaches.|$|E

The Japanese government has designated 98 areas as Bicycle-Friendly Model Areas. In this study, we try to understand through a survey the relationship between the <b>passing</b> <b>position</b> of pedestrians and bicycle users by improvement of {{the pavement}} environment and we observe the <b>passing</b> <b>positions</b> of each. The investigation area is two Bicycle-Friendly Model Areas in Shiga, and the investigation types are the pole separation type, the fence separation type, and the visual separation type. As a result, we consider that the fence separation type is effective build for both pedestrians and bicycle users from the three types. However we consider that the pole separation type may be desirable when we consider the risk of separation structure built continually and the rate of actual application...|$|R

As the Bahraini government has failed to offer meaningful concessions to political reform, it has splintered and radicalised an opposition unsure what to do next, but also undermined its own constituency of support among the island's Sunni communities. These trajectories have set in motion a radical reconfiguring of the island's political landscape in ways that do not augur well for longer-term prospects for reconciliation and recovery...|$|R
