40|$|In this study, to {{complement}} our previously proposed method for estimating muscle fiber orientation, the Gabor filter bank (GF) technique {{was applied to}} sonograms of the biceps and forearm muscles to longitudinally enhance the coherently oriented and hyperechoic <b>perimysiums</b> regions. The method involved three steps: orientation field estimation, frequency map computation and Gabor filtering. The method was evaluated using a simulated image distorted with multiplicative speckle noises where the "muscles" were arranged in a bipennate fashion with an "aponeurosis" located in the middle. After enhancement using the GF approach, most of the original hyperechoic bands in the simulated image could be recovered. The proposed method was also tested using a group of biceps and forearm muscle sonograms collected from healthy adult subjects. Compared with the sonograms without enhancement, the enhanced images led to the detection of more linear patterns including muscle fascicles and smaller angle differences compared with the mean of manual results from two operators, therefore, were better prepared for the automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientation. The proposed method {{has the potential of}} assisting in the visualization of strongly oriented patterns in skeletal muscle sonograms {{as well as in the}} semi-automatic estimation of muscle fiber orientations.

5000|$|Recent {{advances}} in muscle physiology {{suggest that the}} <b>perimysium</b> {{plays a role in}} transmitting lateral contractile movements. This hypothesis is strongly supported in one exhibition of the existence of [...] "Perimysial Junctional Plates" [...] in ungulate Flexor carpi radialis muscles constructed by E Passerieux. The overall comprehensive organization of the <b>perimysium</b> collagen network, as well as its continuity and disparateness, however, have still not been observed and described thoroughly everywhere within the muscle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perimysium</b> is a sheath of {{connective}} tissue that groups muscle fibers into bundles (anywhere between 10 and 100 or more) or fascicles.|$|E
50|$|Endomysium {{combines}} with <b>perimysium</b> and epimysium {{to create}} the collagen fibers of tendons, providing the tissue connection between muscles and bones by indirect attachment.|$|E
50|$|The term cardiac {{skeleton}} {{is sometimes}} considered synonymous with endomysium in the heart, but cardiac skeleton also {{refers to the}} combination of the endomysium and <b>perimysium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Myocytes {{are bound}} {{together}} by <b>perimysium</b> into bundles called fascicles; the bundles are then grouped {{together to form}} muscle tissue, which is enclosed in a sheath of epimysium. The <b>perimysium</b> contains blood vessels and nerves which provide for the muscle fibers. Muscle spindles are distributed throughout the muscles and provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. Myosin is shaped like a long shaft with a rounded end pointed out towards the surface. This structure forms the cross bridge that connects with the thin filaments.|$|E
5000|$|In anatomy, {{a muscle}} {{fascicle}} is {{a bundle of}} skeletal muscle fibers surrounded by <b>perimysium,</b> a type of connective tissue. (There is also a nerve fascicle of axons.) ...|$|E
50|$|Connective {{tissue is}} present in all muscles as fascia. Enclosing each muscle is a layer of {{connective}} tissue known as the epimysium; enclosing each fascicle is a layer called the <b>perimysium,</b> and enclosing each muscle fiber is a layer of connective tissue called the endomysium.|$|E
50|$|Muscle {{tissue is}} a soft tissue that composes muscles in animal bodies, and {{gives rise to}} muscles' ability to contract. This is opposed to other {{components}} or tissues in muscle such as tendons or <b>perimysium.</b> It is formed during embryonic development through {{a process known as}} myogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Skeletal {{muscles are}} {{sheathed}} by a tough layer of connective tissue called the epimysium. The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, {{each of which}} contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a <b>perimysium.</b> Besides surrounding each fascicle, the <b>perimysium</b> is a pathway for nerves and {{the flow of blood}} within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle. Scattered throughout the muscles are muscle spindles that provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. (This grouping structure is analogous to the organization of nerves which uses epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium).|$|E
5000|$|Epimysium (plural epimysia) (Greek epi- for on, upon, {{or above}} + Greek mys for muscle) The epimysium is the fibrous tissue {{envelope}} that surrounds skeletal muscle. [...] It is {{a layer of}} dense irregular connective tissue which ensheathes the entire muscle and protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. [...] It is continuous with fascia and other connective tissue wrappings of muscle including the endomysium and <b>perimysium.</b> It is also continuous with tendons, where it becomes thicker and collagenous.|$|E
50|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, the myelin sheath of each axon in a nerve is {{wrapped in a}} delicate protective sheath known as the endoneurium. Within the nerve, axons targeting the same anatomical location are bundled together into groups known as fascicles, each surrounded by another protective sheath known as the perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. This grouping structure {{is analogous to the}} muscular organization system of epimysium, <b>perimysium</b> and endomysium.|$|E
50|$|This fibrous {{connective}} tissue interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication {{in the form of}} aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone (periosteum and endosteum); cartilage (perichondrium), and blood vessels (tunica externa) and become specialized in muscles (epimysium, <b>perimysium,</b> and endomysium) and nerves (epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium). The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.|$|E
5000|$|This {{disruption}} of muscle fibers triggers {{white blood cells}} to increase following induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded {{to be associated with}} inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium, <b>perimysium,</b> and/or endomysium. The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise. The products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K+) accumulate outside cells. These substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle [...]|$|E
50|$|The three-element Hill muscle {{model is}} a {{representation}} of the muscle mechanical response. The model is constituted by a contractile element (CE) and two non-linear spring elements, one in series (SE) and another in parallel (PE). The active force of the contractile element comes from the force generated by the actin and myosin cross-bridges at the sarcomere level. It is fully extensible when inactive but capable of shortening when activated. The connective tissues (fascia, epimysium, <b>perimysium</b> and endomysium) that surround the contractile element influences the muscle's force-length curve. The parallel element represents the passive force of these connective tissues and has a soft tissue mechanical behavior. The parallel element is responsible for the muscle passive behavior when it is stretched, even when the contractile element is not activated. The series element represents the tendon and the intrinsic elasticity of the myofilaments. It also has a soft tissue response and provides energy storing mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Functionally, the {{external}} ear {{is served by}} three (3) ear muscles, the auricularis posterior muscle (rear ear-muscle), the auricularis superior muscle (upper ear-muscle), and the auricularis anterior muscle (front ear-muscle), the most notable {{of which is the}} auricularis posterior muscle, which functions to pull the ear backwards, because it is superficially attached to the ponticulus (bridge) of the conchal cartilage, and to the posterior auricular ligament (rear ligament of the ear). The posterior muscle of the ear is composed of 2-3 fascicles (skeletal-muscle fibers contained in <b>perimysium</b> connective tissue), originates from the mastoid process of the temporal bone and is inserted to {{the lower part of the}} cranial surface of the concha, where it is surrounded by fibroareolar tissue deep within the temporal fascia. The posterior auricular artery irrigates the ear tissues with small, branch-artery blood vessels (rami). Likewise, the rear muscle of the ear is innervated with fine rami of the posterior auricular nerve, which is a branch of the facial nerve. Deep within these muscle and ligament structures lie the mastoid fascia and the tendinous origin of the sternomastoid muscle.|$|E
5000|$|Congenital contractural {{arachnodactyly}} (CA) is a non-lethal {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder in cattle. [...] An autosomal recessive defect {{is a disease}} caused {{by the presence of}} two recessive mutant genes on an autosome. CA is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, specifically a disorder of the endomysium and <b>perimysium.</b> The defect in the muscle connective tissue results in a reduced range of elastic extension. CA is also known as 'Fawn calf syndrome'. CA is predominately associated with Angus cattle, however it has also been detected in other Angus associated breeds such as Murray Greys. CA was first identified in Victoria, Australia in 1998. However, it has now been discovered in many other countries. CA calves are almost always born alive, most being able to walk and suckle on their mother's teat leading to their survival in the early stages, although around 20% of CA calves die soon after birth. Differences in phenotypes are not normally noticeable and the weight of new born CA calves are seen to be normal, this means that CA is not always recognised. [...] CA is caused by a specific error in the DNA. This means it can be passed on from parents to offspring. Any cattle known to carry any category one genetic condition such as CA cannot be registered with cattle societies. The carriers of category 1 defects are all identifiable in the Australian Angus database. CA calves that survive are exposed to joint dislocation and early onset of arthritis. This is a result of their flexible joint laxity. Although CA is not as severe as other genetic diseases in cattle such as Mannosidosis (MA), Arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), CA is nonetheless a cause of calf deaths in herds where prevalence of the CA mutation in the herd is high and carrier sires are still being used. Diagnosis of CA can be made with a physical examination of new born calves. This should be done in the first 24 hours after birth, preferably done by a veterinarian or experienced breeder. Despite the variations between severe and non-severe cases, CA is easily diagnosed in a live new born calf. Both males and females can be affected. The following symptoms are observed: congenital proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension, congenital kyphosis and significant postnatal improvement in these clinical signs as the calf grows and matures. CA is not a difficult diagnosis however it requires careful physical examination of the calf followed by constant observation for improvement. Additional signs are present in the calves CA causes but can be more difficult to identify especially in mild cases. These include abnormal long leg bones resulting in a tall stature, loose jointedness, poor muscling and knee knocking [...] To prevent cattle being affected by CA, sires should be pedigree analysed to minimise the chance of the mutation. If CA is identified in a herd, other bloodlines which have tested negative for CA should be purchased. Some predominant Angus sires identified with CA are Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT During {{skeletal}} muscle development, transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) {{is a potent}} inhibitor of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, {{as well as a}} regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich ECM proteoglycans, binds to TGF-β 1 and modulates TGF-β 1 -dependent cell growth stimulation or inhibi-tion. The expression of decorin can be regulated by TGF-β 1 during muscle proliferation and differentia-tion. How TGF-β 1 affects decorin and muscle growth, however, has not been well documented in vivo. The present study investigated the effect of TGF-β 1 on decorin expression and intracellular connective tissue development during {{skeletal muscle}} growth. Exogenous TGF-β 1 significantly decreased the number of myofi-bers in a given area at both 1 d and 6 wk posthatch. The TGF-β 1 -treated muscle had a significant decrease in decorin mRNA expression at embryonic day (ED) 10, whereas protein amounts decreased at 17 ED and 1 d posthatch compared to the control muscle. Decorin was localized in both the endomysium and <b>perimysium</b> in the control pectoralis major muscle. Transforming growth factor-β 1 reduced decorin in both the endomy-sium and <b>perimysium</b> from 17 ED to 6 wk posthatch. Compared to the control muscle, the <b>perimysium</b> space in the pectoralis major muscle was dramatically de-creased by TGF-β 1 during embryonic development through posthatch growth. Because decorin regulates collagen fibrillogenesis, a major component of the ECM, the reduction of decorin by TGF-β 1 treatment may cause the irregular formation of collagen fibrils, leading to the decrease in endomysium and <b>perimysium</b> space. The results from the current study suggest that the effect of TGF-β 1 on decorin expression and local-ization was likely associated with altered development of the <b>perimysium</b> and the regulation of muscle fiber development.

40|$|Three muscles (Longissimus thoracis, Semimembranosus, Biceps femoris) of 40 young bulls from 3 breeds {{were used}} to {{quantify}} structural characteristics of bovine connective tissue by image analysis, with both macroscopic and microscopic approaches. Collagen and proteoglycan content was also investigated. <b>Perimysium</b> occupied a greater area (8 vs 6 %), and was wider (42 vs 2 mu m) and shorter per unit area (1. 9 vs 30 mm mm(- 2)) than endomysium. <b>Perimysium</b> and endomysium from Longissimus were thinner, less ramified than in Biceps. Longissimus showed less total collagen and cross-linking and more proteoglycans (P< 0. 0001) than Biceps muscle. Blond d'Aquitaine <b>perimysium</b> occupied less area, was more ramified and muscles contained less collagen, cross-linking and more proteoglycans than Angus (P< 0. 001). Limousin was intermediate. High proteoglycan content in muscle containing less total collagen suggested a complementarity between these molecules. They might influence mechanical properties of intramuscular connective tissue. This was especially true given that proteoglycans and total collagen were negatively and positively linked with structural parameters, respectively...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that tenascin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, contributes to fibrotic changes in dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: The localisation of tenascin in biopsy specimens of the hearts obtained from eight patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was examined using staining by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. RESULTS: (1) <b>Perimysium</b> and endomysium. Although positive staining for tenascin was observed in the enlarged <b>perimysium</b> and endomysium in all patients, moderately intense staining was characteristically observed near the replacement fibrotic lesions. In the narrow <b>perimysium</b> and endomysium of the myocardium not containing replacement fibrotic lesions, tenascin was not present, as in the control specimens. (2) Replacement fibrotic lesions. Non-homogeneous positive staining for tenascin was detected in all replacement fibrotic lesions examined. Intense tenascin deposition was observed in the peripheral portion of the replacement fibrotic lesions. The tenascin staining observed in the small replacement fibrotic lesions was more intense than that in the large lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Tenascin contributes {{to the development of}} the fibrotic changes seen in the dilated cardiomyopathic heart. Its characteristic location, specifically the distribution along the margin of the fibrosis, suggests that fibrotic change is a continuous process in hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|E

40|$|Meat {{characteristics}} of Cobb- 500 and Ross boiler strains {{in terms of}} histomorphometry of myocyte, fat tissue and connective tissue were studied. Two representative muscles from breast (Pectoralis thoracis and Supracoracoideus) and two from thigh (Ilitibialis lateralis and Iliotibialis cranialis) were selected. Thicker myofiber in breast and thinner myofiber in thigh were found in Ross strain. The perimysial thickness significantly differed among the muscles. The perimysial thickness of breast and thigh muscle at 28 th day and thigh muscle at 35 th day of Cob- 500 were found higher that indicate more toughness of representative muscles. Thick and broad bundles of collagen fiber were observed in <b>perimysium</b> of Ilitibialis lateralis and thinner but broad bundles were in <b>perimysium</b> of Pectoralis thoracis muscle. At 35 th day of age the endomysial thickness was found same in both strains but at 28 th day of age it was higher in Cobb- 500 than that of Ross strain. The intramuscular fat deposited mainly within <b>perimysium</b> as cluster and the number (per focus) {{and the size of}} adipocyte diameter was differed among the muscles.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect on}} intramuscular connective tissue and passive range of joint motion by the stress produced in limb lengthening. MethodsAn animal model of limb lengthening {{was established in the}} tibia of rabbits. Distraction was initiated at a rate of 1 mm/d and 2 mm/d in two steps respectively, and both proceeded until 10 % and 20 % of the tibia length was achieved. Muscle samples were harvested at the time when distraction ended and at the 4 th week of consolidation after the distraction. Scanning electron microscope was applied to observe the morphological changes of the <b>perimysium.</b> The goniometer, which we made for this study, was used to measure the passive range of joint motion. ResultsThe collagen fibers were partitioned in bundles, crimped and interconnected closely and orderly. In the regime of 1 mm/d distraction with 10 % lengthening, no apparent changes of the collagen fiber and passive range of joint motion was demonstrated. When tibia was increased to 20 %, the crimped fibers showed a tendency of being straightened while the passive range of joint motion was reduced. The findings remained the same at the 4 th week of consolidation. In the regime of 2 mm/d distraction with 10 % lengthening, the crimped structure of the collagen fibers in the <b>perimysium</b> disappeared and the fibers were almost straightened. Additionally, the interconnection of the collagen fibers became loosened and interstice was presented among the fibers. At the 4 th week of consolidation, the restoration to the original crimped structure was not completed. When the lengthening ratio was increased to 20 %, the collagen fibers were straightened completely. This condition remained unchanged throughout all 4 weeks. The passive range of joint motion was reduced dramatically in the regime of 2 mm/d distraction. ConclusionsThe ultrastructure of <b>perimysium</b> and the passive range of joint motion in the regime of 1 mm/d lengthening shows the condition closest to the normal ones. The regime of 2 mm/d lengthening may cause an apparent change in the ultrastructure of <b>perimysium</b> and passive range of joint motion...|$|E

40|$|Selective {{staining}} of the {{connective tissue}} and image {{analysis showed that}} in the extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles of the rat {{there was an increase}} in the thickness of the endomysium in both early growth and senility. The <b>perimysium</b> thickness was more or less constant throughout life except in senility when the concentration of this component also increased. The stiffness (length-passive tension) of these muscles was found to increase throughout life. Log transforms of the length-passive tension plots had particularly steep slopes in the senile extensor digitorum longus muscle. Except in the senile soleus muscle, the increase in stiffness was closely correlated with the increase in endomysium and <b>perimysium</b> and with total muscle collagen (as measured biochemically) with age. The relationship between the initial length and the active tension in the extensor digitorum longus muscle changed with age.

40|$|In {{the past}} {{it has been}} proven {{difficult}} to separate and characterize collagen from muscle because of its relative paucity in this tissue. The present report presents a comprehensive methodology, combining methods previously described by McCollester [(1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 57, 427 - 437] and Laurent, Cockerill, McAnulty & Hastings [(1981) Anal. Biochem. 113, 301 - 312], in which the three major tracts of muscle connective tissue, the epimysium, <b>perimysium</b> and endomysium, may be prepared and separated from the bulk of muscle protein. Connective tissue thus prepared may be washed with salt and treated with pepsin to liberate soluble native collagen, or can be washed with sodium dodecyl sulphate to produce a very clean insoluble collagenous product. This latter type of preparation {{may be used for}} quantification of the ratio of the major genetic forms of collagen or for measurement of reducible cross-link content to give reproducible results. It was shown that both the epimysium and <b>perimysium</b> contain type I collagen as the major component and type III collagen as a minor component; <b>perimysium</b> also contained traces of type V collagen. The endomysium, the sheaths of individual muscle fibres, was shown to contain both type I and type III collagen as major components. Type V collagen was also present in small amounts, and type IV collagen, the collagenous component of basement membranes, was purified from endomysial preparations. This is the first biochemical demonstration of the presence of type IV collagen in muscle endomysium.

METHODS: Immunohistochemical study of the biopsied myocardium using type specific anticollagen antibodies (I, III, IV, V, VI) was performed in 12 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and six non-diabetic patients. There was no history of hypertension or coronary artery stenosis {{in any of the}} patients. RESULTS: Noticeable accumulations of collagen types I, III, and VI in the myocardial interstitium were recognised in both groups, but little accumulation of types IV or V was found. Types I and III mainly stained in the <b>perimysium</b> and perivascular region, while type VI predominantly stained in the endomysium.
