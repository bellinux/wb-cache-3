40|$|The solid {{propellant}} gas generators having high gas capacity {{are widely used}} for fast pressurization of elastic shells of saving devices of different applications. A typical example of such devices are safety system of automobile (airbags). After collision of an automobile with an obstacle the combustion products of gas generator fill the shell during 60 – 100 milliseconds. However the temperature of combustion products even of “low-temperature ” fuel compositions of gas generators appears not below 1500 К and to reduce of its {{it is necessary to}} apply a various types of porous and filling granular filters. There are passive and active granular filters. The passive filter can cool of combustion products as a result of absorption of heat only. The active cooling is evaporation of the granule material and in this case takes a place more intensive cooling of combustion products in the filter. The numerical modeling of cooling process of high-temperature combustion products at their movement in bulk of granular filter of active cooling is investigated. As the material of granules was used the carbonate of magnesium. At its heating takes a place process of gasification and formation of a <b>porous</b> <b>slag</b> shell which sublimates at higher temperature. The physical model of such spherical granule can be presented as the central part consisting of the carbonate magnesium surrounded with the <b>porous</b> <b>slag</b> spherical shell through which gaseous products of gasification of the central part are filtered. The problem of distribution of heat in each granule is Stefan problem when at the given temperature on the surface of sphere there is the front of gasificatio...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) removal {{mechanisms}} from waste {{stabilization pond}} effluent by a melter slag filter were investigated. The studied filter had treated pond effluent for a decade, but lost its P removal efficiency after 5 years. The P {{distribution in the}} slag was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical fractionation. The results showed the slag to be covered by a film comprising metal oxides/oxyhydroxides, organic resin, and Fe-phosphate precipitates. The slag porous matrix beneath this film hosted lower P concentrations and consisted of metal oxides/oxyhydroxides and calc-magnesium silicates. The study revealed the following mechanisms for P removal from effluent by the melter slag: (1) P adsorption onto metal oxides/oxyhydroxides which are ubiquitous throughout the <b>porous</b> <b>slag</b> matrix and its surface film; (2) P precipitation, mainly as Fe-phosphates (determined by SEM/EDS) on the surface film, derived from the release of metal ions into the solution phase; and (3) P sequestration by an amorphous organic resin that comprises a substantial proportion of the surface film, which was deduced by SEM/EDS and XRF. Results of chemical extractions performed on the slag demonstrated that 1 M HCl, which {{has been used to}} determine Ca-associated P in previous studies, is an unreliable Ca−P marker. By contrast, the citrate−dithionite reagent was shown to be a good indicator of Fe/Al-associated P and revealed that adsorption onto metal oxides/oxyhydroxides, in the porous matrix as well as its surface film, is the most significant P removal mechanism achieved by the slag filter...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the strain-stress distribution (SSD) of <b>porous</b> glass (foamed <b>slag</b> glass, FSG) is assessed by annealing temperature curves according to the given values of the thermomechanical and thermophysical properties of porous glass, which are in correlation with the properties data of the host glass and its structure. When calculating cooling processes (cooling rate) of porous glass products, the A. N. Dauvalter's formula, which takes into account only the stresses arising from the safe product cooling, but {{does not take into}} account those that remained there to the cooling start point, is usually used. The cooling rate in the interval of the annealing zone itself should be sufficiently low so that residual stresses, arising after they pass it, have small values. Since methods, that make it possible to determine the residual stresses that appear in the porous glass after passing through the initial annealing zone, are currently poorly developed, numerical simulation methods should be used to determine the porous glass SSD under the influence of thermal loads. Numerical study of the strain-stress distribution of porous glass allowing for thermal loads in the annealing temperature range was carried out in the Ansys Workbench software package...|$|R
5000|$|Flake Hammerscale is {{produced}} in large quantities during multiple stages of the smithing process. To create the pure iron necessary for forging, a smith must first purify the iron ore. The smelting of ore creates a ‘bloom’, a <b>porous</b> mixture of <b>slag</b> and metal. The smith then repeatedly heats and hammers the bloom to remove impurities. This technique creates hammerscale of varying composition. As the purification process continues, the hammerscale’s iron content increases. [...] Additional hammerscale {{is produced}} during the forging of the pure iron from the heating and hammering necessary to shape the piece. The scale produced at this stage is characterized by its blue-black color and tends to be slimmer and darker due to its incredibly high iron oxide content. Archeologists believe that spheroidal hammerscale is produced primarily during the process known as fire welding. Also known as forge welding, this technique is used to connect two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and forcing them together with a hammer or other tool. For this method to be successful, the surface of each piece of metal must be molten. As the smith hammers the pieces together, some metal is forced out from between them, often {{in the form of}} a molten jet which cools in the air to form spheroidal hammer scale. It is also possible for spheroidal hammerscale to form during the purification of slag. As the smith hammers a bloom, it compacts which can drive molten metal out of the slag into the air.|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} some aspects {{concerning}} secondary metallurgy of steel {{where there is}} little or very inconsistent information in the literature. More specifically, it is devoted to the studies on high temperature phase equilibria in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system, the formation of ladle glaze and the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron. First, the solidification of different slags on MgO based refractories was studied in order to reveal the mechanism behind the formation of “ladle glaze”. The formation of the slag glaze layer was studied by dipping MgO rods, dense or <b>porous,</b> into liquid <b>slags</b> at 1873 K. The rods were thereafter cooled at a predetermined rate. From a later SEM-EDS microscopy, {{it was found that the}} initial slag composition had the most profound effect on the phases found in the solidified slag layer. It was found that the type of MgO rod used and cooling speed had a minor impact on the morphology on the solidified samples. In addition, the slags used in the study were equilibrated at 1773 K, 1673 K and 1573 K in order to get an understanding of the equilibrium phases and their relationship during cooling. On the basis of the experimental results, the mechanism regarding entrainment of exogenous inclusions from the refractory lining was also discussed. Secondly, phase diagram studies in the high basicity region of the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were performed using the quench technique followed by EPMA analysis. The main focus in the study was to find the liquidus surfaces for MgO and CaO saturation at 1773 and 1873 K. Based on the experimental data, phase diagrams for the 25, 30 and 35 mass percent alumina sections were constructed for silica contents generally less than 20 mass percent [...] The results generally agreed very well with previous, well established phase diagrams. In addition, the activities of MgO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 were estimated using the phase diagram information. At last, the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron at 1823 K were studied. In a pre-study, the thermodynamics of Ag-Mg solutions were studied, necessary for the Fe-Mg system. For the Ag-Mg system, two different experimental techniques were used; the vapor pressure method and the gas equilibration technique. The temperature range of the Ag-Mg study was 1573 to 1823 K. It was found that the excess Gibbs energy of this system can be described quite well with a sub-regular solution model. In the Fe-Mg study, the partition of Mg between liquid iron and liquid silver were studied at 1823 K. Using the results from the pre-study, the activity coefficient of Mg in liquid iron and the self-interaction parameter were determined at 1823 K. QC 2011031...|$|R
