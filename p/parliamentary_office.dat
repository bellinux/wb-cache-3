5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{began in}} Britain's Australasian colonies {{at the close}} of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage (the right to vote and stand for <b>parliamentary</b> <b>office)</b> in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, {{the second phase of the}} project was {{intended}} to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have been on this planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a redirection of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the new developments. For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>office</b> building, Portcullis House, which sits above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Duceppe {{was accused}} of having used funds {{designated}} for his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>office</b> to pay the Bloc Québécois' general manager over a seven-year period. Duceppe denied any wrongdoing when testifying before the House of Commons Board of Internal Economy in February. In November 2012, the House of Commons Board of Internal Economy found that Duceppe misused funds. However, the board cannot take disciplinary action as the money was spent before the by-laws around the issue were changed.|$|E

25|$|Until 2005, the {{position}} of Government House Leader was not technically a cabinet-level post, but rather a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>office,</b> so to qualify for cabinet membership, an individual had to be named to cabinet in some other capacity. For a time, with {{the position}} having evolved into a full-time job, Government House Leaders have been named to cabinet as Ministers of State with no portfolio specified. The Martin government created these positions so that the Minister of State title is effectively invisible. An amendment to the Salaries Act made this unnecessary by listing the Government House Leader as a minister.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} Church {{has never}} shied from involvement in Scottish politics. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the Church and Society Council. The Church of Scotland was (and is) a firm opponent of nuclear weaponry. Supporting devolution, {{it was one}} of the parties involved in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which resulted in the setting up of the Scottish Parliament in 1997. Indeed, from 1999–2004 the Parliament met in the Kirk's Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland actively supports the work of the Scottish Churches <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Office</b> in Edinburgh.|$|E
500|$|The Pirate Party Germany's {{parliamentary}} {{group in the}} Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin (the Berlin state parliament) has insisted on {{the inclusion of a}} break called [...] "pony time", in which an episode from the series is shown, during their meetings at their <b>parliamentary</b> <b>office,</b> which displeased many other members in the Berlin parliament. The internet activist group Anonymous used the character Rainbow Dash to deface the website of the Social Democratic Party of Austria in 2011 and 2012. A teenage white hat hacker used the name [...] "Pinkie Pie" [...] for anonymity and a fan drawing of the character wielding an axe as part of a successful entry in an early 2012 contest sponsored by Google Chrome to break the security of the web browser; the same user also was the first to break the security in a second contest held later in 2012, and found an important security flaw in the Linux kernel. A May 2013 update to Google Hangouts included an easter egg that would have Friendship Is Magic-inspired ponies run across the chat window. A similar update in August 2013 as part of YouTube's [...] "Geek Week" [...] added two easter eggs, one that would cause ponies to cross the screen on searching for [...] "bronies", and a second that, if searching on a number of different pony names like [...] "Twilight Sparkle", would change the site's title bar to a representative color of that pony.|$|E

He attempted to re-enter parliament later that year through a by-election in Assiniboia, Saskatchewan but was defeated by former Saskatchewan Premier James Garfield Gardiner.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015 the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Office</b> of Science and Technology {{released}} a briefing which stated that [...] "There is widespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether {{is not seen}} as an acceptable policy option in the U.K." [...] and that [...] "Even if it were, there would be technical challenges." [...] The report further noted that Tor [...] "plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children" [...] (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the Internet Watch Foundation, the utility of its hidden services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.|$|E
