50|$|<b>Pressureless</b> {{sintering}} {{is another}} method for processing and densifying UHTCs. <b>Pressureless</b> sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold {{in order to}} promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial die compaction, and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. Exaggerated grain growth that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic sinterability and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB2 by <b>pressureless</b> sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2150 °C for 9 h (Figure 3). Efforts to control grain size and improve densification have focused on adding third phases to the UHTCs, some examples of these phases include the addition of boron and iridium. Addition of Ir in particular has shown an increase in the toughness of HfB2/20vol.% SiC by 25%. Sintered density has also been shown to increase with the addition of Fe (up to 10% w/w) and Ni (up to 50% w/w) to achieve densifications of up to 88% at 1600 °C. More advances in <b>pressureless</b> sintering must be made before it can be considered a viable method for UHTC processing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pressureless</b> {{sintering}} is the sintering of {{a powder}} compact (sometimes {{at very high}} temperatures, depending on the powder) without applied pressure. This avoids density variations in the final component, which occurs with more traditional hot pressing methods.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pressureless</b> {{perfect fluid}} can be {{interpreted}} as a model of a configuration of dust particles that locally move in concert and interact with each other only gravitationally, from which the name is derived.

5000|$|Over {{the years}} newer and tougher {{composites}} have been developed, giving {{about five times}} the protection value of the original pure ceramics, the best of which were again about five times as effective as a steel plate of equal weight. These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or metal matrix composites which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix. The latest developments involve the use of carbon nanotubes to improve toughness even further. Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include boron carbide, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide (sapphire or [...] "alumina"), aluminium nitride, titanium boride and Syndite, a synthetic diamond composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most expensive and brittle. Boron carbide composites are today favoured for ceramic plates protecting against smaller projectiles, such as used in body armour and armoured helicopters; this was in fact in the early sixties the first general application of ceramic armour. Silicon carbide, better suited to protect against larger projectiles, {{was at that time}} only used in some prototype land vehicles, such as the MBT-70. The ceramics can be created by <b>pressureless</b> sintering or hot pressing. A high density is required, so residual porosity must be minimised in the final part.|$|E
50|$|When the {{perturbations}} {{have grown}} sufficiently, a small region might become substantially denser {{than the mean}} density of the universe. At this point, the physics involved becomes substantially more complicated. When the deviations from homogeneity are small, the dark matter may {{be treated as a}} <b>pressureless</b> fluid and evolves by very simple equations. In regions which are significantly denser than the background, the full Newtonian theory of gravity must be included. (The Newtonian theory is appropriate because the masses involved are much less than those required to form a black hole, and the speed of gravity may be ignored as the light-crossing time for the structure is still smaller than the characteristic dynamical time.) One sign that the linear and fluid approximations become invalid is that dark matter starts to form caustics in which the trajectories of adjacent particles cross, or particles start to form orbits. These dynamics are generally best understood using N-body simulations (although a variety of semi-analytic schemes, such as the Press-Schechter formalism, can be used in some cases). While in principle these simulations are quite simple, in practice they are very difficult to implement, as they require simulating millions or even billions of particles. Moreover, despite the large number of particles, each particle typically weighs 109 solar masses and discretization effects may become significant. The largest such simulation as of 2005 is the Millennium simulation.|$|E
