40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. <b>Collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|R

25|$|Generally, a <b>collet</b> <b>chuck,</b> {{considered}} as a unit, consists of a tapered receiving sleeve (sometimes integral with the machine spindle), the collet proper (usually made of spring steel) which is inserted into the receiving sleeve, and (often) a cap that screws over the collet, clamping it via another taper.|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill <b>chuck</b> or <b>collet</b> <b>chuck),</b> the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R
30|$|As a new {{cutting tool}} hold technology, {{lengthened}} shrink-fit holder (LSFH) has drawn tremendous industrial attention recently. For touching workpiece in high-speed machining of dies and molds characterized by large-scale and deep cavity, LSFH is more suitable than those traditional hold {{systems such as}} the <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> and the static pressure expansive chuck because of its simple structure, high balance accuracy, and high clamping strength (Zhou et al. 2012; Tony and Schmitz 2007; Zhang 2006).|$|R
40|$|Combined {{extrusion}}-forging is a {{metal forming}} process where the billet is forced through the extrusion and forging dies {{to get the}} required product. Combined extrusion-forging processes are now getting importance because of improved mechanical properties, less capital cost, high production rate and less material waste when compared to conventional manufacturing processes like casting and machining. Combined extrusion-forging {{is used in the}} manufacturing {{of a wide range of}} engineering components. Due to the complexity of the forming process and because of so many process variables, it is difficult to predict the forming load required to manufacture a given component. The present research work emphasizes on the estimation of forming force for combined extrusion-forging process of <b>Collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holder. Experimental studies are carried out to compare the results obtained from the Finite element analysis simulation.

2500|$|... "Autolock" [...] <b>collet</b> <b>chucks</b> (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] is {{a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of milling cutters with only hand tightening. They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson <b>chucks.</b> Autolock <b>collets</b> require cutters with threaded shank ends to screw into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. Collets are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the above}} traits, scroll chucks offer always № 1 and № 2; usually № 3; to varying extents № 4 (depending on the situation); but not {{reliably}} № 5. Independent-jaw chucks offer always № 3; usually № 4; reliably № 5 (but {{at the expense}} of paying a skilled user to spend time achieving it); never № 2; and generally not № 1. Meanwhile, a <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> can deliver all reliably, and with no need for a skilled user (№s 3 to 5 do depend on the object being clamped closely matching {{the size and shape of}} the collet's clamping surface. This constraint is usually not a problem when the object is good-quality bar stock; the shank of a well maintained drill bit, reamer, end mill, etc.; or a previously machined part that is being rechucked for additional cutting operations).|$|R
5000|$|A collet, {{one type}} of chuck, is a sleeve with a (normally) {{cylindrical}} inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece whose secure holding is desired. Most often this is achieved with a spring collet, made of spring steel, {{with one or more}} [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered gauge blocks) held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). The Jacobs Rubber-Flex brand is a name that most machinists would recognize for this type of <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} cam-operated {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called screw machines or automatic screw machines. These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm long. Screw machines almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a <b>collet</b> <b>chuck).</b> As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|R
5000|$|Many lathes {{that run}} <b>collet</b> <b>chucks</b> have {{dedicated}} collet-closer setups whereby {{there is no}} backplate, and the spindle nose contains the female taper for either the collet's male outer taper, or a sleeve that will hold it. A hollow drawbar passes back through the headstock to its back side, where a closer mechanism is mounted. The latter allows easy, rapid opening and closing of the collet. The drawbar's inner diameter determines the through-the-spindle bar diameter capacity of the lathe. Some collet-closer systems even allow opening and closing without stopping the spindle rotation. The closer on a manual lathe is either lever-style or handwheel-style. The closer on a CNC lathe is powered (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic), {{and it may be}} controlled by various means: a foot pedal that the operator steps on when desired; a line in the program (for opening and closing under program control); or a button on the control panel.|$|R
50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). <b>Collet</b> <b>chucks,</b> rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine collet systems, 5C collets were {{developed}} primarily for work holding. Superficially similar to R8 collets, 5C collets have an external thread {{at the rear}} for drawing the collet closed and so work pieces may pass right through the <b>collet</b> and <b>chuck</b> (5C <b>collets</b> often also have an internal thread). Collets are also available to hold square stock. 5C collets have a limited closing range and so shank and collet diameters must be a close match.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all <b>collet</b> <b>chucks</b> achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, spring clamp, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|R
40|$|Present {{manufacturing}} {{industries are}} facing many challenges {{to produce the}} products of high strength, resistance to fatigue, heat, corrosion and low production cost. To meet these challenges combined extrusion-forging process is employed to achieve improved material properties, high production rates, and less material wastage when compared with other manufacturing processes such as machining, casting, etc. Combined extrusion-forging process is the advanced metal forming process in which an initial billet is forced through the extrusion and forging die punch setup to get desired product. The flow pattern of metal mainly depends on the frictional conditions at the workpiece/die interface, the geometry of dies and the percentage area reductions. In this process, the estimation of forming load is a bit difficult {{because the number of}} process parameters involved, and complexness of analysis. It has extensive applications in automotive and aerospace industries. Present research work focuses on estimation of forming load to produce the product <b>collet</b> <b>chuck</b> holder by this process. The metal flow pattern and die cavity filling has studied in both experimental and simulation analysis. The modelling software Solidworks is used for 3 D modelling and Deform 3 D® is used for the simulation process. The number of experiments has done to compare the results obtained from the simulation process. The results obtained from the experimentation and simulation analysis are in good agreement with each other...|$|R
2500|$|The {{tightening}} {{sequence of}} Autolock collets is widely misunderstood. The chuck cap {{itself does not}} tighten the collet at all, with the cap tight and no tool inserted the collet is loose in the chuck. Only when a cutter is inserted will the collet be pressed against the cap taper. The back of the cutter engages with a centering pin and further turning drives the <b>collet</b> against the <b>chuck</b> cap, tightening around the cutter shank, hence [...] "Autolock".|$|R
40|$|Sine-bar {{attachment}} for <b>collets,</b> spindles, and <b>chucks</b> helps machinists set {{up quickly}} for precise angular cuts that require greater precision than provided by graduations of machine tools. Machinist uses attachment to index head, carriage of milling machine or lathe relative to table or turning axis of tool.

50|$|A radius grinder (or {{radius tool}} grinder) {{is a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a <b>collet</b> or <b>chuck</b> fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|R
5000|$|The four most {{commonly}} used workholding devices are the three-jaw chuck, the four-jaw <b>chuck,</b> the <b>collet,</b> and the faceplate. The three-jaw chuck is used to hold round or hex workpieces because the work is automatically centered. On these chucks the runout faces limitations; on late-model CNCs, it can be quite low if all conditions are excellent, but traditionally it is usually at least [...]001-.003 in (0.025-0.075 mm). The four-jaw chuck is used either to hold irregular shapes or to hold round or hex to extremely low runout (with time spent indicating and clamping each piece), in both cases because of its independent action on each jaw. The face plate is also used for irregular shapes. <b>Collets</b> combine self-centering <b>chucking</b> with low runout, but they involve higher costs.|$|R
