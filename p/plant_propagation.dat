5|$|Modern botany is a broad, {{multidisciplinary}} {{subject with}} inputs from most {{other areas of}} science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, <b>plant</b> <b>propagation,</b> breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, {{and the maintenance of}} biodiversity.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study done}} in Nepal, it was {{observed}} that overharvesting, unscientific collection of rhizomes, harvesting of plants before seed maturity, low viable seed production and long dormancy of seeds are the major threats to the <b>plant's</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Research {{activities}} include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling {{and other factors}} that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in <b>plant</b> <b>propagation,</b> plant introduction, and environmental management.

50|$|The virus also {{weakens the}} bulb and retards the <b>plant's</b> <b>propagation</b> through offset growths; as it {{progresses}} through each generation the bulb grows stunted and weak. Eventually {{it has no}} strength to flower, and either breaks apart or withers away, ending the genetic line. For this reason the most famous examples of tulips from color broken bulbs - the Semper Augustus and the Viceroy - no longer exist.|$|R

50|$|Exports to Europe include fruits (citrus, avocado, grapes), {{vegetables}} (sweet peppers, tomatoes, potato, melons, sweet potato), ornamentals (cut flowers, potted <b>plants,</b> <b>propagation</b> material) and herbs. In 1997, agricultural export (fresh and processed) {{reached over}} $1.329 billion - approximately 6.4% of the country's total exports (Source: Central Bureau of Statistics). This has necessitated an ongoing {{search for new}} products, niches in seasons and better storage technologies. Major achievements included an increase in productivity of fruit, vegetable and field crops with a reduced input of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

500|$|According to Chahi, {{the game}} began its {{life as a}} {{strategy}} game. The core {{of the game is}} that players are [...] "giving powers to [...] people". However, the team later shifted the format to a god game hoping players would interact with the environment and simulation, and not treat those elements as a background. Many original concepts, such as natural disasters, remained intact in the final game. Other influences for the game include Conway's Game of Life, a mathematical model of the 1970s, <b>plant</b> <b>propagations,</b> the works of Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński, and Koyaanisqatsi, a film directed by Godfrey Reggio which shows slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States.|$|R

Three concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0 %) and three different times (10, 15, 20 minutes) were used for disinfection of axillary buds. The highest rates of established buds were achieved using sodium hypochlorite to 2. 0 % during 20 minutes for disinfection. Between 86 % and 100 % buds sprouted, and a 93. 7 % of explants free of visible microbial contaminants were obtained from axillary buds introduced to in vitro conditions.
