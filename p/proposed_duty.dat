40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} corporate liability {{in the context of}} occupational health and safety in New Zealand. In particular it looks at the new duty of officers proposed in the Health and Safety Reform Bill 2014. New Zealand’s occupational health and safety framework has experienced a regulatory breakdown, stemming from its incomplete implementation of the Robens Model for health and safety regulation. That breakdown involves many flaws and gaps, especially as far as corporate liability is concerned, while the modern world of work has created new challenges to health and safety regulation. This setting demands a new regulatory tool to create effective corporate liability and increase the compliance of companies’. This article {{examines the}} new world of work and the inherent clash between OHS regulation and the corporate world to reveal two main conclusions; the major barrier to company compliance is a lack of effective inducement; and there is a desperate need to create health and safety leaders within companies, {{in order to create a}} positive health and safety culture.

40|$|Abstract—Duty cycling {{is often}} used to reduce the energy {{consumption}} caused by idle listening in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Most studies on WSN protocols define a common duty cycle value throughout the network to achieve synchronization among the nodes. On the other hand, a few studies propose adaptation of the duty cycle according to uniform traffic conditions, which is beneficial assuming one-to-one traffic patterns that result in evenly distributed packet traffic. In this work, we consider the convergecast communication pattern commonly observed in WSNs. In convergecast communication, the packet traffic observed around the sink node is much higher than the traffic observed far from the sink, i. e., nodes with different distances to the sink node receive and must relay different amounts of traffic. Additionally, we utilize receiver-based protocols, which enable nodes to communicate with no synchronization or neighbor information, and hence do not require all nodes in the network to have the same duty cycle. In this paper, we model the expected energy consumption of nodes utilizing receiver-based protocols as a function of their duty cycle and their distance to the sink node. Using this analysis, we derive a closed-form formula for the duty cycle that minimizes the expected energy consumption at a given distance. Moreover, we propose an adaptation method for the derived distance-based duty cycle based on local observed traffic. Performance evaluations of the two <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle assignment methods show that they greatly improve the energy efficiency without sacrificing packet delivery ratio or delay significantly.

40|$|The Department of Energy's Advanced Turbine System (ATS) {{program is}} aimed at {{forecasting}} {{the development of a}} new generation of land-based gas turbine systems with overall efficiencies significantly beyond those of current state-of-the-art machines, as well as greatly increased times between inspection and refurbishment, improved environmental impact, and decreased cost. The <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of ATS turbines will require the use of different criteria in the design of the materials for the critical hot gas path components. In particular, thermal barrier coatings will be an essential feature of the hot gas path components in these machines. While such coatings are routinely used in high-performance aircraft engines and are becoming established in land-based turbines, the requirements of the ATS turbine application are sufficiently different that significant improvements in thermal barrier coating technology will be necessary. In particular, it appears that thermal barrier coatings will have to function on all airfoil sections of the first stage vanes and blades to provide the significant temperature reduction required. In contrast, such coatings applied to the blades and vances of advanced aircraft engines are intended primarily to reduce air cooling requirements and extend component lifetime; failure of those coatings can be tolerated without jeopardizing mechanical or corrosion performance. A major difference is that in ATS turbines these components will be totally reliant on thermal barrier coatings which will, therefore, need to be highly reliable even over the leading edges of first stage blades. Obviously, the ATS program provides a very challenging opportunity for TBC's, and involves some significant opportunities to extend this technology...|$|E
40|$|Broadcasting by {{flooding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental services for both wired and wireless networks. This also includes several sensor network applications that use broadcasting to spread information from one sensor node to the other sensor nodes in the entire sensor network. These wireless sensor networks have certain characteristics such as limited power and battery driven. However the simple flooding mechanism causes lots of duplicated packets and consumes a lot of resources. In view of these constraints, the broadcasting service should reduce redundant transmissions such that energy conservation is obtained since the devices within a wireless sensor network have limited battery power. Since it is not necessary for each sensor node to be active all the time a more sophisticated method might be introduced to flood an entire network and the other side is more efficient. In this work, an asynchronous sleep scheduling is proposed by an adapted duty cycle for each sensor where the duty cycle is based on the RSS based density estimation for each sensor node. By using the <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle the reachability is compared with that of the fixed duty cycle and the adapted duty cycle by using neighborhood discovery density estimation model. The results show that the reachability of the network with an adapted duty cycle in combination with RSS based density estimation is two times more than that of the neighborhood density estimation in a 100 m x 100 m WSN of 200 sensor nodes. Further the results show the reachability is as good as in the case of the 90 % fixed duty cycle but is more energy efficient.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issues and {{techniques}} associated with employing the principles of inferential statistics to design effective Medium Access Control (MAC), routing and duty cycle management strategies for multihop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The main objective of these protocols are to maximise the throughput of the network, to prolong the lifetime of nodes and to reduce the end-to-end delay of packets over a general network scenario without particular considerations for specific topology configurations, traffic patterns or routing policies. WSNs represent one of the leading-edge technologies that have received substantial research efforts due to their prominent roles in many applications. However, to design effective communication protocols for WSNs is particularly challenging due to the scarce resources of these networks and the requirement for large-scale deployment. The MAC, routing and duty cycle management protocols are amongst the important strategies that are required to ensure correct operations of WSNs. This thesis makes use of the inferential statistics field to design these protocols; inferential statistics was selected as it provides a rich design space with powerful approaches and methods. The MAC protocol proposed in this thesis exploits the statistical characteristics of the Gamma distribution to enable each node to adjust its contention parameters dynamically based on its inference for the channel occupancy. This technique reduces the service time of packets and leverages the throughput by improving the channel utilisation. Reducing the service time minimises the energy consumed in contention to access the channel which in turn prolongs the lifetime of nodes. The <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle management scheme uses non-parametric Bayesian inference to enable each node {{to determine the best}} times and durations for its sleeping durations without posing overheads on the network. Hence the lifetime of node is prolonged by mitigating the amount of energy wasted in overhearing and idle listening. Prolonging the lifetime of nodes increases the throughput of the network and reduces the end-to-end delay as it allows nodes to route their packets over optimal paths for longer periods. The proposed routing protocol uses one of the state-of-the-art inference techniques dubbed spatial reasoning that enables each node to figure out the spatial relationships between nodes without overwhelming the network with control packets. As a result, the end-to-end delay is reduced while the throughput and lifetime are increased. Besides the proposed protocols, this thesis utilises the analytical aspects of statistics to develop rigorous analytical models that can accurately predict the queuing and medium access delay and energy consumption over multihop networks. Moreover, this thesis provides a broader perspective for design of communication protocols for WSNs by casting the operations of these networks in the domains of the artificial chemistry discipline and the harmony search optimisation algorithm. ...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} an {{emerging}} technology proposing {{the concept of}} dynamic spec- trum access {{as a solution to}} the looming problem of spectrum scarcity caused by the growth in wireless communication systems. Under the proposed concept, non- licensed, secondary users (SU) can access spectrum owned by licensed, primary users (PU) so long as interference to PU are kept minimal. Spectrum sensing is a crucial task in cognitive radio whereby the SU senses the spectrum to detect {{the presence or absence of}} any PU signal. Conventional spectrum sensing assumes the PU signal as ‘stationary’ and remains in the same activity state during the sensing cycle, while an emerging trend models PU as ‘non-stationary’ and undergoes state changes. Existing studies have focused on non-stationary PU during the transmission period, however very little research considered the impact on spectrum sensing when the PU is non-stationary during the sensing period. The concept of PU duty cycle is developed as a tool to analyse the performance of spectrum sensing detectors when detecting non-stationary PU signals. New detectors are also proposed to optimise detection with respect to duty cycle ex- hibited by the PU. This research consists of two major investigations. The first stage investigates the impact of duty cycle on the performance of existing detec- tors and the extent of the problem in existing studies. The second stage develops new detection models and frameworks to ensure the integrity of spectrum sensing when detecting non-stationary PU signals. The first investigation demonstrates that conventional signal model formulated for stationary PU does not accurately reflect the behaviour of a non-stationary PU. Therefore the performance calculated and assumed to be achievable by the conventional detector does not reflect actual performance achieved. Through analysing the statistical properties of duty cycle, performance degradation is proved to be a problem that cannot be easily neglected in existing sensing studies when PU is modelled as non-stationary. The second investigation presents detectors that are aware of the duty cycle ex- hibited by a non-stationary PU. A two stage detection model is proposed to improve the detection performance and robustness to changes in duty cycle. This detector is most suitable for applications that require long sensing periods. A second detector, the duty cycle based energy detector is formulated by integrat- ing the distribution of duty cycle into the test statistic of the energy detector and suitable for short sensing periods. The decision threshold is optimised with respect to the traffic model of the PU, hence the proposed detector can calculate average detection performance that reflect realistic results. A detection framework for the application of spectrum sensing optimisation is proposed to provide clear guidance on the constraints on sensing and detection model. Following this framework will ensure the signal model accurately reflects practical behaviour while the detection model implemented is also suitable for the desired detection assumption. Based on this framework, a spectrum sensing optimisation algorithm is further developed to maximise the sensing efficiency for non-stationary PU. New optimisation constraints are derived to account for any PU state changes within the sensing cycle while implementing the <b>proposed</b> <b>duty</b> cycle based detector...|$|E
