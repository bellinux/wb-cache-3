40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that despite their growing popularity, mega{{projects}} - large-scale, complex projects delivered through various partnerships {{between public and private}} organisations - often fail to meet costs estimations, time schedules and project outcomes and are motivated by vested interests which operate against the public interest. This paper presents a more benign and theoretically-grounded view on what goes wrong by comparing the project designs, daily practices, <b>project</b> <b>cultures</b> and management approaches of two recent megaprojects in The Netherlands and Australia, showing how these projects made sense of uncertainty, ambiguity and risk. We conclude that project design and <b>project</b> <b>cultures</b> play a role in determining how managers and partners cooperate to achieve project objectives {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA...|$|R

5000|$|Kim Sanders (born October 24, 1968 in East Chicago, Indiana) is an American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} based in Germany. Sanders began to release singles {{as a solo}} artist in 1994 and wrote songs for other musicians. In 1993 and 1994 she released three of her singles, [...] "Show Me", [...] "Tell Me That You Want Me" [...] and [...] "Ride". In 1998, Sanders became the front-woman of the German dance <b>project,</b> <b>Culture</b> Beat, on the album Metamorphosis. In 2003, she released her debut album Pretty on Edge, which failed to enter the charts due to the record company placing the incorrect bar code on the album. Although this was a huge setback for Sanders' solo career, she has since collaborated with artists such as, Schiller, Aural Float, Stefanie Heinzmann, Till Brönner, Nicola Conte and Wolfgang Haffner. Her solo album A Closer Look was released in 2009 with the C.A.R.E.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build {{enterprise}} <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> evaluation model and search for the best evaluation method for Chinese enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> on the basis of studying and drawing lessons from enterprise culture evaluation theory and method at home and abroad. Design/methodology/approach: Referring to the Denison enterprise culture evaluation model, this paper optimizes it according to the difference of enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture,</b> designs the enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> evaluation model and proves the practicability of the model through empirical. Finding: This paper finds that it`s more applicable to use the Denison model for enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> evaluation through the comparative analysis of domestic and foreign enterprise culture evaluation theory and method, the systematic <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> management framework of Chinese enterprises has not yet formed through empirical research, and four factors in enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> have important influence on project operation performance improvement. Research limitations/implications: The research on evaluation of enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> based on Denison model is a preliminary attempt, the design of evaluation index system, evaluation model and scale structure also need to be improved, but the thinking of this paper in this field provides a valuable reference for future research. Practical Implications: This paper provides the support of theory and practice for evaluating the present situation of enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> construction and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of <b>project</b> <b>culture,</b> which contributes to the "dialectical therapy" of enterprise project management, enterprise management and enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> construction. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of Denison enterprise culture model. Combining with the actual situation of enterprises, this paper also builds the evaluation model for enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture,</b> which is helpful to promote the construction and development of Chinese enterprise <b>project</b> <b>culture.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Cultural {{issues in}} the {{construction}} industry have attracted growing attention from both practitioners and academia. However, there are few studies on culture issues at the project level. The influence of <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> has not traditionally been on the research radar. This research aims to investigate the impacts of <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> on the performance of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach, utilising questionnaire surveys, in-depth interviews and review of project documents, was employed to investigate <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> and its associated impacts in two major hospital projects. Findings - The results indicated that <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> {{played an important role in}} achieving harmonious relationships between project participants and better project outcomes in terms of schedule, functionality, satisfaction with the process, satisfaction with the relationships, environmental issues addressed commercial success, further business opportunities and overall performance. Case 1 outperformed Case 2 in these performance indicators. Similarly, it became clear that the project’s culture should be developed from the outset and sustained during the project period. Furthermore, it was also highlighted that the <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> should be translated to all levels of the supply chain i. e. sub-contractors and suppliers. Practical implications – The findings enabled the client to understand the role of <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> and actively commit towards the development and maintenance of the <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> from very early on. It also helps project teams to understand how to deal with cultural issues at the project level.

40|$|In {{recent years}} culture {{has become one}} of the most studied topics in project {{management}} research. Some studies have investigated the infl uence of culture at different levels – such as national culture, industry culture, organisational culture and professional culture. As a project-based industry, the construction industry needs to have more insight concerning cultural issues at the project level and their infl uence on the performance of construction projects. Few studies, however, have focused on culture at the project level. This paper uses a questionnaire survey to determine the perceptions of Chinese contractors about the impact of <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> on the performance of local construction projects. This is augmented by a series of in-depth interviews with senior executive managers in the industry. The fi ndings indicate that specifi c <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> does contribute signifi cantly towards project outcomes. In particular, goal orientation and fl exibility, as two dimensions of <b>project</b> <b>culture,</b> have a negative statistical correlation with perceived satisfaction of the process, commercial success, future business opportunities, lessons learnt from the project, satisfaction with the relationships, and overall performance. This paper also indicates that the affordability of developing an appropriate <b>project</b> <b>culture</b> is a major concern for industry practitioners...|$|E
