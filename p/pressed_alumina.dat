40|$|There is {{currently}} much discussion {{over the use}} of ceramic femoral components against metal acetabular cups, for use in total hip arthroplasty. The current study investigates six hot isostatically <b>pressed</b> <b>alumina</b> femoral heads of 38  mm diameter articulating against six as-cast Co–Cr–Mo metallic acetabular cups. Standard walking-cycle simulator wear testing was carried out to 5 × 10 ⁶ cycles using the Durham Mark II hip wear simulator, and wear was determined gravimetrically. In addition, surface topography, using a non-contacting profilometer, an atomic force microscope, and an optical microscope, was monitored throughout the wear test. The wear of the ceramic heads was found to be undetectable using the current gravimetric method; however, a change in the surface topography was seen, as grain removal on the pole was observed through atomic force microscopy analysis. A biphasic wear pattern was found for the metallic cups, with low wear rates of 1. 04  ±  0. 293  mm³/ 10 ⁶ cycles (mean, ± 95 per cent confidence interval) and 0. 0209  ±  0. 004  mm³/ 10 ⁶ cycles (mean, ± 95 per cent confidence interval) for running-in and steady state wear phases respectively. Frictional measurement revealed that the joints were tending towards full fluid-film lubrication in parts of the walking cycle. The results show that the combination of hot isostatically <b>pressed</b> <b>alumina</b> and as-cast Co–Cr–Mo is a promising alternative for total hip arthroplasties...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 68 quench tests were {{conducted}} in a vented bomb assembly (VBA). Designed to simulate full-scale motor operating conditions, this laboratory apparatus uses a 2 -inch-diameter, end-burning propellant charge and an insulated disc of consolidated hydrated aluminum sulfate along with the explosive charge necessary to disperse the salt and inject it onto the burning surface. The VBA was constructed to permit variation of motor design parameters of interest; i. e., weight of salt per unit burning surface area, weight of explosive per unit weight of salt, distance from salt surface to burning surface, incidence angle of salt injection, chamber pressure, and burn time. Completely satisfactory salt quenching, without re-ignition, occurred in only two VBA tests. These were accomplished with a quench charge ratio (QCR) of 0. 023 lb salt per square inch of burning surface at dispersing charge ratios (DCR) of 13 and 28 lb of salt per lb of explosive. Candidate materials for insulating salt charges from the rocket combustion environment were evaluated in firings of 5 -inch-diameter, uncured end-burner motors.

40|$|The {{development}} of hip joint materials {{is one of}} the most challenging problems to prostheses technology in this millennium. Several types of materials have been developed for this purpose. The materials like glass, polymer (poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene / PTFE or Teflon and ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene or UHMWPE), metal (stainless steel, CoCr alloy, and CoCrMo alloy), ceramics (alumina, zirconia, Ti-coated ceramic alloys, and high isostatic <b>pressed</b> <b>alumina</b> or HIPed Al 2 O 3), composite, and apatite materials have been tried with partial success. Currently, Hydroxyapatite (HA) is being used quite frequently all over the world. Hip joint replacement techniques have been discussed under four different classifications i. e. hip arthroplasty, femoral stem, acetabular cup, and finally, total hip arthroplasty (THA). Chronology of technical improvement over first generation alternative joint bearing technologies before 1950 s, have been presented by Charnley and other scientists. Before 1960 s, there was hardly any technique with predictable results. The modern Charnley’s low-friction UHMWPE-on-metal technique was the actual invention of the total hip replacement (THR) technique. The main objective of this paper is to list all the efforts in the direction of total hip replacement technique and material development chronologically. All historical and recent efforts for developing suitable materials and various designs have been covered in detail. Towards the end of the paper, the current trends and direction in material development techniques and the areas of research have also been emphasized...|$|E

40|$|Study of {{densification}} of alumina in {{the presence}} of CuO has been studied. CuO as dopant is added to the extent of 0. 5 mole % (1 wt%) to pure alumina (A 17 NE) and studies were done for pressure less sintering. Cold <b>pressed</b> pellets of <b>alumina</b> with or without copper oxide were sintered at 1100 °C, 1200 °C, 1400 °C, 1550 °C and for 1650 °C and were also kept for different soaking time at 1650 °C. The pellets were then characterized for densification and microstructure analysis using SEM. Dilatometric studies were also done on the doped samples. Results showed that doped samples acquire better density (~ 95 % of theoretical density) than undoped samples (~ 93 % of theoretical density). Activation energy calculated for the initial stage of sintering for Cu doped alumina was found to be 329. 45 kJ/mol. The same for undoped alumina could not be possible due to time constraints...|$|R

These supports were heat {{treated in the}} 1100 ° - 1200 °C temperature range and dip-coated with ceramic sols prepared from alkoxides by using sol-gel methods. The average sol particle sizes were measured as 3 - 7 nm for zirconia and 30 - 40 nm for alumina by laser scattering technique. The optimum heat treatment temperature range was determined as 500 °- 600 °C for dip-coated membranes by using TGA (thermo gravimetric analysis) results. The microstructure of the ceramic composite membranes was investigated by SEM (Scanning electron microscope). The clean water permeability (CWP) of the membranes was tested by using deionized water in a filtration set-up. Separation experiments were performed with bovine serum albumin (BSA, Stokes diameter: 7 nm) solution and whey to determine the protein separation capacity of the composite membranes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{in vitro}} study was aimed to {{investigate}} the attachment, spreading and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts to milled and polished non-veneered ceramic surfaces in alumina and zirconia and to ceramic surfaces veneered by {{two different types of}} porcelain baseliners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibroblasts were cultured on discs of <b>pressed</b> <b>alumina</b> or zirconia, on discs which had been milled, on discs comprising alumina or zirconia which had been polished, on discs of alumina veneered with NobelRondo baseliner Al, on discs of zirconia veneered with Cercon-S baseliner, and on alumina or zirconia discs veneered with the above baseliners and then polished. The surfaces were analyzed using an optical interferometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cell profile areas were measured using SEM and an image analyzer. Cell attachment was determined after 3 and 24 h as a ratio of the cell profiles and the total micrograph area and was expressed as percent of attachment. MTT analyses were undertaken to determine cellular attachment after 3 h of incubation and cellular proliferation after 7 days. RESULTS: The polished zirconia specimens had the smoothest surface in terms of average height deviation (S(a) = 0. 03 microm) : the roughest were the zirconia specimens with milled surfaces (S(a) = 0. 36 microm). The application of the baseliners resulted in surfaces smoother than those of the non-veneered discs. The milled surfaces of both alumina and zirconia had significantly higher percentages of cell attachment and proliferation than the other surfaces whereas the milled surfaces in zirconia demonstrated better cellular attachment after 3 and 24 h of culture than the one in alumina. Fibroblasts attached and grew effectively on the surfaces veneered with NobelRondo throughout the experiments, whereas the zirconia surfaces veneered with Cercon-S had the lowest percentage of cell attachment and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the roughness of all surfaces investigated was < 0. 4 mum, the study disclosed significant differences in cellular attachment and proliferation associated with the various surface modifications...|$|E

Ceramic composite membranes {{consisting of a}} support and a thin membrane layer with finer pores were prepared in this work. Ceramic supports were prepared from fine alumina and zirconia powders by dry-pressing and slipcasting. These supports were sintered in the 1100 - 1200 °C temperature range. These supports were dip-coated with ceramic sols prepared from zirconium propoxide and aluminium isopropoxide for the preparation of thin layers with finer pores. Average particle sizes of these sols were measured as 3 - 7 nm for zirconia sol and 30 - 40 nm for alumina sol by laser scattering technique. The dipcoated membranes were calcined in the 500 - 600 °C temperature range. The thermal characterization of membrane layers was determined with DTA/TGA. The microstructure of the ceramic composite membranes was investigated with SEM. The clean water permeability (CWP) of membranes was tested by using deionised water in a filtration set-up.

40|$|Ceramography {{is the art}} {{and science}} of preparation, examination, and {{evaluation}} of ceramic microstructures. Microstructure is the structure level approximately 0. 1 to 100 μ m between the wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye. The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, microcracks, hardness microindentations. Investigation and evaluation of ceramic microstructure is very important because a number of mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and other properties of ceramics are significantly affected by the microstructure.

40|$|MastersStatement of the Problem: Porcelain veneers are {{translucent}} {{materials and}} are therefore affected by {{the thickness of the}} porcelain used as well as the color of the underlying substructure which limits their masking ability and compromises the esthetic result in heavily stained teeth. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the contrast ratio (opacity) and masking ability (△E) of three different veneering ceramics with two thicknesses 1. 0 and 1. 5 mm by measuring the color differences over white and black backgrounds. In addition, this study tested the correlation between contrast ratio and masking ability of these veneering ceramics. Methods and Materials: Thirty disk shaped specimens were fabricated from three types of all-ceramic systems: IPS e. max Press, Vita VM 7 and Nobel Rondo <b>Press</b> <b>Alumina</b> Solo of shade A 2. The disks were 12. 0 mm in diameter and 1. 0 mm, 1. 5 mm thick. The contrast ratio (CR=Yb/Yw), defined as the ratio of illuminance (Y) of the test material when it’s placed on the black background (Yb) to the illuminance of the same material when it’s placed over a white background (Yw), was determined. The color (CIE L*a*b*) and illuminance (Y) of each specimen were measured over standard white and black tiles using a spectrophotometer with an aperture of 0. 3 cm x 0. 8 cm. For each of the ceramic discs, three measurements were made in three different locations around the center of the disc (n= 15). Masking abilities of the specimens were determined by measuring the color difference (ΔE) over white and black backgrounds. Differences among the contrast ratios and masking abilities of the three materials with the two thicknesses were analyzed using Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the mean values of contrast ratio across the three materials followed by Duncan multiple comparison test. The correlation between contrast ratio and masking ability as well as thickness and contrast ratio were determined by comparing R 2 values (Square of coefficient of correlation) obtained from a linear regression analysis. For comparison of mean contrast ratio values, Student’s t-test for independent samples was used. Results: Contrast ratio values of Nobel Rondo were significantly less than those of IPS e. max Press and Vita VM 7, whereas, the contrast ratio of IPS e. max Press was higher than Vita VM 7. Furthermore, contrast ratio increased as the thickness of the discs increased to 1. 5 mm for all three materials. The △ L*, △ a* and △ b* values decreased as the thickness of the ceramic discs increased from 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm for all ceramics tested. It was also observed that mean △E values were significantly higher with 1. 0 mm thick discs than with 1. 5 mm discs. Among the three materials Nobel Rondo had significantly higher △ L* values and lower △ a*. Also, Vita VM 7 demonstrated significantly higher △ a* values when compared to those of IPS e. max Press. In addition, no significant difference was found in △ b* values between all three materials. It was observed that Nobel Rondo had the highest △E when compared to IPS e. max Press or Vita VM 7, whereas the △E of the latter two were not significantly different from one another. There is a strong linear correlation between contrast ratio and masking ability. Conclusion: Contrast ratio and masking ability are affected by the type as well as the thickness of the ceramic used. IPS e. max Press and Vita VM 7 are similar in their masking abilities, while Nobel Rondo had the lowest masking ability. Nobel Rondo was the most translucent followed by Vita VM 7 while IPS e. max Press was the most opaque of the latter two. None of the materials tested was able to completely mask the black background. It is therefore recommended that the type of ceramic should be chosen according to each clinical situation...|$|R
40|$|Spray dried {{granules}} {{are important}} in the processing of ceramic components as base material for dry compaction shaping operations. During the processing steps flow behavior of the granule material is a critical property. This can influence the handling during storage and transport {{as well as the}} homogeneity of the die filling in compaction process. In the latter case inadequate material properties of the compact can result if the flow behavior does not meet the requirements. During product design of granules it is therefore necessary to pay attention on this integral processing property and analyze them with adequate methods. Because of their internal structure, which consists of small primary particles, pores and organic components, granules exhibit some special properties in contrast to systems of dense primary particles. Therefore, the evaluation of the flowability measurement methods (e. g. shear test with rotational shear cell) for the application in the field of ductile ceramic granules in size ranges 20 - 200 µm is necessary. In this context {{the focus is on the}} characterization under small loads and selectivity for granule systems with good flow properties.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of sintering rates and other solid state reactions during 	microwave heating {{on a variety}} of ceramics have been reported in literatures. These 	empirical observations of microwave enhancement have been broadly called 	`microwave effect`. However, there has been little published work which directly 	compares the effects of microwave frequency and green sample`s properties on 	microwave effect on ceramics. Therefore, this dissertation describes a series of 	experimental to investigate effects of microwave frequency and green sample on 	alumina. 	To study microwave frequency dependence, extension of microwave, up to 300 	GHz (submillimeter waves) were applied and sintering by using 2. 45 GHz, 28 GHz, and 	 300 GHz was performed. And to study the effects of green samples, both cold isostatic 	pressed (CIPed) and uncold isostatic <b>pressed</b> (unCIPed) <b>alumina</b> samples, were 	prepared. 	The experimental results obtained from this study indicated that the microwave 	processing of alumina was strongly dependent on microwave frequency and green 	samples. Since microwave frequency effect on alumina densification seemed to 	decrease at submillimeter waves (SMMW), the most effective microwave frequency for 	the densification of alumina should exist below 300 GHz. 	The decreased densification attributed to decelerated diffusion. This was 	confirmed by a slower grain growth and an increased of apparent activation energy 	estimation in SMMW sintering. Mechanism responsible for the decrement in SMMW 	sintering may attribute to decrease in microwave effect or different the transport path 	such as volume diffusion mechanism instead of mainly grain boundary diffusion as 	usually reported in microwave sintering. This could lead to a decelerated flux and a 	decreased densification during SMMW sintering as observed in this work. 	As for the effect of green samples, the effect of CIP on SMMW and MMW 	sintered alumina was higher than that in conventionally sintered samples. This suggests 	that microwaves preferred heating grain boundary areas to heating within the grains. 	The experiment results also revealed that the effect of CIP on SMMW sintered alumina 	was higher than that in MMW. Such an effect was probably due to the stronger 	SMMW-grain boundary interaction compared to that found in MMW. The increase of 	the number of grain boundaries on CIPed samples had a bigger effect in 	SMMW-alumina interaction than that in MMW...|$|R

40|$|Metal-on-metal (MOM) hip {{prosthesis}} bearings have enjoyed renewed popularity, but concerns remain with wear debris and metal ion release causing a negative {{response in the}} surrounding tissues. Further understanding into the wear and corrosion mechanisms occurring in MOM hips is therefore essential. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the tribocorrosion behavior, or interplay between corrosion and wear, of a low-carbon CoCrMo alloy as a function of loading. The tribocorrosion tests were performed using two tribometer configurations. In the first configuration, “System A”, a linearly reciprocating alumina ball slid against the flat metal immersed in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In the second configuration, “System B”, the flat end of a cylindrical metal pin was <b>pressed</b> against an <b>alumina</b> ball that oscillated rotationally, using bovine calf serum (BCS) as the lubricant and electrolyte. System B was custom-built to emulate in vivo conditions. The tribocorrosion tests were performed under potentiostatic conditions at − 0. 345 V, with a sliding duration of 1800 s and a frequency of 1 Hz. In System A the applied loads were 0. 05, 0. 5, and 1 N (138, 296 and 373 MPa, respectively) and in System B were 16, 32, and 64 N (474, 597, and 752 MPa, respectively). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization resistance were estimated. The total mass loss (Kwc) in the CoCrMo was determined. The mass loss due to wear (Kw) and that due to corrosion (Kc) were determined. The dominant wear regime for the CoCrMo alloy subjected to sliding changes from wear–corrosion to mechanical wear as the contact stress increases. An attempt was made to compare both system, in their tribochemical responses and formulate some insights in the total degradation processes. Our results also suggest that the proteins in the serum lubricant assist in the generation of a protective layer against corrosion during sliding.
