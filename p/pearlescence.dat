5000|$|<b>Pearlescence,</b> also {{sometimes}} spelled as [...] "pearl essence", is a shine or gloss effect {{commonly used in}} a wide variety of cosmetic products. The most usual source of <b>pearlescence</b> is the natural mineral mica covered by a thin layer of titanium dioxide. This coating causes goniochromism [...] - [...] the color appears through interference effects with the naturally translucent mica, and varying the thickness of the titanium dioxide changes the color. [...] Alternatives exist, including the suspension of tiny flakes of a suitable material within the product, often a wax such as glycol distearate. A shimmery substance found on fish scales, most usually obtained from herring and one of many by-products of commercial fish processing, can also be used for pearlescent effects, primarily in nail polish, but is now rarely used due to its high cost, bismuth oxychloride flakes being used as a substitute instead.|$|E
40|$|Synopsis [...] Specific {{combinations}} of the polyoxyethylene fatty ethers and fatty alcohols or acids exhibit considerable <b>pearlescence</b> or iridescence in aqueous or aqueous aerosol systems. As {{a result of}} the high aesthetic appeal of these systems, they should be useful for the for-mulation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The <b>pearlescence</b> that is produced depends upon the particular polyoxyethylene fatty ethers, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids that are present, and also upon their concentrations and ratios to each other. The <b>pearlescence</b> is sensitive to temperature, and all of the products ultinmtely lose their <b>pearlescence</b> at higher temperatures. The loss of <b>pearlescence</b> occurs over a temperature range rather than at a specific temperature. This behavior in conjunc-tion with the optical properties of these systems, indicates that they belong to the class of substances having mesomorphic or liquid crystalline structures. Acrosols prepared from the aqueous concentrates generally discharge as foamy liquids which subsequently expand into foams. The propellant can affect the <b>pearlescence</b> of the aqueous concentrates, particularly if the molecular complex has some affinity for the pro-pellant...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how pearlescent dye {{can be used}} both to visualise turbulence and to measure integral length and time scales using auto-correlation functions. The measurements are calculated more quickly than standard particle tracking techniques and, because of the statistical approach, mean turbulence quantities are determined immediately. We also show how circulation patterns in the mean flow can be measured using cross-correlation functions. Keywords: pearlescence; flow visualisation; integral turbulent scales 1 Introduction Pearlescent dye is a suspension of fine, reflective, plate-like particles. Natural <b>pearlescence</b> is derived from fish scales, but <b>pearlescence</b> may also be made artificially using mica flakes coated with titanium dioxide or ferric oxide [1]. The dye is used {{in a variety of}} consumer products such as shampoo and nail polish because the dye imparts a pearly glean. In fluid dynamics experiments <b>pearlescence</b> may be used to visualise turbulence. Regions of large strai [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Lionel Wendt’s {{photographs of the}} Sri Lankan shoreline and its pearling economy during the British occupation in the 1930 s and 1940 s. It considers the light they shed on labour, {{as well as the}} tangled relationships between wealth and waste, in an environment where the detritus (cultch) generated by harvesting luxury pearls also formed the most common building materials. The ambivalences of Wendt’s aesthetic are connected to the qualities of <b>pearlescence</b> and the shimmer, which themselves were freighted with both metaphorical meaning and technical possibility, for theorists of modernity like Walter Benjamin and early scientists of photography alike. Considering what was, and was not depicted in Wendt’s photographs, the article describes the materiality of the coercive labour that existed in the Gulf of Manaar, as well as its connected imaginaries, both local and colonial...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{graphics}} {{hardware and}} software is {{used to create a}} new set of tools for selecting a household paint color. Important surface reflection effects, such as gloss and <b>pearlescence,</b> are rendered in real time using pixel shading hardware. Unlike traditional paint chips, this feature permits colors to be evaluated on three dimensional shapes and in different surface finishes. A novel set of color navigation tools is provided to allow the user to visualize the color collection supplied by the manufacturer, to select subsets of the collection for consideration, and to match or modify an existing color sample. This interface is easier to use and less expensive to produce than the fan deck found in most paint stores. The pictures produced by the software are displayed on a four panel video wall. The large size of the wall allows the user to evaluate the appearance of the color at a scale similar to its final dimension once it has been applied to a surface...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{motivated}} from finding a complementary way of tuning and controlling the machine parameters of Injection Stretch Blow Molding process. In the current approach, a specialized technician detects the bottle defects by visual inspection and corrects the machine parameters using its own experience or indications obtained by previous statistical analyses. As all human based operations, inherent limitations {{are that the}} results {{are influenced by the}} operator skills; in addition, the experience can be hardly converted into a database, which could be used for the process optimization. The solution investigated in this work is to replace visual inspection with an image processing system. A prototype for offline analyses of PET bottles was designed {{in order to have a}} resolution allowing to identify the most common bottle defects. The acquired images were analyzed with algorithms implemented in LabVIEW. Results showed that this system can off-center gate, haze and <b>pearlescence</b> with a repeatability and reproducibility sufficient for the identification of bottles with manufacturing defects...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEthylene glycol {{distearate}} (EGDS) {{was forced to}} crystallize as thin platelet {{in order to obtain}} a pearlescent effect. This was possible by performing a cooling surface crystallization in oil-in-water emulsion with the presence of an emulsifier. Under stagnant conditions, nucleation events and growth of faceted crystals in the oil phase were in situ monitored under microscope. After a first primary nucleation of dendritic crystals, a second population of faceted crystals arose by secondary nucleation and seemed to be the prevailing population. In a stirred vessel, the platelet shape of EGDS crystals was driven by the surfactant choice. Only a non-ionic surfactant, located at the liquid interface was supposed to interact with EGDS during the development of the crystals favouring a platelet habit. The nature of the interaction was not yet established. Moreover, the mastery of the platelet shape was lost when the amount of non-ionic surfactant relatively to the EGDS was decreased. This underlined the importance of the non-ionic surfactant for the obtaining of desired shape. The different physical qualities of crystals produced allowed us to confirm relationships between EGDS particle features with their effect of <b>pearlescence</b> of a cold pearl blend...|$|E
40|$|Mica based {{pearlescent}} pigments {{are widely}} applied in plastics, cosmetics, automobiles coatings among others, {{but they seem}} not explored by the ceramic industry. In this work, the potential of two commercial special effect pigments (with gold and silver lustre respectively) in the decoration of ceramic tiles was appraised by testing them dispersed into several ceramic coatings fired {{in a wide range}} of temperatures (700 - 1150 ?C). The pigments were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, XRF and PSD, while their technological behavior was assessed determining phase composition (XRD) and colorimetric parameters (DRS) of ceramic materials, including a <b>pearlescence</b> index. Results indicate that titania mica pigments are stable into glassy coatings up to 900 ?C, being any deterioration of their optical properties due to anatase-to-rutile and muscovite-to-feldspar transformations occurring at higher temperatures or after long firing times. The pigment type with a gold shine is particularly suitable for third fire decoration of ceramic tiles, involving low temperatures and fast firing schedules, where it can replace expensive precious metals lustres. Moreover, a certain satin effect was appreciable in porcelain stoneware tiles, unexpectedly persistant after firing at 1200 ?...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the principal}} findings of an experimental investigation of forced statistically steady turbulence in a rapidly rotating background. The experiment is conducted in a large cylindrical mixing tank and bulk rotation is produced by two large co-rotating impellers installed near the top and {{the bottom of the}} tank. The mean flow motion generated in such a configuration is axisymmetric and close to but not exactly solid-body rotation. The focus of this work is on the region {{in the vicinity of the}} rotation axis where the flow is Rayleigh stable. The unique features of this facility allows forcing and thus permits turbulence to be maintained at a certain level without a mean decay. The facility also allows an easy experimental access of statistical quantities. The bulk rotation rates and the amount of turbulence are adjusted to a Rossby number (Ro) of O(1). Under this condition, some physical phenomena commonly seen in solid-body rotating turbulent flows at low Ro are also observed, despite the differences in other parameters. A flow visualization at one of the testing conditions using <b>pearlescence</b> clearly shows the presence of cyclonic columnar structures. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (2 DPIV) measurements are carried out in a plane normal to the axis of the rotation and near the middle height of the tank. Symmetry breaking between cyclonic and anti-cyclonic vorticity in the flow is revealed by the skewness of the fluctuating vorticity. It is found that skewness is not a monotonic function of Ro; in this particular experimental arrangement, symmetry is broken to a maximum extent at Ro∼ 1. 5 based on velocity length scale. Turbulence quantities are also computed along with the turbulent energy dissipation, which is estimated using velocity structure functions and lends support to previous findings that purport that dissipation is suppressed in such flows...|$|E
