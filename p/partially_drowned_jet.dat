5000|$|Later that night, {{the fighters}} engage in {{drinking}} again, and Taylor gets very drunk and deliberately urinates his pants {{inside of the}} house. Then he runs {{around the house and}} yells at everyone telling them what he just did. He then tries to hold himself underwater, <b>partially</b> <b>drowning</b> himself, in the hot tub because {{he does not want to}} get out.|$|R
50|$|In {{his book}} Atlantis of the West: The Case For Britain's Drowned Megalithic Civilization (2003), Paul Dunbavin {{argues that a}} large island once existed in the Irish Sea and that this island was Atlantis. He argues that this Neolithic civilization in Europe was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by rising sea levels caused by a comet impact that caused a pole shift and changed the earth's axis around 3100 BC. Such changes would be readily {{detectable}} to modern science, however, and Dunbavin's claims are considered pseudo-scientific at best within the scientific community.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Changes" [...] was {{shot on the}} 1 August 2008 on {{location}} near Tonbridge. According to his website, Young says [...] "It has probably been the hardest video I’ve ever had to shoot. I ran up and down country lanes, was struck by lightning, set on fire and <b>partially</b> <b>drowned.</b> It’s amazing what you’ll do for music!"He continues, saying he had to drink foul smelling soup, dance in a hay-filled barn {{in front of a}} windmachine and also had to lay on rocks, soaked in freezing cold water. It premièred on Channel V on 16 August 2008.|$|R
60|$|While Chingatok was speaking, {{a gust of}} wind more furious {{than ever}} struck the hut and shook it to its foundations. At the same time a loud {{rumbling}} sound was heard outside. Most of the men leaped up, caught hold of spears or knives, and rushed out. Through the driving drift they could just see that the observatory, which was a flimsy structure, had been swept clean away, and that the more solid hut was following it. Even as they gazed they saw its roof caught up, and whirled off {{as if it had been}} a scroll of paper. The walls fell immediately after, and the stones rolled down the rocky cone with a loud rattling, which was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by the shrieking of the tempest.|$|R
60|$|No sooner was {{its voice}} heard upon the present {{occasion}} than the whole line was in motion. A wild cry of joy from the advancing batallions rent the air, and was then {{lost in the}} shrill clangour of the bagpipes, {{as the sound of}} these, in their turn, was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by the heavy tread of so many men put at once into motion. The banners glittered and shook as they moved forward, and the horse hastened to occupy their station as the advanced guard, and to push on reconnoitring parties to ascertain and report the motions of the enemy. They vanished from Waverley's eye as they wheeled round the base of Arthur's Seat, under the remarkable ridge of basaltic rocks which fronts the little lake of Duddingston.|$|R
500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} no excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises <b>partially</b> <b>drowning</b> them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 2014, Castro and Miss Janet Bandu were {{reported}} to have <b>drowned</b> following a <b>jet</b> ski accident in Ada Estuary while on holiday with the Gyan brothers. People presume that he is alive. The jet ski involved in the accident was recovered on the same day of their disappearance but their bodies had not been recovered yet despite a search by the police.|$|R
5|$|In Coats Grove, Michigan, {{teenager}} Bobby Rich is berated by {{his stepfather}} Phil for not finishing his lawn {{work outside the}} house. Bobby runs into a nearby orchard and Phil gives chase. When Bobby's mother, Patti, follows them into the orchard, she discovers Phil's body <b>partially</b> buried, seemingly <b>drowned</b> in mud. Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby, his eyes wide with terror.|$|R
500|$|Reeves and Baker {{completed}} {{a third and}} final draft that was [...] "substantially toned down" [...] in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed {{with only a few}} minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the pre-credits hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and slamming into a tree. A sequence depicting the Battle of Naseby was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a [...] "confession" [...] out of the bloodied man. Marshall <b>partially</b> <b>drowns</b> Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand the origin of the Belize Barrier Reef and the sequence stratigraphy of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. The data used consisted of 1, 400 km of conventional multichannel seismic, 1, 300 km of single-channel high resolution seismic, and information from nine wells. Conventional seismic shows elongated NNE-SSW highs and lows (Camels Basin, Camels Hump-Turneffe atoll, Gladden Basin, Glovers atoll-Lighthouse Island). The thrusted block of Camels Hump formed from buttressing of the Maya Mountains against the moving Caribbean plate during the Paleocene. Its load generated Camels Basin, whereas Gladden and Turneffe Basins formed as pull-aparts. The transtension produced the Turneffe and the Glovers-Lighthouse alignments whose tops as well as Camels Hump's were covered by carbonate platforms during the late Eocene/Oligocene. These carbonates were <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> in the early/middle Miocene. During the middle/late Miocene, tectonic enhancement of Camels Hump and Glovers highs triggered the collapse of their margins, shedding mass flow deposits. The late Pliocene/early Pleistocene sea-level fall moved the shoreline along the eastern flank of Camels Hump and in the northern Camels Basin where longshore currents redistributed the sediments. The Belize Barrier Reef became established on top of these lowstand siliciclastic coastal deposits {{in the middle of the}} Brunhes Epoch (about 0. 45 Ma). Once the barrier reef was formed, it established the modern mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. When sea-level dropped, about 120 m during the Last Glacial Maximum (18, 000 years ago), the reef built during the previous interglacial highstand was karstified. The shelf lagoon became a fluvial plain drained by two incised valley systems. The northern fluvial system deposited a lowstand delta at the mouth of the English Cay Channel. This delta was partially reworked by longshore currents. The rise of sea-level slowed at about - 65 to - 70 m, 11, 000 to 10, 000 years ago (Younger Dryas) and is documented by a landward-stepped delta. As sea-level rise resumed, the incised valleys became filled with fluvial to estuarine sediments and, then, buried under marine marls. Flooding at about 7, 000 years ago reactivated the reef...|$|R
40|$|The Maldive Archipelago in the {{equatorial}} Indian Ocean {{is only the}} uppermost {{part of a more}} than 3 -km thick carbonate platform. The Maldive platform contains a 50 Ma-long sedimentation record and has a relatively simple tectonic history. The interpretation of 6000 km of Shell 2 -D seismic data and information from two industry and three ODP wells was the basis for the reconstruction of the platform evolution and assessment of controls on platform development. The evolution of the Maldives platform was essentially twofold. During the first stage (Eocene-early Oligocene), tectonic control played the dominant role in the establishment and geographic distribution of shallow water carbonates. A series of shallow water carbonate platforms were formed in the early Eocene on basement highs separated by two deep, narrow, and continuous graben systems. The platforms aggraded and backstepped in the Eocene and early Oligocene in response to relative sea level rise driven mostly by tectonic subsidence. The second stage of the platform evolution (late Oligocene-Quaternary) was predominantly controlled by sea level fluctuations. A significant fall in sea level at the early-late Oligocene transition, with a magnitude possibly up to a 100 m, was recorded in the paleo-bathymetry of the Shell ARI- 1 well. In the late Oligocene and early Miocene, the platforms first aggraded, <b>partially</b> <b>drowned,</b> and later backstepped in response to a substantial long-term sea-level rise. At the end of the early Miocene, a series of aggrading flat top carbonate banks, a small remnant of the Eocene-Oligocene neritic carbonate system, were established {{on the periphery of the}} central basin, the predecessor of the modern Inner Sea of the Maldives. During the middle Miocene, the bank margins prograded for 10 [...] 15 km. The progradation was driven by five complete sea level cycles, with each cycle represented by a relative sea-level fall and a subsequent rise. The reconstructed late Oligocene-middle Miocene relative sea level history of the Maldives corresponds well with the newly-published ice-volume record based on the temperature-corrected benthic foraminifera oxygen isotope data. The late Oligocene-middle Miocene depositional geometries of the Maldive platform appear to have recorded eustatic sea-level fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Pedro Channel is the deepest, central-most seaway on the {{northern}} Nicaragua Rise. A revised bathymetric map illustrates a seafloor dissected by numerous canyons and gullies as well as portions of a drowned carbonate bank with keep-up bank morphology. The 3. 5 kHz echogram data interpretation in Pedro Channel indicates the banks provide both a line and point source of sediment to the channel floor. Concentric facies belts along the bank margins illustrate the line source concept. Localized zones of coarser-grained deposits at the bases of canyons along the bank margins depict the point source concept. The synthetic seismograms for ODP Site 1000 have low correlation coefficients (0. 321). Visual correlation of the synthetic seismogram with SCS data indicates a good correlation of seismic facies with various lithologic intervals. An interpretation of SCCS and MCS data reveals that periplatform sedimentation has dominated Pedro Channel from the early Miocene to recent. Dredge haul analysis suggests that a neritic carbonate bank <b>drowned</b> <b>partially</b> in the middle Oligocene and finally in the early Miocene. Erosion affects the edges of this drowned bank in the middle Miocene. Faults in Pedro Channel illustrate characteristics typical of sinistral strike-slip faults including vertical to sub-vertical faults, faults that splay upward, forced folds, and linear fault traces in map view. ODP Site 998 was selected over {{a small portion of}} the Cayman Rise on a small topographic high. Synthetic seismograms for ODP Site 998 have low correlation coefficients (0. 168). Despite the low correlation coefficients, turbidite-rich core intervals correlate with SCS intervals having low continuity seismic reflectors. The predominantly pelagic sedimentation at this Site results in a generally continuous seismic reflection character. ODP Site 1001 is located just north of the Hess Escarpment. Synthetic seismograms have low correlation coefficients (0. 335), but do permit correlation of SCS A" and B" horizons with an Eocene-Miocene unconformity and basaltic basement respectively. Hydrosweep data indicates that the Hess Escarpment is dissected by numerous canyons incising along faults. The northwest trending normal faults are suggestive of dextral strike-slip motion...|$|R
