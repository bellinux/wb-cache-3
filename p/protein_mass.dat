25|$|After {{separation}} of red cell membranes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) four glycophorins have been identified.

A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining.

2500|$|A major {{application}} for ESI is {{the field of}} <b>protein</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometry. Here, the MS {{is used for the}} identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by de novo peptide sequencing (using tandem mass spectrometry) or peptide mass fingerprinting. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using proteases. As well for the digestion in solution as for the in-gel digestion buffered solutions are needed, whose content in salts is too high and in analyte is too low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined desalting and concentration step is performed. Usually a reversed phase liquid chromatography is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the chromatography matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of organic solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In LC-MS the desalting/concentration is realised with a pre-column, in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with [...] microliter pipettes. Here, the peptides are eluted with the spray solution containing an appropriate portion of organic solvent. The resulting solution (usually a few microliters)is enriched with the analyte and, after transfer to the spray capillary, can be directly used in the MS.|$|E

40|$|Acetonitrile {{precipitation}} {{has been}} carried out as an investigative method for separating small from high molecular <b>mass</b> <b>proteins.</b> The separation has been visualized on a 1 -D gel electrophoresis.

Visualization of the purified cytosolic extract, the precipitate and the supernatant clearly show enrichment for small molecular <b>mass</b> <b>proteins</b> in the supernatant. In addition, the high molecular <b>mass</b> <b>proteins</b> in the non-precipitated cytosolic extract are enriched in the precipitate.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveHypothermic {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{is associated}} with capillary fluid leakage, resulting in edema and occasionally organ dysfunction. Systemic inflammatory activation is considered responsible. In some studies methylprednisolone has reduced the weight gain during cardiopulmonary bypass. Vitamin C and α-trinositol have been demonstrated to reduce the microvascular fluid and protein leakage in thermal injuries. We therefore tested these three agents for the reduction of cold-induced fluid extravasation during cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsA total of 28 piglets {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups of 7 each: control group, high-dose vitamin C group, methylprednisolone group, and α-trinositol-group. After 1 hour of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated in all animals and continued to 90 minutes. The fluid level in the extracorporeal circuit reservoir was kept constant at the 400 -mL level and used as a fluid gauge. Fluid needs, plasma volume, changes in colloid osmotic pressure in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit, and total water contents in different tissues were recorded, and the <b>protein</b> <b>masses</b> and the fluid extravasation rate were calculated. ResultsHemodilution was about 25 % after start of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Cooling did not cause any further changes in hemodilution. During steady-state normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, the fluid need in all groups was about 0. 10 mL/(kg · min), with a 9 -fold increase during the first 30 minutes of cooling (P <. 001). This increased fluid need was due mainly to increased fluid extravasation from the intravascular to the interstitial space at a mean rate of 0. 6 mL/(kg · min) (range 0. 5 - 0. 7 mL/[kg · min]; P <. 01) and was reflected by increased total water content in most tissues in all groups. The albumin and <b>protein</b> <b>masses</b> remained constant in all groups throughout the study. ConclusionPretreatment with methylprednisolone, vitamin C, or α-trinositol was unable to prevent the increased fluid extravasation rate during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. These findings, together with the stability of the <b>protein</b> <b>masses</b> throughout the study, support the presence of a noninflammatory mechanism behind the cold-induced fluid leakage seen during cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R

Immunogold labelling confirmed that the F 420 -reducing hydrogenase is a membrane-bound enzyme. Electron microscopy of the negatively stained purified non-F 420 -reducing hydrogenase revealed that the enzyme is composed of three subunits exhibiting different diameters (5, 4, and 2 to 3 nm).
