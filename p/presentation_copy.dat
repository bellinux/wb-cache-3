In mid-1881, at 27 years old, Poems collected, revised and expanded his poetic efforts. The book was generally well received, and sold out its first print run of 750 copies, prompting further printings in 1882. It was bound in a rich, enamel, parchment cover (embossed with gilt blossom) and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; Wilde presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received {{him over the}} next few years. The Oxford Union condemned the book for alleged plagiarism in a tight vote. The librarian, who had requested the book for the library, returned the <b>presentation</b> <b>copy</b> to Wilde with a note of apology.

2500|$|In the Middle Ages, a hieratic {{canopy of}} state (or [...] "estate"), cloth of honour, or cloth of state was hung above {{the seat of}} a personage of {{sufficient}} standing, {{as a symbol of}} authority. The seat under such a canopy of state would normally be raised on a dais. The cloth above a seat generally continued vertically down to the ground behind the seat. [...] Emperors and kings, reigning dukes and bishops were accorded this honour. In a 15th-century manuscript illumination the sovereign Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes sits in state to receive a <b>presentation</b> <b>copy</b> of the author's book. His seat is raised on a carpet-covered dais and backed with a richly embroidered dosser (French, [...] "dos"). Under his feet is a cushion, such as protected the feet of the King of France when he presided at a lit de justice. [...] The King of France was also covered by a mobile canopy during his Coronation, held up on poles by several Peers of France.

6000|$|Bibliography still {{helps us}} with a further glimpse of our characters. I have here before me a small volume (printed for private circulation: no printer's name; n.d.), [...] "Poésies par Frédéric et Amélie." [...] Mine is a <b>presentation</b> <b>copy,</b> {{obtained}} for me by Mr. Bain in the Haymarket; {{and the name of}} the first owner is written on the fly-leaf in the hand of Prince Otto himself. The modest epigraph--"Le rime n'est pas riche"--may be attributed, with a good show of likelihood, to the same collaborator. It is strikingly appropriate, and I have found the volume very dreary. Those pieces in which I seem to trace the hand of the Princess are particularly dull and conscientious. But the booklet had a fair success with that public for which it was designed; and I have come across some evidences of a second venture of the same sort, now unprocurable. Here, at least, we may take leave of Otto and Seraphina--what do I say? of Frédéric and Amélie--ageing together peaceably at the court of the wife's father, jingling French rhymes and correcting joint proofs.|$|E

[...] He said that Southey had always been most kind to him. [...] . There were various other testimonials from people of note, American as well as English. In his parlor there is a good oil-painting of himself, and in the drawing-room a very fine crayon sketch, wherein his face, handsome and agreeable, is lighted up with all a poet's ecstasy; likewise a large and fine engraving from the picture. The government has recognized his poetic merit by a pension of fifty pounds,--a small sung, it is true, but enough to mark him out as one who has deserved well of his country. [...] . The man himself is very good and lovable. [...] . I was able to gratify him by saying that I had recently seen many favorable notices of his poems in the American newspapers; an edition having been published a few months since on our side of the ocean. He was much pleased at this, and asked me to send him the notices. [...] .|$|E
