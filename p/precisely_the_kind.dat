Learning that the Russians had encamped at their {{operational}} base {{in the town of}} Heilsberg, by the Alle River, Napoleon decided to conduct a general assault in the hopes of dislodging what he thought was the rearguard of the Russian army. In fact, the French ran into the entire Russian army of over 50,000 men and 150 artillery guns. Repeated and determined attacks by the French failed to dislocate the Russians, who were fighting inside elaborate earthworks designed to prevent <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of river crossing Napoleon was attempting. French casualties soared to 10,000 while the Russians lost about 6,000. The Russians eventually withdrew from Heilsberg as their position became untenable, prompting Napoleon to chase after them once again. The French headed in the direction of Königsberg to gain additional supplies and provisions. On June 13, the advance guard of Marshal Lannes reported seeing large numbers of Russian troops at the town of Friedland. Both sides engaged one another {{for the remainder of the}} day with no result. Crucially, Bennigsen believed he had enough time to cross the Alle the following day, to destroy the isolated units of Lannes, and to withdraw back across the river without ever encountering the main French army.|$|E

500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E

The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws.

There is a kind of brusque humor in his address, a downright heartiness, which reminds one of western character.

60|$|Mr. Thomson {{has clearly}} no bias {{in favour of}} a God like our own, known to savages, and not derived from ghost-worship.

Such a God, being usually unpropitiated by sacrifice and lucrative private practice, is <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of deity who does not suit a priesthood. For these reasons--that a priesthood 'sees no money in' a God of this kind, and that Gods of this kind, ethical and creative, are found {{where there are no}} priesthoods--we cannot look on the conception as a late one of priestly origin, as Mr. Thomson does, though a learned caste, like the Peruvian Amantas, may refine on the idea. Least of all can such a God be 'the creation of the priests that minister to him,' when, as in Peru, the Andaman Isles, and much of Africa, this God is ministered to by no priests. Nor, lastly, can we regard the absence of sacrifice to the Creative Being as a mere proof that he is an ancestral ghost who 'had lived on earth at too remote a time;' for this absence of sacrifice occurs where ghosts are dreaded, but are not propitiated by offerings of food (as among Australians, Andamanese, and Blackfoot Indians), while the Creative Being is not and never was a ghost, according to his worshippers.|$|E
