40|$|When lawyers {{receive a}} {{document}} — whether hard copy or an electronic document — {{that they know}} the adversary sent them inadvertently (for example, a fax or email mistakenly sent to an adversary lawyer instead of to co-counsel), the black letter rule in Rule 4. 4 requires the lawyer to notify the other side. However, this Rule {{does not require the}} receiving lawyer to return the document unread. Whether the receiving lawyer can use that document depends, in essence, on the law of evidence. If the court decides that the document lost its privileged status (perhaps because the sending lawyer acted unreasonably), the receiving lawyer can use the document. In some cases, the sending lawyer sends a document advertently (for example, in response to a discovery request). In that situation as well, the lawyer should {{be able to use the}} document, unless some other law, such as the law of evidence, says otherwise. For example, the sending lawyer advertently sent over a large group of documents, one of which is a <b>privileged</b> <b>document</b> that the sending lawyer did not intend to disclose. In many cases, courts will hold that the document in question remains privileged if the sending lawyer acted reasonably. Hence, the receiving lawyer should not use that document in that particular circumstance. As stated in Formal Opinion 05 - 437, “Rule 4. 4 (b) thus only obligates the receiving lawyer to notify the sender of the inadvertent transmission promptly. The rule does not require the receiving lawyer either to refrain from examining the materials or to abide by the instructions of the sending lawyer. ”The Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers also concludes, it “is not a violation [of legal ethics] to accept the advantage of inadvertent, and even negligent, disclosure of confidential information by the other lawyer, if the effect of the other lawyer’s action is to waive the right of that lawyer’s client to assert confidentiality. ” Moreover, if the receiving lawyer may use the document, the receiving lawyer should be able to examine and use all of the information within the document, including information embedded within the document. That information may be embedded in a hard copy document (such as fingerprints, the age or type of the paper), or it may be embedded in a digital document (metadata). If the sending lawyer does not want the receiving lawyer to look at metadata, he or she should not send it. As ABA Formal Opinion 06 - 442 advised, the Model Rules do not prohibit lawyers from discovering and using metadata found in documents that other lawyers transmit to them, even though the other lawyer may not know that the electronic version of the document contains metadata. However, in 2012, the ABA added a new Comment to Rule 4. 4, which provides that Rule 4. 4 creates an obligation on the receiving lawyer “to promptly notify the sender” only when “the receiving lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the metadata was inadvertently sent to the receiving lawyer. ” The concept of sending metadata inadvertently is peculiar when applied to a lawyer who advertently intends to turn over the particular document that contains the metadata. One wonders how the receiving lawyer should know that the sending lawyer sent the document advertently but sent the metadata “inadvertently,” when the sending lawyer turns over the digital document pursuant to discovery and does not claim that the document itself (as opposed to the metadata within it) was sent by accident. After all, no ethics Rule requires the receiving lawyer “to promptly notify” the sending lawyer that an analogue document has other data embedded within it — such as fingerprints, the age of the paper, and the age of the ink on the paper. In the midst of these Opinions, language in the Comments to ABA Model Rule 4. 4, which the ABA House of Delegates added in 2012, confuses the matter. The Comments suggest that metadata in a digital document has an exalted position, in contrast to analogue data in a hard copy. The Report to the ABA House of Delegates did not make clear that it is exalting metadata or intending to overrule any ABA Formal Opinion. Yet, the changes in the Comments to Rule 4. 4 treat metadata differently. There is no justification for treating metadata differently, as this paper explains. Given past history, many courts will simply refuse to follow the ABA’s lead on this issue, just as they have refused to follow the ABA’s efforts to ban non-misleading lawyer participation in internet chat rooms. Other courts may adopt these Comments, but may interpret them to mean very little by always concluding that the sending lawyers always meant to include the metadata on electronic documents that they voluntarily turned over to the other side...|$|E

If Congress is to act, it should recognize the essential role privilege waiver plays in prosecuting white-collar crime, and should move to limit the deleterious ramifications to corporations of routine privilege waivers.

The problem is that Professor Freedman assumes that if lawyers should act zealously in the event of ambiguous ethics rules, we should also want rulemakers to focus heavily on zeal when crafting the rule regarding misdirected documents. In fact, even if we assume that lawyers should resolve any ambiguities in the rules in favor of zeal, we should still want rulemakers to examine a broader range of public policy considerations when crafting the rules themselves. Because Professor Freedman does not discuss this distinction, he does not fully acknowledge several values other than zealous advocacy that we should consider when developing a rule on misdirected documents. Those other values suggest that the rule should require lawyers to return inadvertent disclosures, but only when senders discover their mistakes before recipients have reviewed the relevant documents...|$|R

Defesa: Curitiba, 29 / 09 / 2014 Inclui referênciasResumo: Esta tese visa compreender o processo de transição do uso da mão de obra indígena, fosse semelhante à escravidão ou administrada, para o uso da força de trabalho escravo de africanos e afrodescendentes na Capitania de São Paulo. Para tanto foi delimitado o período de 1697 a 1780 e os documentos privilegiados foram processos judiciais, tanto cíveis quanto criminais, tramitados em vilas da Comarca de Paranaguá, pertencente à Capitania paulista. A extensão {{territorial}} da Comarca era grande e abrangia as vilas de Cananéia, Iguape, Paranaguá, Curitiba, São Francisco e Laguna. Apesar de existirem processos judiciais para todas as referidas localidades, prevaleceram àqueles referentes à vila de Curitiba, seguida pela de Paranaguá. Buscou-se num primeiro momento analisar a documentação que trazia indígenas e seus descendentes, evidenciando as diferentes relações e interações mantidas por eles com a sociedade, que ia desde o seu arrolamento em inventários, sua venda e legação a herdeiros, até situações em que recorreram à justiça para conseguir sua liberdade, já garantida por lei, mas não cumprida dentro da estrutura prevalecente na configuração social aqui examinada. Logo após a análise dos indígenas, que se mostraram muito mais presentes na primeira metade do século XVIII, foi a vez dos africanos e afrodescendentes, fossem eles libertos ou escravos. Este grupo, muito mais numeroso a partir de 1750, era formado em sua maioria por pessoas nascidas na América portuguesa, e não por africanos. A partir da documentação judicial foi também possível evidenciar o uso e a posse destes escravos entre a população livre, bem como os campos de tensões em que estiveram envolvidos. A presença de índios, negros e brancos convivendo de maneira bastante próxima nas vilas da Comarca de Paranaguá facilitou o processo de miscigenação dessa sociedade, formada por mestiços de diferentes origens. Por fim, a tese é encerrada com uma discussão sobre as interações inevitáveis que aconteceram entre negros e índios, aspecto pouco abordado pela historiografia brasileira. A configuração social da Capitania de São Paulo durante o século XVIII proporcionou que as histórias de africanos e afrodescendentes se conectassem às dos indígenas e mestiços. Palavras-chave: Indígenas, Negros, Administração, Escravidão, Capitania de São Paulo. Abstract: This thesis aims {{to comprehend}} the process of transition {{of the use of}} Indian labor, were it similar to slaveryor administered, to the use of African slave labor and Afrodescendant in the Sao Paulo's Captaincy. For that, the period of 1697 to 1780 was delimited and the <b>privileged</b> <b>documents</b> were judicial processes, both civil and criminal, transacted in Paranagua County's villages, belonging to Sao Paulo's Captaincy. The territorial extent of the County was vast and included the villages of Cananeia, Iguape, Paranagua, Curitiba, Sao Francisco and Laguna. Even though judicial processes existed for all the referred locations, the ones related to the Curitiba village prevailed, followed by the Paranagua ones. Was sought in a first approach to analyze the documentation that brought Indiansand their descendants, showing the different relations and interactions kept between them and the society, that went from their enrollment in inventories of heritages, their selling and legation to heirs, as far as situations where they went to the Court to gain their freedom, already guaranteed by law, but not obeyed inside the prevailing structure in the social configuration examined here. Following the analysis of the Indians, who were much more present {{in the first half of}} the eighteenth century, was the time of the Africans and Afrodescendants, were they freedmen or slaves. This group, much more numerous starting in 1750, consisted mostly by people born in the Portuguese America, and not by Africans. From the judicial documents was also possible to make evident the use and ownership of these slaves among the free population, as well as the stress fields that they were involved. The presence of Indians, Blacks and Whites living in a very close way in the Paranagua County's villages facilitated the process of miscegenation of this society, formed by mestizos of different origins. Finally,the thesis concludeswith a discussionabout the inevitable interactions that happened between Blacks and Indians, aspect poorly approached by the Brazilian historiography. The social configuration of the Sao Paulo'sCaptaincy during the eighteenth century made possible the connection between the historiesof the Africansand Afrodescendants and the histories of the Indians and mestizos.

Firstly, the thesis offers a definitive summary of the key characteristics of Chippendale’s and Riesener’s work which will better enable practitioners (conservators, curators, collectors, etc.) to identify pieces made by these makers, analyze their condition and help conserve these important pieces of furniture: furniture history currently is over‐dependent on much more subjective approaches to this process of identification. Secondly, the thesis examines different aspects of furniture making in England and France (literature on the workshops, information on economic conditions, evidence relating to tools and materials etc.) and integrates them in such a way as to provide an authoritative account of the complex processes involved in the commissioning of such fashionable furniture. The thesis not only helps us better understand furniture making in England and France at a structural level during this key period of transition but also provides an original and systematic approach to writing a history around such material cultures, demonstrating how important it is to the full(est) comprehension of history that such fashionable objects be understood. Where other frequently more <b>privileged</b> objects (written <b>documents,</b> paintings and sculptures etc.) have been seen to provide valuable historical insights, this thesis argues that fashionable furniture can now be seen to provide its own unique perspectives on the time and on the society in which it was created...|$|R

Aliando conceitos da teoria arquivística e do estudo do processo de criação, e levando-se em conta, principalmente, que o conteúdo musical deveria ser o elemento norteador na feitura do trabalho, pudemos observar a importância da informação presente na documentação musical estudada. Como fio condutor, temos a oportunidade de apresentar os principais aspectos de um conjunto de documentos inéditos, objeto privilegiado de análise, manuscritos na juventude pelo compositor Camargo Guarnieri. A Obra de Difusão Interdita, título dado pelo autor para nomear o conjunto de anotações musicais escritas entre os anos de 1920 a 1928, abarca uma variedade grande de registros musicais que, pela sua natureza de obra imatura, em fase redacional de elaboração idéias, nos permite desvendar a fixação de conceitos e caracterização da personalidade do artista em formação. The goal of {{the present}} work is to demonstrate in which way a special list of musical manuscripts is an important tool of research, able to support the musicology in the task of analyzing documents and {{to lead to the}} comprehension of the different aspects involved in the binomial composer/composition. By bringing together the concepts of the archival science theory and the study of the artistic process and by considering mainly that the musical content should be the guiding element in the making of the work, {{we have been able to}} observe the importance of the information present in the musical documentation studied. As a guideline, we have the opportunity to present the main aspects of an unpublished collection of <b>documents,</b> <b>privileged</b> object of analysis, handwritten during the youth of the composer Camargo Guarnieri. The Interdicted Work of Diffusion (Obra de Difusão Interdita), title given by the author in order to denominate the collection of musical notations written between 1920 and 1928, embraces a big variety of music registration that, by their nature of immature work, in the redactional phase of the elaboration of ideas, allows one to disclose both the establishment of the concepts and the distinctness of the personality of the artist in development...|$|R
