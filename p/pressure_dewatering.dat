40|$|Generally, sludge {{conditioned}} with inorganic coagulants exhibits rigid {{structure and}} {{is suitable for}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>dewatering</b> process. Sludge flocs possess multilayered structure, and the sludge dewaterability is mainly dependent on the properties of soluble extracellular polymeric substances (SEPS). However, few {{studies have focused on}} influence of chemical conditioning on the characteristics of SEPS. In this study, the surplus sludge obtained from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was conditioned with two inorganic polymer flocculants (IPFs), PACl and HPAC, for improving the sludge dewaterability which was measured using specific resistance to filtration (SRF). Meanwhile, the variation in SEPS properties was investigated with combined high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPESC) and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). According to the experimental results, HPAC showed better performance in improving sludge dewaterability due to higher charge density and better bridging properties. EEM coupled to fluorescence region integration (FRI) demonstrated that protein-like substances were dominant fraction of soluble EPS. HPSEC analysis indicated that most of the SEPS with high molecular weight (> 2000 Da) were effectively removed from aqueous phase after conditioning, they might play more important roles in sludge dewatering. SRF correlated well with zeta potential, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and EPS content located in all four EEM regions under chemical conditioning. This result revealed that EEM in conjunction with FRI was an attractive way to evaluate the sludge conditioning efficiency of IPFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} faced by the oil sand industry is the dewatering of mature fine oil sands tailings (MFT) due to the low permeability. Vacuum pressure or electrokinetic (EK) dewatering is effective to meet this objective. This research {{was focused on the}} experimental study and analytical modelling to explore the influence of combined vacuum and EK treatment on MFT. In this study, systematical experiments on MFT recovered from the northern Alberta were carried out. At first, the characterization and EK cell tests were conducted to measure the basic properties and the coefficient of electroosmotic permeability (ke) of MFT. Secondly, dewatering experiments were carried out with three conditions, i. e. EK dewatering, vacuum <b>pressure</b> <b>dewatering</b> and surcharge preloading dewatering. In this phase of the research, experiments on dewatering by EK combined vacuum pressure treatment and EK combined surcharge preloading treatment were performed in an EK-vacuum cell designed and fabricated for this research. The results of dewatering treatment were assessed with the final water content, undrained shear strength and power consumption etc. Moreover，the theoretical analysis was carried out to examine the feasibility of one dimensional consolidation of MFT based on small strain theory under specific testing conditions. An analytical solution was derived, with variables including the surcharge pressure, vacuum pressure and voltage. The result of the experiments showed the positive effect of dewatering of MFT by EK combined vacuum pressure treatment. After the treatment, the undrained shear strength of MFT ` ii reached 5 kPa along with significant reduction in water content, which can be as low as 27. 7 %. The theoretical model based on the small strain theory simulates the consolidate rate well; yet it is not able to accurately predict the final settlements. A further study incorporating the large strain consolidation theory is needed...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the high bagasse moistures at Maidstone an {{investigation}} was done to determine which factors influence bagasse moistures. The single, <b>pressure</b> fed, <b>dewatering</b> mill at MS was fitted with various instruments, which were connected to a data acquisition computer. The performance of the mill over an eight hour shift was correlated with factors such as escribed volume, fibre fill, reabsorption factor, and mill lift. Some results ofthis investigation concur with what is expected according to the literature, and the theory of milling. Many results, however, apparently contradict the conventional wisdom of sugar milling...|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum ceramic filter resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the <b>pressure</b> during <b>dewatering</b> stages and filter cake formation.|$|R
40|$|The fractal {{structure}} and particle size of flocs are generally {{recognized as the}} two most crucial physical properties having impact on the efficiency of operation of several unit processes in water and wastewater treatment. In this study, an experimental investigation is undertaken {{on the effect of}} aggregate structure in water and wastewater treatment in Hong Kong. The fractal dimension of the resulting aggregate is employed as a measure of the aggregate structure. Small angle light scattering technique is used here. Different amounts of polymers are mixed to bacterial suspensions and the resulting structures are examined. The addition of polymer may foster aggregate formation by neutralization of the bacterial surface charge and enhance inter-particle bridging. The aggregation behavior may affect the efficiency of certain water and wastewater treatment processes such as dewatering and coagulation. The impacts of aggregate structure on two representative processes, namely, ultra-filtration membrane fouling and <b>pressure</b> filter <b>dewatering</b> efficiency, are studied. It is found that the looser flocs yield a more porous cake and less tendency to foul whilst more porous filter cakes yield more ready biosolids dewatering.

40|$|Kava (Piper methysticum Forst F.), ‘awa in the Hawaiian language, {{has been}} {{utilized}} {{by the people}} of the South Pacific Islands, in particular Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, and Samoa for thousands of years during social and ceremonial occasions to promote a state of relaxation. Kava is currently consumed as an anxiolytic by many outside of these regions. This results in a market for a means to produce kava beverages without the need for manual mixing and straining techniques. To this end, design parameters including particle size, energy for size reduction, degree of saturation, and <b>dewatering</b> <b>pressure</b> were determined experimentally. A prototype was fabricated based on these parameters using a dual impeller mixing chamber and air filtration, according to FDA and 3 A sanitary standards...|$|R
30|$|There are {{two main}} schemes for {{dividing}} the CBM well production stages as follows: (1) Four stages are divided based {{on the characteristics of}} the change in fluid phase, including saturated single-phase flow of water, unsaturated single-phase flow of water, two-phase flow of gas and water, and single-phase flow of gas stages (Ni et al. 2010). (2) Five stages, including <b>dewatering,</b> <b>pressure</b> hold, pressure control, high and stable yield, and depletion stages, are classified based on the in situ pressure change characteristics, such as bottom-hole flowing pressure, desorption pressure, and strata pressure (Qin et al. 2011; Li et al. 2011). The former scheme is more scientific and reasonable in theory than the latter one, but the unsaturated single-phase flow of water and single-phase flow of gas stages are difficult to distinguish in practical production. The latter scheme is more precise and practicable than the former one, but it has a relatively weak foundation in theory and the great influence of production control factors makes it difficult to be widely used.|$|R
40|$|The {{coalification}} {{process in}} coal seams generates coal, water, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and methane. The byproducts {{are stored in}} both the fracture space (generated by the shrinkage of the source plant material) and is adsorbed {{on the surface of}} the coal. Methane is preferentially stored on the coal surface and is held there hydrostatically until the pressure drops and the methane molecule “pops ” off. There are three main methods which can induce methane release from coal: • Reduce the overall <b>pressure,</b> usually by <b>dewatering</b> the formation either through pumping or mining • Reduce the partial pressure of the methane by injecting another inert gas into the formation • Replace the methane on the surface with another compound, such as CO 2. This report describes enhanced CBM/CMM (ECBM) recovery techniques, representing the latter two methods, which involve reducing the partial pressure of methane and/or replacing the methane on the coal surface. Both reservoir simulations and early pilot projects indicate that ECBM can accelerate and increase methane production from unmineable coal seams, and also in mineable coal seams in advance of mining. The process is implemented by injecting inert gas a...|$|R
40|$|The {{advanced}} fine-coal cleaning {{techniques such}} as column flotation, recovers a low-ash ultra-fine size clean-coal product. However, economical dewatering of the clean coal product to less than 20 percent moisture using conventional technology is difficult. This research program objective is to evaluate a novel coal surface modification technique developed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research in conjunction with conventional and advanced dewatering technique at a pilot scale. The study which is in progress is being conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company`s Mayflower preparation plant located in St. Charles, VA. During this quarter laboratory dewatering studies were conducted using a 4 -in diameter laboratory chemical centrifuge. The baseline data provided a filter cake with about 32 % moisture. Addition of 0. 3 kg/t of a cationic surfactant lowered the moisture to 29 %. Addition of anionic and non-ionic surfactant was not effective in reducing the filter cake moisture content. In the pilot scale studies, a comparison was conducted between the high <b>pressure</b> and vacuum <b>dewatering</b> techniques. The base line data with high pressure and vacuum filtration provided filter cakes with 23. 6 % and 27. 8 % moisture, respectively. Addition of 20 g/t of cationic flocculent provided 21 % filter cake moisture using the high pressure filter. A 15 % moisture filter cake was obtained using 1. 5 kg/t of non-ionic surfactant. Vacuum filter provided about 23 % to 25 % moisture product with additional reagents. The high pressure filter processed about 3 to 4 times more solids compared to vacuum filter...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} the fluidmechanics of paper-making,more {{specifically}} partial dewateringduring roll forming. The study is mainly experimental. Pressureand wire position measurements have been carried out in anexperimental facility, the KTH-Former,which models the rollforming zone of a paper machine. Measurements are carried out with pure water for threedifferent wires (fabrics) : A non-permeable,a semi-permeable anda conventional wire. Although not used in paper making,thenon-permeable wire is useful when trying to understand thefundamental mechanics of roll forming. The semi-permeable wirewith finite but low permeability is used to model the effectsof the fibre web on the drainage. Tests have mainly been carried out for different wiretensions and different jet speeds. It is shown that the localcurvature of the wire is strongly correlated to the dewateringpressure. The conventiona wire shows a single pressure peak causingcomplete de- watering {{in the first part of}} the dewateringzone. The pressure distributions for the non-and semi-permeablewires are found to show two consecutive pressure peaks followedby a suction peak where the wire is taken of the roll. Thisoscillating behaviour is due to capillary waves where the wiretension plays the role of surface tension on a free surface. Thewavy behaviour of the wire is recovered from an analyticalmodel and the effect is governed by a dimensionless Webernumber. The measured wave lengths correspond well to thosegiven by the theory. When the wire tension is high,i. e. a high dewateringpressure,the flow in the impingement region collapses when thedynamic pressure of the headbox jet is about half of thedewatering pressure. It is shown experimentally that the localdrainage shows a correlation to the <b>dewatering</b> <b>pressure</b> andhence to the wire curvature. NR 2014080...|$|R
40|$|The flow behaviour, and {{primarily}} the floc-floc interaction, of pulp paper suspensions {{have been studied}} visually. Analogy models based on these observations have been developed {{as well as the}} identification of important parameters of floc break-up in low shear rate flow fields. Floc compressions and the locations of voids (areas of lower fibre concentration) where found to influence the floc splitting mechanism. Based on this investigation an equipment for measuring the load carrying ability of fibre flocs and networks was designed, and the effect of measurement geometry, network structure and fibre suspension concentration was investigated. The load carrying ability with concentration increases rapidly when going from 1 % to 2 % in initial suspension concentration. A model handling the fibre floc behaviour during extension and compression has been developed, and some basic flocculated flow mechanisms are discussed on an analogy basis. A modified Voigt element is use, describing mainly the compressional behaviour and plastic behaviour of loose fibre network structures. Further the pos- sibility of stress chain formation is discussed on a fibre level as well as on a floc level. The effect of fibre flow (shear field) occurring in the forming zone of a roll former has been studied in detail. Basic forming mechanisms on floc scale has been investi- gated, and the effect of running parameters like <b>dewatering</b> <b>pressure</b> and jet-to-wire speed difference as well as the fibre type and concentration of the pulp suspension has been evaluated. It is evident that floc elongation increases with shear rate (jet-to-wire speed difference) and lower dewatering rate. The latter is because the fibre floc is subjected to the shear field longer due to slower immobilisation. Shorter fibre tends to create weaker networks, which promotes a higher elongation of the flocs. QC 2010090...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} in fine coal cleaning technology, recovery of fine coal (minus 28 mesh) {{has become an}} attractive route for the U. S. coal industry. The clean coal recovered using the advanced flotation technology i. e. column flotation, contains on average 20 % solids and 80 % water, with an average particle size of 35 microns. Fine coal slurry is usually dewatered using a vacuum dewatering technique, providing a material with about 25 to 30 percent moisture. The process developed in this project will improve dewatering of fine (0. 6 mm) coal slurry to less than 20 percent moisture. Thus, thermal drying of dewatered wet coal will be eliminated. This will provide significant energy savings for the coal industry along with some environmental benefits. A 1 % increase in recovery of coal and producing a filter cake material of less than 20 % moisture will amount to energy savings of 1900 trillion Btu/yr/unit. In terms {{of the amount of}} coal it will be about 0. 8 % of the total coal being used in the USA for electric power generation. It is difficult to dewater the fine clean coal slurry to about 20 % moisture level using the conventional dewatering techniques. The finer the particle, the larger the surface area and thus, it retains large amounts of moisture on the surface. The coal industry has shown some reluctance in using the advanced coal recovery techniques, because of unavailability of an economical dewatering technique which can provide a product containing less than 20 % moisture. The U. S. DOE and Industry has identified the dewatering of coal fines as a high priority problem. The goal of the proposed program is to develop and evaluate a novel two stage dewatering process developed at the University of Kentucky, which involves utilization of two forces, namely, vacuum and <b>pressure</b> for <b>dewatering</b> of fine coal slurries. It has been observed that a fine coal filter cake formed under vacuum has a porous structure with water trapped in the capillaries. When this porous cake is subjected to pressure for a short time, the free water present is released from the filter cake. Laboratory studies have shown that depending on the coal type a filter cake containing about 15 % moisture could be obtained using the two-stage filtration technique. It was also noted that applying intermittent breaks in vacuum force during cake formation, which disturbed the cake structure, helped in removing moisture from the filter cakes. In this project a novel approach of cleaning coal using column flotation was also developed. With this approach the feed capacity of the column is increased significantly, and the column was also able to recover coarser size coal which usually gets lost in the process. The outcome of the research benefits the coal industry, utility industry, and indirectly the general public. The benefits can be counted in terms of clean energy, cleaner environment, and lower cost power...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} fluid dynamic {{mechanisms}} related to papermaking, specif- ically: the initial dewatering mechanisms during roll-forming and fibre motion in sedimentation and in shear flow. Pressure and wire position measurements {{have been conducted}} in a model resembling the forming zone and the measured pressure distributions are shown to have more complex patterns than the simple model p / T/R (where T is the wire tension and R is the roll radius). It is shown that an increase in wire tension has a similar effect as a decrease in flow-rate on {{the shape of the}} pressure distribution. In addition, it is shown that the drainage has a stabilizing effect on the <b>dewatering</b> <b>pressure.</b> The flow around the forming roll has also been modelled with the assump- tion that the wire is impermeable. A non-linear equation for the position of the wire is derived that clearly shows that the Weber number, We, is an im- portant parameter. The equation is linearized around the trivial solution and has a standing wave solution with a specific wavelength that scales with the We-number. Motion of non-Brownian fibre settling in a Newtonian fluid at a small but finite Reynolds number has been studied experimentally. Two different regimes of sedimentation were identified. For dilute suspensions, fibres gener- ally fall without flipping and may travel at velocities larger than that of an isolated particle. In the semi-dilute regime we found the settling process to be dominated by large-scale fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations scale with the suspension volume concentrationφ according toφ 1 / 3, which is similar to the findings for settling spheres. The influence of shear on fibre orientation in the near wall region was studied in cellulose acetate fibre suspensions. At low concentration and low aspect ratio fibres were observed to orient perpendicular to the streamwise direction (named rollers) in the near wall region whereas the orientation further into the suspension was unchanged. As the concentration and aspect ratio increased the fraction of rollers decreased. Finally, an evaluation of a commercial Ultra Velocity Profiler unit in fibre suspensions are presented. The idea was to determine the velocity and characterise the turbulence from ultra sound echoes from particles in the fluid. However, the spatial and/or temporal resolution of the measurements did not permit turbulence characterisation. These limitations might be possible to overcome and some procedures are proposed and evaluated. QC 2010102...|$|R
