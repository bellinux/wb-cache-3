This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea}} of building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E

[...] Director Dan Scanlon {{said he had a}} dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, [...] "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt like the <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary." [...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside."

500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E

For those who want a short introduction to Sowell-think, this small {{book is a}} <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> start. His main message—amply illustrated—is that, {{on the subject of}} race, intellectuals are useless. Indeed, they don't even ask the right questions. Thus, they're woefully lost when it comes to analyzing America's most important domestic issue: the status of blacks and the state of race relations. Of course his point about lame-brained intellectuals extends far beyond their writings on race. Indeed, his book is a primer on rigorous thinking about social and economic issues in general, here and abroad." [...] Thernstrom, herself a noted scholar of race relations and the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, concluded, [...] "I didn't think I would learn much from Sowell's wonderful little book, having slogged through the literature on race since I was born—or at least it feels like it's been that long. But I did. Most NR readers will not have been masochistically race-obsessed for years, but this book's tough questions and clear-eyed answers should make them even more disgusted with America's anti-intellectual intelligentsia than they probably already are. Intellectuals and Race is a feast of hard thinking about America's ongoing racial agony." ...|$|E
