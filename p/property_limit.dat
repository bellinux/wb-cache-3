Professor Cohen argues, instead, that the debate about data privacy protection should be grounded in {{an appreciation of the}} conditions necessary for individuals to develop and exercise autonomy in fact, and that meaningful autonomy requires a degree of freedom from monitoring, scrutiny, and categorization by others.

Also, Ssd revealed a significant potency of abolishing TNF-α-induced cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis in HUVECs while inducing apoptosis via enhancing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HeLa cells.

Through these perturbed games, the dynamic solution concept of limit asymptotic stability is motivated by insisting that such solutions be asymptotically stable for all sufficiently small perturbations (a robustness <b>property).</b> <b>Limit</b> asymptotic stability is then a refinement of the Nash equilibrium. For asymmetric normal form games, it is shown that a strategy pair is limit asymptotically stable {{if and only if}} it is a pure strategy pair that weakly dominates alternative best replies. For symmetric normal form games, all evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS's), whether pure or mixed, are limit asymptotically stable. Here, conditions are established for limit asymptotic stability of completely mixed (i. e. interior) strategies as well as strategies on the boundary. Consistency with solutions found by backwards and/or forwards induction is shown for elementary extensive form games.

In the analysis of SCR, the behavioral characteristics are investigated to check the failure modes by assessing the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} the stress and strain which SCR goes through in time series. SCR is affected by the motions of connected floating production facility and exciting environmental loads. The driven force and motion of SCR has an interaction with seabed soil which represents the stiffness and friction force where SCR touches the seabed. Dynamic response of SCR is primarily caused by the coupled motion of floating structure. The displacement of floating structure is often large and fast enough to cause short cycles of negative and positive tension on SCR. The interaction between SCR and seabed is concentrated at the touchdown zone resulting into the compression and corresponding deformation of pipeline at the position. This paper presents models of floating production facilities and connected mooring lines and SCRs in 100 -year hurricane environmental loads and seabed, focusing on the motional characteristics of SCR at the touchdown zone. In time series simulation, the model of SCR is first analyzed as a pipeline with indefinite elasticity so that the SCR does not fail even if the exciting loads exceed the <b>property</b> <b>limit</b> of SCR.

40|$|This thesis elaborates {{a theory}} for {{understanding}} how advanced capitalism commoditizes knowledge to an intensified degree simultaneously as it undoes {{the divide between}} human and nonhuman beings. In the text, such theory visibilizes how human and digital bodies are being produced as increasingly connected in innovation theory and recent business practices. Such increased connectivity between human and digital bodies is here specifically related to an obfuscation of the legal conceptual divides between “the human” and property. It is further suggested that a clouding of the <b>property</b> <b>limit</b> may be understood to challenge the generally assumed exclusivity of “the human” in relation to “things”. The thesis engages in making the convergences between human and digital bodies visible through developing a posthumanist theoretical perspective in law. This development is specifically connected to the recent years’ developments {{in the field of}} new materialism(s) and its affiliations to the so-called French readings of the philosopher Baruch Spinoza. The theoretical interest is particularly configured into three tools: body, entanglement, and ethics. These three tools are utilized to visibilize how legal concepts of property are significantly affiliated with two theoretical binaries that are put into question through advanced capitalist practices and digital technologies. The binaries specifically identified and interrogated are: mind/body and person/thing. The concept of the body is here utilized to question the stability of boundaries between human and digital bodies. The porousness of this boundary is particularly visibilized in relation to the production of digital bodies as separate from human bodies. The concept of entanglement further shows how processes of separation are never fully enacted. This is made visible through processes of turning both human and digital bodies into “hybrids” or entangled bodies. The concept of ethics furthermore stresses the importance to continuously move the understanding of matter in a direction where bodies, in a more posthumanist sense, may remain in their being. This implies a focus on radical sustainability that avoids yet cherishes technological encounters. As argued throughout the thesis, this type of ethics may be carried out through a radical opening of property, as well as law in general, in relation to their always-already apparent, yet hidden, materialities. This opening up to matter also further makes possible a rethinking of human subjectivity when human and digital bodies converge...|$|E
40|$|Digital Preservation {{addresses}} a significant {{threat to our}} cultural and economic foundation: the loss of access to valuable and, sometimes, unique information that is captured in digital form through obsolescence, deterioration or loss of information of how to access the contents. Digital Preservation {{has been defined as}} “The series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary” (Jones, Beagrie, 2001 / 2008). This thesis develops a conceptual model of the core concepts and constraints that appear in digital preservation - DePICT (Digital PreservatIon ConceptualisaTion). This includes a conceptual model of the digital preservation domain, a top-level vocabulary for the concepts in the model, an in-depth analysis of the role of digital object properties, characteristics, and the constraints that guide digital preservation processes, and of how properties, characteristics and constraints affect the interaction of digital preservation services. In addition, it presents a machine-interpretable XML representation of this conceptual model to support automated digital preservation tools. Previous preservation models have focused on preserving technical properties of digital files. Such an approach limits the choices of preservation actions and does not fully reflect preservation activities in practice. Organisations consider properties that go beyond technical aspects and that encompass a wide range of factors that influence and guide preservation processes, including organisational, legal, and financial ones. Consequently, it is necessary {{to be able to handle}} ‘digital’ objects in a very wide sense, including abstract objects, such as intellectual entities and collections, in addition to the files and sets of files that create renditions of logical objects that are normally considered. In addition, we find that not only the digital objects' properties, but also the properties of the environments in which they exist, guide digital preservation processes. Furthermore, organisations use risk-based analysis for their preservation strategies, policies and preservation planning. They combine information about risks with an understanding of actions that are expected to mitigate the risks. Risk and action specifications can be dependent on properties of the actions, as well as on properties of objects or environments which form the input and output of those actions. The model presented here supports this view explicitly. It links risks with the actions that mitigate them and expresses them in stakeholder specific constraints. Risk, actions and constraints are top-level entities in this model. In addition, digital objects and environments are top-level entities on an equal level. Models that do not have this <b>property</b> <b>limit</b> the choice of preservation actions to ones that transform a file in order to mitigate a risk. Establishing environments as top-level entities enables us to treat risks to objects, environments, or a combination of both. The DePICT model is the first conceptual model in the Digital Preservation domain that supports a comprehensive, whole life-cycle approach for dynamic, interacting preservation processes, rather than taking the customary and more limited view that is concerned with the management of digital objects once they are stored in a long-term repository.

40|$|In this dissertation, fluxless silver (Ag) -indium (In) {{binary system}} bonding and Ag {{solid-state}} bonding are used between different bonded pairs which have large {{thermal expansion coefficient}} (CTE) mismatch and flip-chip interconnect bonding application. In contrast to the conventional soldering process, fluxless bonding technique eliminates contamination and reliability problems caused by flux to fabricate high quality joints. Due to large CTE mismatch, high quality joints are important to manage the shear strain which develops in the bonded objects. Besides, the resulting Ag and Ag-In joints have relative high melting and operating temperature which can be utilized in high temperature packages. There are two section are reported. In the first section, the reactions of Ag-In binary system are presented. In the second section, the high melting temperature, thermal and electrical conductivity joint materials bonding by either Ag-In binary system bonding or solid-state bonding processes for different bonded pairs and flip-chip application are designed, developed, and reported. Our group have studied Ag-In system {{for several years and}} developed the bonding processes successfully. However, the detailed reactions of Ag and In were seldom studied. To design a proper bonding structure, it is necessary to understand the reaction between Ag and In. The systematic experiments were performed to investigate these reactions. A 40 um Ag layer was electroplated on copper (Cu) substrates, followed by indium layers of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 um, respectively. The samples were annealed at 180 °C in 0. 1 torr vacuum. For samples with In thickness less than 5 um, the joint compositions are Ag 2 In only (1 um) or AgIn 2, Ag 2 In, and Ag solid solution (Ag) after annealing. No indium is identified. For 10 and 15 um thick In samples, In covers almost over the entire sample surface after annealing. Later, an Ag layer was annealed at 450 °C for 3 hours to grow Ag grains, followed by plating 10 um In and annealing at 180 °C. By annealing Ag before plating In, more In is kept in the structure during annealing at 180 °C. Based on above results, for those designs with In thinner than 5 um, the Ag layer needs to be annealed, prior to In plating {{in order to make a}} successful bonding. In this section, we further studied the Ag-In bonding and solid-state bonding for different bonded pairs and flip-chip application. For the silicon (Si) and aluminum (Al) pair, Al has been used as the material for interconnect pads on the ICs. However, its high CTE (23 × 10 - 6 /°C) and non-solderable <b>property</b> <b>limit</b> its applications in electronic products. To overcome these problems, a fluxless Ag-In bonding was developed. Al was deposited Cr/Cu layer on the surface by E-beam evaporator to make it solderable. 15 um of Ag and 8 um of In were sequentially plated on the Al substrates and 15 um of Ag was on Si chips with Cr/Au coating layer. The bonding was performed at 180 °C in 0. 1 torr vacuum. The joint consists of Ag/(Ag) /Ag 2 In/(Ag) /Ag. The joint can achieve a solidus temperature of beyond 600 °C. From shear test results, the shear strengths far exceed the requirement in MIL-STD- 883 H. Al is not considered as a favorable substrate material because it is not solderable and has a high CTE. The new method presented in this thesis seems to have surmounted these two challenges. Since Ag 2 In is weak inside the joint in Ag-In system, an annealed process was used to convert the joints into Ag solid solution (Ag) to increase the joint strength and ductility. Two copper (Cu) substrates were bonded at 180 °C without flux. Bonding samples were annealed at 200 °C for 1, 000 hours (first design) and at 250 °C for 350 hours (second design), respectively. Scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis results indicate that the joint of the first design is an alloy of mostly (Ag) with micron-size Ag 2 In and Ag 3 In regions, and that of second design has converted to a single (Ag) phase. Shear test results show that the breaking forces far exceed the requirement in MIL-STD- 883 H. The joint solidus temperatures are 600 °C and 800 °C for the first and second designs, respectively. The research results have shown that high-strength and high temperature joints can be manufactured using fluxless low temperature processes with the Ag-In system and are valuable in developing high temperature package. For real applications, a serious concern is the long-term reliability of the joints under thermal stress caused by CTE mismatch between the chip and the package. Thereby, the reliability of Ag-In joints in thermal cycling (TC) environment is assessed. Si chips and Cu substrates were bonded at 180 °C without flux, and then annealed at 250 °C to convert the joint into an alloy of intermetallic grains and (Ag). Si-Cu pair is chosen because of the large CTE mismatch. Two TC tests were performed. 10 samples were examined from - 40 °C to 85 °C for 100 cycles first and - 40 °C to 200 °C for 5, 000 cycles later. Seven of ten samples survived beyond 5, 000 cycles. Based upon these results, the Ag-In joints not only have high melting temperature but also can survive harsh TC environment. To further investigate other alternative bonding method, the solid-state atomic bonding technique is introduced. High quality joints are crucial to bonding materials with CTE mismatch since shear stress develops in the bonded pair. Since stress concentrated at the voids in these joint, the breakage probability could increase. In addition, intermetallic compound (IMC) formation between the solder and under bump metallurgy (UBM) is essential for interconnect joint formation in the conventional soldering process. However, the interface between the IMC and solder is shown to be the weakest interface that tends to break first during thermal cycling and drop tests. Thus, we developed a solid-state bonding process along with ductile joint materials that no molten phase was included. Thus, the IMC and its related issues are eliminated. In the first bonding experiment, 10 um Ag layer with cavities were produced on the Si chips with Cr/Au coating layer and then bonded to the Cu substrates at 300 °C with 1, 000 psi (6. 9 MPa) static pressure in vacuum. Due to cavities, the bonding pressure can be reduced to 600 psi (4. 1 MPa). No underfill or flux is needed. From cross-section SEM images, Ag joints are well bonded between Si chips and Cu substrates. The shear test results show that bonding strengths pass the MIL-STD- 883 H, except one sample. It eliminates a concern from the bonding strength for practical applications. Due to the miniaturization of large-scale-integration of circuits on Si chip technology, the joint size and the pitch of the flip-chip joints have to be scaled down. As the joint shrinks, reliability issues and manufacturing difficulties emerge. One of these difficulties is elevated shear strain due to the increase of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layer ratio. Therefore, we demonstrated the Ag flip-chip interconnect process using solid-state bonding at 250 °C with a static pressure 800 psi in vacuum. Each Si chip has an array of 50 × 50 × 13 Ag flip-chip joints with 20 um in pitch and 10 um joint in diameter on Si chip. No flux or underfill is needed. The cross-section SEM image shows that the Ag flip-chip joints were well bonded to the Cu substrate without cracks. Despite a large CTE mismatch between Si and Cu, no joint breakage is observed. The ductile Ag joint well manage the stress induced by significant CTE mismatch. The melting temperature of joints is 962 °C. Thus, high operating temperature device such as 200 - 450 °C becomes possible. To further evaluate this, a pull-off-test was performed. The breaking force was 1. 5 times larger than the MIL-STD- 883 H criterion. There are several advantages to this solid-state Ag flip-chip bonding technology: high electrical and thermal conductivities, no IMCs and their related issues, a complete lack of flux, high ductility for managing CTE mismatch between chips and packages, high operating temperature, and possibility for a high aspect ratio of the interconnect. To figure out the stress-strain of Ag and (Ag) at room temperature and elevated temperature, a typical ingot with 9. 5 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length was fabricated. The main ingots were machined into ASTM tensile test samples by EDM. The stress-strain curves of Ag were measured at room temperature, at 221 °C (Th = 0. 4), and at 350 °C (Th = 0. 5), respectively, where Th is the homologous temperature. For Ag ingot, at room temperature, the yield strength (YS) ranges from 51 to 106 MPa and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is from 138 to 208 MPa which are comparable with the published data but the elongation (0. 27 - 0. 49) is about twice of the published value. At higher temperatures, the YS and UTS decrease but elongation varies little. Silver solid solution with 20 at. % In ((Ag) -In 20) samples were also measured at room temperature, at 156 °C (Th = 0. 4), and at 265 °C (Th = 0. 5), respectively. (Ag) -In 20 test samples have better results than pure Ag test sample. The YS is 14 MPa which is smaller than pure Ag test sample but UTS (308 MPa) and elongation (0. 73) are 1. 5 times of pure Ag sample...|$|E
