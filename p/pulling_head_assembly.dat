Unlike most audio tape systems, the capstan and <b>head</b> <b>assemblies</b> were always in contact with the tape, even during fast forward and reverse operations, only moving the <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> away from the tape path during high-speed rewind.

The print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> is positioned {{in a controlled manner}} relative to a working plane, and is connected to two reservoir containers (2, 3, 4) in which liquid to paste-like photolinkable materials each having a different photosensitivity level are stored. The respective material is delivered via the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to the selected locations in the region of the working plane. The device comprises a print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> (1), a radiation source assembly, and a heat source controllable by a control unit acting on a thermal photolinkable material layer separated on a working plane (E). The print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> is positioned in a controlled manner relative to the working plane, and is connected to two reservoir containers (2, 3, 4) in which liquid to paste-like photolinkable materials each having a different photosensitivity level are stored. The respective material is delivered via the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to the selected locations in the region of the working plane. The radiation source assembly emits electromagnetic radiation in an areal manner depending upon the photosensitivity of the photolinkable material that is delivered to selected locations on the working plane. The radiation source assembly comprises a laser light source (L) as a single radiation source whose laser beam is focused with the aid of an optical unit for beam deflection- and focusing into a region of the photolinkable material layer, which is delivered in an areal manner onto the working plane by the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly,</b> and initiates two-photon or multi-photon processes in the focus region within the photolinkable material layer. The two-photon or multi-photon processes lead to the solidification of the photolinkable material in the selected locations. The radiation source assembly comprises a first radiation source irradiating in the areal manner onto the working plane. The first radiation source: emits an electromagnetic radiation having a first wavelength or a first wavelength spectrum, which differs from the wavelength of the laser beam; and comprises a LED or diode array or an other light source having limited spectral regions. The optical unit producing a widening laser beam is present in the device by which a laser beam cross-section is expandable to a flat illumination of the photolinkable material that is delivered to the selected locations on the working plane. An optical switching element is provided that supplies laser beam either the unit for beam deflection- and focusing or the laser beam. The optical unit reducing a light intensity of the widening laser beam is introduced in an optical path of the laser beam. The print head assembly: is formed for discharging the photolinkable materials such that the photolinkable material is delivered on the working plane under formation of a flat layer with a uniform layer thickness and a flat surface layer; and comprises pressure nozzles (5, 6) arranged along a line by which the photolinkable material is uniformly delivered. A non-contact working measuring system is provided that detects the layer thickness and/or a layer surface quality of the photolinkable material layer deposited on the working plane. A control unit is provided that controls {{on the basis of a}} target/actual-comparison of the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> in a trap of faulty layer thickness and/or the layer surface quality to corrective measures. The photolinkable material is stored in an other photolinkable structure material, an other reservoir unit, and a support material. The support- and the photolinkable structure material are delivered via two different pressure nozzles of the printhead assembly to the selected locations on the respective material of the common working plane. The photolinkable material is stockpiled in the other reservoir unit by which the printhead assembly is delivered in an other working plane. A single piece pipe system has pipe diameters and pipe lengths of 5 mm and 0. 1 mu m respectively. The pipe system: has a porous pipe wall having a porous diameter of 0. 5 - 10 mu m and elastic properties, which correspond to the elastic properties of a biological tissue; and consists of biologically compatible material, or is functionalized with a biocompatible material surface.
