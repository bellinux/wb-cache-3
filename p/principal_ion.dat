5000|$|In the mid-1860s, amidst {{increased}} economic development, {{the lack}} of a gymnasium in Galați became apparent. Thus, after repeated petitions, in August 1867 the Education Ministry authorized the establishment of a school with a single class. Three months later, the school opened its doors in a public ceremony; the principal, from Transylvania, had two teachers working under him. During its first twenty years, twenty-eight teachers worked at the gymnasium, and over 1500 pupils studied there, most prominently Eremia Grigorescu (1874-1878). In 1887, the institution was declared a high school, with seven grades. The school building was completed in 1890; two years later, it was named after the poet Vasile Alecsandri. Also in 1890, academic V. A. Urechia (who represented the Galați area in the Senate) donated his personal library to the school. Beginning in 1913 and upon the initiative of <b>principal</b> <b>Ion</b> Tohăneanu, the school hosted a [...] "people's university" [...] that involved political, cultural, scientific and literary figures delivering lectures open to the public.|$|E
40|$|Two ion {{composition}} profiles, {{representative of}} the nighttime equatorial ionosphere between 90 km and 300 km, are presented. These profiles were obtained by two rocket-borne ion mass spectrometers on a single night for solar zenith angles of 112 deg and 165 deg. For both flights, the <b>principal</b> <b>ion</b> above 200 km is O(+). The downward drift of the atomic ions O(+) and N(+), coinciding with the postsunset lowering of the F 2 peak, is observed through an enhancement of the density of O(+) at altitudes above 200 km and N(+) above 240 km. Below the drift region, O(+) and N(+) are observed in concentrations larger than expected. The NO(+) altitude distribution retains its shape throughout the night, and below 210 km, is the <b>principal</b> <b>ion.</b> The behavior of O 2 (+) {{can be explained by}} the O(+), electron density and theoretical neutral nitric oxide concentrations.

Collisionally activated decomposition (CAD) mass spectra were also investigated by tandem mass spectrometry using argon, and the mode of further fragmentation depended upon the nature of the polydentate nitrogen ligand. Some of the indium(III) complexes also gave the <b>principal</b> <b>ion,</b> but for those cations containing a coordinated water molecule in the solid state the ion of highest m/z observed was the daughter ion corresponding to loss of water from the <b>principal</b> <b>ion.</b> The ES mass spectra of dimeric species of the type [(MeIn) 2 L 2 (NO 3) (H 20) ]+ (L is a polydentate bridging alkoxide ligand), which are known to be labile in solution, give [(MeIn) 2 L 2] 2 + as the base peak, but they do also show ions corresponding to [(MeIn) 2 L 2 (NO 3) ]+ or [(MeIn) L 2 (OAc) ]+, the acetate originating from the mobile phase used in the spectrometer.

Correspondingly, measurements from Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) indicate significant abundances of O 2 + up to approx. 500 km in altitude, suggesting that O 2 + may be a <b>principal</b> <b>ion</b> loss mechanism of oxygen. In this article, we investigate {{the effects of the}} higher T(sub e) (which results from electron heating) and ion heating on ion outflow and loss. Numerical solutions show that plasma processes including ion heating and higher T(sub e) may greatly increase O 2 + loss at Mars. In particular, enhanced T(sub e) in Mars ionosphere just above the exobase creates a substantial ambipolar electric field with a potential (e) of several k(sub b) T(sub e), which draws ions out of the region allowing for enhanced escape. With active solar wind, electron and ion heating, direct O 2 + loss could match or exceed loss via dissociative recombination of O 2 +.

40|$|Anion {{exchanger}} 2 (Ae 2; gene symbol, Slc 4 a 2) is a {{plasma membrane}} Cl-/HCO 3 - exchanger {{expressed in the}} gastrointestinal tract, kidney and bone. We have previously shown that Ae 2 {{is required for the}} function of osteoclasts, bone resorbing cells of the macrophage lineage, to maintain homeostatic cytoplasmic pH and electroneutrality during acid secretion. Macrophages require endosomal acidification for pathogen killing during the process known as phagocytosis. Chloride is thought to be the <b>principal</b> <b>ion</b> responsible for maintaining electroneutrality during organelle acidification, but whether Cl-/HCO 3 - exchangers such as Ae 2 contribute to macrophage function is not known. In this study we investigated the role of Ae 2 in primary macrophages during phagocytosis. We find that Ae 2 is expressed in macrophages where it regulates intracellular pH and the binding of Zymosan, a fungal cell wall derivative. Surprisingly, the transcription and surface expression of Dectin- 1, the major phagocytic receptor for Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Zymosan, is reduced in the absence of Ae 2. As a consequence, Zymosan-induced Tnfα expression is also impaired in Ae 2 -deficient macrophages. Similar to Ae 2 deficiency, pharmacological alkalinization of lysosomal pH with bafilomycin A decreases both Dectin- 1 mRNA and cell surface expression. Finally, Ae 2 -deficient macrophages demonstrate defective phagocytosis and killing of the human pathogenic fungus C. albicans. Our results strongly suggest that Ae 2 is a critical factor in the innate response to C. albicans.

As in all metazoans, mosquitoes employ the product of aerobic metabolism carbon dioxide in its bicarbonate/carbonate form as one of the major buffers of cellular and extracellular pH. The conversion of metabolic carbon dioxide to bicarbonate/carbonate is accomplished by a family of enzymes encoded by the carbonic anhydrase gene family. This study characterizes Aedes aegypti carbonic anhydrases using bioinformatic, molecular, and immunohistochemical methods. Our analyses show that there are fourteen Aedes aegypti carbonic anhydrase genes, two of which are expressed as splice variants. The carbonic anhydrases were classified as either integral membrane, peripheral membrane, mitochondrial, secreted, or soluble cytoplasmic proteins. Using polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, one of the carbonic anhydrases, Aedes aegypti carbonic anhydrase 9, was analyzed and found in each life stage, male/female pupae, male/female adults, and in the female posterior midgut. Next, carbonic anhydrase 9 was analyzed in larvae and adults using confocal microscopy and was detected in the midgut regions. According to our analyses, carbonic anhydrase 9 is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme found in the alimentary canal of larvae and adults and is expressed throughout the life cycle of the mosquito. Based on previous physiological analyses of adults and larvae, it appears AeCA 9 {{is one of the major}} carbonic anhydrases involved in producing bicarbonate/carbonate which is involved in pH regulation and ion transport processes in the alimentary canal.

5000|$|Each AMPAR {{has four}} sites {{to which an}} agonist (such as glutamate) can bind, one for each subunit. The binding site is {{believed}} to be formed by the N-terminal tail and the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains three and four. [...] When an agonist binds, these two loops move towards each other, opening the pore. The channel opens when two sites are occupied, and increases its current as more binding sites are occupied. [...] Once open, the channel may undergo rapid desensitization, stopping the current. The mechanism of desensitization {{is believed to be}} due to a small change in angle of one of the parts of the binding site, closing the pore. [...] AMPARs open and close quickly (1ms), and are thus responsible for most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The AMPAR's permeability to calcium and other cations, such as sodium and potassium, is governed by the GluR2 subunit. If an AMPAR lacks a GluR2 subunit, then it will be permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium. The presence of a GluR2 subunit will almost always render the channel impermeable to calcium. This is determined by post-transcriptional modification — RNA editing — of the Q-to-R editing site of the GluR2 mRNA. Here, A→I editing alters the uncharged amino acid glutamine (Q) to the positively charged arginine (R) in the receptor's ion channel. The positively charged amino acid at the critical point makes it energetically unfavourable for calcium to enter the cell through the pore. Almost all of the GluR2 subunits in CNS are edited to the GluR2(R) form. This means that the <b>principal</b> <b>ions</b> gated by AMPARs are sodium and potassium, distinguishing AMPARs from NMDA receptors (the other main ionotropic glutamate receptors in the brain), which also permit calcium influx. Both AMPA and NMDA receptors, however, have an equilibrium potential near 0 mV. The prevention of calcium entry into the cell on activation of GluR2-containing AMPARs is proposed to guard against excitotoxicity.|$|R
