Travelling to the Behavioral Sciences Unit, Black learns that serial killer Ephraim Fabricant (Alex Diakun) has escaped {{from a hospital}} while donating a kidney to his sister. Fabricant was arrested and convicted due to the profile constructed by Black; although he was spared execution when Black asked for leniency {{in order to allow}} Fabricant's mind to be studied.|$|E

5|$|The Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition, {{which was}} {{released}} on May 8, 2001, contains the latest game updates and a software development kit, a separate soundtrack CD and a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> a fictional newspaper featured prominently in Deus Ex titled The Midnight Sun, which recounts recent events in the game's world. However, later releases of said version {{do not include the}} soundtrack CD and contain a PDF version of the newspaper on the game's disc.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials. Included in {{the collections}} were a variety of rare items, such as a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the 1642 printing of the Polychronicon, a 1628 book of poems written in Latin, and a 1769 bible printed by John Baskerville, among others. At that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing {{for the other side}} as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella on a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> The Merchant of Venice {{to give a}} clue that the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a <b>page</b> <b>from,</b> but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it.|$|E
25|$|When Stuart first {{followed}} Ritchie {{into his}} studio {{and watched him}} pull a printed <b>page</b> <b>from</b> his 1839 English iron Albion hand press, {{she wanted to do}} it, too.

25|$|The {{attempt to}} reduce the time of games sought by those rules was successful, {{reducing}} the average college football <b>page</b> <b>from</b> 3:21 hours in 2005 to 3:07 hours in 2006.

25|$|During {{the test}} phase the testers {{requested}} a cheat code {{to skip the}} end of the game, as there was insufficient time to play through all 500 levels, and it was only at this point that Bullfrog realised that they had not included any kind of ending to the game. The team quickly repurposed an interstitial <b>page</b> <b>from</b> between levels and used it as the final screen.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} difficulty posed the logistical problems {{of handling the}} several thousand logographs whose command is required for full literacy in Chinese language. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a <b>page</b> <b>from</b> so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{comparisons}} between surviving {{portions of the}} manuscripts show {{an average of two}} to three changes per <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text. The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.|$|E
25|$|A <b>page</b> <b>from</b> the {{periodical}} Fantasio, 15 October 1911, by Roland Dorgelès, features Portrait de Jacques Nayral by Albert Gleizes (1911) and Le goûter (Tea Time) by Jean Metzinger, {{juxtaposed with}} images of unidentified models, the man with his knees crossed and a book on his lap, the woman (clothed) holding a spoon and a tea cup, as if the sitters. The commentary is heavily ironic, with the headline reading Ce que disent les cubes... (What the cubes say...).|$|E
