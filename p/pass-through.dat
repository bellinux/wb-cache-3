5|$|Prior to December 26, 2014, {{each group}} has a {{separate}} set of cost principles to follow.

5|$|Reimbursement {{of funds}} – This funding {{technique}} requires the recipient to pay program expenditures {{with their own}} funds, and then request a reimbursement for those expenses {{from the federal government}} or <b>pass-through</b> entity. Recipients prepare and send reimbursement requests, and maintain supporting documentation showing that the costs for which reimbursement was requested were paid prior to the date of the reimbursement request.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} <b>pass-through</b> for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as <b>pass-through</b> entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This requirement {{is based on the}} fact that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the <b>pass-through</b> entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

40|$|During the 1960 s and 1970 s, the U. S. {{government}} closely regulated the single-family {{housing finance}} system. The regulation {{manifested itself in}} a highly specialized system with four notable characteristics: portfolio restrictions against investments in corporate assets, tax inducements to invest in residential mortgages, prohibitions against investing in ARMS, and deposit rates ceilings. All were removed in the 1980 s, and, not surprisingly, the housing finance system changed markedly. Between early 1982 and 1989, two-fifths of all new loans had adjustable, not fixed, rates, and savings and loans reduced their holdings of FRMs (both whole loans and mortgage <b>pass-throughs)</b> by 15 to 20 percent. Moreover, the fraction of conventional FRM originations that have been pooled into <b>pass-throughs</b> rose from less than one-twentieth before 1981 to over one-half after 1985. With the opportunity of borrowers to shift to lower coupon ARMs when rates rise and with {{the integration of the}} home mortgage market with capital markets generally, one would expect that the U. S. housing sector is now less sensitive to rising interest rates {{than it was in the}} 1960 s and 1970 s. Numerous studies support this expectation. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Pass-through</b> {{securities}} {{are issued}} by a trust and allocate the cash {{flows from the}} underlying pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. A trust that issues <b>pass-through</b> certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a <b>pass-through</b> certificate is taxed as a direct owner of {{the portion of the}} trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest payments received, and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.|$|E

The full effect of monetary policy is not passed through to credit terms or product prices. The main result is that the increase in NPV from optimizing credit terms is less than even miniscule menu costs for short-term interest rate changes in low-inflation periods.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the manufacturers' strategy of optimizing the direct rebate {{to the final}} customer and the wholesale price to a profit-maximizing retailer with a price-dependent stochastic demand. The manufacturer possesses full information about the cost and the functional relationship among demand, price and rebate, but {{may or may not}} know {{about the nature of the}} underlying demand uncertainty faced by the retailer. The conditions under which a retailer benefits from passing on such information are identified. The main features of the model are illustrated analytically and numerically, using linear or iso-elastic demand functions, with additive or multiplicative error structures. Several important implications have been derived, especially those dealing with price and rebate <b>pass-throughs</b> and with the cost to the manufacturer of asymmetric information. ...|$|R

25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, <b>pass-through</b> securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} prepayment-risk-neutral {{valuation}} model for fixed-rate Mortgage-Backed Securities. Our model is based on intensity models as used in credit-risk modeling and extends existing models for individual mortgage contracts in a proportional hazard framework. The general economic environment is explicitly accounted for in the prepayment process by an additional factor which we fit to the quarterly GDP growth rate in the US. In our risk-neutral setting we account for both the fears of refinancing understatement and turnover overstatement which sometimes result in higher option-adjusted spreads (OAS) for premiums and discounts respectively. We apply our prepayment-risk-neutral pricing approach {{to a sample of}} generic 30 yr GNMA MBS <b>pass-throughs</b> from 1996 to 2006. Our empirical results indicate that the GDP growth factor adds explanatory power to the model. Prepayment, Mortgage-Backed Security, OAS, intensity, risk-neutral pricing, proportional hazard...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for modeling prepayment rates of individual pools of mortgages. The model incorporates the empirical evidence that prepayment is past dependent via Bayesian methodology. There are many factors that influence the prepayment behavior and {{for many of them}} there is no available (or impossible to gather) information. We implement this issue by creating a Bayesian mixture model and construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the parameters. We assess the model on a data set from the Bloomberg Database. Our results show that the burnout effect is a significant variable for explaining normal prepayment activities. This result does not hold when prepayment is triggered by non-pool dependent events. We show how to use the new model to compute prices for Mortgage Backed Securities. Monte Carlo simulation is the traditional method for obtaining such prices and the proposed model can be easily incorporated within simulation pricing framework. Prices for standard <b>Pass-Throughs</b> are obtained using simulation...|$|R
