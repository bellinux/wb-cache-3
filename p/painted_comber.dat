50|$|As most fish species, the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> {{harbours}} {{internal and}} external parasites.|$|E
50|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> has minor {{commercial}} value, and, {{much like}} {{other species of}} Serranus, is considered to have tasty flesh.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the fish}} {{that can be seen}} in the waters around Crete include: {{scorpion}} fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, <b>painted</b> <b>comber,</b> damselfish, and the flying gurnard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus scriba) is a {{subtropical}} marine fish, classified {{in family}} Serranidae, the groupers and sea basses. It {{is found in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea. Confusingly, a synonym of this species is Perca marina, but that name (as Sebastes marinus) has incorrectly been used for a separate species, the rose fish.|$|E
50|$|Serranus scriba {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 28 cm. This grouper has a squat body, a large head and a mouth very large in {{proportion}} to the body size. Jaws are filled with sharp teeth. The <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> is orange to red in color with bluish to dark brown vertical stripes that are wider and darker towards the tail. The caudal fin is dark yellow to orange, the dorsal fins are yellow with orange dots and lines. The pelvic fins and pectoral fins are usually monochromatic light yellow. The head shows many reddish-brown lines that resemble Arabic writing (hence the Latin name of the species). On both sides of the abdomen there is a large, bright blue area.|$|E
50|$|Sex {{determination}} is {{variable in}} fish from environmental factors like temperature to genetic mechanisms. Some fish have XX/XY chromosomes {{and others have}} ZZ/ZW. So far one gene in specific, DMRT1bY, {{has been described as}} a sex determining gene. This gene is expressed before gonads develop and differentiate. Mutations in this gene lead to sex reversal from male to female. While this gene plays a major role in sex determination in some fish species other species have variations of this gene as well as some versions of the Sox gene as seen in zebrafish. Many species of fishes are hermaphrodites. Some, such as the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus scriba), are synchronous hermpahrodites. These fish have both ovaries and testes and can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites. These fishes start life as one sex and undergo a genetically programmed sex change at some point during development. Their gonads have both ovarian and testicular tissues, with one type of tissue predominant while the fish belongs to the corresponding gender.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Painted</b> <b>comber,</b> Serranus scriba (Linnaeus, 1758), is a {{subtropical}} species {{which is}} found in the Eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea. The aim {{of this study was to}} report the data on the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> morphometric and meristic characteristics in the Adriatic Sea, as until now they have not been systematically studied. Material and Methods: Samples of 253 <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> individuals were monthly caught as by-catch species of the small coastal trawl between June 2001 and May 2002 in the Trogir Bay area (eastern mid-Adriatic). In order to analyzed biometry of the species, fifteen morphometric and eight meristic characters were measured. Results and Conclusions: Total length of <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> specimens ranged between 7. 1 and 20. 0 cm, the mean value was 11. 0 ± 1. 70 cm. Comparison of the obtained morphometric and meristic characteristics with the same ones that were published earlier did not show differences between <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> populations inhabiting the Adriatic, different parts of the Mediterranean areas (including the Black Sea) and the eastern Atlantic...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 798 {{specimens}} of the <b>painted</b> <b>comber,</b> Serranus scriba(Linnaeus, 1758), {{were caught in}} Trogir Bay (eastern mid-Adriatic) from June 2001 to May 2002 and analyzed. Total length ranged 7. 1 - 20. 0 cm (mean 11. 0 ± 1. 7 cm); body weight ranged 4. 21 - 108. 99 g (mean 18. 59 ± 10. 248 g). Histological analysis of 242 specimens confirmed simultaneous hermaphroditism. The annual variation of gonadosomatic index indicates that S. scriba spawns rom May to August. Descriptions based on microscopic examinations of ovarian and testicular tissues are given...|$|E
40|$|In this study, some {{population}} {{parameters of}} the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus scriba) of Black Sea was investigated. In June 2017, a total 15 individuals (14 female and 1 male) were sampled with trammel nets in the Middle Black Sea region. The mean length and the mean weight of the specimens were determined as 20. 3 cm + 3. 8 (Min: 11. 3 - Max: 25) and 139. 6 cm + 57. 6 (Min: 16. 4 - Max: 220), respectively. The gonads of 13 individuals were mature and the average fecundity was estimated as 7735. 8 / 1 g. The mean egg diameter was measured as 507. 2 μm + 86. 9 (Min: 380. 5 – Max: 744. 3). The length - weight relationship was described by the following formula W = 0. 0052 L 3. 3478 (R² = 0. 9809) with a positive allometric growth...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{multiple}} individual parameters {{that affect}} the reproductive output in the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> Serranus scriba, a simultaneous hermaphroditic fish that is widely exploited by recreational fishing in temperate marine coastal regions. Batch fecundity was significantly affected by maternal size, but {{was not related to}} maternal age or condition. However, egg quality as estimated by egg dry weight was significantly influenced by the interaction effect of maternal size and age. An empirical assessment demonstrated the existence of a diel spawning pattern based on a daily release of a partial fraction of eggs related to sunset time. Buoyancy varied during the incubation period, but it consistently resulted in positive buoyancy that situated the eggs {{near the top of the}} water column. This study represents the first estimation of reproductive output of the simultaneous hermaphrodites S. scriba and also provides a comprehensive study about the potential maternal factors that affect egg production. These results are a crucial step towards ongoing efforts to improve the stock assessment of this species. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Immediate (4 - 5 h) {{and delayed}} (10 d) hooking {{mortality}} for released fish kept in tanks was evaluated for <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> (Serranus scriba) {{taken by the}} recreational fishery of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). Results showed low rates of immediate (10. 8 %) and delayed (3. 3 %) hooking mortality, a total mortality of 14. 1 %. Anatomical hook location and capture depth were the most significant predictors of mortality; 70. 4 % of fish caught with a deep location of hook died {{as a consequence of}} the damage caused, bleeding, and long unhooking times. Fish caught in depths > 16 m showed evidence of external barotrauma caused by rapid decompression, which increased the probability of death. The most common forms of barotrauma were swimbladder enlargement and stomach inversion. For fish vented with the aid of a hypodermic needle to extract excess gas, mortality was reduced by half. Factors such as surface temperature, fish size, and hook type (>J> hook vs. circle hook) could not explain the mortality of fish released into tanks. Therefore, the results confirm that a practice of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) for S. scriba needs to be promoted among recreational anglers. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

40|$|Trace metal {{concentrations}} (Cd, Cu, Fe, Zn) and total-calcium content {{were measured}} in the gills of 2 marine fish (<b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> Serranus cabrilla and striped mullet Mullus barbatus) sampled in different stations in the cove of Cortiou, where the outlet collecting the waste waters of Marseille, France, is situated (NW Mediterranean). In parallel, the activity rates of some phase I enzymes (ethoxyresorufin- 0 -dealkylase, EROD; pentoxyresorufin- 0 -dealkylase, PROD) and phase II enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, GST) were determined in the livers of both species of fish. Cadmium and copper concentrations were highly variable for both species. Two sampling stations situated in the dispersion area of waste waters seemed affected by chemical pollution. At these stations, iron concentrations appeared to be higher in gills of S. cabrilla and M. barbatus. Elevated iron concentrations {{were thought to be}} due to the water treatment plant, which uses iron chloride as a flocculant. Likewise, at both stations calcium and cadmium concentrations were higher in M barbatus. EROD and PROD activities appeared to be generally lower in the livers of S. cabrilla collected at both 'polluted' stations; GST activities did not differ according to the sampling stations. Enzyme activities (PROD and GST) in M barbatus were lower at the stations in the dispersion area of waste waters. The results imply that heavy metals, which can also be accumulated in some target organs of fish, may lower biotransformation enzyme activities which are induced in the livers of fish exposed to organics...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the short-term movements {{of a small}} temperate fish, the <b>painted</b> <b>comber</b> Serranus scriba (Linnaeus 1758), within the marine protected area (MPA) of Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean) using passive acoustic telemetry. Fifteen adults were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and monitored between July 2007 and February 2008 for periods of up to 36 d. Interindividual variability was detected for both spatial and temporal patterns. There were 2 principal movement behaviours that were recorded, with some individuals showing high site fidelity and others showing a more mobile behaviour, moving out from the monitoring area. Observation-area curves indicated that a period between 3 and 5 d was required to determine home ranges of the sedentary fish. Home range sizes were small, with a minimum shift of core areas occurring on a daily basis. Total minimum convex polygon (MCP) areas ranged between 0. 102 and 0. 671 km 2, whereas 95 % kernel utilization distributions (KUD) ranged between 0. 760 and 1. 333 km 2. Core areas (50 % KUD) ranged between 0. 175 and 0. 294 km 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in home range patterns between day and night periods. However, the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) revealed diel rhythms on the detection pattern that could be related to a resting behaviour at night. Estimation of home ranges of S. scriba agrees with the sedentary habits of the Serranidae family and suggests the potential use of MPAs for the sustainable development of the fishery of this small Serranid.
