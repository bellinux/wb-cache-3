50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of coordinate chart which are adapted to this family of nested spheres, each introducing {{a different kind of}} distortion. The best known alternative is the Schwarzschild chart, which correctly represents distances within each sphere, but (in general) distorts radial distances and angles. Another popular choice is the isotropic chart, which correctly represents angles (but in general distorts both radial and transverse distances). A third choice is the Gaussian <b>polar</b> <b>chart,</b> which correctly represents radial distances, but distorts transverse distances and angles. In all three possibilities, the nested geometric spheres are represented by coordinate spheres, so we can say that their roundness is correctly represented.|$|E
40|$|Our group 1 {{carefully}} considered the factors {{involved with the}} maturity {{of the field of}} Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). A graphical representation of the consensus of the group {{can be found in the}} <b>polar</b> <b>chart</b> of Figure 1. Each of the six axes represents a factor. Milestones points in the progress of the factors are delineated on each axis whereby a milestone indicates that the majority of work in ESE is at that level. The distances between the milestones are not drawn to scale. By this, we mean that the progress to move linearly along an axis is not proportional to the amount of work that must take place. A point on each of the axes is joined via a line. The resulting shape of these lines is our indication of the current state-of-the practice of ESE. In general, the point the furthest away from the center of the chart indicates the ultimate goal in a mature field of ESE. However, due to their nature, the ultimate goal may be an interim point for certain families of study/domains. Each of the factors and the milestones will be discussed below, beginning with Domain/Coverage and progressing clockwise around the <b>polar</b> <b>chart...</b>|$|E

40|$|Map {{projection}} is {{an important}} component of modern cartography, and involves many fussy mathematical analysis processes, such as the power series expansions of elliptical functions, differential of complex and implicit functions, elliptical integral and the operation of complex numbers. The derivation of these problems by hand not only consumes much time and energy but also makes mistake easily, and sometimes can not be realized at all because of the impossible complexity. The research achievements in mathematical analysis of map projection by computer algebra are systematically reviewed in five aspects, i. e., the symbolic expressions of forward and inverse solution of ellipsoidal latitudes, the direct transformations between map projections with different distortion properties, expressions of Gauss projection by complex function, mathematical analysis of oblique Mercator projection, <b>polar</b> <b>chart</b> projection with its transformation.

40|$|Rotor {{track and}} balance is an {{essential}} part of maintenance for the rotorcraft industry. Methods for solving rotor track and balance problems to minimize undesirable vibrations in the cockpit and cabin of rotorcraft are analyzed. Additionally, different approaches to system identification for airframe response are discussed with emphasis on real-life practical applications. Rotor track and balance vibration optimization methods using least squares, weighted least squares, linear quadratic regulator, two-sensors only in the fundamental frequency, all sensors in the fundamental frequency, and all sensors in all frequencies up to N- 1 of the fundamental frequency are formulated within this study and used to calculate control adjustments quickly. The resulting vibration reduction is simulated by approximating the effects of rotor adjustments utilizing a sensitivity matrix that maps the rotor track and balance controls to the response of the rotor. Finally, experimental data involving the use of the proposed method on actual experimental flights are shown. System identification of a helicopter airframe is conducted by capturing flight data from sensors throughout the cockpit and cabin as a result of a rotor track and balance control changes. A conventional approach, which plots data acquired from single control type adjustments on <b>polar</b> <b>charts</b> to aid in the proper identification of sensitivity coefficients, is discussed. The proposed recursive least squares algorithm is developed and implemented against a database containing hundreds of flights and has flexibility in accepting input data. Results show that modeling airframe responses from sensitivity coefficients using large data sets compared to the few gathered during flight test on a test aircraft are more accurate in terms of predicting the vibration level after control adjustment changes. This proposed methodology allows sensitivity coefficient development to continue as the aircraft is being produced. The method converges quickly and produces accurate results while successive measurements fine tune the sensitivity coefficients. This leads to the ability to better model airframe response and ultimately translates to lower flight counts. As a result, time and money can be saved during business operations. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
