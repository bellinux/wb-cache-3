50|$|After the war, {{when the}} already {{installed}} machine tools had been removed, further bombing of Valentin was carried out.

5000|$|U-boat {{yards and}} pens {{were the primary}} {{objectives}} for the US Eighth Air Force from late 1942 to early 1943. In {{the course of the}} war, the Allies used Operation Aphrodite radio-controlled aircraft, [...] "Bat" [...] guided bombs, [...] "Disney" [...] rocket-assisted bombs, Tallboy and Grand Slam deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> to attack the U-boat pens.|$|R
50|$|Named for {{a mythical}} medieval French sword, the Durandal is an anti-runway <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> {{developed}} by the French company Matra (now MBDA), designed to destroy airport and airfield runways and exported {{to a number of}} countries worldwide. As a simple crater in a runway could be just filled in, the Durandal deliberately utilizes two explosions in order to displace the concrete slabs of a runway, damage that is far harder to repair.|$|E
50|$|The BLU-116 is {{the same}} shape, size, and weight (1,927 lb / 874 kg) as the BLU-109 <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> first {{deployed}} in the 1980s. The BLU-116 has a lightweight outer shell around a dense, heavy metal penetrator core. The shape and size mean that the BLU-116 {{could be used by}} unmodified existing aircraft and bomb guidance units such as the GPS guided GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bomb.|$|E
5000|$|The BLU-109/B is a {{hardened}} <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> {{used by the}} United States Air Force (BLU is {{an acronym}} for Bomb Live Unit). As with other [...] "bunker busters", {{it is intended to}} smash through concrete shelters and other hardened structures before exploding. In addition to the US, {{it is part of the}} armament of the air forces of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates.|$|E
50|$|Robert Boyd Williams (November 9, 1901 - February 10, 1977) was a {{major general}} in the United States Army Air Forces and an eminent combat {{commander}} during World War II. He personally led the B-17 raid on the Schweinfurt ball-bearing factories on 17 August 1943, the first large-scale deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombing</b> raid on Germany. He was also an important personage in the training of heavy bombardment units {{both before and after}} his combat tour.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in March 1946, Project Ruby was a joint Anglo-American {{project to}} {{investigate}} the use of <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> against heavily protected, concrete targets. The target selected was the Valentin submarine pens, that had been rendered unusable and abandoned since 617 Squadron's attack on 27 March 1945. Grand Slams were carried by Lancasters from No. 15 Squadron RAF and US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Around 140 sorties were flown, testing a range of different bombs including the rocket-assisted Disney bomb.|$|R
50|$|China {{has been}} a {{continuing}} source of military equipment to Sri Lanka, and is helping to modernize and expand the Sri Lanka Armed Forces.China exports military equipment to the Sri Lanka military including: ammunition, anti-tank guided missiles, rocket launchers and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> and rockets, mortar ammunition, night vision devices, artillery, armor, mortars, security equipment, tanks, jets, naval vessels, radars, and communications equipment. China also aids in the training of Sri Lankan military personnel.|$|R
5000|$|During Operation Desert Storm (1991), {{there was}} a need for a deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> similar to the British weapons of World War II, but none of the NATO air forces had such a weapon. As a stop-gap, some were {{developed}} over a period of 28 days, using old 8 inch (203 mm) artillery barrels as casings. These bombs weighed over two tons but carried only 647 lb of high explosive. They were laser-guided and were designated [...] "Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28)". It was proved to be effective for the intended role.|$|E
5000|$|On 31 July 1944, 617 Squadron {{was linked}} with 9 Squadron for a [...] "Tallboy" [...] deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> {{attack on a}} V-weapon storage dump at Rilly-la-Montagne, near Rheims. As Reid, flying in Lancaster Mk.I ME557 KC-S, {{released}} his bomb over the target at 12,000 ft, he felt his aircraft shudder under {{the impact of a}} bomb dropped by another Lancaster 6,000 ft above. The bomb ploughed through his aeroplane's fuselage, severing all control cables and fatally weakening its structure, and Reid gave the order to bail out.|$|E
50|$|The newest variant is the B61 Mod 11, a {{hardened}} <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> with a reinforced casing (according to some sources, containing depleted uranium) and a delayed-action fuze, {{allowing it}} to penetrate several metres into the ground before detonating, damaging fortified structures further underground. The Mod 11 weighs about 1,200 lb (540 kg). Developed from 1994, the Mod 11 went into service in 1997 replacing the older megaton-yield B53 bomb. About 50 Mod 11 bombs have been produced, their warheads converted from Mod 7 bombs. At present, the primary carrier for the B61 Mod 11 is the B-2 Spirit.|$|E
50|$|It {{was hoped}} {{that it would}} match the British success with Tallboy and Grand Slam ground <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> but the project was dangerous, {{expensive}} and unsuccessful. Of 14 missions flown, none resulted in the successful destruction of a target. Many aircraft lost control and crashed or were shot down by flak, and many pilots were killed. However, a handful of aircraft scored near misses. One notable pilot death was that of Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., USNR, the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy.|$|R
50|$|From late 1916 {{to early}} 1917 the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) had {{attempted}} a co-ordinated series of bombing raids on German-held targets. Whilst the attacks were generally unsuccessful {{the principle of}} deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombing</b> raids against strategic targets was established. General Jan Smuts, {{a member of the}} War Cabinet, prepared the Smuts Report which recommended that a separate Air Ministry and Air Force should be set up, independent of the Army and Navy and that a strategic bomber force should be formed whose sole purpose was to attack Germany.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 the Straits of Tiran {{were again}} closed by Egypt and {{international}} peacekeepers placed after the 1956 {{war in the}} Sinai were ejected by Egypt. Israel then initiated Operation Focus. Israel sent nearly every capable combat aircraft out, holding only a handful for protection. Egyptian airfields were destroyed with Anti-runway <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> and the aircraft were mostly destroyed on the ground; Syria and Jordan also had their air forces destroyed when they entered the conflict. This {{is one of the}} preeminent examples of air supremacy where Israel had complete control of the skies above the conflict area.|$|R
50|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the initial air raids F-16Is and AH-64 Apaches continued to target Hamas facilities while also inflicting severe damage to Palestinian infrastructure. Israel used the 2000-pound Mark 84 Joint Direct Attack Munition to attack buildings and tunnels along the Gaza-Sinai border. The 500-pound variant was used against underground bunkers. Israel {{also used the}} new PB500A1 laser-guided hard-target <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb,</b> which was developed by Israel Military Industries, {{and is based on}} the 1000-pound Mark 83. There were unconfirmed reports of the IAF also using the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb for the first time. Israeli aircraft also used synthetic aperture radar targeting pods and high-resolution imaging pods. After being grounded six months prior, the Israeli fleet of AH-1F Cobra helicopter gunships were rushed back into service for the operation. The Israeli Air Force also used unmanned aerial vehicles firing Israeli-manufactured Spike missiles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{limitation}} {{of the purpose of}} the Victory Bomber to only a single bomb and mission did not endear it to the Air Ministry, who required more flexibility of their aircraft. In mid 1940, a principal had been established that the manufacturing of only five types of aircraft should be pursued - two of these being fighter aircraft and three being bombers; Wallis' vision for a six-engine bomber equipped for only a specialised bomb conflicted with this concept. However, Lord Beaverbrook committed support for the project, co-operation from both the Ministry of Aircraft Production and the Road Research Laboratory would be forthcoming to aid Wallis in developing his plans. In August 1940, the Aeronautical Research Committee permitted the use of a wind tunnel at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington to perform tests to develop the <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bombing {{from high}} altitudes posed several issues, principally amongst these being accuracy. Wallis himself {{acknowledged}} that the accuracy called for to employ the <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> from 40,000 ft was difficult to achieve; specifically, there was an assumption that around 25 per cent of days throughout the year would be suitable for performing bombing missions in, but that during such missions the benefits of being undisturbed from ground-based anti-aircraft fire would lead to equivalent accuracy to conventional bombers flying at 15,000-20,000 ft under gunfire. In response to these difficulties, Wallis had proposed {{the adoption of a}} new gyroscopic bombsight to provide for greater accuracy. The Victory Bomber was to have been capable of traversing substantial ranges, being able to launch bombing missions upon Moscow in Russia from airfields around London in the United Kingdom; Wallis also promoted the aircraft as being the potential basis for post-war civil aircraft capable of performing direct Transatlantic crossings.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is equipped}} with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It navigates primarily by GPS and high-accuracy inertial navigation. Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of an attack mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a thermal imaging infrared system, slaved to a laser rangefinder/laser designator that finds the range and designates targets for laser-guided bombs. The F-117A's split internal bay can carry 5000 lb of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of GBU-10, GBU-12, or GBU-27 laser-guided <b>bombs,</b> two BLU-109 <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs,</b> or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), a GPS/INS guided stand-off bomb.|$|R
2500|$|When the Eighth Air Force resumed deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombing</b> {{missions}} between 2 and 14 October, the 56th FG {{shot down}} 37 Germans while losing just one Thunderbolt. Its {{radius of action}} had been considerably augmented on 31 August by the installation of new belly drop tank shackles on its P-47s that permitted use of 75-gallon steel drop tanks. The Thunderbolts were also modified to pressurize the tanks above [...] by feeding vented air from the instrument vacuum pump into them, and became the norm for future operations, with range further extended periodically {{by the use of}} tanks of increasingly larger size. The use of wing tank pylons did not begin until May 1944 and because of its negative effect on maneuvering performance, was not preferred.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{destruction}} of enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat is the most glamorous aspect of air superiority, {{it is not the}} only method of obtaining air superiority. Historically, the most effective method of gaining air superiority is {{the destruction}} of enemy aircraft on the ground and {{the destruction of}} the means and infrastructure by which an opponent may mount air operations (such as destroying fuel supplies, cratering runways with anti-runway <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> and the sowing of air-fields with area denial weapons). A historical example of this is Operation Focus in which the outnumbered Israeli Air Force dealt a crippling blow to the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian Air Forces and airfields at the start of the Six-Day War, achieving Israeli air supremacy.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the USAF {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a new generation, dubbed Paveway III, that finally entered service in 1986. The Paveway III system used a much more sophisticated seeker with a wider field of view and proportional guidance, minimizing the energy loss of course corrections. Paveway III has a considerably longer glide range and greater accuracy than Paveway II, but it is substantially more expensive, limiting its use to high-value targets. Although Paveway III kits were developed for the smaller Mk 82 weapons, limited effectiveness caused the USAF to adopt the kit only for the larger 2,000 lb-class weapons (the Mk 84 and BLU-109). Paveway III guidance kits were also used on the GBU-28/B <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> fielded {{at the close of}} the 1991 Gulf War. The Paveway III system was also used during the Indian offensive in the Kargil War of 1999 by the Indian Air Force with the Mirage 2000 as a launch platform. Raytheon, the sole provider of Paveway III variants, is currently delivering both standard and enhanced versions to the US Government and foreign customers.|$|E
5000|$|He was, however, {{probably}} {{best known for}} his reports from Baghdad during the Gulf War. Simpson was one of two BBC reporters to defy their editors and remain in the city whilst it was under attack by International forces (The other was John Simpson. Despite having the same surname the two are not related). His reports were carried on the national news, the World Service and particularly on the short lived Radio 4 News FM service. Simpson would later count the return portion of his Iraqi Airways ticket to Baghdad as a favourite souvenir quipping that one day he would try to use it. In {{the early days of the}} war, colleagues were amused by the facetious nicknames which he gave to their government minders; one he dubbed [...] "the veritable prune", another became [...] "the sanctimonious undertaker". Upon commencement of air raids by the Coalition, Simpson was delighted to receive a telex from his father which read, [...] "Congratulations on being bombed by the Americans, it happened to me three times in the Second World War". He would later answer a question on a survey as to whether, in the course of his work for the BBC, he had been subjected to hazard with the words, [...] "Yes...Two thousand-pound <b>penetration</b> <b>bomb</b> propelled by Tomahawk missile." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{powerful}} Jordanian radar facility at Ajloun detected waves of aircraft approaching Egypt and reported the code word for [...] "war" [...] up the Egyptian command chain, Egyptian command and communications problems prevented the warning {{from reaching the}} targeted airfields. The Israelis employed a mixed-attack strategy: bombing and strafing runs against planes parked on the ground, and bombing to disable runways with special tarmac-shredding <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs</b> developed jointly with France, leaving surviving aircraft unable to take off. The runway at the Arish airfield was spared, as the Israelis expected {{to turn it into}} a military airport for their transports after the war. Surviving aircraft were taken out by later attack waves. The operation was more successful than expected, catching the Egyptians by surprise and destroying virtually all of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground, with few Israeli losses. Only four unarmed Egyptian training flights were in the air when the strike began. A total of 338 Egyptian aircraft were destroyed and 100 pilots were killed, although the number of aircraft lost by the Egyptians is disputed.|$|R
50|$|Mission No. 84 was {{a strike}} by 376 bombers of sixteen bomb groups against German heavy {{industry}} {{well beyond the}} range of escorting fighters. The mission inflicted heavy damage on the Regensburg target, but at catastrophic loss to the force, with 60 bombers lost and many more damaged beyond economical repair. As a result, the Eighth Air Force was unable to follow up immediately with a second attack that might have seriously crippled German industry. When Schweinfurt was finally attacked again two months later, the lack of long-range fighter escort had still not been addressed and losses were even higher. As a consequence, deep <b>penetration</b> strategic <b>bombing</b> was curtailed for five months.|$|R
25|$|The depth <b>penetration</b> of <b>bomb</b> tritium can be {{separated}} into 3 distinct layers. Layer 1 is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; {{it has received}} tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to advection and/or vertical diffusion and contains approximately 28% of {{the total amount of}} tritium. Layer 2 is below the first layer but above the 26.81 isopycnal and is no longer part of the mixed layer. Its 2 sources are diffusion downward from the mixed layer and lateral expansions outcropping strata (poleward); it contains about 58% of the total tritium. Layer 3 is representative of waters that are deeper than the outcrop isopycnal and can only receive tritium via vertical diffusion; it contains the remaining 14% of the total tritium.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We have {{generated}} a high-resolution coral D 14 C record {{from the southwest}} subtropical Pacific spanning the last 50 yr. Prebomb (1950 – 1956) D 14 C values average - 52 ‰. Values begin to increase in 1957, reaching a maximum in the early 1970 s, about 10 yr after the atmospheric peak. There is a consistent 10 - 15 ‰ seasonal cycle whose relationship with vertical mixing evolves {{as a consequence of}} the <b>penetration</b> of the <b>bomb</b> transient into subsurface waters. Comparison of this record with that simulated in an ocean general circulation model highlights the difficulty in modeling vertical exchange processes...|$|R
40|$|Following their {{breaching}} of German dams in May 1943, No. 617 Squadron, Royal Air Force, {{was maintained}} as a specialist precision bombing unit. For {{the remainder of}} the Second World War the Squadron carried out precision attacks using new and unconventional weapons, culminating with Barnes Wallis’s deep <b>penetration</b> <b>bombs,</b> TALLBOY and GRAND SLAM. This thesis will show that the numerous accounts of the Squadron’s history have failed to take account of many factors that determined its role. By concentrating on the operational record and weapons, both popular historians and scholars have given a distorted and interpretatively incomplete description of the Squadron’s development. This in turn has led to an incomplete perception of the Squadron’s Development and a misconception of its full contribution to the bomber offensive. This thesis identifies policy and decision making bodies and examines their role in selecting weapons and targets for the Squadron. It explores the issues which determined the role played by the Squadron: changes in Air Staff policy for Bomber Command, choice of targets, the development and production of weapons, and tactical requirements. Comparison is made between the planners’ original intentions and the final operational record. Many of the Squadron’s operations emerged from an inability to follow through from initial planning. Such failure resulted from factors that included unrealistic expectations of weapon performance, delays in the development of new weapons, and political intervention. Alternative targets were selected not only {{to take advantage of the}} Squadron’s existing capabilities but also to address specific issues that were often imposed on the planners by outside agencies which would have otherwise diverted Bomber Command from the main offensive. In other instances the Squadron was used to supplement existing operations carried out by main force. The gestation time for new weapons was such that when a weapon emerged its originally intended targets were no often longer relevant. Accordingly, new targets had to be found. The Squadron’s role in the development and assessment of weapons, equipment and new techniques for the Command is revealed to be greater than previously recognised. This new approach to the Squadron’s wartime role examines the policy and planning backstory to the Squadron’s operations. It reveals a hitherto unrecognised complexity in the evolution of the Squadron’s role, and demonstrates how haphazard delays and setbacks were transformed into new policy to meet ever changing requirements...|$|R
25|$|The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} multirole fighter aircraft, principally {{designed to}} conduct high-speed <b>penetration</b> and first-pass <b>bombing</b> missions {{while maintaining a}} high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. It bore considerable similarities in terms of external appearance to the American F-16 fighter, having a similar configuration and several shared design features while being a slightly smaller aircraft. The engine air intake took the form of a plain chin type scoop with a splitter plate, externally resembling that of the F-16, yet internally it was substantially different, not exposing the engine compressor stage forwards (inverse S-duct), thus drastically minimizing the frontal cross-sections of IR and radar alike. In comparison to the F-16, the Lavi was furnished with a less powerful engine and a consequently lower thrust-to-weight ratio.|$|R
500|$|The carrier's [...] {{flight deck}} was [...] wide and {{overhung}} her hull at both ends, supported by pairs of pillars. A large island, modeled on that fitted on , was sponsoned off {{the starboard side}} and integrated with the ship's funnel. Much like the earlier Taihō design, Shinanos armored flight deck (they were the only Japanese carriers with armored flight decks) functioned as the ship's strength deck and copied British practice as seen in their [...] carriers. Designed to resist <b>penetration</b> by [...] <b>bombs</b> dropped by a dive bomber, the flight deck consisted of [...] of armor plate laid over [...] of ordinary steel. It was equipped with 15 transverse arrestor wires and three crash barriers that could stop a [...] aircraft; five of these wires were positioned further forward to allow the ship to land aircraft over the bow in case the aft portion of the flight deck was unusable.|$|R
40|$|Radiocarbon {{measurements}} are reported for {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater samples collected from the Alcyone- 5 cruise in the central North Pacific Ocean in 1985. Differences between the UV-radiation techniques used here and those reported by Williams, Oeschger and Kinney (1969) to oxidize and recover the DOC from sea water are presented. UV unoxldizable DOC in these samples is discussed in a separate publication (Druffel, Williams & Suzuki, 1989). We briefly discuss the <b>penetration</b> of the <b>bomb</b> 14 C signal into the DOC and DIC pools. The temporal variability of z 14 C in DIC in surface samples taken every 2 - 3 days is presented. Concentrations of total dissolved free (FAA) plus combined (hydrolyzable) amino acids (THAA) and total dissolved carbohydrates TCHO) measured in the same water samples are also reported. Our main aim is to present the chemical and isotopic data from samples collected during the Alcyone- 5 cruise. Detailed interpretation is published elsewhere...|$|R
5000|$|From 1930 to 1933 he was {{in charge}} of the design of all bombs at the Woolwich Arsenal. In September 1933 Wing Commander C. H. Keith joined the Air Ministry as an Assistant Director of Armament Research and Development with {{responsibility}} for armament. His role in the arming of the RAF over the next three years led to key decisions that were critical for the success of the RAF in the battle of Britain. In July 1934 after meetings with Air Commodore Arthur Tedder he organised an informal conference to consider air gunnery which led to the formation of the 'Air Fighting Committee' on which Keith served till 1936. Keith and his team presented their work showing that future aircraft should carry eight machine guns capable of firing at least 1,000 rounds per minute. Both the number of guns and the rate of fire was seen as revolutionary at a time when many officers thought four guns were adequate and Air Marshal Brooke-Popham is famously quoted as saying [...] "I think eight guns is going a bit far With the support of Air Marshall Arthur Tedder the decision was made.Further input from Keith and his team led to the decision to replace the English Vickers machine gun with the more reliable American Browning machine guns and to adapt these to RAF use. The Browning became the main armament for Spitfires and Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain. Having used slow motion film to record the <b>penetration</b> of <b>bombs</b> it was Keith who arranged the first such evaluation of machine guns. He was also actively engaged in the development and trials of suitable ammunition. These guns used the same bullets as a rifle and the need for a more powerful weapon had long been recognised.|$|R
