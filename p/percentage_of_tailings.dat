The study aimed to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> mine <b>tailings</b> o n the numbers of seed germinated, number of leaves, length of seedlings and length of primary roots; assess the effects <b>of</b> the various <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> mine tailings; determine the interaction effect <b>of</b> the various <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> mine <b>tailings</b> with fertile soil and organic fertilizers; and establish the best kind <b>of</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> mine <b>tailings</b> on the germination of seeds and growth of seedlings. Experiments were performed to determine the germination and growth of petunia seeds. Selections of plant candidate from varieties of seeds were considered. The ideal candidate is petunia seeds since it can sprout at a minimum period of seven days. Generally, there is significant effect of mine tailing concentration in primary root growth. Findings show that primary roots in 25 %, 50 % and 75 % mine tailings media are significantly shorter than the pure soil media. The data revealed that addition of fertilizer to the media increased plant growth in the three (3) media. There is significant increased in root lengths when fertilizer is added. It is also noted that there is significant decrease in root length as the amount of mine tailing is increased. The findings proved that the further development of plant organs are affected or are influenced by soil mineral concentrations.

40|$|Tailings (mining waste) {{disposal}} is {{a significant}} consideration for the mining industry, {{with the majority of}} the ore processed in most mining operations ending up as tailings. This creates large volumes <b>of</b> <b>tailings,</b> which must be handled and stored responsibly to avoid potential environmental catastrophes. The most common form <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> storage facility is the impoundment, where tailings are contained within a basin, with beaches forming {{around the perimeter of the}} impoundment and a pond standing in the middle. A relatively new method <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> storage is to create a “stack,” whereby the tailings solids form a large heap, with the discharge <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> slurry from the apex of the heap. This method <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> storage is finding greater popularity as the industry seeks to reduce the amount of water discharged with the tailings, and usually features the discharge <b>of</b> non-segregating <b>tailings</b> slurry that flows turbulently in its own self-formed channel down the tailings beach. It is of significant interest for mine operators and tailings engineers to be able to predict the shape of the beach that forms in either of these disposal scenarios. The key to being able to do this relies on a method of prediction of the beach slope. In this article two new beach shape models are presented for the three-dimensional (3 -D) geometric modeling of the beach surface <b>of</b> a <b>tailings</b> stack that has been formed through the variable discharge of a non-segregating slurry that periodically changes in its composition, whereby the overall discharge output is defined as a sequence of smaller finite periods of steady uniform discharge, each having its own resulting beach slope.

40|$|Tailings are {{the waste}} {{products}} produced during {{extraction of minerals}} from the ore. The particle size <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> varies from medium sand to silt or clay size. Tailings are used as a construction material for raising <b>of</b> embankments called <b>tailings</b> dams. During spigotting, the coarse particles (sands) lie close to the embankment, while the fine particles (slimes) move downwards to the impoundment. The rate <b>of</b> failure in <b>tailings</b> dams is higher than that for the conventional water dams. In the past, tailings dams have failed due to various causes such as meteorological incidents, slope instability, piping/seepage, weak foundations, and seismic liquefaction etc. The statistics shows that the tailings dams are not safe even in their construction stages. The closure and reclamation measures require that the tailings dams and impoundments should be stable {{for a long time}} (more than 1000 years). Hence, the proper understanding of the mechanical properties (i. e., permeability, stiffness and strength) <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> is essential in order to make reliable predictions for the long time stability <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> dams and impoundments. The purpose of the literature survey carried out is: (a) to understand the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> material regarding anisotropy, cyclic loading, particle crushing and creep effects; (b) to know the current design practice and identify the factors that may have strong influence on the long time stability <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> dams and impoundments, and (c) to find from literature, an appropriate constitutive model that can predict realistic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> material. There is similarity in properties <b>of</b> coarse <b>tailings</b> and loose to medium dense natural sands. Slimes are complex material and may show resemblance to natural sands, clays, or a combination of both. The hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> varies from point to point in a deposit. Tailings are more compressible than the natural soils. The coefficient of consolidation of slimes is in the range shown by natural clays. Due to high particle angularity, the sands and slimes show higher drained shear strength than that for similar natural soils. Undrained strength of sands is important in evaluation of liquefaction behaviour. The embankments can be raised with upstream, downstream or centreline construction methods. The upstream method is susceptible to liquefaction, whereas the downstream and centreline methods are relatively seismic resistant. The stability <b>of</b> the <b>tailings</b> embankments can be enhanced by keeping the phreatic surface low within the embankment body. The phreatic surface can be lowered with the application of cores, drainage zones, and the use <b>of</b> sand <b>tailings</b> in the embankment construction. Cut-off trenches, slurry walls, grout curtains, and liners can control seepage in tailings dams. The pore water pressures develop during construction <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> embankments. These pore pressures are described as initial static pore pressure, initial excess pore pressure, and pore pressure due to shearing. The stability analyses conditions for conventional water dams (such as end of construction, staged construction, and long term) are also applicable to the tailings dams. The end of construction condition, and staged construction condition <b>of</b> a <b>tailings</b> dam can be analysed with undrained strength analysis. The drained analysis can be used for the long-term condition <b>of</b> a <b>tailings</b> dam (when an embankment attains maximum height and is constructed slowly). The aim of reclamation measures for tailings dams and impoundments is to achieve long time mass stability, environmental safety, and productive land use. Tailings impoundments can be stabilized with ripraps, chemicals, vegetation, and dry/wet covers etc. Most natural soils show anisotropy in strength due to their depositional history. Due to low density and high degree <b>of</b> saturation, <b>tailings</b> show large cyclic strains in a few cycles of stress reversal. The cyclic strength <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> can increase with decreasing void ratio. Creep occurs in all soils. Clays show more creep than sands. Loose sands creep more than dense sands. The loads due to high tailings embankments may cause particle crushing and creep. The long time stability <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> dams and impoundments can be predicted with finite element analysis with suitable constitutive models. The numerical analysis needs to be carried out for severe conditions of rainfalls, floods, and earthquakes. Godkänd; 2010; 20100609 (muhauc...|$|R

The experimental results, along with 3 other independently collected sets of relevant industrial and experimental data, are used to validate the beach slope prediction models found in the literature, as well as the new beach slope models presented in this thesis.

In order to evaluate the potential of liquefaction, the void ratio <b>of</b> the <b>tailings</b> is required and is often impossible to obtain. Seismic methods allow an indirect method to estimate void ratio of in situ deposits <b>of</b> which <b>tailings</b> are examples <b>of.</b> Currently, the use of seismic methods to estimate void ratio <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> rely on shear wave velocity – void ratio relationships derived for sands. It is thus uncertain whether this relationship holds for gold tailings, which is classified as a sandy silt or silt. The measurement of shear wave velocity <b>of</b> <b>tailings</b> is done in the laboratory using a triaxial apparatus modified to accommodate bender element. Shear wave velocities are measured using wide square pulses and continuous sinusoidal waves. The results show that there is a near linear relationship between void ratio and shear wave velocity normalized against effective stress. The position of this relationship lies below the previously published results for sands. Shear wave velocity <b>of</b> gold <b>tailings</b> is more sensitive to changes in effective stress than changes in void ratio or over-consolidation ratio. Furthermore, using phase sensitive detection of continuous waves, we can conclude that shear wave velocity <b>of</b> gold <b>tailings</b> is also frequency dependent.
