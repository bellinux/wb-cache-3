New failure modes, however, {{have been associated with}} the use of polyimide because of the susceptibility of the insulation to pyrolization and arc tracking. A new wiring construction utilizing partially fluorinated polyimide insulation has been tested and compared with the standard military polyimide wire. Electrical properties which were investigated include AC corona inception and extinction voltages (sea level and 60, 000 feet), time/current to smoke, and wire fusing time. The two constructions were also characterized in terms of their mechanical properties including abrasion resistance, dynamic cut through, and notch propagation.

50|$|Generally a balun {{consists}} of two <b>wires</b> (<b>primary</b> and secondary) and a toroid core: it converts the electrical energy of the <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> into a magnetic field. Depending on how the secondary wire is done, the magnetic field is converted back to an electric field.An autotransformer balun has only one coil, or is made {{of two or more}} coils that have an electrical connection. The coil is typically wound on a ferrite rod or doughnut-shaped toroid. One can also make an autotransformer from an ordinary transformer by cross-wiring the primary and secondary windings. Baluns made with autotransformer windings are also called “Voltage baluns”, since they produce balanced output voltage, but not necessarily balanced current.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from laser–plasma interaction experiments using the VULCAN laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Wire targets {{were used to}} elucidate {{the role of the}} return currents generated by the relativistic electron beam leaving the target at laser intensities up to 5 3 x 10 ^ 19 W/cm^ 2. For some shots an additional wire or a foil was placed near the target wire. In other shots, a foil was used as the target with a wire behind. Three main observations were made: i) Z-pinch behavior in the wires due to the return currents, ii) optical transition radiation (OTR) at the second harmonic of the laser, and iii) proton emission. The OTR and the proton emission were observed from both the <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> target and the adjacent wire. The OTR emission is associated with electron bunches at twice the laser frequency due to ponderomotive JxB acceleration by the laser. The proton emission from the adjacent target was likely due to field emission of electrons by the large potential produced from charging of the <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> target.

5000|$|When {{used in a}} {{switching}} transformer, one winding of the bifilar coil {{is used as a}} {{means of}} removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the primary coil to the secondary coil of the transformer.

50|$|In 1831 {{began the}} epoch-making {{researches}} of Michael Faraday, the famous pupil and successor of Humphry Davy {{at the head}} of the Royal Institution, London, relating to electric and electromagnetic induction. The remarkable researches of Faraday, the prince of experimentalists, on electrostatics and electrodynamics and the induction of currents. These were rather long in being brought from the crude experimental state to a compact system, expressing the real essence. Faraday was not a competent mathematician, but had he been one, he would have been greatly assisted in his researches, have saved himself much useless speculation, and would have anticipated much later work. He would, for instance, knowing Ampere's theory, by his own results have readily been led to Neumann's theory, and the connected work of Helmholtz and Thomson. Faraday's studies and researches extended from 1831 to 1855 and a detailed description of his experiments, deductions and speculations are to be found in his compiled papers, entitled Experimental Researches in Electricity.' Faraday was by profession a chemist. He was not in the remotest degree a mathematician in the ordinary sense — indeed it is a question if in all his writings there is a single mathematical formula.The experiment which led Faraday to the discovery of electromagnetic induction was made as follows: He constructed what is now and was then termed an induction coil, the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>wires</b> of which were wound on a wooden bobbin, side by side, and insulated from one another. In the circuit of the <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> he placed a battery of approximately 100 cells. In the secondary wire he inserted a galvanometer. On making his first test he observed no results, the galvanometer remaining quiescent, but on increasing the length of the wires he noticed a deflection of the galvanometer in the secondary wire when the circuit of the <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> was made and broken. This was the first observed instance of the development of electromotive force by electromagnetic induction.|$|R
50|$|When the Mk 20 bomb {{cluster is}} {{released}} from the aircraft, the arming <b>wires</b> (<b>primary</b> and/or optional arming) are pulled sufficiently to arm the Mk 339 fuze (and recently the FMU-140 fuze) and release the fins.

Functioning of the fuze initiates the linear shaped charges in the dispenser which cut the dispenser case in half and disperse the bombs/bomblets.

5000|$|Through {{the input}} from Sturgeon, {{as well as}} his own {{continuing}} researches, Page developed coil instruments that were the foundation for the eventual induction coil. [...] These instruments had two wires. One <b>wire,</b> termed the <b>primary,</b> carried battery current; a shock was taken across the ends of the other much longer wire, termed the secondary (see transformer). The <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> was wound concentrically over an iron core; the secondary was wound over that. Page developed a deep understanding of the underlying behaviors. In Page's published account of his coil, he termed it and its contact breaker the 'Compound Electro-Magnet and Electrotome'. Page's patent model for this coil is on display at the National Museum of American History.In a subsequent experiment with a spiral conductor, Page mounted it rigidly between the poles of a suspended horseshoe magnet. When current stopped flowing in the spiral, a tone could be heard from the magnet, which Page termed 'galvanic music'. Thirty years later, Alexander Graham Bell cited Page's galvanic music as an important precedent for his development of telephony.|$|R
5000|$|A magneto {{is one of}} the {{electromechanical}} devices invented for {{the purpose}} of ignition with gasoline internal combustion engines. A magneto at its most basic is a simple magnet that moves next to a wire, or sometimes a wire moves next to a magnet. As they move in relation to each other, the changes in direction of magnetic force induce an electric current in the wire. Usually the <b>wire</b> (called a <b>primary</b> <b>wire)</b> is very long, and looped around an iron magnetic core that more or less channels the magnetic field through the loop of wire. As the current flows, the wire loops develop their own magnetic field, which takes a certain amount of energy to form. The magnetic field is a type of potential energy. There is usually some sort of device that opens and closes the circuit called a contact breaker, points or an [...] As the points or ignitor open, the current ceases flowing, and the magnetic field collapses. The energy stored in the magnetic field is released in the form of increased electric voltage in the wire. This voltage jumps across the gap of either the ignitor or a spark plug located in the combustion chamber and ignites the air-fuel mixture to do work.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>primary</b> neutral <b>wire</b> is available, a 'wye' or 'phase to neutral' {{transformer}} can be used. This {{usually has}} only one bushing on top, connected {{to one of the}} primary phases. The other end of the primary winding is 'grounded' to the transformer's case, which is connected to the neutral wire of the 3 phase system, and also earth ground. This type of distribution system, called 'grounded wye', is preferred because the transformers present unbalanced loads on the line, causing currents in the neutral wire. With the 'delta' connection, this can cause variations in the voltages on the 3 phase wires.|$|R
5000|$|On higher voltage systems (on {{the order}} of kilovolts) where a single phase {{transformer}} is in use to supply a low voltage system, the method of splitting varies.

Rural distribution may be a single phase at a medium voltage; in some areas single wire earth return distribution is used when customers are very far apart.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of arc track testing conducted to determine if such a transfer of power to un-energized wires is possible and/or likely during an arcing event, and to evaluate an array of protection schemes that may significantly reduce the possibility of such a transfer. The results of these experiments may be useful for determining the level of protection necessary to guard against spurious voltage and current being applied to safety critical circuits. It was not the purpose of these experiments to determine the probability of the initiation of an arc track event only if an initiation did occur could it cause the undesired event: an inadvertent thruster firing. The <b>primary</b> <b>wire</b> insulation used in the Orbiter is aromatic polyimide, or Kapton, a construction known to arc track under certain conditions [3]. Previous Boeing testing has shown that arc tracks can initiate in aromatic polyimide insulated 28 volts direct current (VDC) power circuits using more realistic techniques such as chafing with an aluminum blade (simulating the corner of an avionics box or lip of a wire tray), or vibration of an aluminum plate against a wire bundle [4]. Therefore, an arc initiation technique was chosen that provided a reliable and consistent technique of starting the arc and not a realistic simulation of a scenario on the vehicle. Once an arc is initiated, the current, power and propagation characteristics of the arc depend on the power source, wire gauge and insulation type, circuit protection and series resistance rather than type of initiation. The initiation method employed for these tests was applying an oil and graphite mixture to the ends of a powered twisted pair wire. The flight configuration of the heater circuits, the fuel/oxider (or ox) wire, and the RCS jet solenoid were modeled in the test configuration so that the behavior of these components during an arcing event could be studied. To determine if coil activation would occur with various protection wire schemes, 145 tests were conducted using various fuel/ox wire alternatives (shielded and unshielded) and/or different combinations of polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE), Mystik tape and convoluted wraps to prevent unwanted coil activation. Test results were evaluated along with other pertinent data and information to develop a mitigation strategy for an inadvertent RCS firing. The SSP evaluated civilian aircraft wiring failures to search for aging trends in assessing the wire-short hazard.
