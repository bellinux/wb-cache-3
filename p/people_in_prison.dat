5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Following {{transfer}} of responsibility of health care for <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> Scotland to the NHS in 2011, there has been growing interest in understanding the service-need for people with head injury (HI).

Methods: Searches were carried out using electronic databases (PsycINFO, Cochrane Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science).

25|$|Sanders has liberal stances {{on social}} issues, having {{advocated}} for LGBT rights {{and against the}} Defense of Marriage Act. Sanders described his opposition to DOMA as being on states' rights grounds. In 2006, he expressed opposition to legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont and did not express support for the right until 2009, after Vermont had already legalized it. He considers himself a feminist, is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes the de-funding of Planned Parenthood. Sanders has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform {{to reduce the number}} of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons and the death penalty. Sanders supports Black Lives Matter. He supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level.|$|E
25|$|Act Four {{takes place}} {{three months later}} in the town jail, early in the morning. Tituba, sharing a cell with Sarah Good, has gone insane {{from all of the}} hysteria, hearing voices and now {{actually}} claiming to talk to Satan. Marshal Herrick, depressed at having arrested so many of his neighbors, has turned to alcoholism. Many villagers have been charged with witchcraft; most have confessed and been given lengthy prison terms and their property seized by the government; twelve have been hanged; seven more are to be hanged at sunrise for refusing to confess, including John Proctor, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey. Giles Corey was tortured to death by pressing as the court tried in vain to extract a plea; by holding out, Giles ensured that his sons would not be disinherited. The village has become dysfunctional with so many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> or dead, and with the arrival of news of rebellion against the courts in nearby Andover, whispers abound of an uprising in Salem.

60|$|Christ's place {{indeed is}} with the poets. His whole {{conception}} of Humanity sprang {{right out of the}} imagination and can only be realised by it. What God was to the pantheist, man was to Him. He was the first to conceive the divided races as a unity. Before his time there had been gods and men, and, feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one or the Son of the other, according to his mood. More than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always appeals. There is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of a young Galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had already been done and suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered: the sins of Nero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was Emperor of Rome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities, factory children, thieves, <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> outcasts, those who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely imagining this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment all who come in contact with his personality, even though they may neither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest, in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{commonly}} cite deinstitutionalization, or the emptying {{of state}} mental {{hospitals in the}} mid-twentieth century, as a direct cause {{of the rise of}} mentally ill <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons.</b> <b>In</b> the 2010 study “More mentally ill persons are <b>in</b> jails and <b>prisons</b> than hospitals: a survey of the states,” researchers noted, at least in part due to deinstitutionalization, it is increasingly difficult to find beds for mentally ill people who need hospitalization. Using data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services, they determined there was one psychiatric bed for every 3,000 Americans, compared to one for every 300 Americans in 1955. They also noted increased percentages of mentally ill <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>prisons</b> throughout the 1970s and 1980s and found a strong correlation between the amount of mentally ill persons in a state’s jails and prisons and how much money that state spends on mental health services. In the book Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals, researchers note that while deinstitutionalization was carried out with good intentions, it was not accompanied with alternate avenues for mental health treatment for those with serious mental illnesses. According to the authors, Community Mental Health Centers focused their limited resources on individuals with less serious mental illnesses, federal training funds for mental health professionals resulted in lots more psychiatrists in wealthy areas but not in low-income areas, and a policy that made individuals eligible for federal programs and benefits only after they’d been discharged from state mental hospitals unintentionally incentivized discharging patients without follow-up.|$|R
