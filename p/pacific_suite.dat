40|$|The {{compositions}} of 45 natural basalt glasses {{from nine}} dredge stations and six Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 54 sites near 9 °N on the East Pacific Rise have been determined by electron microprobe.

40|$|The {{trace element}} {{composition}} of young-of-the-year (YOY) juvenile swordfish Xiphias gladius sagittal otoliths were analysed as a preliminary {{test of the}} value of otolith elemental fingerprints for determining swordfish nursery ground origins in the central <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. A <b>suite</b> of five elements (Mg, Zn, Sr, Ba and Pb) was assayed with isotope dilution ICP-MS; all elemental concentrations were roughly comparable to otoliths of other marine fishes. Multivariate analyses of elemental fingerprints based on Ba and Sr revealed differences between sample sites, and the magnitude of the differences increased with latitudinal separation. With more comprehensive sampling of nursery grounds, {{it should be possible to}} identify origin of nursery ground for adult swordfish by analysing the YOY juvenile portion of the sagittal otolith. # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: central Pacific; isotope dilution ICP-MS; juvenile otoliths; otolith chemistry; swordfish nursery areas; Xiphias gladius...|$|R

Additional chemical variations occur which require source heterogeneities, differences in the degree of melting, different courses of shallow fractionation, or magma mixing to explain. Glass compositions from within the Siqueiros fracture zone are mostly less fractionated than those from the flanks of the Rise, and show chemical differences which require variations in the depth of melting or highpressure fractionation to explain. Some of them could not be parental to East Pacific Rise flank ferrobasalts. Two remaining glass groups, from dredge hauls atop a ridge and a seamount, respectively, have distinctly higher K 2 O, P 2 O 5, and TiO 2 as well as lower CaO/Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 at corresponding values of MgO than the tholeiite suite. These abundances, and whole-rock Y/Zr, Ce/Y, Nb/Zr, and isotopic abundances indicate that these basalts had a deeper, less depleted mantle source than the Rise tholeiite suite. Trace element abundances preclude the "ridge" basalt type from being a hybrid between the "seamount" basalt type and any East Pacific Rise tholeiite so far analyzed. The East Pacific Rise glasses from 9 °N compare very closely to glasses dredged and drilled elsewhere on the East Pacific Rise. However, glass compositions from Site 424 on the Galapagos Rift drilled during Leg 54, as well as glasses and basalts dredged from the Galapagos and Costa Rica rifts, indicate that a greater degree of melting prevailed along much of the Galapagos Spreading Center than anywhere along the East Pacific Rise...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to the rainfall variability over eastern central, and southern Africa during the austral spring-summer are examined. The variability of African rainfall is statistically related to both oceans, but the variability in the two oceans is also related. To separate {{the effects of the}} Indian and <b>Pacific</b> Oceans, a <b>suite</b> of numerical model simulations is presented: GOGA, the atmosphere is forced by observed SSTs globally; IOGA, the atmosphere is forced by observed SSTs only in the Indian Ocean basin; and POGA, the atmosphere is forced by observed SSTs only in the tropical Pacific basin. While the SST variability of the tropical Pacific exerts some influence over the African region, it is the atmospheric response to the Indian Ocean variability that is essential for simulating the correct rainfall response over eastern, central, and southern Africa. Analyses of the dynamical response(s) seen in the numerical experiments and in the observations indicate that the Pacific and Indian Oceans have a competing influence over the Indian Ocean/African region. This competition is related to the influence of the two oceans on the Walker circulation and the consequences of that variability on low-level fluxes of moisture over central and southern Africa. Finally, given the high correlation found between SST variability in the Indian and Pacific Oceans with the Pacific leading by ∼ 3 months, we speculate on an approach to long-lead dynamical climate prediction over central-east and southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{recognized}} ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) makes re-evaluation of {{the contribution}} to ammonia oxidization by both AOA and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) necessary and meaningful. The growing population and increasing anthropogenic activities around coastlines have affected wetland and coastal marine ecosystems through discharging polluted water containing {{large amounts of}} reactive inorganic nitrogen. The objectives {{of this study were}} to detect the phylogenetic diversity and abundance of ammonia oxidizers including AOA and AOB on different scales and to elucidate the distribution patterns along an anthropogenic pollution gradient from the coastal wetland of the Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong to the South China Sea (SCS). Generally, besides lineages shared by similar environments, various endemic lineages were also observed in the polluted mangrove sediments of Hong Kong, and in the coastal, and deep-sea surface and subsurface sediments from the SCS indicating their geographical distance should be responsible for these phylogenetic distinctions. The community structures of AOA and AOB observed were proposed to be associated with environmental parameters including metals and total phosphorus (TP) separately in the sediments while their abundance was correlated with the pH value and temperature. On the other hand, along a profile of surface sediments with stable salinity from the coastal margin to the slope in the SCS, a clear community structure transition was detected for both AOA and AOB, showing major differences in each of their responses. Although the abundance of AOA was lower than that of AOB in the subsurface sediment samples from the SCS, the statistical support for relationships between AOA and nitrite concentration shed new light on the active contributor to the subsurface nitrogen cycle in the oxygen minimum zone from the deep-sea sediments. On a large scale, along the anthropogenic pollution gradient from the Pearl River Delta to the coastal margin and then the SCS, the dominant genus transition from Nitrosomonas to Nitrosospira was detected in response to the salinity and anthropogenic influences. Among a wide spectrum of environmental conditions in the western <b>Pacific,</b> a <b>suite</b> of statistical analyses clearly delineated the shallow and deep-sea sediments clusters suggesting that the depth and other contributing environmental factors involved shape the current distribution pattern of AOA. On a global scale, our understanding about the systematics and evolution of AOA was advanced through phylogenetic analyses. Salinity, lifestyle and temperature were proposed to be responsible for the global distribution patterns of AOA. On the basis of studies in the anthropogenic influence areas, the methods to detect specific responses of ammonia oxidizers to known anthropogenic pollution were concluded. Highlights of this study advance not only our understandings about phylogenetic diversity of ammonia oxidizers and the driving forces shaping their community structure and distribution patterns, but also a revised comprehensive view about them on the larger scale. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Eolian dust is a {{significant}} source of iron and other nutrients that are essential for the health of marine ecosystems and potentially a controlling factor of the high nutrient-low chlorophyll status of the Subarctic North Pacific. We map the spatial distribution of dust input using three different geochemical tracers of eolian dust, 4 He, 232 Th and rare earth elements, in combination with grain size distribution data, from a set of core-top sediments covering the entire Subarctic North <b>Pacific.</b> Using the <b>suite</b> of geochemical proxies to fingerprint different lithogenic components, we deconvolve eolian dust input from other lithogenic inputs such as volcanic ash, ice-rafted debris, riverine and hemipelagic input. While the open ocean sites far away from the volcanic arcs are dominantly composed of pure eolian dust, lithogenic components other than eolian dust play a more crucial role along the arcs. In sites dominated by dust, eolian dust input appears to be characterized by a nearly uniform grain size mode at ~ 4 µm. Applying the 230 Th-normalization technique, our proxies yield a consistent pattern of uniform dust fluxes of 1 - 2 g/m** 2 /yr across the Subarctic North Pacific. Elevated eolian dust fluxes of 2 - 4 g/m** 2 /yr characterize the westernmost region off Japan and the southern Kurile Islands south of 45 ° N and west of 165 ° E along the main pathway of the westerly winds. The core-top based dust flux reconstruction is consistent with recent estimates based on dissolved thorium isotope concentrations in seawater from the Subarctic North Pacific. The dust flux pattern compares well with state-of-the-art dust model predictions in the western and central Subarctic North Pacific, but we find that dust fluxes are higher than modeled fluxes by 0. 5 - 1 g/m** 2 /yr in the northwest, northeast and eastern Subarctic North Pacific. Our results provide an important benchmark for biogeochemical models and a robust approach for downcore studies testing dust-induced iron fertilization of past changes in biological productivity in the Subarctic North Pacific...|$|R
