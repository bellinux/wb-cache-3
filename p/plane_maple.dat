25|$|Kashmir's {{economy is}} centred around agriculture. Traditionally the staple crop {{of the valley}} was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its {{temperate}} climate, {{it is suited for}} crops like asparagus, artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, peaches, and cherries. The chief trees are deodar, firs and pines, chenar or <b>plane,</b> <b>maple,</b> birch and walnut, apple, cherry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first flight}} by a Canadian from North America to England {{embarked}} 9 Oct 1930, in the <b>plane</b> <b>Maple</b> Leaf (aka, Columbia), piloted by Capt. J. Erroll Boyd (1891-1960) and was navigated by the American, Lieut. Harry Connor. This flight was also notable for transporting mail bearing a surcharged stamp as a commemorative overprint. The aviators borrowed a Webley & Scott flare pistol to carry during {{the flight from}} Edward Langdon Oke, a former Sergeant with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in WW1. The aviators had the gun engraved to mark the historic flight and it resides in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum. Amelia Earhart took flight from Harbour Grace on May 20, 1932, {{to become the first}} woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. The early transatlantic flights from the Harbour Grace airfield were designated Events of National Historic Significance (Canada).|$|E
50|$|Webley & Scott {{produced}} {{a number of}} single-shot, break open signal flare gun devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. The most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942. Perhaps the most famous example of a No.1 Mk 1 Flare Pistol is in the collection at the Conception Bay Museum, Harbour Grace, NL. The gun was lent by Edward Langdon Oke, IV, a veteran of WW1 and the then editor of the Harbor Grace Standard newspaper, to the first Canadian to make a transatlantic flight, Capt. J. Errol Boyd (1891-1960). Boyd took off 9 Oct 1930 from the Harbour Grace airstrip in the <b>plane</b> <b>Maple</b> Leaf (aka, Columbia), navigated by Lieut. Harry Connor, and landed 10 Oct in Tresco, Scilly Isles, England. The gun was engraved to mark the historic flight and is also tatted with the owner’s initials. The company logo {{is that of a}} bird wing with the tips angling left and W+S underneath and the gun is stamped 7648.|$|E
50|$|In Rimini {{there are}} about 42,000 public trees, {{belonging}} to 190 different species, predominantly linden, <b>planes,</b> <b>maples,</b> poplars, pines and oaks. 23 of these are old trees, protected as “monumental trees” for their age and their naturalistic value, such as the plane of piazza Malatesta, the downy oak of Giovanni Paolo II Park, the cypresses of Sant’Agostino, the elm of Viale Vespucci and the linden trees of San Fortunato.|$|R
50|$|In the park, {{there are}} a variety of species of trees and shrubs, both {{deciduous}} and coniferous. There are 43 species of trees and 21 species of shrubs, but the park is dominated by alder and black poplar as well as oak, <b>maple,</b> <b>plane</b> and black walnut. In the central part of the park there is a small pond.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to development by Germania, between 1905 and 1908, architect and builder Thomas Benton Ackerson’s eponymous T.B. Ackerson Company, simultaneously built and sold forty-two detached homes along Westminster Road in West Midwood for $10,000 each. Design {{and construction of}} these houses conformed to Ackerson’s “village in the city” vision and houses were graced with columns and fine details. Similarly, Germania advertised the neighborhood as “country living in the city.” To maintain it’s suburban aesthetic, utilities and train tracks were kept underground and streets were lined with trees, mainly London <b>Planes</b> and <b>maples.</b> Further keeping with the park-like ambiance, the original property deeds forbade construction of front yard fences.|$|R
50|$|The Forest Recreation Ground {{supports}} {{many important}} habitats and species. Mature trees include turkey oak, English elm, English oak, sessile oak, rowan, silver birch, common lime and horse chestnut. Additionally, {{there have been}} more recent plantings of London <b>plane,</b> beech, various <b>maples</b> and silver lime. Perennials include autumn crocus, spring crocus, bluebell, ramsons, primrose, wild privet, hazel and guelder rose.|$|R

It is prominently featured on signs and buildings in public parks across the city. The London plane tree is on the NYC Parks Department's list of restricted use species for street tree planting because it constitutes more than 10% of all street trees.|$|R

It is prominently featured on signs and buildings in public parks across the city. The tree is on the NYC Parks Department's list of restricted use species for street tree planting because it constitutes more than 10% of all street trees.|$|R
50|$|Ware taught botany, ecology, {{dendrology}} {{and conservation}} at universities in Oklahoma and Louisiana, {{before joining the}} Morton Arboretum in 1968 as Dendrologist, becoming Research Director ten years later, a post he held {{until his retirement in}} 1995. During his career at the Morton he raised hybrid elms, <b>maples,</b> <b>planes,</b> poplars and mulberries. He also traveled extensively, making a total of five expeditions to China, and three to the former Soviet Union. Ware remained a Research Associate of the Morton Arboretum until 2009.|$|R
50|$|From the dendrological {{point of}} view you can find {{more than one hundred}} species of trees in the park, and entirely {{domestic}} or domesticated species only. A number of ancient oaks, beeches, limes, horse chestnuts, <b>plane</b> trees, <b>maples</b> and alders grow there. The most important of them is the so-called Goethe's oak (today already only a torso), the age of which is estimated at 1,000 years, which ranks it among the oldest trees in the Czech Republic. Deeper in the park we find Pan's-Temple, the Obelisk, the Vantage Pavilion, Goethe's Pavilion, a memorial plaque with the engraved names of important people who have visited the park, a hermitage, a grotto with a sarcophagus and other interesting objects. The so-called French garden, situated behind {{the eastern part of the}} Chateau, is also of note. Its parterre is solved with a pond and grassy areas, which are embellished with large yew-trees and smaller box-trees.|$|R
40|$|Azadirachtins {{are natural}} triterpenoid {{compounds}} derived from Neem tree extracts with potential {{for use as}} systemic insecticides against invasive wood-boring insect pests. In this work, a sensitive and selective analytical method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of azadirachtin A and azadirachtin B (3 -tigloylazadirachtol) in foliage and twigs of various tree species. Samples were mixed with C 18 and primary-secondary amine (PSA), and extracted with acetonitrile. Then, an aliquot of the raw extract was 10 -fold diluted with water and directly analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was validated in foliage and twig matrices of four different tree species (London <b>Plane</b> Tree, Red/Freemani <b>Maple,</b> Norway Maple and Sugar Maple) that are known hosts of the exotic invasive insect pest – Asian Longhorn Beetle (ALB). Analytical results for replicate (N = 5) samples, fortified at 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 mg kg, showed good recoveries (86 – 119 %) and precision (< 20 % RSD). The methodology was successfully applied {{to the analysis of}} 200 samples taken from a field experiment designed to investigate uptake, translocation and expression of azadirachtins in representative high-value urban trees followed by stem injection with TreeAzinTM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Archaeobotanical results {{based on}} {{a limited number of}} samples from three aeeramie sites dating from 9800 to 7800 B. P., which are under {{excavation}} i the val-ley of the Middle Euphrates, are discussed. The finds are presented simply by presence, and are compared to the contemporary vegetation and finds from similar sites. Carbonised plant remains recovered by flotation from levels dated to between 9800 and 9200 B. P. (Dja'de and Jerf al Ahmar) indicate that wild cereals (einkorn wheat, rye and barley) and pulses (lentils, pea and bitter vetch) were exploited. Other plants such as wild grasses, Pistacia, wild almond and oak, suggest hat the local vegetation provided a rich diversity of resources. A study of possible weed taxa is being carried out in order to see whether this assemblage could be used to identify the cultivation of morphologically wild cereals for this pe-riod. Ninth millennium B. P. levels at Halula see the ap-pearance of domestic rops such as emmer, naked wheat and barley, but wild-type cereals persist. The cultivars appear to have been introduced from elsewhere and later ninth millennium B. P. species include olive and flax. Ash, vine, <b>maple,</b> <b>plane,</b> alder and elm from the gallery forest, wild rye, wild einkorn, deciduous oak, wild al-mond, Pistacia, and Pyrus, from the hinterland, indicate cooler conditions...|$|R
