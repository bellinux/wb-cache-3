2500|$|The {{first known}} {{cultivation}} of opium poppies was in Mesopotamia, approximately 3400 BCE, by Sumerians, {{who called the}} plant hul gil, the [...] "joy plant". Tablets found at Nippur, a Sumerian spiritual center south of Baghdad, described the collection of <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> {{in the morning and}} its use in production of opium. Cultivation continued in the Middle East by the Assyrians, who also collected <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> in the morning after scoring the pods with an iron scoop; they called the juice aratpa-pal, possibly the root of Papaver. Opium production continued under the Babylonians and Egyptians.|$|E
60|$|Then Sonny did {{not count}} {{with her as}} much as he did!--was Barton's exultant conclusion. But he remembered her in Sonny's arms under the monkey-pods and {{determined}} on further cruelty. Besides, it was the lingering opium in him that suggested this cruelty. Since he had undertaken this acid test, urged the <b>poppy</b> <b>juice,</b> then let it be a real acid test.|$|E

5000|$|Some of the {{illnesses}} treated were headaches, colds, coughing, melancholy {{and diseases}} of the eye, ear, and stomach. For example, he prescribed for a feverish headache: [...] " [...] 2 parts of duhn (oily extract) of rose, to be mixed with 1 part of vinegar, in which a piece of linen cloth is dipped and compressed on the forehead". He recommended as a laxative, [...] " [...] 7 drams of dried violet flowers with 20 pears, macerated and well mixed, then strained. Add to this filtrate, 20 drams of sugar for a drink. In cases of melancholy, he invariably recommended prescriptions, which included either <b>poppies</b> or its <b>juice</b> (opium), Cuscuta epithymum (clover dodder) or both. For an eye-remedy, he advised myrrh, saffron, and frankincense, 2 drams each, to be mixed with 1 dram of yellow arsenic formed into tablets. Each tablet was to be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of coriander water and used as eye drops.|$|R
5000|$|At least 17 finds of Papaver somniferum from Neolithic {{settlements}} {{have been}} reported throughout Switzerland, Germany, and Spain, including the placement {{of large numbers of}} poppy seed capsules at a burial site (the Cueva de los Murciélagos, or [...] "Bat Cave", in Spain), which have been carbon-14 dated to 4200 BCE. Numerous finds of P. somniferum or P. setigerum from Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have also been reported.The first known cultivation of opium poppies was in Mesopotamia, approximately 3400 BCE, by Sumerians, who called the plant hul gil, the [...] "joy plant".

50|$|Macedonia's limited forest growth also {{includes}} Macedonian Oaks, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, {{and the common}} ash. Near the rich pastures on Šar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia—the poppy. The quality of thick <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese opium contains eight such units and {{is considered to be}} of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units {{and is one of the}} best quality opiums in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "narcotic" [...] is {{believed}} to have been coined by the Greek physician Galen to refer to agents that numb or deaden, causing loss of feeling or paralysis. It is based on the Greek word ναρκωσις (narcosis), the term used by Hippocrates for the process of numbing or the numbed state. Galen listed mandrake root, altercus (eclata), seeds, and <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> (opium) as the chief examples. It originally referred to any substance that relieved pain, dulled the senses, or induced sleep. Now, the term is used in a number of ways. Some people define narcotics as substances that bind at opioid receptors (cellular membrane proteins activated by substances like heroin or morphine) while others refer to any illicit substance as a narcotic. From a U.S. legal perspective, narcotics refer to opium, opium derivatives, and their semi-synthetic substitutes, though in U.S. law, due to its numbing properties, cocaine is also considered a narcotic.|$|E
5000|$|The ancient Greeks portrayed Hypnos, Nyx and Thanatos, {{the gods}} of sleep, night and death, with {{the symbol of the}} poppy. The {{earliest}} written record appeared in the eighth century BC. Early Greek accounts seem to indicate the plant was used for euthanasia; on some Greek islands, women used it in old age to shorten the time left until natural death. Hippocrates (460-377 BC) {{was one of the first}} to emphasize the medicinal uses of the poppy and outline several methods of preparation. He described <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> as narcotic, hypnotic, and cathartic. He also recognized the plant’s uses as food, particularly the seeds. By the first century AD, Dioskorides wrote down the first poppy taxonomy. He distinguished between several different kinds, the first of which was the [...] "cultivated" [...] or [...] "garden" [...] poppies. He further distinguished two types within this category, ones with black and others with white seeds. Both had elongated capsules and the black-seeded variety was involuted. Historians speculate this variety was Papaver somniferum. Other species were in use, as well. Dioskorides named the “flowering” poppy as a type with strong hypnotic properties. This is believed to be Papaver hybridum. Finally, the “wild” poppy he described is believed to be Papaver orientale. Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, later mentioned an “intermediate” type between the wild and cultivated poppy, likely Papaver rhoeas. He wrote about medical applications of the plant; the leaves and capsules were boiled in water to create juice, pressed and rubbed to create tablets, and the dried latex was used to form opium. These products were used in much the same way they are in many cultures today, to promote sleep and to relieve indigestion and respiratory problems.|$|E
40|$|Poppies {{were widely}} used during antiquity {{as a source}} of food, therapeutics, and poisons. It is likely that the {{alimentary}} value of poppy seeds was known in the Neolithic age, and {{there is some evidence that}} the neuropsychopharmacological effects of <b>poppy</b> <b>juice</b> were exploited during the Minoan civilization in the eastern Mediterranean basin. The Minoan civilization dates the attribution to poppies of symbolic meanings connected with rites of agricultural fertility. The persistence throughout antiquity of this symbolism is testified by literary and iconographic evidence of the attribution of poppies to goddesses of fertility, such as Demeter, Aphrodite, and Ceres...|$|E
