5000|$|First {{introduced}} in September 2002, ZipZaps were an instant success {{and one of}} the most popular gifts of the holiday season in North America, with RadioShack stores often selling out of the starter kits. They were referred to as [...] "micro R/C" [...] due to their diminutive size. At around 1:64 scale, ZipZaps were only slightly larger than popular die-cast toy cars such as Hot Wheels and Matchbox.ZipZaps were unique among toy-style micro R/C vehicles in that they could be customized much like large R/C models. Each partially assembled ZipZaps kit included a pre-assembled chassis with built-in nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries on which the gears, tires and hubcaps could be changed for better appearance and performance. Five motors and three gear ratios were offered, ranging from the 16,000 rpm stock unit to the high-speed 34,000 rpm [...] "NX" [...] (named after a popular brand of nitrous oxide). Gear ratios were 12:1 [...] "stock", 9.86:1 [...] "performance" [...] and 8.25:1 [...] "turbo". Tracking was adjusted via a wheel alignment lever underneath the vehicles themselves. The vehicle's on-board battery was charged by snapping the entire car onto the top of the transmitter. Full charge was accomplished in about 40 to 60 seconds with run times averaging five minutes. Neither steering nor throttle was proportional, with both functions either full on or full off. The SE series added semi-proportional, two-speed throttle and fully <b>proportional</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering</b> with steering trim adjustable at the transmitter, as with a full-sized R/C.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The researches in this thesis focus on the development of computer controlled electrohydraulic steering control system for off-road vehicle automatic guidance. The system developed in this research includes steering control computer, data acquisition pad, PWM driver, electrohydraulic <b>proportional</b> valve, hydraulic <b>steering</b> cylinder and vehicle steer angle sensor. Electrohydraulic proportional valve in the system has inherent dead-band and saturation. Dead-band influences steering accuracy very much. To remove it, a nonlinear compensation algorithm is developed and implemented in this research. The developed electrohydraulic steering control system is installed on a John Deere 8200 tractor. It receives steering command signal from a machine vision system. It also can receive steering command signal (sine wave, triangle wave and step signal) generated by computer. The test road conditions include paved cement road and farm field. The test results indicated that the developed electrohydraulic steering control system can implement steering control command successfully...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{platform for the}} demonstration and testing of autonomous lane keeping and pedestrian avoidance {{through the use of}} a test vehicle equipped with an Xbox Kinect 2. 0 for vision-?based detection. The test vehicle is a 1 / 5 th-?scale electric remote control car customized for autonomous steering and drive motor control {{through the use of a}}n Arduino Mega 2560. A <b>proportional</b> derivative (PD) <b>steering</b> controller running on the Arduino receives position commands from a laptop via serial communication. These commands are generated on the laptop based on an analysis of images captured from the Kinect. On the laptop, the program, Processing, is used to identify the colored boundaries of the path the vehicle is traveling, calculate the position of the center of that path, find the position error of the test vehicle relative to the center of the path, and then send that error to the Arduino to calculate a corrective steering command. In addition to lane keeping, the test vehicle is capable of pedestrian detection and avoidance through the use of body tracking libraries written for the Kinect in Processing. Once a human body is detected and tracked, the position of each foot is checked relative to the boundaries of the path. If the pedestrian is located inside of the path boundaries, then the test vehicle stops and waits for the person to leave the path. The PD controller for the steering servo was tuned empirically, and after tuning, the vehicle was consistently able to autonomously navigate a curved path of variable width with an error of less than 75 pixels (5 cm). The pedestrian-?avoidance algorithm worked successfully in conjunction with the lane keeping algorithm. However, the body tracking libraries for the Kinect demonstrated a 40 % failure rate for body detection when the test vehicle and the Kinect were in motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Many {{existing}} {{path following}} approaches {{begin with a}} proposed solution and are then implemented on specialised hardware, which makes comparing approaches difficult. Many of these approaches also require a mathematical model of the robot or the track, a small change in {{the configuration of the}} robot or the track renders the entire solution inaccurate until the model is updated. This paper presents a method for autonomous path following using visual servoing. It differs from more conventional approaches by being designed to control an existing nonholonomic robot platform, by being designed to function on minimal processing hardware, and by being independent of both the robot platform and the dynamics of the track. The approach presented in this paper can be applied, with minimal modifications, to any autonomous robot platform with a vision sensor. Basic information about the path is extracted from each image, namely the lateral offset and local gradient of the track, and is used in a <b>proportional</b> <b>steering</b> controller. Index Terms—Visual servoing, path following, autonomous robots. I...|$|E
