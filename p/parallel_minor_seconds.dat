5000|$|In J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier {{and some}} other earlier sets, major keys were {{followed}} by their <b>parallel</b> <b>minor</b> keys. The Bach order was adopted by Arensky, Glière, York Bowen and others.|$|R
25|$|Secundal chords can be {{decomposed}} into {{a series}} of (major or <b>minor)</b> <b>seconds.</b> For example, the chord C–D–E is a series of seconds, containing a major second (C–D) and a <b>minor</b> <b>second</b> (D–E).|$|R
50|$|Its {{relative}} minor is A minor (or enharmonically G <b>minor),</b> and its <b>parallel</b> <b>minor</b> is C minor, usually {{replaced by}} B minor, since C minor's three double-flats make it generally impractical to use.|$|R
2500|$|In unusual situations, the <b>minor</b> <b>second</b> {{can add a}} {{great deal}} of {{character}} to the music. For instance, Frédéric Chopin's Étude Op. 25, No. 5 opens with a melody accompanied by a line that plays fleeting <b>minor</b> <b>seconds.</b> These are used to humorous and whimsical effect, which contrasts with its more lyrical middle section. This eccentric dissonance has earned the piece its nickname: the [...] "wrong note" [...] étude. This kind of usage of the <b>minor</b> <b>second</b> appears in many other works of the Romantic period, such as Modest Mussorgsky's Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks. More recently, the music to the movie Jaws exemplifies the <b>minor</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
50|$|A major scale can be {{transformed}} to its <b>parallel</b> <b>minor</b> by flattening the third, sixth, and seventh scale degrees, and a minor scale can {{be transformed}} to its parallel major by sharpening those same scale degrees.|$|R
50|$|The {{notes of}} the scale (in the key of C) are C, Db, F, G and Ab. The {{intervals}} in the scale are a <b>minor</b> <b>second,</b> a major third, a major <b>second,</b> a <b>minor</b> <b>second</b> and a major third.|$|R

5000|$|Its {{relative}} minor is D minor, usually {{replaced by}} C minor (see reason below) and its <b>parallel</b> <b>minor</b> is F minor, usually replaced by E minor, since F minor's four double-flats make it generally impractical to use.|$|R

2500|$|A chord {{containing}} semitones, whether {{appearing as}} <b>Minor</b> <b>seconds</b> or Major sevenths, is called hemitonic; one without semitones is anhemitonic. [...] Harmonic semitones {{are an important}} part of Major seventh chords, giving their sound a characteristic high tension, and making the harmonic semitone likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord. [...] A chord containing Major sevenths but no <b>Minor</b> <b>seconds</b> is much less harsh in sound than one containing <b>Minor</b> <b>seconds</b> as well.|$|R
