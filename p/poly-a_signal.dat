Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template. The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.|$|E
50|$|The {{allosteric}} model {{suggests that}} termination occurs {{due to the}} structural change of the RNA polymerase unit after binding to or losing some of its associated proteins, making it detach from the DNA strand after the signal. This would occur after the RNA pol II unit has transcribed the <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> sequence, which acts as a terminator signal.|$|E
50|$|After the mRNA is {{completed}} and cleaved {{off at the}} <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> sequence, the left-over (residual) RNA strand remains bound to the DNA template and the RNA polymerase II unit, continuing to be transcribed. After this cleavage, a so-called exonuclease binds to the residual RNA strand and removes the freshly transcribed nucleotides {{one at a time}} (also called 'degrading' the RNA), moving towards the bound RNA polymerase II. This exonuclease is XRN2 (5'-3' Exoribonuclease 2) in humans. This model proposes that XRN2 proceeds to degrade the uncapped residual RNA from 5’ to 3’ until it reaches the RNA pol II unit. This causes the exonuclease to 'push off' the RNA pol II unit as it moves past it, terminating the transcription while also cleaning up the residual RNA strand.|$|E
50|$|RNA {{polymerase}} {{is normally}} capable of transcribing DNA into single-stranded mRNA efficiently. However, upon transcribing over the <b>poly-A</b> <b>signals</b> on the DNA template, a conformational shift is induced in the RNA polymerase from the proposed loss of associated proteins from its carboxyl terminal domain. This change of conformation reduces RNA polymerase's processivity making the enzyme {{more prone to}} dissociating from its DNA-RNA substrate. In this case, termination is not completed by degradation of mRNA but instead is mediated by limiting the elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase and thus increasing {{the likelihood that the}} polymerase will dissociate and end its current cycle of transcription.|$|R

However, other data types (e.g. protein alignments, ab initio prediction programs, trans-splice leader sites, <b>poly-A</b> <b>signals</b> and addition sites, SAGE and TEC-RED transcript tags, mass-spectroscopic peptides, and conserved protein domains) are useful in refining the structures, especially where expression is low and so transcripts are not sufficiently available.

40|$|Transcriptional regulation, {{a primary}} {{mechanism}} for controlling {{the development of}} multicellular organisms, is carried out by transcription factors (TFs) that recognize and bind to their cognate binding sites. In Caenorhabditis elegans, our knowledge of which genes are regulated by which TFs, through binding to specific sites, is still very limited. To expand our knowledge about the C. elegans regulatory network, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the C. elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Caenorhabditis remanei genomes to identify regulatory elements that are conserved in all genomes. Our analysis identified 4959 elements that are significantly conserved across the genomes and that each occur multiple times within each genome, both hallmarks of functional regulatory sites. Our motifs show significant matches to known core promoter elements, TF binding sites, splice sites, and <b>poly-A</b> <b>signals</b> {{as well as many}} putative regulatory sites. Many of the motifs are significantly correlated with various types of experimental data, including gene expression patterns, tissue-specific expression patterns, and binding site location analysis as well as enrichment in specific functional classes of genes. Many can also be significantly associated with specific TFs. Combinations of motif occurrences allow us to predict the location of cis-regulatory modules and we show that many of them significantly overlap experimentally determined enhancers. We provide access to the predicted binding sites, their associated motifs, and the predicted cis-regulatory modules across the whole genome through a web-accessible database and as tracks for genome browsers...|$|R
50|$|In {{eukaryotic}} transcription of mRNAs, terminator {{signals are}} recognized by protein {{factors that are}} associated with the RNA polymerase II and which trigger the termination process. Once the poly-A signals are transcribed into the mRNA, the proteins cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) transfer from the carboxyl terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to the <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal.</b> These two factors then recruit other proteins to the site to cleave the transcript, freeing the mRNA from the transcription complex, and add a string of about 200 A-repeats to the 3' end of the mRNA in a process known as polyadenylation. During these processing steps, the RNA polymerase continues to transcribe for several hundred to a few thousand bases and eventually dissociates from the DNA and downstream transcript through an unclear mechanism; there are two basic models for this event known as the torpedo and allosteric models.|$|E

Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template. The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II. In the process of terminating transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex. Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last. [...] The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex. [...] The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' exonuclease degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.|$|E

Employing mRNA-sequencing data from the Geuvadis Project and genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project we show that the computational analysis of DNA sequences around splice sites and <b>poly-A</b> <b>signals</b> is able to explain several observations in the phenotype data. In contrast to widespread assessments of statistically significant associations between DNA polymorphisms and quantitative traits, we developed a computational tool to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms by which genetic markers drive variation in RNA-processing, cataloguing and classifying alleles that change the affinity of core RNA elements to their recognizing factors. The in silico models we employ further suggest RNA editing can moonlight as a splicing-modulator, albeit less frequently than genomic sequence diversity. Beyond existing annotations, we demonstrate that the ultra-high resolution of RNA-Seq combined from 462 individuals also provides evidence for thousands of bona fide novel elements of RNA processing—alternative splice sites, introns, and cleavage sites—which are often rare and lowly expressed but in other characteristics similar to their annotated counterparts.

SCPEPCDI is ca. 6800 bp long, with 10 exons. Positions of the 9 introns are identical to those in a maize C- 4 PEPC gene (Hudspeth & Grula 1989) and M. crystallinum CAM and housekeeping PEPC genes (Cushman et al 1989). The entire gene sequence from - 1561 to ca. 300 bp downstream of the putative <b>poly-A</b> addition <b>signal</b> is reported.

We show here that when cellular cDNA were cloned into VSV which retained their own <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal,</b> viral species emerged in culture which had deleted the cellular <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> and also contained a truncated {{form of the}} protein coding sequence. Typically, the truncation occurred such that a Tyrosine-encoding codon was converted into a STOP codon.

Truncated cDNA expressed from VSV were significantly more effective than full length cDNA in treating established tumors. Moreover, tumor therapy with truncated cDNA was completely abolished by depletion of CD 4 + T cells, whereas therapy with full length cDNA was CD 8 + T cell dependent. These data show that the type/potency of antitumor immune responses against self-tumor-associated proteins can be manipulated in vivo through the nature of the self protein (full length or truncated). Therefore, in addition to generation of neoantigens through sequence mutation, immunological tolerance against self-tumor-associated proteins can be broken through manipulation of protein integrity, allowing for rational design of better self-immunogens for cancer immunotherapy...|$|E

Preliminary observations revealed a tendency for greater amounts of potentially non protein-coding alternative transcripts in human genes than in orthologous genes from other organisms. However, many of these isoforms did not appear in recently published alternative splicing databases on account of constraints imposed in the selection of transcripts. This prompted us to develop a less constrained database with the aim of contributing to the identification of the full repertoire of splice variants in the transcriptome of different organisms. Given that mechanisms of control of gene expression involving non-protein-coding splice variants have been described in a variety of genes, this information may be crucial to deciphering more intricate layers of gene regulation in complex organisms brought about by alternative splicing. Description: An algorithm was developed to cluster mRNA and EST BLAT alignments to annotated gene regions. Consensus splice sites were the main requirement imposed on the selection of transcripts. The method was applied to thirteen model organisms. The alternative splicing information generated has been incorporated into a database with clear graphical displays representing the splicing patterns and is available from the ExonMine website ([URL] It incorporates information on constitutive exons, <b>poly-A</b> <b>signals,</b> open reading frames and translation, expression specificity of any exon or splicing pattern relative to biological source of mRNA/EST, alternative splicing events and respective exon and junction sequences for microarray probe design. The ExonMine interface also provides several tools to support laboratory validation of splicing patterns. Conclusions: ExonMine detects a higher percentage of spliced genes and isoforms than currently available alternative splicing databases. The analysis reveals a marked increase, in complex organisms, of splice variants with either retained introns or incorporating novel exons with no apparent protein-coding potential. About 18 % of unannotated exons detected in ExonMine were found expressed in primary human cells using tiling arrays. Validation of some of these results for the U 2 AF family of splicing factors was successfully performed in collaboration with members of the lab revealing primate specific transcripts and an alternatively spliced transcript carrying a microRNA. The database was also successfully used for genome wide analysis of sequence elements involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and for custom alternative splicing microarray design. Matching of ExonMine data to a commercial exon microarray platform covering the majority of human exons was also performed and will assist in large-scale analysis of alternative splicing data. The algorithm developed also provides for easy updatability, taking only 48 hours to generate data for the whole human genome and far less time for less complex organisms.

Here, we generated ribosome-bound nascent polypeptide complexes (RNCs) with different polyalanine (<b>poly-A)</b> inserts or <b>signal</b> peptides from membrane/secretory proteins to {{explore the influence of}} nascent chain compaction in the Escherichia coli ribosome tunnel on chaperone recruitment. By employing time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and immunoblotting, we were able to show that the poly-A inserts embedded in the passage tunnel can form a compacted structure (presumably helix) and reduce the recruitment of Trigger Factor (TF) when the helical motif is located in the region near the tunnel exit. Similar experiments on nascent chains containing signal sequences that may form compacted structural motifs within the ribosome tunnel and lure the signal recognition particle (SRP) to the ribosome, provided additional evidence that short, compacted nascent chains interfere with TF binding. These findings shed light on the possible controlling mechanism of nascent chains within the tunnel that leads to chaperone recruitment, as well as the function of L 23, the ribosomal protein that serves as docking sites for both TF and SRP, in cotranslational protein targeting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{relative}} {{preference of}} nucleosomes to form on individual DNA sequences {{plays a major}} role in genome packaging. A wide variety of DNA sequence features are believed to influence nucleosome formation, including periodic dinucleotide <b>signals,</b> <b>poly-A</b> stretches and other short motifs, and sequence properties that influence DNA structure, including base content. It was recently shown by Kaplan et al. that a probabilistic model using composition of all 5 -mers within a nucleosome-sized tiling window accurately predicts intrinsic nucleosome occupancy across an entire genome in vitro. However, the model is complicated, and it is not clear which specific DNA sequence properties are most important for intrinsic nucleosome-forming preferences. Results We find that a simple linear combination of only 14 simple DNA sequence attributes (G+C content, two transformations of dinucleotide composition, and the frequency of eleven 4 -bp sequences) explains nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo in a manner comparable to the Kaplan model. G+C content and frequency of AAAA are the most important features. G+C content is dominant, alone explaining ~ 50 % of the variation in nucleosome occupancy in vitro. Conclusions Our findings provide a dramatically simplified means to predict and understand intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. G+C content may dominate because it both reduces frequency of poly-A-like stretches and correlates with many other DNA structural characteristics. Since G+C content is enriched or depleted at many types of features in diverse eukaryotic genomes, our results suggest that variation in nucleotide composition may have a widespread and direct influence on chromatin structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{looked at}} a disease-associated macrosatellite array D 4 Z 4 and focused on {{epigenetic}} factors influencing its chromatin state outside of the disease-context. We used the HCT 116 cell line that contains the non-canonical polyadenylation (<b>poly-A)</b> <b>signal</b> required to stabilize somatic transcripts of the human double homeobox gene DUX 4, encoded from D 4 Z 4. In HCT 116, D 4 Z 4 is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin, characterized by DNA methylation and histone H 3 tri-methylation at lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 me 3), resulting in low basal levels of D 4 Z 4 -derived transcripts. However, a double knockout (DKO) of DNA methyltransferase genes, DNMT 1 and DNMT 3 B, but not either alone, results in significant loss of DNA and H 3 K 9 methylation. This is coupled with upregulation of transcript levels from the array, including DUX 4 isoforms (DUX 4 -fl) that are abnormally expressed in somatic muscle in the disease Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) along with DUX 4 protein, as indicated indirectly by upregulation of bondafide targets of DUX 4 in DKO but not HCT 116 cells. Results from treatment with a chemical inhibitor of histone methylation in HCT 116 suggest that {{in the absence of}} DNA hypomethylation, H 3 K 9 me 3 loss alone is sufficient to facilitate DUX 4 -fl transcription. Additionally, characterization of a cell line from a patient with Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies syndrome 1 (ICF 1) possessing a non-canonical <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> and DNA hypomethylation at D 4 Z 4 showed DUX 4 target gene upregulation in the patient when compared to controls in spite of retention of H 3 K 9 me 3. Taken together, these data suggest that both DNA methylation and H 3 K 9 me 3 are determinants of D 4 Z 4 silencing. Moreover, we show that in addition to testis, there is appreciable expression of spliced and polyadenylated D 4 Z 4 derived transcripts that contain the complete DUX 4 open reading frame (ORF) along with DUX 4 target gene expression in the thymus, suggesting that DUX 4 may provide normal function in this somatic tissue...|$|E

In the paternal mutant, the expression levels of Usp 29 were reduced to 14 - 18 % level of the wild-type littermates due to the <b>Poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> included in the knockin cassette.

In order to define a useful TSP for targeting in the context of melanoma gene therapy, four promoters, the cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2), alpha-chemokine SDF- 1 receptor (CXCR 4), epithelial glycoprotein 2 (EGP- 2), and survivin, were tested in both established melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma cells. We employed recombinant adenoviral vectors (reAds) each with a candidate TSP (the Cox- 2, CXCR 4, EGP- 2, or survivin), a reporter luciferase gene, and a <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal,</b> all of which were inserted into the E 1 -deleted region. A reAdGL 3 Bcytomegalovirus (CMV), containing the CMV promoter and luciferase gene, was used as a positive control to normalize the luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured in multiple tumor cell lines and two primary melanoma cell cultures after infection with reAds. Human epithelial melanocytes, HEM, were used as normal control. In contrast to three other promoters, the survivin promoter exhibited the highest activities within both melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma cells, but not in HEMs. Additionally, the survivin promoter exhibited very low activities in major mouse organs including the liver, in vivo. EGP- 2 is not active in melanoma; messenger RNA expressions were correlated to promoter activities both in melanoma cell lines and primary cell cultures. Thus, these data suggest that the survivin promoter achieved a 'tumor-on/liver-off' profile, and thus represents a potentially useful tumor-specific promoter with applications for transcriptional targeting of Ad vector-based cancer gene therapy or oncolysis to melanoma...|$|E

Based on the full length mRNA sequence (911 bps), it was possible to elucidate the coding sequence of MytiLec- 1, which displays an extended open reading frame (ORF) at the 5 ' end of the sequence, confirmed both at the mRNA and at the genomic DNA sequence level. While this extension could potentially produce a polypeptide significantly longer than previously reported, this has not been confirmed yet at the protein level. MytiLec- 1 was revealed to be encoded by a gene consisting of two exons and a single intron. The first exon comprised the 5 'UTR and the initial ATG codon and it was possible to detect a putative promoter region immediately ahead of the transcription start site in the MytiLec- 1 genomic locus. The remaining part of the MytiLec- 1 coding sequence (including the three sub-domains, the 3 'UTR and the <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal)</b> was included in the second exon. The bacteriostatic activity of MytiLec- 1 was determined by the agglutination of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which was reversed by the co-presence of α-galactoside.

By screening a larger fragment for mutations, the 5 bp deletion (g. - 757 _- 753 delCTTTC) was identified in a FHM patient. The deletion significantly increased the transcriptional activity, most likely due to the removal of half a turn of the DNA helix, changing the orientation of downstream binding sites for transcriptional factors.

Fecha de lectura 20 - 06 - 2007 Red {{blood cell}} protein 4. 1, 4. 1 R, {{is an extreme}} {{variation}} {{on the theme of}} isoform multiplicity and involvement of alternative pre-mRNA splicing events for the generation of 4. 1 R protein diversity has been widely explored. Two types of 4. 1 R isoforms varying in N-terminal extensions are originated by alternative splicing events involving exon 2 ’. This exon encompasses translation initiation site AUG 1 and hence 4. 1 R mRNAs containing exon 2 ’ regulate expression of longer (135 kDa) isoforms of 4. 1 R protein. By contrast, 4. 1 R mRNAs excluding exon 2 ’ allow expression of shorter (80 kDa) isoforms, the synthesis of which is initiated at the AUG 2 translation initiation site comprised in exon 4. The current study reports that 4. 1 R mRNAs containing exons 2 ’ and 4 regulate expression of both longer and shorter 4. 1 R isoforms. Analysis of in vitro expression of a set of 4. 1 R cDNAs containing exon 2 ’ showed an unexpected result: that two proteins 4. 1 R, longer (∼ 135 -kDa) and shorter (∼ 80 -kDa), were synthesized. Mutational studies indicated that the shorter protein 4. 1 R was not a proteolytic product of the longer one but a product synthesized from the downstream AUG 2 site. Results of further experiments showed that the sequence 5 ’-upstream of exon 4 was essential {{for the use of the}} AUG 2 as internal initiation site of translation. When this sequence was introduced in a bicistronic vector, it directed the synthesis of the second cistron even when a hairpin structure was added 5 ’- upstream of the first cistron and only one mRNA species was detected by Northern blot analysis. In vivo expression of this set of 4. 1 R cDNAs confirmed that shorter and longer 4. 1 R isoforms were generated but not when the 4. 1 R sequence was introduced in a promoterless vector. These results indicate that the 5 ’ region upstream of exon 4 contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element which directs the synthesis of 80 -kDa 4. 1 R isoforms from mRNAs containing exon 2 ’. These data show that generation of 4. 1 R isoforms is also regulated at the translational level. The current study identified a set of 4. 1 R cDNAs coding a new group of isoforms lacking the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) characteristic of all 4. 1 R proteins identified so far. An alternative <b>poly-A</b> <b>signal</b> present in the sequence between exons 17 and 18 of the EPB 41 gene and the inclusion of twenty seven nucleotides comprising a stop codon regulated the production of this set of 4. 1 R isoforms lacking the CTD. Generation of an antiserum that specifically recognized this set of isoforms as well as transfection experiments using the isolated 4. 1 R cDNAs have allowed to determine the localization of these isoforms within the cell. Together, our data implicate two mechanisms not previously described as involved in the regulation of 4. 1 R expression: internal translation and alternative polyadenilation with the inclusion of a premature stop codon.
