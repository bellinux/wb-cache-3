40|$|Regularly sampled {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) has been a mainstay of the power electronics community {{since the advent of}} digital controllers. In this form of PWM the modulating signal is sampled only at either the peaks and/or the troughs of the triangular carrier waveform, then held constant until the next sampling instant, which allows ample time for the calculation of switching instants. Unfortunately, it produces <b>phase</b> and <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> of the modulating signal that can be significant at low pulse numbers. In applications where the desired modulating signal is not known a priori, this phase delay can become a critical limitation. The analogue alternative to regular sampling is naturally sampled PWM, where the modulating signal is permitted to vary as a continuous waveform. This form of PWM does not apply any <b>phase</b> or <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> to the modulating signal. True natural sampling is, however, impossible to implement on the digital control platforms that are used in modern power electronics applications. In this paper, a type of hold circuit known as a First-Order Hold (FOH) circuit is used in conjunction with the technique known as resampled regular PWM to improve upon the limitations of regular sampling. It is found that this augmentation to the PWM strategy improves both the linearity and phase delay of the modulator as well as (for high pulse numbers) harmonic performance.

40|$|Inter-symbol {{interference}} (ISI) in {{a digital}} communications system can be a severe impediment to recovery of transmitted symbols at {{the receiving end of}} the channel. Reduction or elimination of ISI—equalization of the channel—is accomplished using a variety of techniques, most of which assume linear ISI. The equalization is blind in the absence of known training sequences sent by the transmitter to facilitate the setting of equalizer parameters at the receiver. Nonlinear channels compound the problem by disrupting the operation of blind equalizers designed for linear channels. The advantages and drawbacks of existing blind equalization algorithms applied to nonlinear channels are discussed in this dissertation. This leads to a novel structure which replaces a simple linear filter with a relatively simple serial combination of a linear filter and a nonlinear filter. Asymmetry is introduced as a design feature of symbol constellations. Asymmetric constellations can be used for blind estimation of nonlinear <b>phase</b> and <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortions</b> in nonlinear channels. For a linear channel, third-order statistics of asymmetric constellations allow blind identification of the channel taps, which in turn enables use of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation or zero-forcing, linear MMSE, or decision-feedback equalizers. ...|$|R

Also, in directed energy applications, the plenoptic sensor and its fast reconstruction algorithm can give instantaneous instructions to an adaptive optics (AO) system to create intelligent corrections in directing a beam through atmospheric turbulence. The hardware structure of the plenoptic sensor uses an objective lens and a microlens array (MLA) to form a mini “Keplerian” telescope array that shares the common objective lens. In principle, the objective lens helps to detect the phase gradient of the distorted laser beam and the microlens array (MLA) helps to retrieve the geometry of the distorted beam in various gradient segments.

40|$|Adaptive antennas {{with digital}} {{beamforming}} represent a promising technology for mitigation of radio interference and multipath effects in receivers of Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS, e. g. GPS, Galileo). Due to the mitigation of interfering signals in spatial domain, they allow for better performance {{in terms of}} signal to noise plus interference ratio (SNIR). However, the adaptive antenna techniques may also introduce deviation of the array phase centre from its nominal position, which results in erroneous pseudo-range and carrier-phase measurements of the GNSS array receiver. The deviation of the array phase centre manifests itself through some additional carrier phase shifts and signal group delays caused by the adaptive antenna to the received signals. In order to control such deviations and to produce the corresponding corrections, the magnitude and phase response of the adaptive array system described by a system transfer function must be known for the directions of arrival of the satellite signals. The aim of the paper is to explain the challenge and the need of stabilizing phase centres of adaptive GNSS antennas and to detail the novel development of suitable means for controlling the phase centres. The problem of correcting for the phase centre deviation is tightly related to the calibration problem of the antenna array hardware. Indeed, in both problems the <b>phase</b> and <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortions</b> of an ideal array response due to the transfer characteristics of the array antenna elements and RF front-ends should be determined. Therefore, {{the solution of the}} calibration problem can be also considered as the solution for correcting for the phase centre deviations. The focus of this paper is on practical aspects of the array calibration in GNSS adaptive antenna systems. After introducing the system transfer function of an adaptive antenna, a model for the error propagation from the domain of code- and carrier-based pseudo-range observations of a GNSS receiver into the positioning error domain will be shortly outlined. This model will be further used to show the effect of phase calibration errors and different radiation patterns of the array elements on the GNSS receiver performance defined in term of user positioning and timing errors. A practical implementation of the adaptive GNSS antenna system that includes a real-time calibration capability will be presented. The performance of the array calibration will be demonstrated by using the field test results for beamforming and direction-of-arrival estimation as well as positioning by using code and carrier measurements. ...|$|R

We compare these average-sample types with others: 2 -h average, Gaussian, and "brick-wall" low-frequency-pass. Hourly spot measurements provide a statistically unbiased representation of the amplitude range of geomagnetic-field variation, but as a representation of continuous field variation over time, they are significantly affected by aliasing, especially at high latitudes. The 1 -h, 2 -h, and Gaussian average-samples are affected by a combination of <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> and aliasing. Brick-wall values are not affected by either <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> or aliasing, but constructing them is, in an operational setting, relatively more difficult than it is for other average-sample types.
