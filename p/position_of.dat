5|$|Album {{sales were}} limited—by March 1999 only 35,000 copies had been sold. In 2001, Michael Giltz of The Advocate wrote that Wainwright's biggest sales boost {{came from the}} Gap {{advertisement}} rather than radio play. Despite low sales, Wainwright reached number 24 on Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and Rolling Stone named him 1998's Best New Artist. The January 19, 1999 CMJ New Music Report showed that Rufus Wainwright spent nine weeks on CMJ Radio 200 reaching a peak <b>position</b> <b>of</b> number 52, five weeks on CMJ Code Radio reaching a peak <b>position</b> <b>of</b> number 42, as well as nine weeks on CMJ Triple A reaching a peak <b>position</b> <b>of</b> number 9.|$|E
5|$|From 1855 to 1907, the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> first {{minister}} {{was known as}} Premier. After the colony was granted dominion status, the position became known as Prime Minister.

30|$|There are {{few studies}} on view-based robotic manipulation. Zhang et al. {{presented}} {{a method for}} <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> robots with eye-in-hand cameras [8] for grasping objects. In their study, assuming that coarse <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> a robot hand was completed, fine <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the hand with regard to a target object was achieved by view-based neuro-fuzzy control. Their method is for relative <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> only a robot with regard to a target, too.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a method}} of operating a robot in successive sampling intervals to perform a task, the robot having joints and joint actuators with actuator control loops, by decomposing the task into behavior forces, accelerations, velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> plural behaviors to be exhibited by the robot simultaneously, computing actuator accelerations of the joint actuators for the current sampling interval from both behavior forces, accelerations velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the current sampling interval and actuator velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the previous sampling interval, computing actuator velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the joint actuators for the current sampling interval from the actuator velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the previous sampling interval, and, finally, controlling the actuators {{in accordance with the}} actuator accelerations, velocities and <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the current sampling interval.
