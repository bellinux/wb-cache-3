Treatment of wild-type M. graminicola (strain IPO 323) with 5 μg of epoxiconazole, tebuconazole, triadimenol, or <b>prothioconazole</b> ml− 1 resulted in inhibition of M. graminicola CYP 51 (MgCYP 51), as evidenced by the accumulation of 14 α-methylated sterol substrates (lanosterol and eburicol) and the depletion of ergosterol in azole-treated cells. Successful expression of MgCYP 51 in Escherichia coli enabled us to conduct spectrophotometric assays using purified 62 -kDa MgCYP 51 protein. Antifungal-binding studies revealed that epoxiconazole, tebuconazole, and triadimenol all bound tightly to MgCYP 51, producing strong type II difference spectra (peak at 423 to 429 nm and trough at 406 to 409 nm) indicative of the formation of classical low-spin sixth-ligand complexes.

40|$|Background: Fusarium {{head blight}} {{is a very}} {{important}} disease of small grain cereals with F. graminearum {{as one of the most}} important causal agents. It not only causes reduction in yield and quality but from a human and animal healthcare point of view, it produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) which can accumulate to toxic levels. Little is known about external triggers influencing DON production. Results: In the present work, a combined in vivo/ in vitro approach was used to test the effect of sub lethal fungicide treatments on DON production. Using a dilution series of <b>prothioconazole,</b> azoxystrobin and <b>prothioconazole</b> + fluoxastrobin, we demonstrated that sub lethal doses of <b>prothioconazole</b> coincide with an increase in DON production 48 h after fungicide treatment. In an artificial infection trial using wheat plants, the in vitro results of increased DON levels upon sub lethal <b>prothioconazole</b> application were confirmed illustrating the significance of these results from a practical point of view. In addition, further in vitro experiments revealed a timely hyperinduction of H 2 O 2 production as fast as 4 h after amending cultures with <b>prothioconazole.</b> When applying H 2 O 2 directly to germinating conidia, a similar induction of DON-production by F. graminearum was observed. The effect of sub lethal <b>prothioconazole</b> concentrations on DON production completely disappeared when applying catalase together with the fungicide. Conclusions: These cumulative results suggest that H 2 O 2 induced by sub lethal doses of the triazole fungicide <b>prothioconazole</b> acts as a trigger of DON biosynthesis. In a broader framework, this work clearly shows that DON production by the plant pathogen F. graminearum is the result of the interaction of fungal genomics and external environmental triggers...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} triazole-based {{treatments}} on Fusarium head blight (FHB), grain yields and {{the accumulation of}} deoxynivalenol (DON) in harvested wheat kernels was evaluated by means of twenty multi-site field experiments performed during five consecutive growing seasons (from 2004 ‒ 2005 to 2008 ‒ 2009) in Italy. Fungicide treatments were carried out on different cultivars of common wheat (cv. Serio, Blasco, Genio and Savio) and durum wheat (cv. Orobel, Saragolla, San Carlo, Levante, Duilio, Karur and Derrik) after artificial inoculation {{with a mixture of}} toxigenic Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum strains. The application of fungicides containing <b>prothioconazole</b> (Proline® or Prosaro®) at the beginning of anthesis (BBCH 61) resulted in a consistent reduction of FHB disease severity (by between 39 and 93 %) and DON levels in wheat kernels (by between 40 and 91 %) and increased wheat yields (from 0. 4 to 5. 6 t ha- 1, average 2. 2 t ha- 1), as compared to the untreated/inoculated control. Fungicides containing tebuconazole (Folicur® SE) and cyproconazole plus prochloraz (Tiptor® Xcell) showed a reduced effectiveness compared with prothioconazole-based treatments. All fungicide treatments were more effective in reducing DON and increasing grain yields of common wheat than durum wheat. Results showed that the application of fungicides containing <b>prothioconazole</b> at the beginning of anthesis provided a strong reduction of FHB disease, allowing both an increase in grain yields and a considerable reduction of DON content in wheat kernels...|$|E

40|$|Poster abstractPhoma stem canker, {{a disease}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) caused by sibling {{pathogens}} Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. Both pathogens follow a monocylic disease cycle that causes leaf spotting in autumn/winter and stem cankers in spring/summer. Most severe cankers decrease transportation of water and nutrients. Fungicides are important for phoma stem canker control. Triazole fungicides currently dominate the market, although reduced sensitivity in some plant pathogen species is a concern. Moreover, L. maculans and L. biglobosa have shown differing level of sensitivity to triazole fungicides. Therefore, increased knowledge on controlling phoma stem canker using non-triazole based fungicides is essential. Field trials were established for 2013 / 2014 cropping season. Four fungicides were applied: penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, <b>prothioconazole</b> and a novel fungicide. Spray timings were divided into three sprays T 1 (phoma leaf spotting incidence ??? 10 %), T 2 (3 / 4 weeks post T 1) and T 3 (Sclerotinia). Phoma leaf spotting incidence and stem canker severity were recorded. In vitro sensitivity testing was done on one L. maculans (ME 24) and one L. biglobosa (68) isolate. <b>Prothioconazole</b> showed no noteworthy advantage over the novel fungicide in canker severity scoring. No significant difference in growth inhibition was observed between L. biglobosa and L. maculans (P ??? 0. 05) when treated with novel fungicide. Canker severity indicates that the novel fungicide has a similar efficacy to triazole fungicides. Fungicide sensitivity testing shows that L. biglobosa {{does not have an}} increased sensitivity to non-triazole fungicides. This interaction suggests that the novel fungicide could be used to control both L. maculans and L. biglobos...|$|E

40|$|Phoma {{stem canker}} {{is a disease}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) caused by closely related plant {{pathogens}} Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. It is an economically important disease, causing annual yield losses of approximately ?? 770 million worldwide. When colonising oilseed rape, L. maculans and L. biglobosa exist in close proximity on the leaf, competing for resources as they move through the main leaf vein and into the stem. Fungicides are commonly used to decrease severity of phoma stem canker on oilseed rape. However, the efficacy and longevity of active chemicals is under threat from evolution of resistance in pathogen populations and government legalisation. Moreover, {{it has been suggested}} that both L. maculans and L. biglobosa differ in their sensitivity to azoles, and important class of fungicides that are used to control the disease through the inhibition of lanosterol 14 -?? demethylase (erg 11, CYP 51). This project aims to further understand the role that fungicides have in controlling phoma stem canker by investigating their efficacy against L. maculans and L. biglobosa in crops, in vitro and in planta. In field experiments, established in Cambridgeshire across four cropping seasons, the fungicide mixture penthiopyrad (SDHI) plus picoxystrobin (QoI) was as effective at controlling phoma leaf spotting and phoma stem canker in winter oilseed rape as <b>prothioconazole</b> (DMI), suggesting that both fungicides could be used to reduce phoma stem canker symptoms. The two pathogens differed in their growth rates in vitro, with L. biglobosa growing faster than L. maculans when untreated or treated with lower fungicide concentrations. Fungicide sensitivity assays suggest that L. maculans and L. biglobosa are both sensitive to DMI, SDHI and QoI fungicides and that differences between the species are minor. <b>Prothioconazole</b> and penthiopyrad + picoxystrobin had a similar efficacy on oilseed rape cotyledons colonised with either L. maculans or L. biglobosa. There was no difference between species on <b>prothioconazole</b> treated plants, although there was a difference between L. maculans and L. biglobosa when treated with 20 ??g/ml penthiopyrad + picoxystrobin. Heterologous yeast expression of LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B with fungicide sensitivity testing of the yeast transformants suggests that LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B are similarly sensitive to azole fungicides flusilazole, prothioconazole-desthio and tebuconazole. These findings are supported by homology protein modelling, which predicts that LmCYP 51 B and LbCYP 51 B are structurally very similar, specifically at the azole-binding site. In conclusion, fungicides are still an effective control method for reducing phoma stem canker symptoms caused by Leptosphaeria species in the UK, and a useful tool to in the sustainable production of oilseed rape...|$|E
40|$|Avaliou-se a eficácia de fungicidas para o controle da helmintosporiose (Bipolaris incurvata) do coqueiro, em condições de campo. O experimento foi conduzido em Ocauçu - SP, em plantas com 8 meses de idade. Foram {{realizadas}} três pulverizações com intervalo quinzenal, utilizando-se de 600 litros de calda/ha, com os ingredientes ativos: <b>prothioconazole</b> (0, 100 e 0, 150 L/ha), tebuconazole (0, 150 e 0, 200 L/ha) e propiconazole (0, 125 e 0, 250 L/ha). A primeira pulverização foi realizada em plantas com sintomas foliares da doença, de modo que todas as plantas avaliadas tinham as folhas velhas como fonte de inóculo. O controle proporcionado pelos ingredientes ativos, foi avaliado em folhas jovens que, sob condições climáticas favoráveis, foram suscetíveis ao ataque do patógeno. Constatou-se que todos os fungicidas e doses utilizados foram eficientes no controle da helmintosporiose (Bipolaris incurvata). Helmintosporiose fungicide control efficacy {{was evaluated}} in coconut plants, at field conditions. The experiment {{was conducted in}} Ocauçu-SP (Brasil), using 8 -months old plants.

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{decline in}} the effectiveness of some azole fungicides in controlling Mycosphaerella graminicola, causal agent of the damaging Septoria leaf blotch disease of wheat, has been correlated with the selection and spread in the pathogen population of specific mutations in the M. graminicola CYP 51 (MgCYP 51) gene encoding the azole target sterol 14 α-demethylase. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} the emergence of novel MgCYP 51 variants, often harboring substitution S 524 T, has contributed to a decrease in the efficacy of <b>prothioconazole</b> and epoxiconazole, the two currently most effective azole fungicides against M. graminicola. In this study, we establish which amino acid alterations in novel MgCYP 51 variants have the greatest impact on azole sensitivity and protein function. We introduced individual and combinations of identified alterations by site-directed mutagenesis and functionally determined their impact on azole sensitivity by expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant YUG 37 ::erg 11 carrying a regulatable promoter controlling native CYP 51 expression. We demonstrate that substitution S 524 T confers decreased sensitivity to all azoles when introduced alone or in combination with Y 461 S. In addition, S 524 T restores the function in S. cerevisiae of MgCYP 51 variants carrying the otherwise lethal alterations Y 137 F and V 136 A. Sensitivity tests of S. cerevisiae transformants expressing recently emerged MgCYP 51 variants carrying combinations of alterations D 134 G, V 136 A, Y 461 S, and S 524 T reveal a substantial impact on sensitivity to the currently most widely used azoles, including epoxiconazole and <b>prothioconazole.</b> Finally, we exploit a recently developed model of the MgCYP 51 protein to predict that the substantial structural changes caused by these novel combinations reduce azole interactions with critical residues in the binding cavity, thereby causing resistance...|$|E

40|$|Blind seed disease (BS) {{is caused}} by the fungus Gloeotinia temulenta that {{directly}} affects the germination of grass seeds by killing the embryo. This disease continues to periodically affect the forage grass seed industry (Alderman, 2001). Epichloë fungal infection has a symbiotic association with grasses, providing beneficial traits to the plant host, having a crucial role in ensuring the persistence of grasses against biotic and abiotic threats (Mortimer and Di Menna, 1982; Popay and Rowan, 1994). This study focuses on new fungicide testing used to control BS and its effects on the transmission of the AR 37 endophyte into the new seed generation. In this study, thousand seed weights, germination percentages, blind seed determinations and immunoblot detection of endophyte were carried out to assess the effects of different foliar fungicide treatments used to control blind seed (BS) and other pathogens, on the transmission of the AR 37 endophyte into the developing seed of perennial and hybrid ryegrass cultivars (Samson, Horizon and PGone 50). Trial one, but not trial two, was conducted on a paddock where there were abundant buried seed with BS disease to ensure a high potential for this disease to develop in the treatments plots. In trial one, germination in Samson with all fungicide treatments used was higher, and conversely BS was lower, than the control (except T 12 composed of folpet). The treatments that best controlled BS in Samson were T 2 (70 % germination, composed by 100 g/ha <b>prothioconazole</b> applied at mid-flowering); T 4 (72 % germination, composed by 100 g/ha <b>prothioconazole</b> + 250 g/ha carbendazim applied at mid-flowering and mid-seed fill); T 8 (73 % germination, composed by 125 g/ha azoxystrobin with 189. 2 g/ha tebuconazole applied twice (at mid-flowering and mid-seed fill and 250 g/ha carbendazim at mid-seed fill); and T 9 (73 % germination, composed by 100 g/ha <b>prothioconazole</b> + 75 g/ha isopyrazam + 250 g/ha carbendazim applied at mid-flowering and mid-seed fill). No reduction in endophyte transmission to seed was observed with the fungicide treatments {{with the exception of the}} applications of folpet. In turn, with Horizon several fungicide combinations were able to improve the germination performance by controlling BS, however Horizon had a lower performance in terms of controlling BS. The percentage of Horizon seed with endophyte in all treatments was very low, possible reflecting the use of seed with a low percentage of viable AR 37 endophyte when the grass seed crop was established some years previously. In trial two, germination, endophyte content, and seed yield between the treatments were not different. All treatments (including the control) had a germination level between 84 to 89 %. All treatments used in this trial maintained the AR 37 endophyte content in the resultant seed lots. It is known that the application of some fungicides used to control a range of pathogens is detrimental to the viability of endophytes. Therefore, it is imperative that research in the quest of new treatments that control effectively BS without exerting detrimental effects on endophyte continues...|$|E
