5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length. Many of the class were fitted with <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need to change {{to the other end}} of its train at the end of a journey.|$|E
25|$|The Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) 2600 Class were Associated Equipment Company (AEC)–engined diesel {{multiple}} units (normally termed railcars in Ireland) that operated InterCity and suburban services on the CIÉ system between 1952 and 1975. Many were later converted for <b>push–pull</b> <b>operation</b> with diesel locomotives, finally being withdrawn when {{displaced by the}} electric Dublin Area Rapid Transit service in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|The NIR {{coaches were}} {{withdrawn}} on 19 January 2005, but were re-introduced to provide extra capacity on the Portadown to Belfast (Central) service, making one trip every morning. (Coaches 943+944 did not re-enter service and {{were used for}} parts). In 2009 the locomotives and coaches were due to be converted to <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> following the purchase by NIR of a DBSO from 'one' (later National Express East Anglia). However, this never happened and the entire fleet was withdrawn on 18 June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1959, gallery {{cars on the}} Chicago and Northwestern were {{equipped}} with the AAR standard multiple-unit train control system and a control cab that allowed true high speed <b>push-pull</b> train <b>operations</b> without requiring any operators in the locomotive when operating in push mode. This combination of high passenger capacity, rapid turnaround (or flip-backs) and highly reliable <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> has resulted in almost universal adoption of bilevel <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> for commuter and non-electrified corridor services throughout North America.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s express {{trains in}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> were hauled by class DB-220 diesel locomotives.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 62 were {{originally}} built between 1958 and 1963, certain {{units of the}} class were fitted for <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> with Corail coaches and control car.|$|R
25|$|Passenger yards are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard {{is fully}} electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head {{contains}} a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating {{the need for}} a turntable. It remains in service, even though <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> has eliminated the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are hand-operated. A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating back to when electrification ended there, but have been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy can be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> on the {{suburban}} rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An underfloor generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph speed restriction imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, Bombardier {{gave the}} Class 185 family a brand name, TRAXX, {{intended}} to allude {{to the terms}} 'traction', 'track' and 'attraction'. The acronym stands for Transnational Railway Applications with eXtreme fleXibility. The first letter of TRAXX type designations provides for differentiation according {{to the area of}} application, with F for freight and P for passenger. The original system also tentatively included H for heavy-haul and S for high-speed, but no actual vehicles were delivered under this designation. The number following the first letter indicates the top speed of the locomotive in kilometers per hour. The next two letters indicate the supply system, with AC for alternating current electric locomotives, DC for direct current electric locomotives, MS for multi-system locomotives capable of operating both under AC and DC overhead wires, and DE was foreseen from the start for an eventual Diesel-electric version. An extra P letter at the end was to designate powerheads (traction heads), that is locomotives with one driving cabin for <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation.</b> An also optional number at the end designates different versions, later used for the designation of generations.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} train {{consists}} in <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> was originally limited to 10 cars {{for reasons of}} guidance dynamics. A speed limit of 120 km/h was also imposed, rising to 140 km/h in 1980. This was not an operational hindrance, as push-pull trains were generally initially used in six-car commuter trains.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} variants were procured: C4ymg-51 (later Bylb 421), BC4yg (later ABylb 411), CPwymg-51, a {{large number}} of which were fitted with driver's cabs for <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> and designated as CPwygmf (later BDylbf 456). The driver's cab end of the coach had an inset entrance located one compartment-length from the end {{to make room for the}} cab.|$|R
25|$|The {{units were}} {{converted}} from Class 414 driving motors cars, by Eastleigh works in 1983-84, {{for use on}} the new Gatwick Express service. They were used to allow <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations,</b> on the London-end of the rakes of Class 488 stock, with a Class 73 locomotive {{at the other end}} and both used for propulsion. The units were used as baggage cars.|$|R
500|$|... 30 July 1984: 47707 Holyrood was {{propelling}} the 17:30 express from Edinburgh to Glasgow {{from the}} rear, {{when the train}} collided with a cow near Polmont and was derailed, resulting in 13 deaths. The accident raised serious concerns {{about the safety of}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> where the locomotive was {{at the rear of the}} train.|$|E
500|$|As Amtrak's F40PH fleet was {{replaced}} by newer GE Genesis-series locomotives, Amtrak converted {{a number of the}} retired units into baggage/cab cars. Colloquially known as [...] "cabbages" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "cab" [...] and [...] "baggage"), and officially known as Non-Powered Control Units (NPCUs), these units had their prime movers and traction motors removed and a large roll-up door installed in the side (allowing the former engine compartment to be used for baggage). Amtrak converted 22 locomotives into cabbage cars between 1996–2007. Each converted unit was renumbered by prefixing [...] "90" [...] to its original number. In 2011, Amtrak F40PH 406 was refurbished for Amtrak's 40th-anniversary exhibit train. It was converted to an NPCU to enable <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> of the exhibit train; in addition a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary electricity. Unlike other NPCUs, the 406 retains its original number and resembles an operational F40PH externally.|$|E
2500|$|From Pasing via Mittersendling to Deisenhofen was {{originally}} {{part of the}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> under the name S12. Thereafter, these trains ran without S-Bahn-designation. Later, the line was simplified and became the S20 again an S-Bahn-designation.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive numbers 1 to 3 on the Lübeck-Büchen railway (Lübeck-Büchener Eisenbahn or LBE) in Germany were {{streamlined}} tank locomotives. The locomotives had a 2-4-2T wheel arrangement, a two-cylinder, superheated {{engine and}} {{were capable of}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations.</b> In order to ensure a symmetrical running gear, both carrying axles were built as Bissel bogies, which were fitted with return devices for improved running.|$|R
50|$|The {{units were}} {{converted}} from Class 414 driving motors cars, by Eastleigh works in 1983-84, {{for use on}} the new Gatwick Express service. They were used to allow <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations,</b> on the London-end of the rakes of Class 488 stock, with a Class 73 locomotive {{at the other end}} and both used for propulsion. The units were used as baggage cars.|$|R
5000|$|The Regional-Express service, Passau-Plattling-Landshut-Munich, {{which is}} worked {{every two hours}} by {{electric}} locomotives of Class 111 hauling two double-decker coaches and two Silberling local passenger coaches (or n-coaches) in <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> with 374 seats in 2nd class and 42 in 1st class. At peak times they are reinforced by additional double-deckers and n-coaches. At the weekend, they operated with four double-deckers and two n-coaches.|$|R
2500|$|Chicago and North Western also {{operated}} {{commuter train}} {{service in the}} Chicago area, where they developed what was perhaps the first control car. [...] A modified gallery car was built in 1960 with locomotive controls to allow <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation.</b> [...] Today, it is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. The C also pioneered the concept of Head End Power (HEP), generating 480 volt electricity from the locomotive to power the air conditioning, lighting, and heating on the new bi-level cars. This eventually became the standard for all railroads in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|All cars' toilets were removed. There were {{originally}} nine five-car and three four-car sets. The first sets to enter service had the locomotive {{at the north}} end, but later ones were marshalled with the locomotive at the south end; the earlier sets were then turned on the triangle at Limerick Junction to standardise the position. However, the number of available driving trailers declined due to a spate of fires (at one stage, a [...] "spare man" [...] travelled in each driving trailer's generator compartment to detect and extinguish fires) and the fatal collision at Gormanston in 1974. There were only six driving trailers available by 1982; conventional locomotive haulage was, thus, often substituted for <b>push–pull</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Mark 3A [...] "Cú Na Mara" [...] set, now withdrawn, {{operated}} {{exclusively on}} the Dublin to Galway route, and was originally the BREL International Train, a showcase project designed to secure overseas orders. The set travelled to a German rail exhibition in 1988, but returned without any new orders and languished for some years before being sold on through Vic Berry. CIÉ converted the many different interior layouts to their own standard design (6201–08 ex 99521–22/24–29, Restaurant Buffet 6401 ex 99523), fitted their own Mark 3 type powered door and re-bogied with ABB bogies. Although also re-wired for <b>Push-Pull</b> <b>operation</b> {{the fact that an}} additional coach wasn't converted to a Driving Brake Standard (planned 6501 ex 99520) prevented the set from ever running with this configuration.|$|E
50|$|When first introduced, it {{was hoped}} to allow <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> with one {{locomotive}} permanently allocated to a single three- or four-car H set, with a driving cab installed in the non-locomotive end of that set. This failed because while the Harris motor cabs were sufficient for 1950's standards of comfort and visibility, the conversion cost any application of the grandfather clause and so visibility of signals etc. was deemed insufficient.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Railway also {{operated}} push-pull trains {{of up to}} two carriages in commuter areas. <b>Push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> did {{not need}} the time-consuming use of a turntable or run-around {{at the end of}} a suburban branch line, and enabled the driver to use a cab in the end coach to drive the locomotive in reverse. Such operations were similar to the autotrains, with a Drummond M7 providing the motive power.|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Class 3000 trains was a success, they were a like-for-like replacement for the Class 80 units rather than an expansion of the fleet. Due to the limited number of new units, some of NIR's older rolling stock was retained, notably the entire Class 450 on the Belfast-Larne route. [...] To enable NIR to maintain its levels of service, it upgraded some of its older rolling stock. In 2005, the Class 450 fleet was refurbished to a standard close to that of the Class 3000 units, which saw them through to their withdrawal in 2012. Three four-car Class 80 units were refurbished and a number of locomotives and coaches were converted to <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> with the addition of the DBSO obtained from 'one', to ensure that passenger rolling stock levels were maintained up to {{the introduction}} of new rolling stock in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the M1s {{comprised}} the entire electric fleet, supplemented by 174 new M3 cars between 1985 and 1986. The newer, postwar single-level electric MU cars {{were converted to}} operate behind diesels, joining the postwar diesel-hauled coaches already in that service whose HVAC systems were converted from steam heating to head-end power (HEP). A modified type of <b>push-pull</b> <b>operation</b> {{was introduced to the}} diesel trains, using retired first-generation freight diesels from other railroads (mostly ALCO FAs) converted into control units capable only of HEP generation and controlling the locomotive {{at the other end of}} the train. The first 16 control cabs were created by GE using the last 16 Alco-GE FA-1 and FA-2 units in existence, all of which had been traded in to GE by the last four railroads to operate them: the Penn Central, Louisville & Nashville, Spokane, Portland and Seattle, and Western Maryland. Many of these units survive today in rail museums. New diesels for general use were purchased to replace the LIRR's ALCO Century 420s and other diesels, in the form of GP38-2s and MP15ACs. The latter switchers were innovatively used as [...] "pull-pull" [...] pairs on each end of short off-peak trains on the Oyster Bay Branch and the Greenport shuttle, whereby the leading unit would provide the motive power, and the trailing unit would supply the train with HEP, the process being reversed at the terminal. By 1973, the LIRR had a completely air-conditioned fleet.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{asynchronous}} way of gossiping with limited delay. In our scheme, a peer establishes connectivity with multiple peers {{and uses a}} limited number of <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> in each information spreading cycle. This repeated push-pulls between two peers during each cycle (details in Sec. III-A) results in a much smaller number of duplicated messages compared to conventional push-based gossip protocols and conventional push-pull gossip protocols for real-time applications [43, 44]. Hence, we name our protocol Redundancy Reduced Gossip (RRG).|$|R
5000|$|During the mid-1990s, as <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> {{became more}} common in the United States, cab-cars came under {{criticism}} [...] for providing less protection to engine crews during level crossing accidents. This has been addressed by providing additional reinforcing in cab cars. This criticism became stronger after the 2005 Glendale train crash, in which a Metrolink train collided with a Jeep Grand Cherokee at a level crossing in California. The train was traveling with its cab car in the front, and the train jackknifed. Eleven people were killed in the accident, and about 180 were injured.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the meeting {{was to have a}} {{first-hand}} discussion about the properties of the magnet for ILD. The two most important outcomes were: 1.) a common parameter set for the coil ('Saclay parameters') 2.) a discussion about the movement of the coil for <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations.</b> Here Francois was doubtful that a CMS-like coil could be moved cooled down in routine operations! As the time for warm-up resp. cool-down is in the order of a month, this might be a potential show-stopper for push-pull! At least some significant R&D might be needed to study that point...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{speed was}} 100 km/h, this was enhanced to 110 km/h in 1969 {{in order to}} allow better usability also for commuter trains. A sub-series, known as 140.8, were equipped for <b>push-pull</b> train <b>operation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The service {{originally}} {{operated on}} the Aachen-Bielefeld route and {{was composed of}} class 110 locomotives hauling six partly modernised Silberling carriages. If necessary, trains had an additional carriage. From the mid-90s, the trains were formed of non air-conditioned double-deck carriages and class 111 locomotives. Shortly later control cars were added, so that <b>push-pull</b> <b>operations</b> could be introduced. From 1998, air-conditioned double-deck carriages were introduced, but only after Expo 2000 in Hanover were all services of the NRW-Express operated with new air-conditioned carriages equipped to operate at 160 km/h. The sets were now mostly hauled by class 146 locomotives, which had originally been supplied for the Expo.|$|R
