50|$|Experimentation with LSD, peyote, {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, MDA, marijuana, {{and other}} psychedelic drugs {{became a major}} component of 1960s counterculture, influencing philosophy, art, music and styles of dress.

50|$|Entheogens {{have played}} a pivotal role in the spiritual {{practices}} of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus</b> (Lophophora williamsii). For his part, {{one of the founders of}} modern ethno-botany, the late-Richard Evans Schultes of Harvard University documented the ritual use of <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus</b> among the Kiowa, who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now Mexico, in the 19th century its use spread throughout North America, replacing the deadly toxic mescal bean (Calia secundiflora) who are questioned to be an entheogen at all. Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic Aztec sacrament, pulque, ritual tobacco (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the Maya (from where the word 'cigar' derives), psilocybin mushrooms, morning glories (Ipomoea tricolor and Turbina corymbosa), and Salvia divinorum.|$|E
40|$|The {{explanation}} of <b>peyote,</b> the hallucinogenic <b>cactus</b> central to several American Indian ceremonies, requires forays into many diverse fields, from chemistry and botany to ethnomusicology, frontier history, and legal studies.

5000|$|In {{order to}} follow the sacred journey, every year the maraka'ames (chamanes) travel 250 miles (400 kilometers) from wixarica's area in Jalisco to San Luis Potosí. At the {{beginning}} they walk towards Takata, a sacred area in Sierra Madre Occidental where the temple guard (xuxuricare) will ask for a safe journey. The next step is kalihuey, a Main Temple where they join Wixarica's authorities.They collect <b>peyote</b> - a <b>cactus</b> containing hallucinogens - along the way, they believe the peyote enables the Wixarica (Huichol) to commune directly with their ancestors and deities.|$|R
50|$|Epinine {{does not}} seem to occur widely, but it is present as a minor {{alkaloid}} in some plants, such as the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus,</b> Lophophora williamsii, and a species of Acacia, as well as in Scotch Broom, Cytisus scoparius. This compound has also been isolated from the adrenal medulla of pigs and cows, and from the toad, Bufo marinus. It has also been detected in the locust, Locusta migratoria.|$|E
5000|$|For the Huichol {{people of}} Mexico, the [...] "magical deer" [...] {{represents}} both {{the power of}} maize to sustain the body and of the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus</b> to feed and enlighten the spirit. Animals such as the eagle, jaguar, serpent and deer are of great importance to the Mexican indigenous cultures. For each group, however, one of these animals is of special significance and confers some of its qualities to the tribe.|$|E
5000|$|At {{other times}} of the year, there is a {{continuous}} pilgrimage of {{people of all ages}} and nationalities. They travel thousands of miles to arrive at this sacred site and experience a mystical communion with the magical cactus. So much so, in fact, that the government has mounted a campaign to protect the cactus from these so-called [...] "peyote tourists". It is illegal for anyone but Huichol Indians to gather, or possess, the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Peyote,</b> a <b>cactus</b> {{containing}} the hallucinogen mescaline, {{is used to}} induce altered states of consciousness in religious ceremonies or for recreational purpose. This study reports a case of an underage boy suspected of mescaline abuse. For this purpose, we analyzed a dark green liquid sample found in the bedroom of the boy whose urine and hair samples were collected shortly after the drink was found. A method by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in positive chemical ionization mode was developed and validated in terms of linearity, specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity for mescaline determination at the low concentrations present in hair. GC-MS analysis of the liquid identified mescaline, while urine was negative; GC-MS/MS segmental hair analysis identified mescaline in the proximal segment (root to 2  cm), while the distal segments were negative. Although peyote was uncommonly encountered, its use was confirmed by segmental hair analysis that can provide long-term information about drugs use...|$|R
50|$|<b>Peyote</b> is a <b>cactus</b> {{found in}} North America, {{mainly in the}} area {{composed}} by south-western United States and the entire northwest of Mexico (where is common to find wild peyote), used by Native cultures. It gives similar effects to LSD. This drug is regulated under U.N. law but the only nation to ban and enforce the ban has been Canada. In the U.S., after a major legal trial, Peyote was deemed legal {{as long as it}} was used in Native American churches (it is not required to be Native American or a church member to use it in the said church).|$|R
40|$|Native American {{religious}} tradition {{is a fascinating}} subject. Yet most Americans {{know very little about}} the spiritual practices of indigenous peoples. As a curious student of theology, I explored the modern Native American Church in my senior seminar research paper. I attended a peyote ceremony – a healing ritual using the hallucinogenic <b>cactus</b> <b>peyote</b> – and studied the history, theology, and practice of the Native American Church. Through my research and experience, I have seen similarities between my own Christian tradition and the Native American Church and contend that the sacramental use of peyote can be a powerful spiritual tool in strengthening anyone 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with God...|$|R
50|$|Arthur Carl Wilhelm Heffter (15 June 1859, in Leipzig - 8 February 1925, in Berlin) was a German {{pharmacologist}} and chemist. He was {{the first}} chairman of the German Society of Pharmacologists, and was {{largely responsible for the}} first Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. He isolated mescaline from the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus</b> in 1897, the first such isolation of a naturally occurring psychedelic substance in pure form. In addition, he conducted experiments on its effects by comparing the effects of peyote and mescaline on himself.|$|E

5000|$|Dermatophyllum secundiflorum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} shrub or small tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to the southwestern United States (Texas, New Mexico) and Mexico (Chihuahua and Coahuila south to Hidalgo, Puebla and Querétaro). Common names include Texas mountain laurel, Texas mescalbean, frijolito, and frijolillo. Although [...] "mescalbean" [...] is among the plant's common appellations, it bears {{no relation to the}} Agave species used to make the spirit mezcal, nor to the <b>peyote</b> <b>cactus</b> (Lophophora williamsii), which contains the hallucinogenic alkaloid mescaline.|$|E
50|$|Smart {{shops are}} best known in {{practice}} for selling whatever psychedelics, dissociatives, entactogens and deliriants local law permits. In the Netherlands, which {{is home to}} most of the smart shops in Europe, this includes Salvia divinorum, Amanita muscaria, <b>Peyote,</b> San Pedro <b>cactus,</b> Tabernanthe iboga, and various ingredients for Ayahuasca preparations. As of 1 December 2008, magic mushrooms are under stricter control in the Netherlands. Those new controls are quite controversial, because the list of banned mushrooms also contains species that have no psychoactive substances. Magic Mushroom spore prints and grow boxes are still available over the counter in the Netherlands. Psilocybin is not included in the ban and continues to be sold in smart shops nationwide in truffle form.|$|R
5000|$|Like many {{indigenous}} American groups, Huichols {{have traditionally}} used the <b>peyote</b> (hikuri) <b>cactus</b> in religious rituals. Huichol practices seem to reflect pre-Columbian practices particularly accurately. These rituals involve singing, weeping, and contact with ancestor spirits."It is Wirikuta, where the Huichol go {{each year to}} collect peyote." [...] "Before reaching Wirikúta, their final destination, they pass by the sacred springs of Tatéi Matiniéri ("Where Our Mother Lives"), {{the house of the}} eastern rain goddess. They cross steppes. The first one is the Cloud Gate; the second, Where the Clouds Open." [...] This pilgrimage takes place annually as a desire to return to where life originated and heal oneself. The Huichols assume roles of gods along the trail that they usually take by foot. Upon arrival in Wirikuta, the hunt begins and the first cactus that is found is shared among everyone. Then they harvest enough peyote for the year (since they only make the trip one time every year). After the work is done, they eat enough peyote (a hallucinogen) to have visions. Because of the visions and effects of the plant, the shaman is able to speak to the gods and ensure the regeneration of the Huichols' souls.|$|R
50|$|<b>Peyote</b> is a <b>cactus</b> found {{natively}} in Mexico. The {{buttons of}} the cactus, when chewed, {{act as a}} hallucinogen used in the ancient Aztec religion and continued by area tribes to the present. Peyote ceremonies spread north and east, reaching the Apache tribes in the 18th century and then spreading to most every tribe in North America, along with some Apache music and Plains-Pueblo characteristics. Peyote songs accompany the peyote ceremonies, and are mostly the same throughout the area of peyote's entheogenic use. These songs are most similar to traditional songs of the Plains area, but are characterized by a rapid rhythm composed of two note values, transcribed as quarter and eighth notes. Vocables, or non-lexical syllables are used, as are cadential and closing formulas.|$|R
