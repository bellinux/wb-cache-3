Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air.

40|$|International audienceThe {{morphology}} {{development of}} blends of <b>plasticized</b> polyvinyl butyral (PVB) with <b>plasticized</b> polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is studied {{to obtain a}} droplet-in-matrix morphology.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of two different sizes of silica particles (micro-silica and nano-silica) was studied on mechanical properties of sulfur and sulfur composite. To improve the structural properties, sulfur was <b>plasticized</b> using dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and methyl styrene (MSt). <b>Plasticized</b> sulfur composite was prepared by melt blending of <b>plasticized</b> sulfur and silica particles. The increment in compressive and flexural strengths revealed that the micro-particles enhance mechanical properties of sulfur while nano-particles improved mechanical properties of <b>plasticized</b> sulfur. Viscosity measurements indicated that mechanical properties of nano composites containing matrix with low viscosity (sulfur <b>plasticized</b> with methyl styrene) are improved with increasing mixer speed but increasing the mixer speed had negative effect on composites containing matrix with higher viscosity (sulfur <b>plasticized</b> with dicyclopentadiene) ...|$|R
50|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} of these factors, and affects the mix viscosity, acting to <b>plasticize</b> the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as wet extrusion, but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability. The most important rheological factor in the wet extrusion of high-starch extrudate is temperature.|$|E

The most important later innovation of C-3 introduced the non-explosive plasticizer butyl phthalate instead of this mixture of nitro compounds. This reduced the toxicity while increasing the concentration of RDX and improving safety of use and storage.

40|$|AbstractEffects of silica {{nanoparticle}} {{concentration and}} plasticizer type on color transition of PDA/SiO 2 nanocomposite were investigated. Four types of plasticizer were poly(ethylene glycol- 400), glycerol, xylitol and sorbitol. The number of hydroxyl groups in polyol affected to {{the stability of}} PDA/SiO 2 nanocomposite molecules. The color of <b>plasticized</b> PDA films exhibited a stronger purple color tone than those of <b>plasticized</b> PDA/SiO 2 films.

Higher concentration of silica nanoparticles yielded higher stability of PDA/SiO 2 nanocomposite molecules. <b>Plasticized</b> PDA and <b>plasticized</b> PDA/SiO 2 films clearly changed the color from blue to purple, reddish purple and finally red stored at higher temperature (35 °C), whereas they only shifted the color from blue to purple kept at lower temperature (5 °C) throughout storage time.

40|$|There exist {{important}} industrial applications, such as hoses {{or plastic}} windows, dealing with closely combining, <b>plasticized</b> and rigid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). Nevertheless, migration of plasticizer causes severe {{variation of the}} mechanical performance of the end-products. In this work the common system <b>plasticized</b> PVC /di-octyl-phthalate /rigid PVC was studied under two-sided diffusion conditions, i. e. from a thin sheet of <b>plasticized</b> PVC to two sheets of rigid PVC, each in contact with {{one side of the}} <b>plasticized</b> sheet. Three different levels of initial plasticizer concentration (48, 66 and 100 phr) have been considered for a period of about five months, until equilibrium was reached. During this period the migration process was monitored by weight changes. It was proved that the Fick's law approximation for short times can be used to describe the migration kinetics for this solid/solid system. On the other hand, macroscopic observations revealed that no plasticizer was accumulated at the interface, i. e. all plasticizer leaving the <b>plasticized</b> sheet entered the rigid ones. Finally, it seems that the controlling stage is the diffusion inside <b>plasticized</b> PVC while possible annealing of the <b>plasticized</b> polymer structure cannot be excluded...|$|R
