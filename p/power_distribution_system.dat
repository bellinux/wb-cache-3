SEPTA's 25Hz traction power system uses the same 12kV voltage on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical catenary voltage, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> has a 138kV transmission network that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12kV to feed the catenary system. The SEPTA <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> uses a 2:1 ratio autotransformer system, with the catenary fed at 12kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24kV.

40|$|There {{are many}} calamitous {{events such as}} earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis etc. that occur {{suddenly}} and cause great loss of life, damage, or hardship. Hurricanes cause significant damage to <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems,</b> resulting in prolonged customer outages and excessive delays in the reconstruction efforts. Accordingly, predicting the effects of power outages {{on the performance of}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> is of major importance to government agencies, utilities, and customers. Unfortunately, the current tools to predict the performance of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> during catastrophic events are limited in both the performance measures considered, as well as in their ability to model real systems. The main goal of this research is to develop a methodology for simulating hurricanes of different intensity on <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> of small and medium size cities. Our study includes a detailed comparison between the engineering-based and connectivity-based models of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as the impact of power re-routing algorithms on the system reliability. Our approach is based on fragility curves that capture the ability of the system to withstand a range of wind speeds. In addition, we develop a multiscale approach that facilitates efficient computation of fragility curves for large cities. With this approach, hurricanes are simulated over small zones of a city and fragility curves are obtained. These are used to estimate the damage for identical zones throughout the city. To validate our techniques, two testbeds, Micropolis and Mesopolis, were used. Micropolis is synthetic model for a small city and Mesopolis for a big city.

25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system,</b> which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E

Between 1899 and 1900 he built a laboratory in Colorado Springs and performed experiments on wireless transmission there. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> had been introduced there {{and he had}} associates {{who were willing to}} give him all the power he needed without charging for it., Leland I. Anderson, 21st Century Books, 2002, p. 109, [...] [...] The Colorado Springs laboratory had one of the largest Tesla coils ever built, which Tesla called a [...] "magnifying transmitter" [...] as it was intended to transmit power to a distant receiver. With an input power of 300 kilowatts it could produce potentials of the order of 10 million volts, at frequencies of 50–150kHz, creating huge [...] "lightning bolts" [...] reportedly up to 135 feet long. During experiments, it caused an overload which set fire to the alternator of the Colorado Springs power company, destroying it, and Tesla had to rebuild the alternator.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla went on {{to develop}} a {{wireless}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> that he hoped {{would be capable of}} transmit power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above [...] in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would [...] "break the air stratum down", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a [...] "World Wireless System" [...] that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.|$|E
