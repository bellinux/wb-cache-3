50|$|Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 were, from 1957 to 1966, the {{marketing}} brands that identified motion pictures photographed with Panavision's anamorphic movie camera lenses. The 70 mm film gauge actually used 65 mm wide {{film in the}} camera to capture images in these processes. The <b>projection</b> <b>print,</b> however, was 70 mm film stock. The extra 5 mm on the positive <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> was used to accommodate six-track stereo sound. Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 were shot at 24 frames per second (fps) using anamorphic camera lenses. Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65's anamorphic lenses compressed the image 1.25 times, yielding an extremely wide aspect ratio of 2.76:1 (when a 70 mm <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> was used).|$|E

50|$|In January 1921 a film {{adaptation}} of the novel was released, directed by Albert Capellani, and featuring William P. Carleton as John Hodder, David Torrence as Eldon Parr, and Edith Hallor as Alison Parr.

50|$|Based on {{the same}} dye-transfer {{technique}} first applied to motion pictures in 1916 by Max Handschiegl, Technicolor Process 3 (1928) was developed to eliminate the <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> made of double-cemented prints {{in favor of a}} print created by dye imbibition. The Technicolor camera for Process 3 was identical to that for Process 2, simultaneously photographing two consecutive frames of a black-and-white film behind red and green filters.|$|E

5000|$|Technicolor {{was used}} for the scenes taking place on the Indians' land, while {{black-and-white}} (sepia-toned in the original <b>projection</b> <b>prints)</b> {{was used for}} the scenes set in the white man's world. Roughly three-fourths of the film is in color. [...] Location shooting took place in Canyon de Chelly.|$|R
50|$|Such newer platter-based {{projectors}} {{would eliminate}} the need for cue marks, but the marks are still present on modern-day motion picture <b>projection</b> <b>prints,</b> mainly for older theaters and studio screening rooms still using 2-projector setups, and also to aid the projectionist in identifying reel ends during the splicing together of the reels onto a platter in newer theaters.|$|R
50|$|Most cue marks {{appear as}} either a black circle (if the {{physical}} hole is punched out on the negative {{used to make the}} <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> of the film), or a white circle (if the mark is made by punching a hole or scraping the emulsion on the positive film print). They will also appear as an oval if the print is projected through an anamorphic lens.|$|E
50|$|VistaVision is {{a higher}} resolution, {{widescreen}} variant of the 35mm motion picture film format which was created by engineers at Paramount Pictures in 1954. It uses a horizontal, 8 perforation 35mm image, {{similar to that used}} in 135 film for still photography. Paramount did not use anamorphic processes such as CinemaScope but refined the quality of their flat widescreen system by orienting the 35mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area, which yielded a finer-grained <b>projection</b> <b>print.</b>|$|E
50|$|In bipack color {{photography}} for motion pictures, two {{strips of}} black-and-white 35 mm film, {{running through the}} camera emulsion to emulsion, are used to record two regions of the color spectrum, {{for the purpose of}} ultimately printing the images, in complementary colors, superimposed on one strip of film. The result is a multicolored <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> that reproduces a useful but limited range of color by the subtractive color method. Bipack processes became commercially practical in the early 1910s when Kodak introduced duplitized film print stock, which facilitated making two-color prints.|$|E

40|$|Lithography {{spearheaded the}} {{semiconductor}} industry to nanometer-level feature sizes. The MEMS industry, having started later and being less developed in economy of scale, {{can take advantage of}} the experience of semiconductor pat-terning to make MEMS patterning cheaper and faster. Even though most MEMS devices are still in the micrometer re-gime, there are still many semiconductor lithography techniques to benefit from. Four types of lithography are used for MEMS fabrication: proximity <b>printing,</b> nanoimprint, <b>projection</b> <b>printing,</b> and maskless direct write. <b>Projection</b> <b>printing</b> stands out as the best candidate for MEMS high volume manufacturing. The MEMS technology places more emphasis on DOF than resolution. It often requires fabrication of obliquely oriented devices. It also needs to test many innovative ideas before committing to mass production. Several semiconductor me-thods and some MEMS-specific methods to extend the depth of focus are covered. Multiple-e-beam direct-write systems are discussed with a focus on the suitability to high volume manufacturing in cost and lithographic performance for MEMS...|$|R
50|$|High-end movie {{productions}} {{were often}} produced {{in this film}} gauge in the 1950s and 1960s and many very large screen theaters are still capable of projecting it in the 21st century. It {{is often referred to}} as 65/70, as the camera uses film 65 mm wide, but the <b>projection</b> <b>prints</b> are 70 mm wide. The extra five millimeters of film accommodated the soundtrack, usually a six track magnetic stripe. The most common theater installation would use dual gauge 35/70mm projectors.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{reported}} that John Huston asked cinematographer Oswald Morris to render the color scheme of the film to look [...] "as if Toulouse-Lautrec had directed it". Moulin Rouge was shot in three-strip Technicolor. The Technicolor <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> is created by dye transfer from three primary-color gelatin matrices. This permits great flexibility in controlling the density, contrast, and saturation of the print. Huston asked Technicolor for a subdued palette, rather than the sometimes-gaudy colors [...] "glorious Technicolor" [...] was famous for. Technicolor {{was reported}}ly reluctant to do this.|$|E
5000|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of just over $100,000, the film grossed $25 million in 1970, {{becoming}} the most profitable 3-D film ever released. In budget-relative terms, it remains among the most profitable theatrical movies ever made. Originally self-rated [...] "X," [...] the film was largely re-shot and re-edited to receive an MPAA [...] "R" [...] rating {{to qualify for a}} wide general release. At the same time, the technology of the <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> was enhanced by means of anamorphic 3D to a larger image. This later version appeared in final form in 1971.|$|E
50|$|When {{preparing}} the film for release on VHS and DVD, an anamorphic <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> was used {{rather than the}} original Techniscope negatives. As a result, the home video releases are indeed presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. However, since the film was shot in Techniscope (a method often used by budget filmmakers), the correct exhibition ratio is 2.35:1. The 1.78:1 prints used are vertically compressed, intended to be projected with a special lens {{in order to achieve}} the proper aspect ratio. When viewed on a widescreen TV, the picture settings can be adjusted to the proper ratio.|$|E
50|$|Film editors use {{a version}} {{with a very}} small {{overlaps}} {{at the top and}} bottom of the picture frame to edit film negatives, although units with a longer overlap are preferred for <b>projection</b> release <b>prints.</b>|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron-based EUV {{exposure}} tools {{continue to}} play a crucial roll in the development of EUV lithography. Utilizing a programmable-pupil-fill illuminator, the 0. 3 -NA microexposure tool at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source synchrotron radiation facility provides the highest resolution EUV <b>projection</b> <b>printing</b> capabilities available today. This makes it ideal for the characterization of advanced resist and mask processes. The Berkeley tool also serves as a good benchmarking platform for commercial implementations of 0. 3 -NA EUV microsteppers because its illuminator can be programmed to emulate the coherence conditions of the commercial tools. Here we present the latest resist and tool characterization results from the Berkeley EUV exposure station...|$|R
40|$|Standing waves {{phenomena}} in a resist laid on a reflective substrate give rise, when resist thickness changes, to variations of linewidths {{to be transferred}} by <b>projection</b> <b>printing.</b> We have attempted to display all parameters such as wafer reflectivity, numerical aperture of the lens, spatial coherence of illumination, resist thickness, and their effect on linewidth variations. We demonstrate the possibility to transfer, onto a strongly reflective substrate such as aluminium, lines and spaces 1 μm wide over steps 0. 5 μm high, through a CERCO 5 X TULIPE lens, if the resist layer is ≃ 2 μm thick, and if the illumination is spatially coherent...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of perforations is their [...] "pitch." [...] This is the measurement of the distance between the tops of two sequential perforations. For motion picture 35 mm film and 16 mm film, there are two different pitches—short pitch (camera stocks intended for duplication or printing, and for most intermediate applications) and long pitch (camera stocks intended for direct <b>projection,</b> <b>print</b> stocks, and special intermediate applications). For 35 mm film these are 0.1866" [...] and 0.1870" [...] (4.740 mm and 4.750 mm); for 16 mm film they are 0.2994" [...] and 0.3000" [...] (7.605 mm and 7.620 mm).|$|E
50|$|The Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 {{lenses and}} cameras {{were similar to}} the 1955 version of the Todd-AO 65 mm {{photographic}} process. But the Todd-AO system was shot at 30 frames per second (fps), while Ultra Panavision 70 and MGM Camera 65 used the industry standard of 24 fps, and whilst the original Todd-AO process included {{the use of a}} deeply curved screen similar to that used for Cinerama, Ultra Panavision 70/Camera 65 was intended for projection onto a flat screen. Finally Ultra Panavision 70/Camera 65 compressed the image anamorphically 1.25 times, yielding an aspect ratio of 2.76:1 (when a 70 mm <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> was used) whilst Todd-AO used spherical lenses giving an aspect ratio of 2.20:1.|$|E
50|$|Nitrocellulose {{film base}} {{manufactured}} by Kodak {{can be identified}} {{by the presence of}} the word 'nitrate' in dark letters along one edge; the word only in clear letters on a dark background indicates derivation from a nitrate base original negative or <b>projection</b> <b>print,</b> but the film in hand itself may be a later print or copy negative, made on safety film. Acetate film manufactured during the era when nitrate films were still in use was marked 'Safety' or 'Safety Film' along one edge in dark letters. 8, 9.5, and 16 mm film stocks, intended for amateur and other nontheatrical use, were never manufactured with a nitrate base in the west, but rumors exist of 16 mm nitrate film having been produced in the former Soviet Union and/or China.|$|E
5000|$|In still photography, Kodak's Kodacolor brand {{has been}} {{associated}} with various color negative films (i.e., films that produce negatives for making color prints on paper) since 1942. Kodak claims that Kodacolor was [...] "the world's first true color negative film". More accurately, it was the first color negative film intended for making paper prints: in 1939, Agfa had introduced a 35 mm Agfacolor negative film for use by the German motion picture industry, in which the negative was used only for making positive <b>projection</b> <b>prints</b> on 35 mm film. There have been several varieties of Kodacolor negative film, including Kodacolor-X, Kodacolor VR and Kodacolor Gold.|$|R

2500|$|Technicolor {{continued}} to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer <b>printing</b> process for <b>projection</b> <b>prints</b> until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998. [...] As an archival format, Technicolor prints {{are one of}} the most stable color print processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries. [...] With the introduction of Eastmancolor low-fade positive print (LPP) films, properly stored (at 45°F or 7°C and 25 percent relative humidity) monopack color film is expected to last, with no fading, a comparative amount of time. [...] Improperly stored monopack color film from before 1983 can incur a 30 percent image loss in as little as 25 years.|$|R
5000|$|A Showprint is a {{very high}} quality <b>projection</b> <b>print</b> made for {{screening}} at special events such as gala premieres. It is usually printed directly from the composited camera negative, with each shot individually timed as a duplicate intermediate element would normally be, onto a higher quality of print stock than is usual for mass-production release prints (e.g. Eastman 2393 for showprints, and the standard 2383 for mass-production release prints). As a showprint is at least two generations closer to the composited camera negative than a typical release print, the definition and saturation in the projected image is significantly higher. Showprints have been colloquially referred to as [...] "EKs" [...] (for Eastman Kodak), since [...] "Showprint" [...] is a tradename of DeLuxe, {{although it is not}} a registered trademark.|$|E
50|$|The frames exposed {{behind the}} green filter were printed on one strip of {{black-and-white}} film, and the frames exposed behind the red filter were printed on another strip. After development, each print was toned to a color nearly complementary {{to that of}} the filter: orange-red for the green-filtered images, cyan-green for the red-filtered ones. Unlike tinting, which adds a uniform veil of color to the entire image, toning chemically replaces the black-and-white silver image with transparent coloring matter, so that the highlights remain clear (or nearly so), dark areas are strongly colored, and intermediate tones are colored proportionally. The two prints, made on film stock half the thickness of regular film, were then cemented together back to back to create a <b>projection</b> <b>print.</b> The Toll of the Sea, which debuted on November 26, 1922, used Process 2 and was the first general-release film in Technicolor.|$|E
50|$|Image capture is {{only part}} of the image forming process. Regardless of material, some process must be {{employed}} to render the latent image captured by the camera into a viewable image. With slide film, the developed film is just mounted for <b>projection.</b> <b>Print</b> film requires the developed film negative to be printed onto photographic paper or transparency. Prior to the advent of laser jet and inkjet printers, celluloid photographic negative images had to be mounted in an enlarger which projected the image onto a sheet of light-sensitive paper for a certain length of time (usually measured in seconds or fractions of a second). This sheet then was soaked in a chemical bath of developer (to bring out the image) followed immediately by a stop bath (to neutralize the progression of development and prevent the image from changing further once exposed to normal light). After this, the paper was hung until dry enough to safely handle. This post-production process allowed the photographer to further manipulate the final image beyond what had already been captured on the negative, adjusting the length of time the image was projected by the enlarger and the duration of both chemical baths to change the image's intensity, darkness, clarity, etc. This process is still employed by both amateur and professional photographers, but the advent of digital imagery means that the vast majority of modern photographic work is captured digitally and rendered via printing processes that are no longer dependent on chemical reactions to light. Such digital images may be uploaded to an image server (e.g., a photo-sharing website), viewed on a television, or transferred to a computer or digital photo frame. Every type can then be produced as a hard copy on regular paper or photographic paper via a printer.|$|E
