40|$|INTRODUCTION: Lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTS) affect 18 - 26 % of men aged 40 - 79 years, {{many of whom}} present with a fear of having cancer. Current guidelines {{for the assessment of}} LUTS focus mainly upon benign prostatic hypertrophy. It has been our practice to perform an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and urine cytology during the assessment of males presenting with LUTS to investigate the alternative potentially life-threatening causes for LUTS. We report on the added value of these tests during the assessment of men with LUTS. RESULTS: A total of 263 / 3976 (6. 6 %) patients investigated for LUTS were found to have incidental urological malignancies, urinary tract calculi or abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Abdominal USSs resulted in the incidental diagnosis of four renal carcinomas (0. 1 %), 45 AAAs (incidence = 1. 1 %) and 44 urinary tract calculi (1. 1 %). Urine cytology testing and bladder USSs helped diagnose 17 new bladder cancers (0. 4 %), five of which did not present with haematuria. Patients found to have an elevated age-specific PSA had a 23. 6 % chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer (3. 8 %). CONCLUSION: The addition of abdominal ultrasound scanning, urine cytology and PSA testing as part of an LUTS assessment protocol can help to diagnose significant, potentially life-threatening conditions in up to 6. 6 % of patients.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} ability of four {{commonly}} used PCR techniques to demonstrate clonal IgH rearrangements in multiple myeloma. METHODS: Bone marrow samples (containing a minimum of 10 % plasma cells) were obtained from 127 patients with confirmed multiple myeloma. Framework 3 (Fr 3) PCR was performed in all cases and the Framework 1 (Fr 1 f) PCR, which utilises six VH family specific primers, in 98 cases. In addition, 44 cases were assessed by Fr 3, Fr 1 f, Framework 2 (Fr 2) and Framework 1 consensus (Fr 1 con) PCR techniques. JH primer selection was also assessed such that each PCR strategy was performed twice {{in each of the}} 44 cases, using the JH consensus primer (JH con) alone and then repeated with an equimolar mixture of JH con, JH 3 and JH 6 (JH mix). RESULTS: Clonal rearrangements were demonstrated in 71 (56 %) of 127 cases with the Fr 3 PCR and in 52 (53 %) of 98 with the Fr 1 f PCR. However, by using both techniques it was possible to demonstrate clonal IgH rearrangements in 92 (75 %) of 122 cases. Forty four cases were assessed by all four PCR techniques; in these cases the Fr 3 and Fr 1 f PCRs demonstrated clonal rearrangements in 26 (59 %) cases with a combined yield of 34 (77 %). The Fr 2 and Fr 1 con PCR techniques had inferior <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>rates,</b> demonstrating clonal rearrangements in 21 (48 %) of 44 cases and a combined yield of 28 (63 %). The Fr 2 PCR did, however, demonstrate a clonal rearrangement in one case negative by both Fr 3 and Fr 1 f. Two additional rearrangements were demonstrated by using JH mix; one became positive by Fr 3, Fr 1 f and Fr 2 and the other positive by Fr 1 f, Fr 1 con and Fr 2.

40|$|Introduction Survival in {{colorectal}} cancer patients is dependant {{on the stage}} of the cancer at diagnosis. Referral via an appropriate pathway to a specialist service is vital to the early detection of {{colorectal cancer}} but there is neither a standard referral system nor a nationally agreed referral pathway in the UK. Though studies have compared individual components of different models of health care in colorectal cancer, this is the first study comparing two models in their entirety. Hypothesis The distinct model of service delivery in Trust A picks up a higher percentage of early colorectal cancers than the model of service delivery in Trust B. Method The study compares colorectal cancers diagnosed from two adjacent Trusts in Wales during a three year period. The samples obtained after rigid exclusions correlate the two models of health care with the stage of cancer at diagnosis. Results Trust A has a higher emergency and urgent workload. The overall pick up of early cancers is similar in both Trusts. However, there is a higher <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>rate</b> of early colorectal cancer in Trust A, when GPs accessed the specialist service using an urgent referral through the elective route. Trust A had lower overall waiting times for the first clinic appointment but there was no difference for urgent cases between the two Trusts.

Conclusion There appears to be {{no significant difference in the}} overall pick-up rate of modified Dukes’ A colorectal cancers between the two models of health care delivery.

Methods: We collated clinical data on all children aged under 14 years attending the three refugee specific clinics seeing children in NSW in 2005. We compared these {{data to the}} number of refugee children settling in NSW in 2005. Results: NSW received 1, 557 refugee children (< 14 years) in 2005. Around one in five (n= 331) was seen in a refugee specific clinic. Most were asymptomatic. Of those tested, 25 % had anaemia, 27 % were serology positive for schistosomiasis, 16 % had evidence of current or recent malaria, 25 % were tuberculin skin test positive, 69 % were hepatitis B non-immune and 20 % had low vitamin D levels. Most children needed catch up immunisation. Other problems included chronic health, developmental and behavioural problems. Screening tests varied across sites. Follow up was problematic for most.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Bethesda System of {{reporting}} cervico-vaginal smears, the equivocal epithelial cell abnormalities have been categorised as "atypical squamous and glandular cells of undetermined significance" (ASCUS and AGUS).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} water pick-up rate and {{capacity}} of an ink may have a profound affect on the press performance of an ink. As the water content of ink changes so do the Theological characteristics of the ink and this effects ink performance attributes such as ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of fountain solution and ink as used in the printing of newspapers, in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the fountain solution and ink interaction on ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different ink and fountain solution combinations. One set was a specific black news ink and fountain solution combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral Fountain Solution, used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>rates</b> have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine ink and fountain solution combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. Rub resistance was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline fountain solution than the neutral solution. The least was <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> with the acid fountain solution. The more fountain solution the inks <b>picked</b> <b>up,</b> the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off.

Controls were 110 children with mental retardation of unknown aetiology with normal G banded karyotype and no detectable submicroscopic subtelomeric abnormalities. RESULTS: Prenatal onset of growth retardation was found in 37 % compared to 9 % of the controls (p 30 %) among subtelomeric deletion cases were microcephaly, short stature, hypertelorism, nasal and ear anomalies, hand anomalies, and cryptorchidism. Two or more facial dysmorphic features were observed in 83 % of the subtelomere patients. None of these features was significantly different from the controls. Using the results, a five item checklist was developed which allowed exclusion from further testing in 20 % of the mentally retarded children (95 % CI 13 - 28 %) in our study without missing any subtelomere cases. As our control group was selected for the "chromosomal phenotype", the specificity of the checklist is likely to be higher in an unselected group of mentally retarded subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that good indicators for subtelomeric defects are prenatal onset of growth retardation and a positive family history for mental retardation. These clinical criteria, in addition to features suggestive of a chromosomal phenotype, resulted {{in the development of a}} five item checklist which will improve the diagnostic <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>rate</b> of subtelomeric defects among mentally retarded subjects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:––The major {{efficiency}} {{loss of a}} boiler {{is caused by the}} hot stack gases discharging to the atmosphere which is polluting the atmosphere and on other side Pollution Control Board is forcing the norms of Pollution levels in atmosphere. One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. Typically, on a high pressure water tube boiler, the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4 %, depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler, the improvement is 2 to 3. 5 %, depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. A feedwater line, which serves the boiler, is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are some bank of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another bank of tubes in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler, and to find how much feed water temperature raises both from subcritical and Supercritical operating conditions. An investigation is conducted on the effect of performance of the boiler by incorporating the additional bank of tubes in the space below the lower bank of tubes. The main idea is to extract maximum amount of heat from the flue gases and increase the heat <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>rate</b> of the feed water outlet into the boiler. By assuming the additional bank of tubes, various heat transfer calculations are done and the reduction in the flue gas outlet temperature and increase in the feedwater outlet temperature are found out. Finally a comparison o...|$|E
