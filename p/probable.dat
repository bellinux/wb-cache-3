5|$|Based on ancestral {{reconstruction}} studies, {{the earliest}} (basal) {{members of the}} Sclerodermatineae originated in the late Cretaceous (145–66Ma). The major genera diversified near the mid Cenozoic (66–0Ma). Asia and North America are the most <b>probable</b> ancestral areas for all Sclerodermatineae, and Pinaceae and angiosperms (primarily rosids) are the most <b>probable</b> ancestral hosts.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Finucane was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} squadron leader in No. 602 Squadron. Within six months, he was credited a further six individual victories bringing his tally to 28. Four more were damaged, four were shared destroyed and two credited as individual <b>probable</b> victories and one shared <b>probable.</b> In June 1942, he became the RAF's youngest wing commander in its history. Finucane was appointed to lead the Hornchurch Wing.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of the 19 November 1940, Cunningham claimed his first victory. By the time the Blitz had ended in June 1941, he had {{destroyed}} 13 enemy aircraft and claimed three as <b>probable</b> victories and two damaged. After a prolonged rest period, he was promoted to wing commander in 1942. He was also appointed to command No. 85 Squadron RAF, by which time his tally had reached 16 enemy aircraft destroyed. In 1943 and early 1944 he added a further four victories, one <b>probable</b> and one damaged. Cunningham's combat career ended with 20 aerial victories, three <b>probable</b> and six damaged. He spent the remainder of the conflict in various staff officer positions. By {{the end of the war}} in Europe in May 1945 he had attained the rank of group captain.|$|E
5|$|The CAB {{issued the}} {{following}} <b>Probable</b> Cause statement:The Board determines the <b>probable</b> {{cause of this}} accident {{was the lack of}} command coordination and decision, lack of judgment, and lack of knowledge of the equipment resulting in loss of power in three engines creating an emergency situation which the crew could not handle.|$|E
5|$|A {{colder climate}} {{introduced}} cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the San Bernardino Mountains. A <b>probable</b> southward {{shift of the}} storm belts led to windier weather. According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E

5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the <b>probable</b> cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to {{determine}} which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the pilots {{who had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be the <b>probable</b> cause of the accident.|$|E

5|$|An {{even greater}} Swedish force of 5000 {{soldiers}} (of which 3000 were cavalry) under Lars Kagg, Gustaf Horn and Harald Stake laid siege to Frederikshald in January 1660.

5|$|As a diplodocid, it is <b>probable</b> that Dinheirosaurus {{possessed a}} whip-tail. If it did, {{it is likely}} that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with {{supersonic}} speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E

5|$|Because fleas carry plague, {{they have}} seen service as a {{biological}} weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The bubonic and septicaemic plagues are the most <b>probable</b> form of the plague that would spread {{as a result of}} a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{from the}} Crusader period {{indicate}} that Ashdod {{belonged to the}} lordship of Ramla, and it appears <b>probable</b> that in 1169 the old Arab sea fort was given by Hugh, lord of Ramla, to his knight Nicolas de Beroard. From this period the fort is known as Castellum Beroart.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within a few minutes. It is <b>probable</b> that an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the total}} only five Argentine {{aircraft}} {{might have been}} shot down by Rapier, and, as originally noted by Ethell and Price, {{only one of these}} was certain, with two <b>probables</b> and two possibles. Similar discrepancies arose over other weapons systems, notably Blowpipe (one confirmed kill as against nine confirmed and two <b>probables</b> in the White Paper) and Sea Cat (zero to one against eight confirmed and two <b>probables</b> in the White Paper). ... This confirmation that MoD had exaggerated, however unwittingly, the capabilities of Rapier was deemed to be political dynamite. It was observed that if this assessment became publicly known it 'could have a serious adverse effects on sales' prospects for Rapier, which is the staple revenue-earner for BAe's Dynamic Group.|$|R

5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is <b>probable</b> that Olaf Tryggvason was indeed sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more <b>probable</b> that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did indeed betray Olaf.|$|E
