40|$|Upgrading the {{database}} of CYBER JAPAN has been strategically promoted because the "Basic Act on Promotion of Utilization of Geographical Information", was enacted in May 2007. In particular, {{there is a}} high demand for road information that comprises a framework in this database. Therefore, road inventory mapping work has to be accurate and eliminate variation caused by individual human operators. Further, the large number of <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> that are periodically maintained and possibly changed require an efficient method for updating spatial data. Currently, we apply manual photogrammetry drawing <b>for</b> mapping <b>traffic</b> <b>markings.</b> However, this method is not sufficiently efficient in terms of the required productivity, and data variation can arise from individual operators. In contrast, Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) and high-density Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) scanners are rapidly gaining popularity. The aim in this study is to build an efficient method <b>for</b> automatically drawing <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> using MMS LIDAR data. The key idea in this method is extracting lines using a Hough transform strategically focused on changes in local reflection intensity along scan lines. However, also note that this method processes every traffic marking. In this paper, we discuss a highly accurate and non-human-operator-dependent method that applies the following steps: (1) Binarizing LIDAR points by intensity and extracting higher intensity points; (2) Generating a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) from higher intensity points; (3) Deleting arcs by length and generating outline polygons on the TIN; (4) Generating buffers from the outline polygons; (5) Extracting points from the buffers using the original LIDAR points; (6) Extracting local-intensity-changing points along scan lines using the extracted points; (7) Extracting lines from intensity-changing points through a Hough transform; and (8) Connecting lines to generate automated traffic marking mapping data...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of autonomous cars is accelerating on the integration of highly advanced artificial intelligence, which increases demand for a digital map with high accuracy. In particular, <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> are required to be precisely digitized since automatic driving utilizes them for position detection. To draw <b>traffic</b> <b>markings,</b> we benefit from Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) equipped with high-density Laser imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanners, which produces large amount of data efficiently with XYZ coordination along with reflectance intensity. Digitizing this data, on the other hand, conventionally has been dependent on human operation, which thus suffers from human errors, subjectivity errors, and low reproductivity. We have tackled this problem by means of automatic extraction of traffic marking, which partially accomplished to draw several <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> (G. Takahashi et al., 2014). The key idea of the method was extracting lines using the Hough transform strategically focused on changes in local reflection intensity along scan lines. However, it failed to extract <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> properly in a densely marked area, especially when local changing points are close each other. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional gradient-based detection method where local changing points are labelled with plus or minus group. Given that each label corresponds to the boundary between <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> and background, we can identify <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> explicitly, meaning <b>traffic</b> lines are differentiated correctly by the proposed method. As such, our automated method, a highly accurate and non-human-operator-dependent method using bidirectional gradient-based algorithm, can successfully extract traffic lines composed of complex shapes such as a cross walk, resulting in minimizing cost and obtaining highly accurate results...|$|R
5000|$|Tetro {{sought to}} portray himself {{not as an}} art forger, but as an [...] "emulator" [...] who copied works, but {{did not intend to}} sell them as originals. He blamed art dealers for the fraud and said they {{commissioned}} him to create copies of paintings. His first trial ended in mistrial when jurors were deadlocked after 17 hours of deliberating, giving up after the third ballot. In order to convict, jurors had to be convinced of Tetro's intent to commit fraud. The district attorney decided to retry the case. With no more cash or assets to pay for a defense, in February 1993, Tetro pleaded nolo contendere to six counts of forgery, one count of conspiracy and one count of attempted theft. Part of his sentence included 200 hours of community service in which he was ordered to paint a mural on a public building. He was also sentenced to six months in a work release program, where he <b>painted</b> prototypes <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> safety murals, and to five years' probation.

40|$|The {{research}} work performed in this PhD initially focussed {{on the technical}} development of an advanced TL-spectroscopy setup, suitable for the investigation of persistent luminescent phosphors. It {{soon became clear that}} this setup, called λT-TL, is also perfectly suited for investigating the temperature dependency of the luminescence properties of regular photoluminescent materials. Although not yet entirely completed, the λT-TL setup has already proven its usefulness in thermal quenching (TQ) studies of regular phosphors and temperature and wavelength dependent charging, afterglow and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements on persistent luminescent phosphors. Based on the unique capabilities of this setup, a feasibility study for the use of persistent luminescent materials in <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> was performed.

40|$|Abstract—This article {{proposes a}} method of {{parameters}} estimation by analyzing a video in which a traffic accident is recorded. At {{the scene of an}} accident, vehicle properties such as position and velocity are important for the investigators, but they are not easy to be obtained for the difficulty of telling the state of a surveillance camera. Here a method is presented by taking good advantages of road <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> and the remote image from Google earth, with which the inverse projective transformed image from surveillance traffic video is matched in order to gain the vehicle properties. As a result, compared with an official report, parameters of a traffic accident mentioned are accurately estimated by image and video processing. And error analysis has also been concerned. At the conclusion, necessary requirements are discussed for common applications...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{function}} of delineation {{is to provide}} the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle {{in a variety of}} situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more durable pavement marking lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs (see Chapter 1140). These devices use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. It is important to maintain an adequate level of retroreflectivity <b>for</b> both <b>traffic</b> signs and <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> <b>for</b> motorists during hours of darkness and during adverse weather conditions. Delineation is a required safety item of work and is addressed on all projects. A decision to omit delineation work can only be justified if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and an evaluation of accident rates clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the MUTCD as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with WSDOT policy and region preference. These policies and preferences address both the type of markings and the material selection...|$|R
