5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable <b>private</b> <b>law</b> remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a <b>private</b> <b>law</b> claim in contract or tort law.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his <b>private</b> <b>law</b> practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Private</b> {{international}} <b>law</b> {{presents a}} dilemma for {{legal and political}} philosophy. Legal and political philosophers have ignored <b>private</b> international <b>law,</b> {{with only a few}} scattered attempts to evaluate its claims. <b>Private</b> international <b>law</b> offers a powerful set of counterexamples that put into serious doubt attempts to link law’s authority only or primarily to relationships between states and citizens. No society, state, or other practice-mediated relationship can serve as grounds for the authority of <b>private</b> international <b>law</b> to persons to whom it applies but who are outside of such relationships. <b>Private</b> international <b>law</b> affects the normative situations of persons entirely outside these relationships. This article examines these issues from the standpoint of contractualist moral and political philosophy. How can <b>private</b> international <b>law</b> be justified from a moral point of view? The aim {{of this article is to}} show that the moral justification of <b>private</b> international <b>law,</b> in particular the law on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, requires an evaluation of the coercive qualities of <b>private</b> international <b>law.</b> Suitably constructed moral principles, which permit reasonable restrictions on liberty, are developed...|$|R

5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
