25|$|During {{this period}} the flourishing of Dutch {{painters}} became {{emblematic of the}} Golden Age in Dutch culture. At the time, this was just an industry like many others, with offshoots like chemical pigment making. Its rise illustrates the general boom conditions in the country, like the horticultural developments that laid {{the basis for the}} sophisticated tulip farming sector (which had its own speculative bubble, known as the tulip mania). By 1636 the tulip bulb became the fourth leading export product of the Netherlands – after gin, herring and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight, to the consternation of Calvinists who abhorred this artificial frenzy that denied the virtues of moderation, discretion and genuine work.|$|E
25|$|There are {{eighteen}} professional county clubs, seventeen {{of them in}} England and one in Wales. Each {{summer the}} county clubs compete in the first class County Championship, which consists of two leagues of nine teams and in which matches are played over four days. The same teams also play the one day National League, a one-day knock out competition called the Friends Provident Trophy, and the short-form Twenty20 Cup. English cricket grounds include Lord's, The Oval, Headingley, Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. Cardiff's Sophia Gardens ground has also become increasingly popular in recent years. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. It {{is by no means}} equal to football in finance, attendance or coverage, but it has a high profile nonetheless. It is probably the second most widely covered sport in England and third most widely covered sport in Wales and the fortunes of the England team are closely followed by many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> attend a live game.|$|E

500|$|Although The Viceroy of Ouidah {{received}} good reviews, it did {{not sell}} well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer Chatwin said he [...] "decided to write something about <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> went out." [...] His next book, On the Black Hill (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all {{of their lives in}} a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, The Viceroy of Ouidah, a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Catherine {{established}} rituals such as baptism of infants, {{blessing of}} couples and communion of young people. They simply consist of an [...] "elevation of thought" [...] {{that take place}} after the services in a consulting room of the temple. These rituals have no particular meaning in the religion and are not considered sacraments; they are performed only {{at the request of}} followers, including young people, who want to provide a religious dimension to the important moments of their lives. Funerals are also performed {{at the request of the}} concerned person, unless the family asks for rituals of another religion. The procession always takes place at the cemetery or the funeral home, and the deceased person is never brought to the temple. Desservants read the [...] "Ten Principles of the Father", then an Antoinist text on reincarnation, to help the soul to come off the body to be reincarnated. Sociologists note that many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> attend the Antoinist services asked for funeral rites of that religion.|$|E
500|$|Piller {{originally}} envisioned only casting actors {{between the}} ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs. He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as [...] "young, angry <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> lived old enough {{to have the kind of}} experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have". He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were [...] "much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations" [...] through the actors' performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached on the grounds that the [...] "older actors gave more polished performances". He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers' concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx's Donna Dickens.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{status of}} Abkhazia as a [...] "treaty republic" [...] was never {{clarified}} during its existence, and historian Arsène Saparov {{has suggested that}} even officials at the time {{did not know what}} the phrase meant. However it had symbolic meaning to the Abkhaz <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> forgot that they had, at least in theory, an independent state. With the advent of glasnost and perestroika in the 1980s, calls for Abkhazia to restore its status began; an assembly at Lykhny in 1989 issued a call to the Soviet authorities to make Abkhazia a full union republic, claiming the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent for this move. When Abkhazia declared independence in 1990, it called for the restoration of the 1925 constitution; as it called for Abkhazia and Georgia to unite, this allowed for the possibility of a future union between the two states. The restoration of the 1925 constitution would serve as a pretext for the 1992–1993 war, and the ensuing dispute over the status of Abkhazia, which has led to Abkhazia being de facto independent of Georgia since the outbreak of the war in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{regarded}} {{being able}} to draw the human being as {{the single most important}} attainment of any artist. When asked why none of the people in his pictures are ever painted smiling, he said that he could not draw smiles well. Unlike many primarily landscape artists, he could paint both the human form and the human face, {{as can be seen in}} his self-portrait work. He regarded abstract painters as <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> learnt to draw. Smart mostly painted with oil, acrylic and watercolours, generally using the bold primary colours – yellow, blue and red – and dark greys for his skies. This created an unusual effect in his works as the foregrounds of his paintings are fully lit despite the dark sky. His process of painting was a long and arduous one, resulting in barely a dozen finished canvases a year.

[...] Moreover, he said in preparing for the rally he tried for a year to get a military flyover or someone in a military uniform to present the flag and could not; at 9:59 am, one minute before the rally's scheduled start time, a flock of geese flew directly over the rally. Beck called it a miracle. He also said he received a call from the Smithsonian saying they wanted [...] "items from the event preserved for the Smithsonian."

2500|$|However, the {{banning of}} the kirpan was not {{proportionate}} to the objective. [...] It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations. [...] The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school. [...] The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely. [...] The thief would have to seize the claimant and look under the claimant's clothing. [...] Additionally, {{there was little to}} no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools. [...] Although cases involving airline security have resulted in {{the banning of}} kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> know each other. [...] There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent. [...] As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. [...] Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. [...] The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. [...] The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism. [...] If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.|$|E
