40|$|Summarry The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} Protective sexological treatment and with topic related issues, discusses {{in detail the}} anchoring of the Institute of protective treatment in the legislation of the Czech Republic (the substantive and <b>procedural</b> <b>page),</b> which is a better outline of the whole problem with the use and knowledge of forensic disciplines such as forensic psychiatry, forensic sexology and psychology. Protective treatment is an institute of criminal law, one {{of the types of}} protective measures, forms irreplaceable part of the czech system of criminal sanctions. Purpose of storing and exercise protective treatment is protection of society from dangerous offenders, who have committet acts harmful to society on the basis of mental disorder, sexual deviance, reliance on alcohol or ain addictive substances, and therapeutic effects on the personality of the offender in the sense minimization their dangerousness for the future. Whereas the protective treatment belongs to a separate category of criminal penalties,which are protective measures, beginning of this thesis is devoted to defining the concept and purpose of protective measures, are listed here essential principles for storing them in the context of protective treatment, compared sentences and protective measures, it is pointed out their [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This study revisits {{the area}} of {{reliance}} on budget to evaluate employee performance. It contributes in several ways. First, it updates this traditional research area making it more relevant to the current debate {{on the use of}} financial vis-à-vis nonfinancial measures in multidimensional performance measurement systems. Second, it examines the relationship between reliance on budget and budgetary participation {{in a manner that is}} different from that used by prior studies. Instead of treating budgetary participation as a moderating variable, the study examines it as a mediating variable. Specifically, the study hypothesizes that reliance on budget as performance measures affects the extent of employee budgetary participation. Third, it incorporates the recent interest by management accounting researchers in organizational fairness into this research area. It hypothesizes that budgetary participation affects the extent of employees' perceptions of procedural fairness, which, in turn, influences employee job satisfaction and performance. The structural equation modeling results based on a sample of 152 managers indicate that the use of budget targets for performance evaluation is positively associated with employee job satisfaction and performance. However, much of these effects are indirect via (1) budgetary participation and (2) <b>procedural</b> fairness. 35 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The primary {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Differentiation based off catheter ablation modalities was not considered due to the limited scope of the current field. Studies that employed alcohol septal ablation for the treatment of AF in HCM patients were excluded as were abstracts, case reports, conference presentations, editorials, reviews, and expert opinions Methods: Electronic searches were performed in six databases from their inception until January 2014. Relevant studies regarding catheter ablation for AF in HCM populations were identified. Data was extracted and analyzed according to pre-defined clinical endpoints Results: A review was undertaken of eight studies in which 241 HCM patients underwent catheter ablation for AF. Overall AF-free survival at last follow-up ranged from 47 to 77 % (64 – 67 %). Sinus rhythm was maintained at last follow-up in 47 – 82 % (median 64 – 67 %). AF recurrence ranged from 0 to 66 % (median 35 – 40 %). Conclusion: A review of the current evidence suggests that catheter ablation of AF in HCM patients is effective with suitable efficacy and is justified in select patients. Future adequately powered randomized studies should be undertaken aimed at addressing long-term efficacy and complications associated with <b>procedural</b> outcomes. 10 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of clinically apparent stroke in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) exceeds {{that of any}} other procedure performed by interventional cardiologists and, in the index admission, occurs more than twice as frequently with TAVI than with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, this represents only a small component of the vast burden of neurological injury that occurs during TAVI, with recent evidence suggesting that many strokes are clinically silent or only subtly apparent. Additionally, insult may manifest as slight neurocognitive dysfunction rather than overt neurological deficits. Characterisation of the incidence and underlying aetiology of these neurological events may lead to identification of currently unrecognised neuroprotective strategies. Methods: The Silent and Apparent Neurological Injury in TAVI (SANITY) Study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study comparing the {{incidence of}} neurological injury after TAVI versus SAVR. It introduces an intensive, standardised, formal neurologic and neurocognitive disease assessment for all aortic valve recipients, regardless of intervention (SAVR, TAVI), valve-type (bioprosthetic, Edwards SAPIEN-XT) or access route (sternotomy, transfemoral, transapical or transaortic). Comprehensive monitoring of neurological insult will also be recorded to more fully define and compare the neurological burden of the procedures and identify targets for harm minimisation strategies. Discussion: The SANITY study undertakes the most rigorous assessment of neurological injury reported in the literature to date. It attempts to accurately characterise the insult and sustained injury associated with both TAVI and SAVR in an attempt to advance understanding of this complication and associations thus allowing for improved patient selection and <b>procedural</b> modification. 10 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
40|$|Yale Kamisar has {{explained}} how {{events that occurred}} about fifty years ago {{led to the creation}} of a stand-alone criminal procedure course and, a few years later, led to the division of that stand-alone course into two courses. The second of those courses came to be called, almost from the outset, the 2 ̆ 2 Jail-to-Bail 2 ̆ 2 course. My focus today is on why that course was created and how it was shaped. Modern Criminal Procedure, as Yale has noted, was the first coursebook designed for a stand-alone course in criminal procedure. Modern was published in 1966. A year earlier, the first version of Modern was published under a different title, Basic Criminal Procedure. Basic, a 350 -page paperback, was presented as a replacement for the criminal procedure portion of the typical criminal law coursebook. The first-year Criminal Law course covered both substantive criminal law and criminal procedure in a four-credit course. While the titles of the major coursebooks gave equal billing to the substantive and <b>procedural</b> sides, the <b>page</b> allocation heavily favored the substantive criminal law. Livingston Hall was a coauthor of one of the major criminal law casebooks, Hall and Glueck 2 ̆ 7 s Criminal Law and Its Enforcement. He agreed with Yale that a different approach was needed for the coverage of the criminal procedure portion of the Criminal Law course, and signed on as a co-author of the materials that Yale had already prepared. Hall and Kamisar 2 ̆ 7 s Basic Criminal Procedure hopefully would be used by instructors assigning the Hall and Glueck coursebook. It could also be combined with various other coursebooks that followed the traditional approach to the presentation of the criminal procedure portion of the Criminal Law course...|$|R
