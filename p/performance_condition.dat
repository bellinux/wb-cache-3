40|$|Measurement {{issues related}} to the {{assessment}} of Executive Functioning (EF) and social competence were examined with Kindergarten students (N = 62) and their teachers. Measures of constructs, such as EF and social competence, exist along a continuum of <b>performance</b> <b>conditions,</b> ranging from highly maximal, well-defined tasks with clear performance expectations to more typical, ill-defined tasks with ambiguous performance expectations. It is hypothesized that measures with maximal or typical <b>performance</b> <b>conditions</b> cannot be used interchangeably because the results gleaned from the measures generalize to different situations and different behaviors. This study employed observed variable path analyses to examine the model fit between measures of EF and social competence that present <b>performance</b> <b>conditions</b> that range from maximal to typical. The results indicate that <b>performance</b> <b>conditions</b> of measures significantly alter the relations between measures and the results gleaned from the opposing <b>performance</b> <b>conditions</b> predict different behaviors in different contexts. The results also suggest that more maximal measures of EF do not translate to the social world...|$|R

In the United States, these plans were used heavily since Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) passed, which permitted deductions for certain performance-based compensation without limitation. Upcoming changes in the Securities and Exchange Commission's executive compensation policies, however, may change this practice. LTIPs are also used in the United Kingdom.In Switzerland, LTIPs have seen a strong increase in use since the passing of the Swiss executive pay referendum, 2013.

5000|$|Subsea Internet of Things (SIoT) is {{a network}} of smart, {{wireless}} sensors and smart devices configured to provide actionable operational intelligence such as <b>performance,</b> <b>condition</b> and diagnostic information. It is coined from the term The Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike IoT, SIot focuses on subsea communication through {{the water and the}} water-air boundary. SIoT systems are based around smart, wireless devices incorporating Seatooth radio and Seatooth Hybrid technologies. SIoT systems incorporate standard sensors including temperature, pressure, flow, vibration, corrosion and video. Processed information is shared among nearby wireless sensor nodes. SIoT systems are used for environmental monitoring, Oil & Gas production control and optimisation and subsea asset integrity management. Some of the features of IoT's share similar characteristics to Cloud Computing. There is also a recent increase of interest looking at the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing. Subsea Cloud Computing is an architecture design to provide an efficient means of SIoT systems to manage large data sets. It is an adaption of Cloud Computing frameworks {{to meet the needs of}} the underwater environment. Similarly to Fog computing or Edge computing critical focus remains at the edge. Algorithms are used to interrogate data set for information which is used to optimise production.|$|E

The result is high effort when self-relevant demands are difficult or individuals try to do their best in active coping.

Of further interest was how performance on this type of task may relate to scores obtained on standard imagery use and vividness measures. Thirty-two music students were recruited from the Royal College of Music (RCM). They first completed two imagery use and vividness measures, followed by two live and two mental performances of a two-minute extract of their choice. Following the generation of timing profiles for each performance, correlations were calculated within and between the two performance conditions. These were normalized by conversion to Z-scores and then compared with results obtained from the imagery use and vividness measures. While all participants achieved a significant correlation between the timing profiles from the live <b>performance</b> <b>condition,</b> only 17 did so within the mental <b>performance</b> <b>condition.</b> When comparing the timing profiles between the two conditions, 22 obtained significant correlations.

The study also investigated the interplay between comments and ratings in conditions of high versus low performance. A total of 91 undergraduate students (female = 55) from a large metropolitan Canadian University participated in the study. Participants were asked to evaluate the performance of an employee based on a performance information package. They also completed a single online measure for MUM sugarcoating, task self efficacy and self monitoring. Based {{on the results of}} analysis, it was found that there is a significant positive relationship between the valence of ratings and that of comments. It was also found that the relationship between the valence of ratings and comments was stronger in the high <b>performance</b> <b>condition</b> that the low <b>performance</b> <b>condition.</b> Regression analyses demonstrated that individuals in the low <b>performance</b> <b>condition</b> did not sugarcoat their comments significantly more than their peers in the high <b>performance</b> <b>condition.</b> Finally, regression analyses demonstrated that self-monitoring did not significantly impact the magnitude {{of the relationship between the}} performance level and the amount of sugarcoating.
