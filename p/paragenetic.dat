40|$|An unusually diverse {{array of}} 25 {{secondary}} Te oxysalt minerals has been documented from Otto Mountain, California, and 18 of these from the Bird Nest drift sublocality. A <b>paragenetic</b> sequence for these minerals is proposed, using observed overgrowth relationships plus spatial association data and data from other localities. Apart from Te and O, the components Pb, Cu and H are essential {{in the majority of}} the minerals. The atomic Cu/Te ratio decreases through the <b>paragenetic</b> sequence. This, and the occurrence of minerals with additional components such as Cl^–, CO_ 3 ^(2 –), SO_ 4 ^(2 –) and Fe^(3 +) at an intermediate stage, suggests nonmonotonic evolution of the parent fluids, reflecting differing access to or spatial distribution of various components. For the minerals with known crystal structures, two alternative 'structural units' were identified, one consisting only of the Te^(4 +) or Te^(6 +) oxyanion, while the other also included small, strongly-bound cations such as Cu^(2 +). The degree of polymerization for the Te oxyanion correlated with the <b>paragenetic</b> sequence: the monomeric tellurate anions of early minerals were replaced progressively by dimers, chains and sheet structures, which may relate to a decreasing abundance of the 'network modifying' Cu^(2 +) cation, analogous to Bowen's discontinuous reaction series in igneous rock-forming silicates. No relationship was seen between <b>paragenetic</b> order and the larger type of structural unit, or structural complexity as defined by information content. This contrasts with results in the literature for evaporite sulfates and pegmatite phosphates.

40|$|The Deer Lake subbasin {{is one of}} two northeast-trending, mainly Carboniferous, subbasins {{in western}} Newfoundland. Within the subbasin the Deer Lake Group and Howley Formation consist entirely of non-marine sediments {{deposited}} in a half-graben which was extensively faulted along its eastern side. Petrographic investigation of nine drill cores has shown that coarse grained alluvial fan and fluviatile sediments from the North Brook, Humber Falls, and Howley Formations, and high-grade uranium-mineralized sandstone boulder samples found in Pleistocene tills above the northern body of the Humber Falls Formation, have essentially the same detrital and diagenetic mineral assemblage and display the same <b>paragenetic</b> sequence. The dominantly lacustrine siliciclastic and carbonate sediment samples from the Rocky Brook Formation have a mineral assemblage and <b>paragenetic</b> sequence different from the coarser grained formations. Basic mineralogic differences are the absence of diagenetic kaolinite and illite-montmorillonite, and the presence of "analcime" in the Rocky Brook Formation sediments. The <b>paragenetic</b> sequence for the North Brook, Humber Falls, and Howley Formations and the mineralized samples reflects an acidic to alkaline geochemical environment.

40|$|The Grouse Creek deposit {{is located}} within a {{northwest}} trending third order basin, {{which in turn}} is located within a northeast trending second order basin, that occurs within the Custer graben, a northeast trending first order basin. The deposit is hosted by pyroclastics, carbonaceous and tuffaceous lacustrine sediments, and rhyolites belonging to the Tertiary Challis volcanics. The oldest rock unit observed in the Grouse Creek deposit is a propylitically altered quartz latite pyroclastic, unit Tpp, which is correlative with the tuff of Eightmile Creek. This unit was erupted approximately 48 m. y. ago with initial subsidence of the Custer Graben. The deposition of unit Tpp was followed by a period of erosion and an eruption of a rhyolitic massive pyroclastic, unit Tp. This massive pyroclastic may consist of several relatively indistinct units possibly identifiable only by horizontal silicified zones contained within. Near the end of or soon after the massive pyroclastic eruption and deposition, second and third order basins were formed. Second order basins trend northeast while third order basins trend northwest. Rhyolite flow domes, Trh and Tr, intruded the third order basin margins approximately 45. 8 ± 2. 3 m. y. ago. Shortly after the intrusion of rhyolite Trh, a vent breccia or hydrothermal explosion breccia, Tp(l), was erupted at or near the surface. Portions of unit Tp (1) was then epiclastically reworked within the third order basin 2 ̆ 2 followed by the progressive in-filling of the third order basin with a coarsening upward sequence of carbonaceous black shales, Ts(b), volcaniclastic siltstones and sandstones, Ts, and finally a coarse-grained pyroclastic, Tp(u). During and after the deposition of the upper pyroclastic unit, Tp(u), recurrent movement along the N 50 - 85 E trending set of faults occurred with fine-grained rhyolite dike emplacement. The youngest rock unit in the study area is a rhyolite quartz porphyry dike, and represents the last episode of intrusive activity in the Grouse Creek deposit area. The Grouse Creek deposit contains proven plus probable mineable reserves of 5, 420, 000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0. 042 opt gold and 1. 97 opt silver for a total of 227, 658 ounces of gold and 10, 689, 108 ounces of silver. Ore horizons are relatively flat-lying tabular zones which occur in favorable stratigraphic horizons, with thicker and/or higher grade zones occurring in and near the dominant N 50 - 85 E striking feeding structures. Gold in the Grouse Creek deposit {{is in the form of}} electrum, which is very young in the <b>paragenetic</b> sequence, and as inclusions within pyrite. Silver minerals in the Grouse Creek deposit from oldest to youngest include polybasite, galena, tetrahedrite, freibergite, acanthite, stephanite, miargyrite, pyargyrite, native silver, and electrum. Other silver minerals include aguilarite, owyheeite, and naumannite, but are unknown as to their <b>paragenetic</b> position. Other sulfides present in the deposit include pyrite (occurred throughout mineralization), arsenopyrite (occurred through tetrahedrite depostion), cerussite (unknown <b>paragenetic</b> position), boulangerite (unknown <b>paragenetic</b> position), geocronite (unknown <b>paragenetic</b> position), bornite (early in <b>paragenetic</b> sequence), and chalcopyrite (<b>paragenetic</b> position between bornite and polybasite). The origin of the Grouse Creek ore deposit is interpreted to be epigenetic with a syngenetic phase. The epigenetic origin is supported by the strong structurally controlled feeder zones, veining, and open space filling textures. The syngenetic phase is supported by the strong stratigraphic controls away from the feeder structures, massive pyrite lenses up to 2. 5 cm thick in the lower portion of the carbonaceous black shales, and the presence of framboidal pyrite in portions of the carbonaceous black shales. Structural controls for the Grouse Creek deposit are dominated by the youngest set, therefore the more open or permeable set, of faults striking N 50 - 85 E. The older set of faults striking N 30 - 45 W also controls the Grouse Creek deposit, but to a lesser extent. The intersections of these two sets of structures were major zones of permeability allowing the upward migration of the mineralizing fluids. The stratigraphic contact between the massive pyroclastics, Tp, and the carbonaceous black shales, Ts(b), is a major zone of mineralization due to the impermeable nature of the shales which stopped the upward migration of fluids, forcing lateral migration along this contact. Analysis of four primary fluid inclusions indicates the ore-forming fluids were relatively low in salinity, 1. 81 - 2. 06 wt. ...|$|E

40|$|New geological, bulk {{chemical}} and mineralogical (QEMSCAN and FEG-EPMA) data are presented for albitite-type uranium deposits of the Mount Isa region of Queensland, Australia. Early albitisation of interbedded metabasalt and metasiltstone predated intense deformation along D 2 high strain (mylonite) zones. The early sodic alteration <b>paragenetic</b> stage includes albite, riebeckite, aegirine, apatite, zircon and magnetite. This <b>paragenetic</b> stage was overprinted by potassic microveins, containing K-feldspar, biotite, coffinite, brannerite, rare uraninite, ilmenite and rutile. An unusual U-Zr phase {{has also been}} identified which exhibits continuous solid solution with a uranium silicate possibly coffinite or nenadkevite. Calcite, epidote and sulphide veinlets represent the latest stage of mineralisation. This transition from ductile deformation and sodic alteration to vein-controlled uranium is mirrored in other examples of the deposit type. The association of uranium with F-rich minerals and a suite of high field strength elements; phosphorous and zirconium is interpreted to be indicative of a magmatic rather than metamorphic or basinal fluid source. No large intrusions of appropriate age outcrop near the deposits; but we suggest a relationship with B- and Be-rich pegmatites and quartz-tourmaline veins...|$|E
40|$|Burial {{diagenesis}} of the Upper Jurassic Torrecilla Reef Complex {{is recorded}} by a complex <b>paragenetic</b> sequence initiated with emplacement of ferroan calcite cements {{and followed by}} the precipitation of ferroan saddle dolomite. Ferroan calcite cements contain micro-sized dolomite inclusions (MDIs). Elemental and isotopic compositions of MDIs are virtually indistinguishable from those of ferroan saddle dolomite cements. In contrast to other scenarios {{for the formation of}} microdolomite inclusions that invoke either a magnesian calcite precursor or incomplete dedolomitization, the <b>paragenetic</b> relations of MDIs to their host ferroan calcite and their geochemical composition implies formation by fine-scale burial replacement of ferroan calcite by fluids associated with the emplacement of ferroan saddle dolomite. Petrographic observations and mass-balance considerations suggest that it is unlikely that Fe and Mg incorporated into ferroan dolomite could have been derived from the cannibalization of the reefal host rock. Rather, dolomitizing fluids were likely associated with the hydrothermal, low-grade metamorphic event that affected the Cameros Basin during the middle to Late Cretaceous. Interaction of these fluids with preexisting burial cements produced MDIs in the ferroan calcites...|$|E

Neither of these systems represents older, typical epithermal or porphyry-related systems that were subsequently deformed. However, advanced argillic alteration at both prospects cuts across the peripheral parts of older porphyry-style a teration systems, with <b>paragenetic</b> relations analogous to the Butte and Dizon districts.

40|$|Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation is {{currently}} extracting the highest grade BIF-hosted direct shipping iron ore {{in the world}} from their flagship Deposit No. 1 on north Baffin Island. This deposit and several other prospects are hosted within the isoclinally folded Mary River Group, a Neoarchean greenstone belt terrane hosting Algoma-type BIF, ultramafics volcaniclastics and sediment. Mary River Group supracrustals are juxtaposed against Mesoarchean basement gneisses due to a regional Transhudson Orogen overprint, forming a regional dome-keel tectonic framework. Detail mapping and core logging of Deposit No. 1 combined with geochemistry and geochronology reveal the footwall rocks, previously interpreted as gneisses, volcanics and metasediments, to be mylontized and altered ~ 2900 Ma monzogranite. The footwall monzogranite has endured three stages of hydrothermal alteration during Paleoproterozoic extension, removing up to 40 % SiO 2. Stage 1 is the formation of epidote-carbonate-hornblende veins. Stage 2 involves the breakdown of feldspars and quartz to muscovite forming quartz-augen muscovite schist (QAMS). A low amphibolite facies metamorphic event follows stage 2 alteration, producing large cordierite porphyroblasts. Stage 3 further desilicifies QAMS by biotite alteration forming quartz-augen biotite schist (QABS) and biotite schist. Retrogression of biotite schist forms chlorite schist. Stage 3 schists are overprinted by a second low amphibolite facies metamorphic event, producing andalusite-staurolite-almandine and grunerite-almandine porphyroblastic assemblages. Temperatures and pressure of the second metamorphic event are calculated between 368 - 481 °C at a max pressure of 3550 bars. <b>Paragenetic</b> sequencing of silica loss in monzogranite to form chlorite schist {{is identical to the}} formation of ore zone chlorite schist and therefore related to the formation of high grade iron ore.
