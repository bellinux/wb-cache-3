5000|$|Several {{possible}} classifications for terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>have</b> been proposed: ...|$|R
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º {{as seen from}} Earth. The planet is, thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> been observed to transit its host star.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 350 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Piscis Austrinus, orbiting the star HD 205739. This <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a minimum mass 37% more than Jupiter and orbits 90% of {{the distance between the}} Earth and the Sun. The <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a very elliptical orbit, which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit. This planet was reported on September 5, 2008 after its discovery at Las Campanas Observatory, where the planet was observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes. Follow-up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{formation}} models {{indicate that}} the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a gaseous envelope, somewhat less massive than 20% of it total mass, which account for ≈60% of its radius (or ≈90% of its volume).|$|E

50|$|The {{possibility}} of lifeforms existing on tidally-locked <b>planets</b> <b>has</b> been debated.|$|R
5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|After 13,000 {{years the}} Grand Galactics finally return to Earth and are astounded {{to see how}} fast the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> developed. They had always {{interfered}} with the evolution of sentient species they had discovered, believing {{they could not be}} trusted to evolve on their own. Impressed with Earth's progress, the Grand Galactic relieve themselves of the burden of watching over intelligent life and hand the task over to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Although each <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> unique {{physical}} characteristics, {{a number}} of broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.|$|E
5|$|The idea of <b>planets</b> <b>has</b> {{evolved over}} its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the {{scientific}} age. The concept has expanded to include worlds {{not only in the}} Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining <b>planets</b> <b>have</b> led to much scientific controversy.|$|R

5|$|As {{the planet}} is not known to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an {{eccentric}} orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion resonances with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b is a Hot Jupiter that is {{estimated}} to be 2.2 times the mass of Jupiter (over 700 times the mass of Earth), but 1.17 times Jupiter's radius (13.12 times the radius of Earth). Thus, the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a density of 1.68grams per cubic centimeter, similar to that of Neptune (1.638 g/cm3). The planet's equilibrium temperature {{is estimated}} to be 1620 K, thirteen times hotter than Jupiter's equilibrium temperature.|$|E

50|$|Different <b>planets</b> <b>had</b> {{different}} types of atmosphere, so that certain species could more easily colonise some than others, and each <b>planet</b> additionally <b>had</b> different quantities of natural resources, similar to the Space Empires series of games.|$|R

5|$|The Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) {{has been}} {{collecting}} surface measurements. BSRN {{was started in}} the early 1990s and updated the archives in this time. Analysis of recent data reveals that {{the surface of the}} <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> brightened by about 4% in the past decade. The brightening trend is corroborated by other data, including satellite analyses.|$|E
5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the orbital inclination to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
5|$|The {{low mass}} of the <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> led to {{suggestions}} {{that it may be}} a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.|$|E

5|$|The <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a {{very short}} orbital period, and circles its host star every 2.64561 days at a {{distance}} of 0.0287 AU. Gliese 3634 b has an eccentricity of 0.08, giving it a mostly circular orbit. In comparison, planet Mercury lies 0.387 AU from the Sun, orbits every 87.97 days, and has an orbital eccentricity of 0.2056.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13b is an {{extrasolar planet}} that was {{discovered}} in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star WASP-13. The <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-fourths the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might {{be caused by a}} core that is of low mass or that is not present at all.|$|E
5|$|Although a <b>planet</b> <b>has</b> {{yet to be}} {{directly}} observed around Vega, {{the presence of a}} planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
