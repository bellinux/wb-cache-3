40|$|ABSTRACT: Autonomous star {{trackers}} are optical-electronic devices {{used for}} attitude determination of artificial satellites, having {{as a reference}} for this computation the positions of stars. There is one autonomous star tracker in development at the Aerospace Electronics Division of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The autonomous star tracker imager is a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor active pixel sensor, consisting of an integrated circuit {{with an array of}} them. Each pixel has a photodetector and an active amplifier. Since it has many amplifiers, the active pixel sensor has an additional fixed <b>pattern</b> <b>noise,</b> therefore its characterization is different from the traditional method used for the charge coupled devices. With this experiment, it was observed that the mean value per columns of fixed <b>pattern</b> <b>noise</b> is ~ 100 % greater than the mean value of the pixel one. Taking into account this result, modeling the pixel fixed <b>pattern</b> <b>noise</b> will not be important to improve the autonomous star tracker sensibility. Furthermore, the random noise value was less than 1 % of the fixed <b>pattern</b> <b>noise</b> range data, being possible to estimate it.
