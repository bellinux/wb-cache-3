50|$|Cycads can be {{cut into}} pieces to make new plants, or by direct {{planting}} of the seeds. Propagation by seeds is the preferred method of growth, and two unique risks to their germination exist. One is that the seeds have no dormancy, so the embryo is biologically required to maintain growth and development, which means if the seed dries out, it dies. The second is that the emerging radicle and embryo can be very susceptible to fungal diseases in its early stages, when in unhygienic or excessively wet conditions. Thus, many cycad growers <b>pregerminate</b> the seeds in moist, sterile media such as vermiculite or perlite. However pregermination is not necessary, and many report success by directly planting the seeds in regular potting soil. As with many plants, a combination of well-drained soil, sunlight, water and nutrients will help it to prosper. Although, because of their hardy nature, cycads do not necessarily require the most tender or careful treatment, they can grow in almost any medium, including soilless ones. One {{of the most common}} causes of cycad death is from rotting stems and roots due to over-watering.|$|R

The seedlings surviving on the medium enriched with salt at the highest concentration were presumed to be tolerant and represented the mother plants for the production of in vitro clones. In the following step, the clones were evaluated in vitro to confirm the salt tolerance. The influence of mild salt stress (75 mM NaCl) on the growth parameters of selected clones was examined. At the end of this trial, the proline accumulation and sodium content in alfalfa shoots were also quantified. The results suggest an increased level of proline promotes salt tolerance.

However, weeds may also contribute to the biological diversity within the agro-environment. This greenhouse study investigated whether common weeds of arable cropping systems were suitable host plants for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), allowing the development of extraradical mycelium (ERM) that can contribute to the early colonization of a following wheat crop, especially in the absence of soil disturbance. Weeds were allowed to grow for up to 2 months before being controlled by soil disturbance or herbicide application (glyphosate or paraquat). <b>Pregerminated</b> wheat seeds were then planted. Chemical control of the weeds prior to sowing enhanced the early arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) colonization rate of wheat roots, whereas mechanical disturbance was less acceptable as a method of weed control for rapid AM colonization. The type of herbicide (contact or systemic) had no impact on colonization of the wheat crop. Enhanced AM colonization promoted early P acquisition and growth of the crop. Appropriate management of weeds emerging between two consecutive cropping seasons coupled with no-till soil management could ensure a quick and efficient AM colonization of the following wheat plants...|$|R

Of the spores produced, 75 % germinated and produced new generations in monoxenic culture. The mycelium network was formed by thick light-brown hyphae, which exhibit two major architecture patterns related to either root colonization or resource exploitation, and lower-order hyphae, bearing auxiliary cells, branched absorbing structures (BAS), hyphal swellings (HS) and forming anastomoses. BAS were formed abundantly in extramatrical mycelium and frequently had HS resembling vesicles, a feature not previously reported in the Gigasporaceae, {{to the best of}} our knowledge.

We show that sedaxane increased the efficiency of PSII photochemistry, reduced non-photochemical quenching and improved the photosynthesis and biomass in wheat correlating with systemic changes in the expression of genes involved in defense, chlorophyll synthesis and cell wall modification. We applied a coexpression network-based approach using differentially expressed genes of leaves, roots and <b>pregerminated</b> seeds from our wheat array datasets to identify the most important hub genes, with top ranked correlation (higher gene association value and z-score) involved in cell wall expansion and strengthening, wax and pigment biosynthesis and defense.

40|$|Although {{transplanting}} {{has been}} a major traditional method of rice establishment in Asia, economic factors and recent changes in rice production technology have improved the desirability of direct-seeding methods. The rising labor cost and the need to intensify rice production through double and triple cropping provided the economic incentives for a switch to direct seeding. Simultaneously, the availability of high-yielding, short-duration varieties and chemical weed control methods made such a switch technically viable. As the rice production systems of Asia undergo adjustments in response to the rising scarcity of land, water, and labor, a major adjustment can be expected in the method of rice establishment. This paper provides a brief overview of the patterns of changes in crop establishment methods that have taken place in Asia and their impact and implications for research and technology development. There are three principal methods of rice establishment: dry seeding, wet seeding, and transplanting. Although these methods vary, each is characterized by distinct salient features. Dry seeding consists of sowing dry seeds on dry (unsaturated) soils. Seeds can be broadcast, drilled, or dibbled. Wet seeding involves sowing <b>pregerminated</b> seeds in wet (saturated) puddled soils. Transplanting involves replanting of rice seedlings grown in nurseries to puddled soils. Because the seeds are sown directly, the dry- and wet-seeding methods are often jointly referred to as direct seeding...|$|R

A key development challenge in the drought-prone rainfed agriculture of the Barind Tract of northwest Bangladesh is to simultaneously improve the reliability and yield of monsoon rice while improving total system productivity by increasing the area planted to drought-tolerant postrice crops. Research trials and field-scale evaluation by farmers have demonstrated that dry direct seeding or wet seeding of <b>pregerminated</b> rice seed reduces labor for crop establishment, results in rice yields similar to or higher than those from conventional transplanting, and advances harvest by 7 - 10 days.

The irrigation systems, both intensive (accompanied by land consolidation) and extensive (with only irrigation canal), have made rice cultivation possible throughout the year and have brought stability {{in the lives of the}} farmers as well as the farm managements based on rice cultivation. The intensive irrigation system has made the new method of rice cultivation of direct sowing by <b>pregerminated</b> seeds of non-glutinous varieties possible and enhanced rice yield to more than 6. 0 tons/ha in brown rice (estimated) due to a high density of seeding (500 hills/m 2) and proper water control. One of the most serious problems in the area was the uneven distribution of water in the fields due to the shortage of water flow from the diversion dam. Rice cultivation in the extensive irrigation area has been successfully conducted by using proper devices of gravity irrigation system. The only problem in this area may be the irregular shapes and small size of the fields, which will be a handicap for mechanization of rice cultivation in the future.

In the present study, we studied antihemolytic and antioxidative effects of germosprout (i. e., the germ part along with sprouted stems plus roots) extract prepared from the <b>pregerminated</b> rice. The extract contained considerable amounts of antioxidant β-carotene (414 ± 12 [*]ng/g of extract) and phytochemicals such as total polyphenols (12. 0 ± 1. 1 [*]mg gallic acid equivalent/g of extract) and flavonoids (11. 0 ± 1. 4 [*]mg catechin equivalent/g of extract). The antioxidant potential of the extract was assessed by its DPPH- (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl-) free radical scavenging activity where we observed that germosprout extract had considerable antioxidative potentials. To evaluate antihemolytic effect of the extract, freshly prepared erythrocytes were incubated with either peroxynitrite or Fenton’s reagent in the absence or presence of the extract. We observed that erythrocytes pretreated with the extract exhibited reduced degree of in vitro hemolysis. To support the proposition that germosprout extract could act as a good antioxidative agent, we also induced in vitro oxidative stress in erythrocyte membranes and in the aorta, brain, heart, and liver tissue homogenates {{in the presence of the}} extract. As expected, germosprout extract decreased oxidative stress almost to the same extent as that of vitamin E, as measured by lipid peroxide levels, in all the mentioned tissues. We conclude that rice germosprout extract could be a good natural source of antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress-induced hemolysis and damage of blood vessels and other tissues...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the water}} {{relations}} parameters of developing somatic embryogenic and xygotic European larch (Larix decidua) were studied. Water release curves were generated by suspending tissue samples over unsaturated NaCl solutions until they reached vapor equilibration with the surrounding air. Twenty solutions were used whose water potentials ranged from − 0. 05 to − 10 MPa. Water release curves were obtained by plotting paired values of tissue relative water content (RWC) and solution potential. Curves were derived for embryonic larch at various stages of development and for hypocotyls and roots from germinated zygotic and somatic embryos. The ability to resist dehydration increased markedly with development. Stage 1 tissue, which consisted of clusters of loosely associated nonchlorophyllous cells, had extremely low bulk elastic modulus (ε) (1. 91 MPa) and apoplastic water content (A) (0. 023), relatively high osmotic potential (Ψπ) (− 0. 53 MPa), and lost turgor at 0. 56 RWC. In contrast, mature embryoids with primary roots, hypocotyl, and cotyledons (stage 3) had an almost 4 -fold increase in A (0. 089), significantly higher ε (3. 49 MPa), and lower Ψπ (− 0. 88 MPa) and lost turgor at 0. 66 RWC. Hypocotyl tissue from germinated somatic embryos lost turgor at 0. 74 RWC and had higher ε, A, and solute accumulation than <b>pregerminated</b> tissue. Hypocotyl tissue resisted dehydration more strongly than root tissue, and differences between root and hypocotyl water relation parameters were more pronounced in xygotic than in somatic seedlings. Highest dehydration resistance was in zygotic hypocotyls.

This review presents {{the different types of}} bioreactors used for coffee {{somatic embryogenesis}} by Nestlé R&D Centre-Tours and by other scientific teams. Mechanically agitated bioreactors were used for the production of torpedo-shaped embryos. Critical parameters are the inoculation density (0. 5 to 1. 0 g FW L- 1), medium renewing and the initial oxygen transfer rate (KLa: 5 h- 1). In this system, Robusta embryo concentrations range between 200, 000 to 400, 000 L- 1 within 2 months. Maturation from the torpedo to the cotyledonary-stage embryos was achieved in various temporary immersion bioreactors (TIB) : in 1 -L RITA ® system (up to 1, 000 cotyledonary embryos per system), in 10 -L glass bottles (up to 20, 000) and in 10 -L flexible disposable bags. The latter one, the so-called “Box-in-Bags”, insures a higher light transmittance to the biomass due to its horizontal design. At the end of the maturation phase, the somatic embryos are green and able to photosynthesize: these <b>pregerminated</b> embryos can be directly transplanted to the greenhouse to get fully germinated plantlets.

Its rare populations are at the present time greatly endangered namely by spontaneous hybridization with the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Regarding the fact that its protection is insufficient even in national nature reserves (NNR) and the classical propagation by cuttings is problematic, modern methods were adopted for a long-term preservation of the taxon. Growth regulation conditions were investigated for the induction of organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. Mature seeds were obtained from selected trees in the Žofinka NNR and from a locality near the village of Krajková in the Sokolov district. Cotyledon and hypocotyl segments from seedlings <b>pregerminated</b> in sterile conditions were used to induce the organogenesis. Bud proliferation was observed on the cotyledons after 4 weeks. The largest amount of buds was found on the medium with 1. 5 mg .  l− 1 benzyladenine (BA) and 0. 5 mg .  l− 1 1 -naphtylacetic acid (NAA) after 12 weeks.

The major objective was to study methane (CH 4) emission from deepwater rice as affected by different crop management. Irrigated rice was investigated in adjacent plots, mainly for comparison purposes. The 4 -yr average in CH 4 emission from deepwater rice with straw ash (burned straw) treatment was 46 mg m high - 2 d high - 1 and total emission was 98 kg ha high - 1 yr high - 1. For irrigated rice, the average emission rate and total emission for the straw ash treatment was 79 mg m high - 2 d high - 1 and 74 kg ha high - 1 yr high - 1, respectively. Low emission rates may partially be related to acid sulfate soil of the experimental site. Without organic amendment, the seasonal pattern of CH 4 emission from deepwater rice was correlated {{with an increase in}} biomass of rice plants. Emission rates from deepwater rice depend on the production of biomass and the straw management as well. Methane emission was greatest with straw incorporation, followed by straw compost incorporation, zero-tillage with straw mulching, and least with straw ash incorporation. The seasonal pattern of CH 4 ebullition in deepwater rice was consistent with seasonal emission, and total ebullition corresponded to 50 % of total emission. Dissolved CH 4 concentrations in the surface soil (0 - 5 cm) were similar to those in the subsoil (5 - 15 cm), and the seasonal fluctuation of dissolved CH 4 was also consistent with the seasonal CH 4 emission.

Contrary to previous predictions, accumulation of MSI- 99 in transgenic chloroplasts did not affect normal growth {{and development of the}} transgenic plants. This may be due to differences in the lipid composition of plastid membranes compared with the membranes of susceptible target microbes. In vitro assays with protein extracts from T 1 and T 2 plants confirmed that MSI- 99 was expressed at high levels to provide 88 % (T 1) and 96 % (T 2) inhibition of growth against Pseudomonas syringae pv tabaci, a major plant pathogen. When germinated in the absence of spectinomycin selection, leaf extracts from T 2 generation plants showed 96 % inhibition of growth against P. syringae pv tabaci. In addition, leaf extracts from transgenic plants (T 1) inhibited the growth of <b>pregerminated</b> spores of three fungal species, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium moniliforme, and Verticillium dahliae, by more than 95 % compared with non-transformed control plant extracts.

The enhanced biodegradation test {{was carried out in}} the laboratory. Samples taken from the field after five consecutive applications of each nematicide were treated in the following way: (1) not sterilized and no nematicide applied; (2) not sterilized but nematicide applied; and (3) nematicide applied after sterilization. The number of Radopholus similis which had penetrated the maize plantlets was used as a parameter to determine the degradation of the applied nematicide. Degradation was measured 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inoculation of <b>pregerminated</b> maize plantlets with 500 nematodes in soil under laboratory conditions. At harvest, 20 months after starting the field experiment, the lowest percentage of functional roots (P = 0. 024) and bunch weight (P = 0. 0001) were found in the non-treated control, followed by the Furadan treatment. On average, nematicides increased the bunch weight by 38 %. In general, higher bunch weights coincided with higher percentages of functional roots. Furadan showed a high level of enhanced biodegradation while for Counter and Rugby this phenomenon was not detected. In the case of Mocap and Nemacur, a relatively high level of enhanced biodegradation in the soil biotest coincided with a high number of nematodes per 100 g roots in the field experiment. A high correlation between mean nematode numbers per 100 g roots and mean percentage of functional roots was observed (R (2) = 0. 81, P = 0. 006) for all treatments together. Data show that a rotation of different nematicidal molecules is the best option for long-term nematode management in commercial banana plantations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Water {{productivity}} (WP) of irrigated {{lowland rice}} was determined during the 1994 dry (January to May) and wet (August to December) seasons on a heavy clay acid sulphate soil. Treatments {{consisted of three}} cultivation methods : transplanted rice, <b>pregerminated</b> seeds broadcasted on puddled soil (wet seeding) and dry seeds broadcasted on unpuddled soil (dry seeding). In wet and dry seeded plots, continuous standing water condition was initiated 17 days after sowing. Total water requirement for rice production was highest in transplanted plots (755 mm in wet season and 1154 mm in dry season) and was lowest in dry seeded plots (505 mm in wet season and 1040 mm in dry season). Dry seeding required no water for land preparation but transplanting and wet seeding methods required 18 - 20 % of total water requirement in dry season and 27 - 29 % in wet season. Total percolation was maximum (99 mm in wet season and 215 mm in dry season) in dry seeding method and was minimum (62 mm in wet season and 94 mm in dry season) in transplanting method. In dry and wet seeding methods, daily percolation gradually decreased with {{the age of the}} crop. Total seepage loss did not show any significant difference between the cultivation methods in the two seasons. Grain yield was not affected by the three cultivation methods in both seasons. Water productivity (the ratio between grain yield and total amount of water used in production) was 3. 5 - 4. 1 kg ha- 1 mm- 1, 3. 8 - 4. 4 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 and 4. 1 - 5. 5 kg ha- 1 mm- 1 in transplanted, wet seeded and dry seeded rice, respectively. Labour requirement for land preparation and sowing was maximum in transplanted (219 - 226 man-hours ha- 1) followed by wet (104 - 112 man-hours ha- 1) and dry seeded (94 - 99 man-hours ha- 1) methods. However, in wet season extra labour (77 man-hours ha- 1) was required for weeding after crop establishment in dry and wet seeding methods. Crop maturity was 20 days earlier in wet and dry seeding methods compared to transplanting. Dry seeding was considered the best rice cultivation method on heavy clay soils...|$|R
40|$|The Bauhinia Regional Rail Project (BRRP) is the {{construction}} of a 110 km spur line linking the Rolleston Coal Mine to the Blackwater rail network in Central Queensland, Australia. It will generate rail traffic of 8 Mt/year of coal from Rolleston mine by 2008. BRRP is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2005. The new spur line includes several embankments that need to be protected against erosion. Erosion of unprotected railway embankments causes serious maintenance and environmental problems within the project region. Earlier research has demonstrated that revegetation of the batters minimises the erosion risks considerably. Therefore the cost-effective erosion control strategies of the ongoing HEFRAIL Research Project are integrated with the earthworks construction. In order to reduce the treatment costs, the embankment batters are categorised with different levels of treatment. The top 3 m of batters of all embankment sections exceeding 4 m in height and embankment batters on the downstream side of the two major flood plains are receiving the full HEFRAIL erosion control treatment. The full HEFRAIL treatment involves topsoiling, grass seeding and drip irrigation system set up to aid in the grass establishment. The remaining embankment batters are receiving the full treatment except for the drip irrigation. Water from existing dams and creek water holes, from earthworks construction water tanks, and from road delivery to temporary tanks located within the rail corridor is being used to supply the irrigation water. The slow germination process and low germination rate of the preferred drought resistance buffel grass impose a serious bottleneck for the rapid grass establishment required for erosion control. Therefore an attempt has been made to increase the germination rate and accelerate the germination process by soaking seeds for 5 mins in water and pre-germinating in potting mix before spreading on the batter surface. Sulphuric acid treatment in the laboratory produced excellent results but has limitations for mass treatment, and it is being further investigated for improvement. Good emergence of buffel and Rhodes grass on the railway batters within a week of seeding with <b>pregerminated</b> seeds has been observed where the irrigation water is secured. In general very good grass coverage is being achieved within 8 weeks after seeding with irrigation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the methodologies for the {{evaluation}} of the cold tolerance level of rice in the following stages were identified: germination from sterilized dry seeds (placed on a Petri dish at 13 °C up the time when the controls showed 70 % of the seeds with coleoptile 5 mm or 35 days after planting), <b>pregerminated</b> seeds (incubated 5 ° C for 15 days and planted on sterilized soil and kept at ambient for 7 days) and in the seedling stage (seedlings with 3 rd leaf well developed were kept at 13 °C for 7 days, transferred to ambient temperature for other 7 days). This methodologies, utilizing non-sophisticated equipment, were capable of evaluating large quantities of genotypes in a short time. With this methodologies were evaluated in F s and R 2 (double haploids from the anther culture) 624 lines which coming from crosses destined 10 improve the cooking quality of genotypes from temperate zones and 19 lines were identified from the evaluation that combined tolerance to low temperature in the three evaluated stages and excellent cooking quality (larges or extralarges grain sizes, low white belly and more of 23 % amylose content). En el presente trabajo se identificaron metodologías para evaluar tolerancia a temperaturas bajas del arroz en las etapas de semilla seca esterilizada (se colocaron 50 semillas en una caja de Petri y se sometieron a 13 °C hasta que los testigos tolerantes presentaran el 70 % de las semillas con coleoptilo 5 mm o 35 días después de la siembra), semilla pregerminada (se incubaron a 5 °C durante 15 días, se sembraron en suelo esterilizado y se mantuvieron a temperatura ambiente por 7 días) y estado de plántula (plántulas con tercera hoja desarrollada se sometieron a 13 °C durante 7 días y se transfirieron a temperatura ambiente otros 7 días).

Antes do plantio foram aplicados 5 mitigadores de metais pesados. Para detecção e quantificação de níquel, chumbo, cromo e cádmio foram {{realizadas}} análises em ICP-MS em amostras de tecidos da cana-de-açúcar (folha + 1, raízes e tolete pré-germinado) obtidos na colheita da cana-planta e cana-soca. A quantificação das bactérias foram realizadas em amostras da parte aérea e das raízes, da cana-planta (colheita) e da cana-soca (6 meses e colheita), utilizando a metodologia do tolete pré-germinado. O ensaio ïn vitroc̈onsistiu em acrescentar ao meio de cultura 4 concentrações de Pb, Cd, Ni e Cr inseridos isoladamente e em combinações e proceder a inoculação em placa de petri de 4 bactérias (Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Azospirillum amazonense e Burkholderia tropica). O comportamento nas diferentes concentrações foi avaliado atribuindo-se valores aos diferentes padrões de crescimento. Para os metais, a maior concentração foi encontrada nas raízes e a menor foi encontrado na folha + 1. No campo os valores da folha + 1 aumentaram da cana planta para a cana soca e os valores das raízes diminuíram. Comparando campo e tolete pré-germinado, na cana planta a concentração nas raízes foi menor do que o encontrado no campo e na parte aérea o tolete teve uma concentração maior para o Ni e Cd. Na cana soca o campo possui as maiores concentrações tanto para parte aérea como para raízes. Na quantificação das bactérias, a comparação entre os períodos mostrou que a quantificação no geral é maior na cana planta. Na cana planta a quantificação foi maior na parte aérea, no 6 meses da cana soca o predomínio é na raiz e na colheita da cana soca existe uma distribuição mais uniforme das bactérias no interior da planta. No ensaio ïn vitroä concentração máxima de metais tolerada foi a máxima estudada para Pb (248 mg L- 1), Cd (8 mg L- 1) e Ni (40 mg L- 1). O Cr e a associação entre 2, 3 e 4 metais proporcionaram o não crescimento das bactérias. Para a maior parte das bactérias houve associação significativa entre os padrões de crescimento e as concentrações de metais no meio de cultura. Na variedade IAC 87 - 3396 foram encontrados os 4 gêneros de BFN, mesmo nas raízes onde os teores de Pb, Ni, Cr e Cd foram maiores. A tolerância das BFN aos metais ïn situd̈iferiu da ïn vitro. ̈ O cromo e a associação entre os metais limitaram o crescimento ïn vitrod̈e todas as bactérias. A metodologia do tolete pré-germinado não refletiu as condições de concentração de metais em materiais coletados no campo. A cana-deaçúcar tem potencial para ser uma cultura fitoextratora e acumuladora de Pb, Ni, Cr e CdThe {{objectives of}} this study were to evaluate the concentration of Cd, Pb, Cr and Ni in the tissues of sugarcane, noting the presence of the BFN in IAC 87 - 3396 variety grown in contaminated environment and evaluate the BFN tolerance to heavy metals ïn situänd ïn vitro. ̈ Sugarcane variety IAC 87 - 3396 was grown in an soil contaminated by metals. Before planting, five mitigators of heavy metals were applied. Analysis were performed to detect nickel, lead, chromium and cadmium in tissues of sugarcane, including leaf + 1, roots and <b>pregerminated</b> sett (shoot and root) at harvest of the plant cane and ratoon cane. To quantify the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, three tests were performed comprising the shoots and roots, one in the plant cane (at harvest) and two in ratoon cane (6 months and harvesting) using the methodology of pre-germinated sett. The test ïn vitroc̈onsisted of adding to the culture medium Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, mixed metals and inoculated in a petri dish of 4 bacteria (Herbaspirillum seropedicae, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Azospirillum amazonense and Burkholderia tropica). The behavior in different concentrations was evaluated by assigning values to different growth patterns. For all metals, the highest concentration was found in the roots and the lowest values were found in leaf + 1. This values in leaf + 1 increased from plant cane to ratoon cane while in root it decreased. In relation to the <b>pregerminated</b> sett, metal concentration in root of plant cane was lower than that found in the field while the leaf had a higher concentration only for Ni and Cd. The field ratoon cane has the highest concentrations for both the aerial and root part. For the quantification of bacteria, the comparison between the measurement periods showed that in general it is greater in the plant cane. The location of bacteria inside the plant revealed that, in the plant cane, it was higher in the shoot. However, {{for the first six months}} of ratoon cane the predominance of bacterias was in the root. At harvest of the ratoon crop a more uniform distribution of bacteria was found inside the plant. In the ïn vitroëssay the maximum concentration studied was the maximum tolerated for Pb (248 mg L- 1), Cd (8 mg L- 1) and Ni (40 mg L- 1). The association between Cr and 2, 3 and 4 metals provided no growth of bacteria. For most of the bacteria a significant association was found between growth patterns and concentrations of metals in the culture medium. All the four kinds of NFB were found in IAC 87 - 3396 even in roots where the levels of Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd were high. The tolerance of the NFB to these metals ïn situïs different from that ïn vitro. ̈ The chromium and its association with other metals have limited growth ïn vitroöf all bacteria.

40|$|Sorghum {{seeds of}} the {{cultivar}} SC 283, highly susceptible to Peronosclerospora sorghi were used in three experiments aiming the control of sorghum downy mildew. In the first experiment, seeds were previously treated with the following fungicides (g a. i. 100 Kg- 1 seeds) : metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (5. 6 + 89. 6), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (15. 0 + 150. 0), fosetyl-Al (240. 0), propamocarb (722. 0), metalaxyl-M (75. 0), metalaxyl-M (37. 5), fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M (12. 5 + 5. 0) and fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M (25. 0 + 10. 0). After these treatments, seeds were <b>pregerminated,</b> inoculated with conidia of P. sorghi and sowed in sterilized soil in the greenhouse. The experimental design {{was the one with}} randomized blocks, with 9 treatments in four replications. Fifteen days after sowing, the results evidenced that metalaxyl-M + mancozeb, metalaxyl- M + chlorothalonil, metalaxyl-M and fludioxonil + metalaxyl-M were highly efficient in the control sorghum of downy mildew (97. 2 to 100. 0 %). In the second experiment, fungicides were evaluated for their efficiency in giving protection to seeds against oospores of P. sorghi present in the soil and in sorghum debris of systemically infected plants from the previous season. The following treatments were evaluated (g a. i. 100 kg- 1 seeds) : metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (5. 6 + 89. 6), metalaxyl- M + mancozeb (7. 3 + 116. 5), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (15. 0 + 150. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (19. 5 + 195. 0), metalaxyl-M (37. 5), metalaxyl-M (75. 0), metalaxyl-M + fludioxonil (5. 0 + 12. 5) and metalaxyl-M + fludioxonil (9. 0 + 22. 5). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 9 treatments in four replications. Plots were established in soil contaminated with oospores of P. sorghi derived from debris of systemically infected plants in the previous season. The plants were evaluated forty-five days after the sowing, and the fungicide metalaxyl-M (75. 0 g i. a. 100 kg- 1) showed absolute protection against the systemic infection. The third experiment was performed to evaluate the efficiency of fungicides for the control of downy mildew through foliar application against systemic infection and local lesions of P. sorghi. Treatments were planted in four row-plots between two rows on a susceptible genotype, planted 40 days before, to act as spreader rows. The following fungicides were used in this experiment (g i. a. ha- 1) : metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (100. 0 + 1600. 0), metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (72. 0 + 1152. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (135. 0 + 1350. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (101. 2 + 1012. 5), fosetyl-Al (2000. 0) and fosetyl- Al (1440. 0). The experimental design was a randomized block with 7 treatments in four replications. Fungicide spraying, in number of four, was accomplished with a hand sprayer at a 14 day-interval, starting 21 days after planting. Evaluations were performed fourteen days after the last spraying and the results showed that the fungicide metalaxyl-M+ mancozeb and metalaxyl–M + chlorothalonil did not present systemically infected plants and local lesions which attends the field legislation of 0 % downy mildew in seed production fields.
