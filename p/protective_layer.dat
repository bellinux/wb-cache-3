The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E

The effects Of SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> and annealing on the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the films are investigated. The results show that SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> exert little influence on the electric field intensity (EFI) distribution, microstructure and microdefect density but increase the absorption slightly. Annealing is effective on decreasing the microdefect density and the absorption of the films. Both SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> and annealing are beneficial to the damage resistance of the films and the latter is more effective to improve the LIDT. Moreover, the maximal LIDT of Ta 2 O 5 films is achieved by the combination Of SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> and annealing...|$|R

5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|The cat skull {{is unusual}} among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a {{powerful}} and specialized jaw. Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them {{between two of the}} prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair {{on each side of the}} mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.|$|E
25|$|Copper alloy tubes can be {{supplied}} either {{with a bright}} metallic surface (CuNiO) or with a thin, firmly attached oxide layer (aluminium brass). These finish types allow {{for the formation of}} a <b>protective</b> <b>layer.</b> The protective oxide surface is best achieved when the system is operated for several weeks with clean, oxygen containing cooling water. While the <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> forms, supportive measures can be carried out to enhance the process, such as the addition of iron sulfate or intermittent tube cleaning. The protective film that forms on Cu-Ni alloys in aerated seawater becomes mature in about three months at 60nbsp&°F and becomes increasingly protective with time. The film is resistant to polluted waters, irregular velocities, and other harsh conditions. Further details are available.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of several reactively sputtered AgOx films, prepared at different oxygen flow ratios, {{with and without}} ZnS-SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> have been examined. For the as-deposited AgOx films, the amount and size of Ag clusters decreased, and the constituent phase of AgOx gradually transferred from pure Ag 2 O, to a mixture of Ag 2 O and AgO, then to pure AgO, as the oxygen flow ratio was increased. After annealing, the reduction of AgO into Ag 2 O and decomposition of Ag 2 O into Ag and O- 2 took place, and the decomposed Ag elements would diffuse outward and precipitate small silver particles {{on the surface of}} ZnS-SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers.</b> The chemical decomposition of AgOx film confined by ZnS-SiO 2 <b>protective</b> <b>layers</b> was confirmed to be an irreversible process.

25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A sparge of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly uranium hexafluoride, containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling uranium hexafluoride is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than Hastelloy. One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a <b>protective</b> <b>layer.</b> At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility was used to remove uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid fuel elements fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped. In its diamond-like behaviour it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.|$|E

Contiguous and uniform GO-PVA coatings were prepared on magnesium substrates by dip-coating method, and were further thermally treated at 120  °C under ambient condition to obtain in-situ reduced GO-PVA coatings. Owing to the reducing effect of PVA, thermal treatment at low temperature led to effective in-situ reduction of GO as confirmed by XRD, Raman, FTIR and XPS tests.

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in drip irrigation systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the sprinkler irrigation system to coat the vines with a <b>protective</b> <b>layer</b> of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1957, Jean Hoerni first {{proposed}} a planar technology of bipolar transistors. In this process, all the p-n junctions {{were covered by}} a <b>protective</b> <b>layer,</b> which should significantly improve reliability. However, in 1957, this proposal was considered technically impossible. The formation of the emitter of an n-p-n transistor required diffusion of phosphorus, {{and the work of}} Frosch suggested that SiO2 does not block such diffusion. In March 1959, Chi-Tang Sah, a former colleague of Hoerni, pointed Hoerni and Noyce to an error in the conclusions of Frosch. Frosch used too thin oxide layers, whereas the experiments of 1957–1958 showed that a thick layer of oxide can stop the phosphorus diffusion. Armed with this knowledge, by March 12, 1959 Hoerni made the first prototype of a planar transistor, and on May 1, 1959 filed a patent application for the invention of the planar process. In April 1960, Fairchild launched the planar transistor 2N1613, and by October 1960 completely abandoned the mesa transistor technology. By the mid-1960s, the planar process has become the main technology of producing transistors and monolithic integrated circuits.|$|E
