5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no <b>problem.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E

5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator <b>problem.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox <b>problem.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church at {{the time}} faced {{difficulty}} retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing social ostracism. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lack of a united Catholic identity, or sensus Catholicus, as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following lap.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{opened a}} gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his {{one and only}} pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. de la Rosa was the last {{one-stop}} driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap. Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a crankshaft sensor <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same lap.|$|E
5|$|The {{first order}} for {{electric}} multiple units was placed with Metropolitan Amalgamated in 1902 for 50 trailers and 20 motor cars with Westinghouse equipment, which ran as 6-car trains. First and third class accommodation was provided in open saloons, second class being {{withdrawn from the}} Met. Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased 20 × 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful motors were used on the circle with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had gates replaced with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> busy circle and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.|$|E

5|$|The third caution {{was given}} on lap ten; Tracy glanced the rear-right wheel of Servià's car heading into turn three which caused both drivers to spin and stall. De Ferran led at the lap-12 restart, ahead of Bräck and Franchitti. Bräck was {{overtaken}} by Franchitti {{for second place}} around {{the outside of the}} third turn on lap 18, while Tagliani passed Kanaan at the same corner one lap later. De Ferran continued to pull away {{from the rest of the}} field and held a 7.5 second lead over Franchitti by the 30th lap. The fourth caution came out two laps later when Takagi made contact with the side of Wilson at the entrance of turn three. Both cars spun with Takagi going into the outside tire barrier and Wilson went off into the run-off area with a broken suspension. Franchitti drove into the turn six run-off area to retire with an oil pressure <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same lap caused by a lack of oil in his car. During the caution, most of the field made pit stops. Dixon moved from 17th to fifth and Junqueira went from 18th to seventh position because they made pit stops before the caution was displayed. Andretti moved up from 15th to tenth place. De Ferran led the lap-37 restart, and was followed by Tagliani, Bräck, Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E
