From the analysis, the level <b>of</b> <b>cross-modulation</b> noise {{is determined by}} the system's noise figure(NF) and VCO's phase noise and there is a trade-off relationships between them. In addition, w have determined the value of LAN's IIP 3 and duplexer;s idolation to satusfy the above level in designing the system. Therefore, this paper will give a guideline for a selection of components in designing cdma 2000 mobile station. ope...|$|R

The most important result is that under imperfect carrier reference the command subcarrier and the ranging tone frequencies can be selected to suppress the cross-modulation interference and interference from the ranging channel for the specified command bit rate and ranging code component. Recommendations as to use of specific command subcarrier frequency, command bit rate, and ranging tone frequency are made for consideration in future standards systems...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} the application <b>of</b> <b>cross-modulation</b> vibro-acoustic technique for impact-damage detection in composite laminates. A composite plate is monitored for damage {{resulting from a}} low-velocity impact. The plate is excited simultaneously with two harmonic signals: a slow amplitude-modulated vibration pumping wave and a constant amplitude-probing wave. The frequency of both the excitation signals coincides with the resonances of the plate. An electromagnetic shaker is used to introduce the pumping wave to the plate. Two surface-bonded, low-profile piezoceramic transducers are used for probing-wave excitation and measurement. The wave modulation is transferred from the pumping wave to the probing wave {{in the presence of}} impact damage. This effect is exhibited in a power spectrum of the probing wave by a pattern of sidebands around the carrier harmonic. The results show that the amplitude of the sidebands is related to the severity of damage. The study also investigates also the effect of boundary conditions on the result...|$|R
