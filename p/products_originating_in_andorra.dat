2500|$|The 2010 ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Brita case {{confirmed}} that <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the West Bank do {{not qualify for}} preferential customs treatment under the EC–Israel Agreement, and that contrary assertions by Israeli authorities are not binding upon EU customs authorities. In its reasoning, the ECJ relied {{on the presence of}} two, distinct and equal Association agreements, one with Israel, applying to the [...] "territory of the State of Israel", and one with the PLO, applying to the territory of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and on the general principle of customary international law that an obligation cannot be imposed on a third party without its consent. The Court concluded that the EC–Israel Agreement may not be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to compel the Palestinian authorities to waive their right to exercise the competence conferred upon them by virtue of the EC–PLO Agreement and, in particular, to refrain from exercising the right to issue customs documents providing proof of origin for goods manufactured in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It follows that <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the West Bank do not fall within the territorial scope of the EC–Israel Agreement and, therefore, do not qualify for preferential treatment under that agreement.|$|R

At the same time, farmers also needed beef and mutton for food, and raw materials like fur. For their part, farmers supplied important items like silk and tea to the nomads. As a result, the trade between nomads and farmers later became known as “horse-silk market” or “tea-horse trade.” Many <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> the Central Plains, including currency, have been found in Northern nomad tombs from the late-Warring States period and the Han Dynasty.|$|R

From January 2005 through September 2006, <b>products</b> <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> China were responsible for about 48 percent of product recalls in the U.S., and a similar percentage of notifications in the EU. Lack of process control in sub-contracted vendors has been a contributing factor in recent high-profile cases.|$|R

50|$|On January 7, 2014, 17 cars of a 122-car train derailed {{and caused}} a huge {{fireball}} near Plaster Rock.

As a result, Irving Oil uses the CN line from Montreal through Quebec City that crosses over the bridge to the South shore through Rimouski and Matane and then through Plaster Rock to Saint John. Nobody was injured during the blaze but about 150 people were evacuated.|$|R
