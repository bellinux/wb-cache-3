40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to jointly assess the impact of {{regulatory}} reform for corporate fundraising in Australia (CLERP Act 1999) and the relaxation of ASX admission rules in 1999, on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts in initial <b>public</b> <b>offer</b> (IPO) <b>prospectuses.</b> The relaxation of ASX listing rules permitted a new category of new economy firms (commitments test entities (CTEs)) to list without a prior history of profitability, while the CLERP Act (introduced in 2000) was accompanied by tighter disclosure obligations and stronger enforcement action by the corporate regulator (ASIC). Design/methodology/approach – All IPO earnings forecasts in prospectuses lodged between 1998 and 2003 are examined to assess the pre- and post-CLERP Act impact. Based on active ASIC enforcement action in the post-reform period, IPO firms are hypothesised to provide more accurate forecasts, particularly CTE firms, which are less likely to have a reasonable basis for forecasting. Research models are developed to empirically test the impact of the reforms on CTE and non-CTE IPO firms. Findings – The new regulatory environment has had a positive impact on management forecasting behaviour. In the post-CLERP Act period, the accuracy of prospectus forecasts and their revisions significantly improved and, as expected, the results are primarily driven by CTE firms. However, the majority of prospectus forecasts continue to be materially inaccurate. Originality/value – The results highlight the need to control for both the changing nature of listed firms and the level of enforcement action when examining responses to regulatory changes to corporate fundraising activities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{analysing}} the relationship between governance systems and safeguard of minority shareholders in Italy. We believe that an appropriate governance system can favour a fair distribution of value to shareholders of listed companies regardless {{of the size of}} the share held. We studied the tender offers made in Italy in the period 2000 - 2009 to calculate the relationship between the compliance of governance systems with best practices and size of majority premiums paid in take-over transactions, measured through <b>offer</b> <b>prospectuses.</b> The empirical research shows a negative association between the mentioned variables. So this seems to suggest that the compliance with best practice codes can influence the majority premiums in tender offers and protect minority shareholders...|$|R
