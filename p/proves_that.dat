5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E

30|$|Developing {{the notion}} of K-homotopy in the {{category}} of Khalimsky topological spaces, we have developed the notions of contractibility and local contractibility induced by the K-homotopy. Besides, <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> digital contractibilities imply local contractibilities for a K-contractible space X, we wondered if the space X has the FPP. In this paper, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> not every K-topological space with K-contractibility has the FPP. More precisely, for SC_K^n,l, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> SC_K^n,l does not have the FPP. For instance, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> whereas SC_K^n, 4 is K-contractible, it cannot have the FPP. However, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> a simple K-path has the FPP. In addition, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> in KTC the FPP is a K-topological invariant.|$|R

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that the reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E

5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars attribute {{the invention of the}} drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> the figured fabrics of that era were also crafted {{with the use of a}} drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded by {{soldiers of the}} Japanese Army and concludes that at least 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> a bare minimum of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, plus at least another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally concludes that the death toll must have been well over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E

When Smalljon Umber <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> Rickon Stark is captured by presenting Shaggydog's head, Sansa tells Ramsay that he will die the next day and rides off.

Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. A healing ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder {{is being held in}} a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the artifact contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the artifact is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor.

Kierkegaard's Papers first edition VIII(2), B 81 - 89 explain this method in writing. On interpretation there is also much to be found in The Point of View of My Work as an Author.|$|E

5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E

As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in.

However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport.|$|E
5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House <b>proves</b> <b>that</b> Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.
