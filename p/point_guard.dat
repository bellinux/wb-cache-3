He was also reunited with former championship teammate Tyson Chandler, who {{was traded to}} Dallas after a 3-year stint with New York.

5|$|As {{he entered}} his {{freshman}} season at Duke, {{he was expected}} to battle with senior <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> Quinn Cook and junior guard Rasheed Sulaimon for playing time following the graduation of Tyler Thornton. Well before the season there were expectations that Jones would win the starting <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> position. Thus, he was selected by USA Today to its Preseason All-American second team and by CBS Sports to its Preseason All-American third team. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, Jones was listed at number 45 by ESPN. Jones was named to the 36-man Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List. He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate and a Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List selection. Jones was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the season}} began, <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists {{leader in the}} 2010–11 season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. The {{incoming}} class included Carlton Brundidge and 2011 Ohio Mr. Basketball <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> Trey Burke. Both Brundidge and Burke were among Scout.com's top 100 players of the 2011 class; Brundidge ranked 98th and Burke ranked 94th. Max Bielfeldt committed to Michigan in April despite his family's ties to the Illinois Fighting Illini. Illinois University's Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. Sai Tummala, who along with Bielfeldt was recruited by Ivy League schools, rounded out the incoming class. Tummala earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk-on candidate for the basketball team.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 15 {{games of the}} 2013–14 NBA season, Nelson started at <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> for the Orlando Magic, but on November 29, he missed the game due to injury.

On February 18 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Moore had 17 points and 2 blocks, which were season highs. Moore tied his season high of 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting, including 5-for-5 on three point shots on April 9 against the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{statistical}} profile of the <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> of the teams that participated in the FIBA World Championship in 2010. Data were obtained through the official website of the International Basketball Federation, and analyzed official statistics of 57 <b>point</b> <b>guards,</b> belonging to 24 teams participating in the competition. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation). The results revealed that the <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> made low number of offensive and defensive actions per game, compared to that observed in the literature. Findings that may be related to reduced time spent in court, and the highest level of competition. With regard to offensive actions, the <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> had a profile lower than expected for the position in regard to assistance and field goal (excepting the free throw). However, they exhibited a characteristic profile of the position, with respect to the few loose balls per game. The defensive profile revealed a mild involvement of these players in the actions of blocks, defensive rebounds and steals for their teams. However, it is emphasized that the low values achieved the first two indicators can be related to height and positioning on the court, often the front and away from the basket and action in the paint, while the third indicator (steals) can be directly linked to the technical level of the players in this competition, including the <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> themselves, who had a low index of mistakes (lost balls) per game...|$|R

50|$|Below is a {{table of}} notable preseason watch lists. The Senior CLASS award is only for seniors and the Cousy Award is only for <b>point</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the taller}} {{players who have}} enjoyed success at the {{position}} is Magic Johnson, who was 6' 9" [...] (2.06 m) and won the National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award three times in his career. Other <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> who have been named NBA MVP include Russell Westbrook, Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Derrick Rose and two-time winners Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. In the NBA, <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> are usually about 6' 5" [...] (1.96 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2.75" [...] (1.90 m) whereas in the WNBA, <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> are usually 5' 9" [...] (1.75 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling.|$|R
5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote {{told him he could}} play the <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.|$|E
5|$|Barea was {{a member}} of the Puerto Rican {{national}} team that won the gold medal in the 2006 and 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. He was the starting <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> for Puerto Rico when they won the gold medal in the 2011 Pan American Games and the silver medal in the 2007 Pan American Games.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} after his 201011 {{freshman}} season, he was described as the best <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> {{from the state of}} Minnesota since Khalid El-Amin. Another Minnesotan who is a measuring stick for Jones is Sam Jacobson. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, when he plays for Duke, Jones is likely to finish among the top 5 in the nation in assists per game but may need to work on his defense.|$|E
50|$|In August 2007, while {{studying}} in the United States, {{he had to}} decide whether to finish his last semester of Kinesiology studies at California State-Fullerton or go to the Philippines and apply for the PBA draft. He chose the latter and was drafted third overall by the Sta. Lucia Realtors. Reyes {{was one of the few}} pure <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> in the 2007 PBA draft. His great size, athletic ability, solid perimeter shooting, driving skills, general court vision, defensive instincts, ball handling, and confidence in his abilities made him stand out from the other <b>point</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This is in {{contrast}} to [...] "true" [...] (or [...] "pure") <b>point</b> <b>guards</b> such as Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Kevin Johnson and Ricky Rubio. These players exhibit a pass-first mentality, value assists and steals over points, and embrace the responsibility of playmaker rather than finisher. They conform to the perception that a <b>point</b> <b>guard's</b> duties are to direct the offense, distribute the ball, create scoring opportunities for others, and attempt the shot only if there are no open teammates to be found.|$|R

5|$|Byron Brown {{is married}} to the former Michelle Austin {{and they have a}} son, Byron III, who is {{referred}} to as Byron, Jr. by some accounts.

On the national level, he was an unheralded <b>point</b> <b>guard</b> in the 2008 high school graduating class, and he went on to attend Queen City Prep in Charlotte, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{played for}} the University of Illinois Wheelchair Basketball team in the country's first division. In 2006/07, she was coached by Mike Frogley, and was the team's {{starting}} <b>point</b> <b>guard.</b> Early in the 2006/07 season, her wheelchair broke {{and she had to}} play in one that was not hers. After three games played in the borrowed chair, she had bloody and bruised knees. She was named an All-American in the 2006/07 season.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{grew up in}} Chicago {{where he}} was a multisport {{standout}} athlete at Crane High School.
