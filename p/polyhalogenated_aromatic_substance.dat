Lipid peroxidation induced by NADPH/ADP-iron, however, proceeded at a substantially lower rate in the hepatic microsomes of DBA/ 2 mice.

Strong bases having beta -hydrogens both perform deprotonation of the imidazolium salt and are hydrogen sources for the dehalogenation process. The oxidative addition of the imidazolium salt to the palladium(0) precursor generating a carbene palladium hydride species may also be involved in the dehalogenation process.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{exposure to}} dioxin-like compounds using chemical and bioassay analysis in different matrices in a female population. A total of 106 serum and 9 follicular fluid {{samples were collected}} from infertile women attending Centers for Reproductive Medicine in Belgium from 1996 to 1998. Major polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were quantified by chemical analysis using gas chromatography with electron-capture detection, and the chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX) bioassay {{was used to determine}} the total dioxin-like toxic equivalence (TEQ) of m ixu of <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons present in body fluids, such as serum and follicular fluid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to determine TEQvaIues by the CALUX bioassay in follicular fluid. The TEQ levels in both matrices are well corrdated (r = 0. 83, p = 0. 02). As the chemical and bioassay analysis exected in this study do not cover the same span of <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons, we did not expect totally correlated results. Moreover, the sample workup and quantification of the analytes difered completely. Nonetheless, the TEQ values in human extracts correlated well with the sum of four major PCB congeners chemically determined in both serum and follicular fluid. These results indicate that the CALUX bioassay may serve as a simple, relatively inexpensive prescreening tool for exposure assessment in epidemiologic surveys.

Exposure to several environmental toxicants, including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has been strongly implicated in impaired mammary differentiation and lactation. TCDD and related <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons are widespread industrial pollutants that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Despite many epidemiological and animal studies, the molecular mechanism through which AHR signaling blocks lactation remains unclear.

We demonstrate AHR agonists directly block milk production in isolated mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, we define a novel role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) in mediating this response.

We analysed egg or liver extracts from six species and compared chemically determined Sigma PCB-TEQs concentrations with total AhR-mediated toxicity determined using the chemical-activated luciferase gene expression bioassay (CALUX-TEQ). Dioxin-like PCB profiles in eggs and livers were dominated by congeners 118, 105 and 167. Sigma PCB-TEQ and CALUX-TEQ concentrations were positively associated but not in a 1 : 1 relationship. Sigma PCB-TEQ were broadly similar to CALUX-TEQ concentrations in eggs and livers with CALUX-TEQ concentrations > 50 - 80 and 160 - 320 pg g(- 1) lipid respectively, but were lower than CALUX-TEQ concentrations in less contaminated samples.
