5000|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} DST is James's {{view that the}} Me, equated with the self-as-known, is composed of the empirical elements considered as belonging to oneself. James was aware {{that there is a}} gradual transition between Me and mine and concluded that the empirical self is composed of all that the person can call his or her own, [...] "not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account". According to this view, people and things in the environment belong to the self, as far as they are felt as [...] "mine". This means that not only [...] "my mother" [...] belongs to the self but even [...] "my enemy". In this way, James <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> in which the self is 'extended' to the environment. This proposal contrasts with a Cartesian view of the self which is based on a dualistic conception, not only between self and body but also between self and other. With his conception of the extended self, that defined as going beyond the skin, James has paved the way for later theoretical developments in which other people and groups, defined as [...] "mine" [...] are part of a dynamic multi-voiced self.|$|E

40|$|Nielsen, et al. [1, 2] <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> {{of quantum}} {{computation}} where determining optimal algorithms {{is equivalent to}} extremizing a geodesic length or cost functional. This view of optimization is highly suggestive of an action principle of the space of N-qubits interacting via local operations. The cost or action functional is given by the cost of evolution operators on local qubit operations leading to causal dynamics, as in Blute et. al. [3] Here we propose a view of information geometry for quantum algorithms where the inherent causal structure determines topology and information distances [4, 5] set the local geometry. This naturally leads to geometric characterization of hypersurfaces in a quantum cellular automaton. While in standard quantum circuit representations the connections between individual qubits, i. e. the topology, for hypersurfaces will be dynamic, quantum cellular automata have readily identifiable static hypersurface topologies determined via the quantum update rules. We demonstrate construction of quantum cellular automata geometry and discuss the utility of this approach for tracking entanglement and algorithm optimization. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|Our goal is {{to augment}} a {{panorama}} with object movies in a visually 3 D-consistent way. Notice that a panorama is recorded as one single 2 D image and an object movie (OM) is composed {{of a set of}} 2 D images taken around a 3 D object. The challenge is how to integrate the above two sources of 2 D images in a 3 D-consistent way so that the user can easily manipulate object movies in a panorama. To solve this problem, we adopt a purely image-based approach that does not have to reconstruct the geometric models of the 3 D objects to be inserted in the panorama. A critical issue of this method is how to generate the novel views required for showing an OM in different places of a panorama, and we have <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> morphing technique, called t-DBVM, to solve this problem. Our experiments have shown that this purely image-based approach can effectively generate visually convincing OM-augmented panoramas.

40|$|Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) has {{provided}} the Industrial/Organizational Psychologists and Organizational Behaviorists with a theoretical framework for understanding how leaders lead followers. This theory {{is based on the}} interpersonal relationship between leader and follower. The theory proposes that the relationship between leaders and followers develops from a dyadic exchange process. However, research has recognized the need to consider the influence of social context on the relationship between LMX and outcomes. The Social Identity Model of Leadership (SIMOL) has <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> of leadership {{from the perspective of the}} relationship between the leader and a group of followers. This theory is based primarily on group memberships and how the leader fits the group prototype, affecting the leader's ability to lead and how the leader leads.

The paper hypothesizes that SIMOL, through leader prototypicality, moderates the relationship between LMX and follower attitudes.
