50|$|In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to {{recreate}} this shot. Although a <b>photograph</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1969 photo shoot was originally {{intended for the}} then-planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, another <b>photograph</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1969 shoot, along with an unused <b>photograph</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1963 photo shoot, was used for both this LP and 1962-1966.|$|R

5|$|A script {{book for}} The Quatermass Experiment, {{including}} some <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production, {{was released by}} Penguin Books in 1959. This was followed by similar releases of Quatermass II and Quatermass and the Pit, both published in 1960. All three of these releases were reprinted by Arrow Books in 1979 with new introductions by Kneale, to tie-in with the television transmission of the fourth and final serial.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E
5|$|Later {{residents}} of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet {{and founder of the}} Society for Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, who was born in Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including <b>photographs,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Abrahams' era.|$|E

5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time of opening consulted, and {{the bridge was}} restored to its original appearance. The {{main body of the}} bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} popular for their {{personal}} appearances in television {{shows such as}} Bob Hope Christmas Specials. Mansfield and Hargitay {{had a number of}} business holdings, including the Hargitay Exercise Equipment Company, Jayne Mansfield Productions, and Eastland Savings and Loan. She co-wrote the autobiographical book Jayne Mansfield's Wild, Wild World with Hargitay. The book also contained 32 pages of black-and-white <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film on glossy paper.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E

5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|Lecrae {{stated in}} an {{exclusive}} video with AllHipHop that after recording Church Clothes in March, {{he was on the}} road before beginning recording for Gravity in May. In an article by SOHH, Lecrae revealed that he had started work on the album in February, then wrapped up recording during the mid-year. The album was recorded over the next couple months at Music House Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. On July 10, 2012, Christian hip hop website Rapzilla reported that Lecrae had shot a music video with No Malice of Clipse and with his labelmate Tedashii. Lecrae New Music Video ft.

5|$|The museum's Photograph Archive {{preserves}} {{photographs by}} official, amateur and professional photographers. The collection includes the official British photographic {{record of the}} two world wars; the First World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Ernest Brooks and John Warwick Brooke. The archive also holds 150,000 British aerial <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> First World War, the largest collection of its kind. The Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton and Bert Hardy. Like the Film Archive, the Photograph Archive is an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, and as such continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. In 2012 the museum reported {{the size of its}} photographic holdings as approximately 11 million images in 17,263 collections.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} also {{tracked the}} Soviet moon probes, including Lunik II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as {{it hit the}} moon; this was proven by the telescope by measuring {{the effect of the}} moon's gravity on the probe,Piper, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 42Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 269–271 and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 271 Also, the telescope tracked Luna 9 in February 1966, the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. The telescope listened in on its facsimile transmission of <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press – the probe transmitted, likely intentionally to increase chances of reception, in the international format for image transmission by newswire – and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|The terrace {{comprises}} three {{one story}} cottages, a six room cottage for the principal keeper and two three room cottages for the assistants, all {{sharing the same}} roof. Each of the cottages had a kitchen, a storeroom and a privy. The building was constructed of the same imported sandstone as the lighthouse, dressed outside and plastered inside. The roof was originally made of slate, replaced in 1901 with terracotta, with five chimneys along the ridge and a bay window and gables along the front. A low terrace was built at the rear from random stone. <b>Photographs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s also show a rear addition with a skillion roof infilling part of the verandah.|$|E
