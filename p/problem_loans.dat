40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} of <b>problem</b> <b>loan</b> resolution choices that {{is a function of}} the combined borrower and lender decisions. A bank will choose a workout option if its expected value is greater than the outcome under a no-workout plan. For the borrower, if the reputational penalty due to a default is less than the opportunity cost of the best new alternative, the borrower will have an incentive to default. If the reverse holds then the borrower will be better-off with a loan workout. Using a unique data set composed of borrower, lender and economic factors we empirically examine the <b>problem</b> <b>loan</b> resolution choices. The, results provide support for our conceptual framework that <b>problem</b> <b>loan</b> choices are based on combined borrower/lender variables.

40|$|We {{employ a}} unique data set of public {{commercial}} real estate (CRE) bonds issued during the Great Depression era (1920 - 32) to determine their frequency of default and total loss given default. Default rates on these bonds far exceeded those originated in subsequent periods, driven {{in part by the}} greater economic stress of the Depression as well as the lower level of financial sophistication of investors and structures that prevailed in 1920 - 32. Our results confirm that making loans with higher loan-to-value ratios results in higher rates of default and loss. They also support the business cycle's significance to the performance of CRE assets. Despite the large number of defaults in the early 1930 s, the losses, which typically occurred after 1940, are comparable to those for contemporary loans, largely due to the rapid recovery of the economy from the Depression. This finding has relevance today, as numerous entities have a large amount of sub-performing CRE assets to work out. While the data point to better loss performance the quicker a <b>problem</b> <b>loan</b> is worked out, this may not hold true when there is a rapid recovery around the corner...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure process is beset {{by a variety}} of problems. These range from procedural defects (including, but not limited to robosigning) to outright counterfeiting of documents to questions about the validity of private-label mortgage securitizations that could mean that these mortgage-backed securities are not actually backed by any mortgages whatsoever. While the extent of these problems is unknown at present, the evidence is mounting that it is not limited to one-off cases, but that there may be pervasive defects throughout the foreclosure and securitization processes. The problems in the mortgage market are highly technical, but they are extremely serious. At best they present problems of fraud on the court, clouded title to property, and delay in foreclosures that will increase the shadow housing inventory and drive down home prices. At worst, they represent a systemic risk of liabilities in the trillions of dollars, greatly exceeding the capital of the US’s major financial institutions. Congress would do well to ensure that federal regulators are undertaking a thorough investigation of foreclosure problems and to consider the possibilities for a global settlement of foreclosure <b>problems,</b> <b>loan</b> modifications, and the housing debt overhang that stagnate the economy and pose potential systemic risk...|$|R
