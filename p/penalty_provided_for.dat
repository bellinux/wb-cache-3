This legislation would impose the death penalty on certain homosexual activity and would require citizens to report homosexual activity to the police or face jail time.

In the United States, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has argued that, should the legislation become law, Uganda would be ineligible for trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). AGOA requires that beneficiary nations not engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.
