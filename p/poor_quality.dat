40|$|Part 8 : Health/Medical DevicesInternational audienceMany tasks with {{interfaces}} require entering data accurately, for example, entering {{patient data}} in an electronic records system or programming infusion pumps. However, human error is inevitable. Paradoxically, results from cognitive psychology suggest that representing {{information in a}} <b>poorer</b> <b>quality</b> format {{increases the likelihood of}} memorising the information accurately. This is explained by the dual system account of cognition where slower, more effortful but more accurate thinking is invoked via the <b>poorer</b> <b>quality</b> representation. We present two studies where we transfer these results to the domain of data- entry and show that <b>poorer</b> <b>quality</b> format of to-be-copied information leads to increased accuracy in transcription tasks. Moreover, this is not a consequence of the typical speed-accuracy tradeoffs. The results of our novel approach have implications for the design of data-entry tasks in domains such as healthcare...|$|R

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate {{the effect of a}} task-specific self-instruction intervention to improve handwriting ability of children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> in schools for regular education (Study 1) and children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> in schools for special education (Study 2). Study 1 showed that children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> who received handwriting intervention on an individual basis for three months improved on average more on quality of writing than control children without handwriting problems who did not receive intervention. In contrast, the control group improved more in speed of writing after the intervention period. At an individual level, three out of the seven children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> before intervention were not classified as such anymore after the intervention period. Study 2 showed that after six months of intervention in a group setting children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> improved their quality of writing more so than children with <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality</b> who had not received intervention. On speed of handwriting no significant group differences emerged. We conclude that the task-oriented self-instruction method applied in this study seems to improve especially the quality of handwriting, not speed, of children initially identified as having <b>poor</b> handwriting <b>quality...</b>|$|R
