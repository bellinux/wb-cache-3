50|$|Jon Kammerer Guitars {{is one of}} the few guitar {{companies}} that takes the time to do blind fret slots. This increases the build complexity, as the guitar builder must take care to not cut the fret slot all the way across the fretboard. This process ensures that the fret tang does not stick out if the wood shrinks as it ages, but without having to resort to <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> along the fretboard edge.|$|E
50|$|The spines {{are made}} out of plastic and have 19 rings, similar to a like a <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> comb. The hole pattern needed for ZipBind spines to work {{is the same one}} used for comb binding and will usually be made through paper drilling. These spines can be opened with a tool that acts like a zipper. The spines can be opened and closed {{numerous}} times which allows the user to make changes to his/her documents.|$|E
5000|$|When {{production}} {{began in}} 1964, Rickenbacker changed some features {{from those of}} the prototype. The edge of the body was rounded off around the top of the guitar, and white <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> was added to the soundhole. Production models retained the prototypes' use of the rectangular trapeze tailpiece until late 1964, when twelve-string models were fitted with Rickenbacker's [...] "R" [...] tailpiece. The last 360/12 OS was produced in Fireglo and made in December 1968 S/N HL1725.(Ref. R.Smith) After 1969, the 360/12 gained a 24-fret neck instead of the traditional 21-fret neck. Three models were produced: the two-pickup 360/12, the three-pickup 370/12 (favored by Roger McGuinn of The Byrds) and the 450/12, a two-pickup solidbody.|$|E

50|$|Unlike some {{collectible}} toys, Breyer horse packaging {{does not}} generally affect the model's value. Unfortunately, {{there have been}} some issues with pre-2000s packaging, in which if a model is left in the box {{for an extended period of}} time, the box can actually cause harm to the horse's finish due to rubbing of the horse's paint on the sides of the box or on the <b>plastic</b> ties <b>binding</b> it to the packaging, therefore diminishing the model's value.|$|R
50|$|GBC {{was founded}} in 1947 by William N. Lane II and two {{business}} partners when they purchased a small trade bindery in Chicago, Illinois. First year sales totaled $250,000. GBC expanded operations in 1952, opening another domestic manufacturing plant and founding General Binding Corporation Canada, Ltd. In the 1950s GBC {{laid the groundwork for}} its international divisions, creating sales and distribution networks in Europe, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, and Brazil. Sales were slow at first in the European market, where GBC's binding machines were readily available but supplies were not. In response to this situation, GBC established a manufacturing subsidiary in Switzerland in 1954 to produce a full range of <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> supplies as well as a limited number of binding machines. Wholly owned subsidiaries were then set up to market GBC machines and supplies throughout England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France.|$|E
40|$|Phage {{display is}} a {{powerful}} technique for the discovery of peptide ligands that bind to various targetshowever, ambiguous results often appear. Peptide HWGMWSY has been isolated repeatedly in our laboratory and by other research groups dealing with different protein and nonprotein targets, {{which led to a}} hypothesis that it may be a target-unrelated peptide interacting with polystyrene plastic surfaces. We compared binding properties and amplification rate of phage clone displaying the peptide HWGMWSY, a previously confirmed <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> clone WHWRLPS, and a control phage clone ASVQERK. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a phage elution assay confirmed that phage clone HWGMWSY binds to polystyrene. Surface plasmon resonance measurements on the other hand excluded the possibility of binding to bovine serum albumin, a common blocking agent in phage display experiments. Amplification rates of the abovenoted phage clones were not statistically different. We therefore conclude that phage clone HWGMWSY was isolated in different selection procedures {{as a result of its}} affinity to polystyrene...|$|E

50|$|In the past, some comb binding {{machines}} {{would come}} with a wire closer. These machines were designed {{to be used with}} 19 loop wire. Nineteen loop wire is designed to be used with a <b>plastic</b> comb <b>binding</b> pattern. This hole pattern will have longer rectangular holes that are 9/16 in on center. This style of binding used to be referred to as Ibiwire which was Ibico's name for this style of binding. However, when Ibico was purchased by the General Binding Corporation this type of supplies was discontinued. Today, 19-loop wire is commonly called Spiral-O Wire.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plastic</b> spiral <b>binding</b> is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the}} edge of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or a crimping machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|R
5000|$|On December 5, 1957, Lily Kendrick {{became the}} President of Handymap, {{making it one}} of Dallas' first {{companies}} to be headed by a woman. Milton Boyd Keith's adopted son Donald became Vice President, and Lily's son Choyce became the Treasurer. Choyce had ten years in the air conditioning business and was unprepared for the challenges of mapmaking. The Dallas Mapsco, now with the Handymap name on the cover, continued to be produced. With the [...] "succession crisis" [...] now resolved, Mapscos continued {{to be made in the}} back of the flower shop for the remainder of the 50s and 60s. In 1959, the <b>plastic</b> spiral <b>binding</b> was changed to a metal wire binding, which continues in use to this day. Donald Keith sold his stock in the company to Lily in 1959, and the founding Keith family exited the map business. Also in that year, Mapsco acquired its main in-town rival, known as JIFFYMAP. The company paid $5,000 for the maps and name.|$|R
40|$|The alloantiserum-dependent lysis of TLX 9 {{lymphoma}} cells by peritoneal {{cells from}} Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) -treated mice was inhibited 62 percent by depletion of oxygen. This effect {{did not appear}} to be a result of interference with mitochondrial respiration because cyanide, azide, and dinitrophenol did not inhibit cytotoxicity. Preincubating the effector cells for 2 h without glucose, which markedly reduces their ability to release hydrogen peroxide, likewise suppressed antibody-dependent cytolysis by 62 percent. Lysis of sensitized lymphoma cells was virtually abolished by 6 mg/ml of thioglycollate broth, a concentration that also abrogated the detectable release of hydrogen peroxide and the lysis of lymphoma cells by BCG-activated macrophages in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This concentration of thioglycollate broth was not toxic to the effector cells, as judged by adherence to <b>plastic,</b> <b>binding</b> of opsonized erythrocytes, and phagocytosis of radiolabeled starch granules. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, horseradish peroxidase, mannitol, ethanol, benzoate, and diazabicyclooctane were without consistent effects. Cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B both markedly suppressed cytolysis, whether induced by antibody or by PMA (ID(50), 0. 5 μg/ml). Cytoehalasin B was an equally potent suppressor of glucose uptake and PMA-induced hydrogen peroxide release by BCG-activated macrophages (ID(50), 0. 5 μg/ml). However, dihydrocytochalasin B lacked these latter effects, which suggests that cytotoxicity required intact contractile elements. The extracellular lysis of antibody-coated lymphoma cells by BCG-activated macrophages appears to have a predominantly oxidative basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{preferential}} {{generation of}} heat within hidden explosive materials {{would be highly}} valuable to currently-existing explosives detection technologies, due to the associated increase in vapor pressure and thus concentration of detectable vapors. In this work, the thermomechanics of plastic-bonded explosives, propellants, and surrogates thereof are investigated due to their widespread adoption in improvised explosive devices. These classes of material consist of energetic crystals held within an inert <b>plastic</b> <b>binding</b> material. Understanding the composite nature of the material, two methods of heat generation are investigated: low-frequency excitation with wavelengths on the structural-scale and ultrasonic excitation with wavelengths on the crystal-scale. ^ It is observed that direct, electrodynamic shaker-produced excitation at structural resonances of the bulk explosive structure leads to viscoelastic-like heating, with results in good agreement with classical viscoelastic theory in both beam and plate geometries. In this case, scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and infrared thermography were employed to capture the mechanical and thermal response of the structures, respectively. Typically, this type of heating was seen to induce a 2 degrees C surface temperature rise over 60 min with 2 g of base excitation. Further related work included {{the development of an}} experimental methodology to determine the wavespeeds of common binder materials. ^ Excitation at ultrasonic frequencies was investigated first in fully-loaded energetic composites, revealing the possibility of heat generation in response to direct ultrasonic stimulus. In this frequency regime incident energy is expected to interact not with the bulk structure but with the individual crystals of the plastic-bonded explosive. Further studies involved the creation of unique single-crystal samples excited with piezoelectric ultrasonic patch transducers. This method elicited very strong heating after just 2 s, up to approximately 10 degrees C and larger. In certain cases, chemical decomposition of energetic crystals has occurred {{as a result of this}} heating. To compare between samples, a 1 -dimensional semi-infinite thermal model was fit to the transient surface temperature profiles to estimate the heat generation strength and source depth. Crystalline inclusions were observed to generate significantly more heat than spherical inclusions, with no significant dependency on energetic content. Further studies suggest that more irregular crystals exhibit a greater probability of exhibiting significant heating. Finally, initial work on high solids loading 2 ̆ 7 particles-of-particles 2 ̆ 7 is discussed, highlighting a possible link between solids loading and susceptibility to chemical decomposition in response to ultrasonic stimuli. ...|$|E

40|$|Background- We {{propose a}} new {{surgical}} procedure for advanced heart failure- adaptive cardiac binding- {{which allows for}} a gradual increase in compression on the dilated heart with separate loads {{on the left and}} right ventricles. Method- A canine model of biventricular heart failure (arteriovenous anastomosis – AVA, and doxorubicin administration) was created. Twenty-four dogs were divided into four groups: control, adynamic cardiomyoplasty (CMP), usual <b>plastic</b> cardiac <b>binding</b> (PCB), and adaptive cardiac binding (ACB). Systolic and diastolic area and volume and LVEF were measured before creation of heart failure, six weeks after, immediately after main operation, and 4 weeks later. In the animal group with ACB, liquid was added incrementally (35 ml, 15 ml, and finally 10 ml) to each side of the pouch at weeks 1, 2, and 3. Results- LVEF was 59 ± 4 % before AVA and doxorubicin administration and dropped to 27 ± 2 % six weeks later. Immediately after the main operation, LVEF was 35 ± 3 % (CMP), 34 ± 4 % (PCB), and 35 ± 4 (ACB) (p> 0. 05 between groups). Four weeks later...|$|R
40|$|Team Rhin-O-Tuff {{was asked}} by Performance Design Inc. to develop a simpler, cheaper {{and easier to use}} machine to spin <b>plastic</b> coil <b>bindings</b> onto pre-punched {{document}}s. The Gate-R-Trap semi-automated binding system modernizes the document binding industry and by taking the document out of the user’s hands during the binding process. It utilizes a uniquely designed coil guide insertion system that increases successful binding by 20 %. The prototype includes a document sizing tray that automatically provides the user digital feedback for the appropriate coil size for each individual document. This makes manual measurement no longer required. The Gate-R-Trap’s floating head draws the coil through the document as opposed to previous technology which pushes the coil from behind. This can be compared to the proverbial “pushing versus pulling a rope” analogy creating less coil deformation and document damage. The Gate-R-Trap also includes a built-in cutting and crimping system to remove the coil overrun at each document end. In past roller insertion systems, the user had to remove excess coil with hand held pliers. Overall, the Gate-R-Trap system combines user friendliness, efficiency, and functionality in a much more cost effective platform than any other product currently in its target price range...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveFat {{embolization}} to {{the brain}} {{is a potential problem}} in cardiac surgery, assumed to originate from retransfused pericardial suction blood. Our aim was to measure the fat content in pericardial suction blood and to determine how it can be reduced by simple spontaneous density separation and surface absorption. MethodsPericardial suction blood was collected during routine coronary bypass procedures and analyzed for blood-suspended fat and <b>plastic</b> surface <b>binding.</b> A single-chamber bag (n = 10) was compared with a fat-reducing system having a stacked 2 -chamber design (n = 10). The fat-reducing system was also tested experimentally (n = 12) with heat-extracted liquid wound fat (1. 25 %) mixed with mediastinal drain blood. ResultsPericardial suction blood contained 1. 5 mL (0. 63 / 2. 19) of fat suspended in 418 mL (269 / 631) of blood (median and quartiles). Surface-bound fat accounted for 24 % (12 / 35). Experimental analysis of the new system revealed an 83 % (71 / 92) fat-reduction rate (P <. 001). This rate was confirmed under clinical conditions, suggesting 80 % reduction (72 / 86; P =. 001). The fat-reducing system also gave a small but significant red blood cell concentrating effect (P =. 001). ConclusionsIt was confirmed that pericardial suction blood contains fat, possibly having an embolic potential. The new system allowed fat to separate by density while pericardial suction blood was temporally retained and incubated. A significant portion of fat adheres to the plastic surface, which added to the reduction. The method appeared efficient. It is proposed that pericardial suction blood should be collected during surgery to evaluate the need for retransfusion and to allow fat reduction...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Non-coding {{regulatory}} {{regions are}} strongly implicated in human disease via genetic studies. However, {{it is currently}} not possible to interpret reliably and systematically the functional consequences of genetic variation within any given transcription factor recognition sequence. To {{lay the groundwork for}} the assessment of regulatory variation in human disease, I comprehensively analyzed heritable genome-wide binding patterns of a major sequence-specific regulator (CTCF) in relation to genetic variability in binding site sequences across a three-generation pedigree as well as 19 diverse human cell types. We identified hundreds of genetic variants with reproducible quantitative effects on CTCF occupancy (both positive and negative). While these effects paralleled protein-DNA recognition energetics when averaged, they were extensively buffered by striking local context dependencies. Examining variation across multiple cell types, we observed highly reproducible yet surprisingly <b>plastic</b> genomic <b>binding</b> landscapes, indicative of strong cell-selective regulation of CTCF occupancy. Comparison with massively parallel bisulfite sequencing data indicates that 41 % of variable CTCF binding is linked to differential DNA methylation, concentrated at two critical positions within the CTCF recognition sequence. These results establish the feasibility of studying the regulatory architecture of human disease. I then apply the framework developed in the CTCF model system to the interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have identified many non-coding variants associated with common diseases and traits. We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). 88 % of such DHSs are active during fetal development, and are enriched for gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identify distant gene targets for hundreds of DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrate tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs, and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. This dissertation establishes a framework for the study of regulatory variation, suggests pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease, and provides pathogenic insights into diverse disorders...|$|R
