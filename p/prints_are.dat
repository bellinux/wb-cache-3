5|$|Photographer Ansel Adams {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his {{photographs}} of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E
5|$|Spore <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly ellipsoidal, {{and typically}} measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|E

50|$|As a curiosum {{it can be}} {{mentioned}} that Bad Afro Records since the beginning as a vinyl based record label has had a policy that {{makes it easy to}} tell the difference between first print of the LP’s or 7” singles and later <b>prints.</b> First <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on black vinyl, second <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on red vinyl, 3rd <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on green vinyl and 4th <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on purple vinyl.|$|R
5|$|Footprints {{belonging}} to the ichnogenus Brachychirotherium are often associated with aetosaurs. Brachychirotherium has been found from Rio Grande do Sul in Paleorrota, Brazil as well as Italy, Germany, and the eastern United States. They are also common in the southwestern United States, having been found from Canyonlands National Park and Dinosaur National Monument. Many of these tracks have a narrow gauge (meaning left and right <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> placed closely together) and nearly overstep each other. A 2011 functional analysis of the skeleton of Typothorax coccinarum indicated that it had the range of movement necessary to produce the tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E
5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving on all fours, but the foot <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
5|$|Spore <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> dark brown, {{sometimes}} with violet shades. Spores are thick-walled with an apical pore, and elongated ellipsoid to equilateral in face view, and somewhat inequilateral in side view, typically measuring 12.0–12.6–13.1 by 6.8–7.1–7.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, four-spored with sterigmata up to 5.5μm long, and have dimensions of 27–37 by 9–11μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} hyphae. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and variably shaped, and range from narrow clubs to narrow flasks with a neck no longer than 8μm; their dimensions are typically 20–30 by 6–8μm. The pleurocystidia (found on the gill face) are common; they are broadly club-shaped but taper to a point ({{sometimes with}} a rounded tip at the end), and measure 25–35 by 9–14μm. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are also present, with variable shapes similar to the cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E

25|$|Patent <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> chance {{friction}} ridge impressions {{which are}} obvious {{to the human}} eye and which {{have been caused by}} the transfer of foreign material from a finger onto a surface. Some obvious examples would be impressions from flour and wet clay. Because they are already visible and have no need of enhancement they are generally photographed rather than being lifted in the way that latent <b>prints</b> <b>are.</b> An attempt to preserve the actual print is always made for later presentation in court, and there are many techniques used to do this. Patent prints can be left on a surface by materials such as ink, dirt, or blood.|$|E

50|$|Printing {{technologies}} {{divide between}} sheet-based and roll-to-roll-based approaches. Sheet-based inkjet and screen <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> best for low-volume, high-precision work. Gravure, offset and flexographic <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m²/h). While offset and flexographic <b>printing</b> <b>are</b> mainly used for inorganic and organic conductors (the latter also for dielectrics), gravure <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, {{due to high}} layer quality. If high resolution is needed, gravure is also suitable for inorganic and organic conductors. Organic field-effect transistors and integrated circuits can be prepared completely by means of mass-printing methods.|$|R
25|$|Thereafter {{engraving}} {{tended to}} lose ground to etching, {{which was a}} much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although Rembrandt's <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> generally all called etchings for convenience, {{many of them have}} some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.|$|E
25|$|Much of America’s aesthetic, economic, {{and social}} history {{is found in}} works on paper, a {{category}} that includes drawings, prints, and watercolors. The ACMAA began to actively collect works on paper in 1967. The collection today numbers several thousand items by noted artists of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} to the present. Drawings and paintings range from preliminary studies to fully realized compositions. Most nineteenth-century prints originated as reproductions intended for dissemination to the public and depict subjects relevant to the American experience. Twentieth-century and later <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> fine art prints made by a variety of processes as a means of artistic self-expression.|$|E
25|$|A plastic {{print is}} a {{friction}} ridge impression {{left in a}} material that retains {{the shape of the}} ridge detail. Although very few criminals would be careless enough to leave their prints in a lump of wet clay, this would make a perfect plastic print. Commonly encountered examples are melted candle wax, putty removed from the perimeter of window panes and thick grease deposits on car parts. Such <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> already visible and need no enhancement, but investigators must not overlook the potential that invisible latent prints deposited by accomplices may also be on such surfaces. After photographically recording such prints, attempts should be made to develop other non-plastic impressions deposited from sweat or other contaminants.|$|E
