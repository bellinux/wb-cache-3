5000|$|Initially, the {{commemoration}} of Defenders Day was {{divided between the}} two sites; one focusing on the Battle of North Point {{and the other on}} [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] and the bombardment of Fort McHenry. The development of the holiday followed the evolution of the local state militia units. The first phase was the transition from the involuntary militia system that existed prior to the War of 1812 to the Voluntary militia system that emerged during the war period itself. The second phase was the development of the Voluntary Militia into the local parochial political-militia-business alliance that peaked with dominance of the Know Nothing (American Party) with its third party politics just prior to the Civil War. The third was the transition from parochial patriotism to national patriotism during the Civil War. Finally in the fourth phase, after the War Between the States, the local militia disappeared (later reorganized into state National Guard with divided state and Federal authority / command structure by the 1880s) and the local parochial patriotic military units traditions were largely forgotten or replaced with new national patriotic ideas and traditions. In the first phase the local militia viewed the national government as allies. During the second the parochial political-militia-business alliance viewed the national government with increasing hostility, as expressed by the Maryland state anthem [...] "Maryland, My Maryland", written after civil strife ("Pratt Street Riots") on Baltimore streets {{at the beginning of the}} Civil War in April 1861. During the second phase, the myth and lore of Defender's Day were used to support <b>parochial</b> Nativism (<b>politics).</b> In the third phase the parochial nationalism and nativism of the pre-Civil War militia disappeared since those groups had moved to South Carolina or later Virginia to enlist and join individually or the Maryland southerner regiments in the Confederate States Army. In the fourth phase, nativism returned with the former Confederate veterans and after a struggle between the militias, formed from the Union veterans and their rival militias formed from Confederate veterans, the post Civil War militias were replaced by the creation of the Maryland National Guard. The replacement of the state militias by the National Guard also produced a replacement of the politics and cultural traditions that supported the militias. Hence, the {{commemoration of}} the Battle of North Point declined in favor of the celebration of the Star Spangled Banner.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary liberal {{philosophers}} {{have spent}} considerable time defending a public reason liberal politics in which citizens publicly deliberate about laws and policies but bracket their private moral, philosophical, and religious worldviews when doing so. Instead of their parochial worldviews, {{citizens in the}} public forum are to deliberate about laws and policies using public reason - principles, values, and inquiry guidelines that all citizens can accept as free and equal. The current literature, however, makes oversimplifications in two areas, causing it to neglect serious obstacles facing a public reason liberal politics. First, the literature oversimplifies {{the idea of a}} worldview, causing it to underplay the epistemic obstacles that face citizens in setting aside their <b>parochial</b> worldviews in <b>politics.</b> Second, the literature oversimplifies the elements that go into arriving at a political solution, causing it to overlook the inability of public reason to arrive at and publicly justify answers to some political questions. This dissertation avoids these oversimplifications and, subsequently, offers a refined version of a public reason liberal politics that addresses the obstacles that these oversimplifications originally masked. First, in light of a more detailed understanding of a worldview, a public reason liberal politics must work into its procedures formal segments in which participants exchange and attend to worldviews. Second, in light of a more detailed understanding of the elements that go into reasoning to a political solution, a public reason liberal politics must work into its theoretical structure a convergence conception of public justification that can inform deliberative processes capable of reaching publicly justified political outcomes when public reason is incomplete...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} new approach to the age-old social science problem of the underlying causes of economic development. It focuses on two initially very similar cross-border pairs of cities (McAllen, TX - Reynosa, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, TX - Matamoros, Tamaulipas) along the U. S. - Mexico border. The comparison of these two cross-border city pairs reveals that differences in patterns of local behavior led one small city on the US side, McAllen, to successfully exploit the opportunities offered by NAFTA after 1994. A review of relevant economic and demographic data as well as one year of in depth field investigation show that the differences in local outcomes cannot be explained by established causes. Their pre-NAFTA endowments were essentially the same, and McAllen and Brownsville pursued very similar economic development policies. Rather, I trace the economic divergence to the means by which local elites introduced and contested their projects. These differences and similarities enable us to speak of a community's "repertoire," a term borrowed from Tilly (1977, 1993, 2006) and Swidler (1986) to characterize a group's means pursuing and contesting goals with each other. Insofar as they pertain to patterns of communications and trust, repertoires relate to the network literature; however, in the cases observed here, the repertoires seem to predate the key networks of interaction, and, in a sense, to produce rather than to reflect them, suggesting that they are the underlying causal mechanism upon which we need to focus. While very similar for much of their early history, the two US-side cities' repertoires diverged around the 1930 s. This took place when a region-wide shift in demographics and industrial base overturned the political boss structure that was common throughout South Texas. Insurgents in McAllen were {{left to their own devices}} and defeated their local boss after twenty years of struggle, in the process instituting a new local repertoire based on the "progressive," technocratic, pro-business politics they had brought with them from the American Midwest. Meanwhile, their peers in Brownsville overturned their political boss in half the time, albeit by allying with local pre-existing boss opponents who knew only the old polarized, <b>parochial</b> approach to <b>politics.</b> Thus the long-term history of these cities offers the possibility that repertoires can change dramatically when new resource flows are harnessed by groups who are able to articulate a set of political practices without interruption or cooptation from those steeped in a prevailing repertoire. Although the differences among the two cities' repertoires were apparently inconsequential to their growth patterns during the era of industrial agriculture (1930 s- 1980 s), the opening to global capital in the 1990 s provided a venue where McAllen's "collective, constructive and cosmopolitan" repertoire far outperformed Brownsville's set of "atomized, antagonistic, and atypical" practices and understandings. Despite the consistency of these practices over time, there is significant variety in actors' ongoing attempts to come to grips with and solve their problems in uncertain situations. Significant, sustained deviations from local repertoire occur in both McAllen and Brownsville in the present day. In McAllen, the political and social isolation of its local physicians led them to stymie the construction of a medical school in their city, a project which had been a major goal of nearly every other element of the local political and economic elite. Similarly, in Brownsville, the completion of a multi-use education, research, and business development center (called the ITEC) demonstrates that exceptions can arise and produce more than momentary, fleeting effects. Furthermore, the ITEC was the project of the University of Texas at Brownsville, whose involvement in many cases of Brownsville politics-as-usual raises the possibility that organizations are capable of deploying multiple distinct repertoires. These observations taken together suggest the following contributions: first, that economic development can be as much an outcome of locally ingrained cultural practices, tools and techniques as of traditionally defined factors such as geography, human capital, institutions, and policies. Moreover, these local cultures are not simply reducible to other apparent causes of development. Second, it demonstrates that to assess constraints and opportunities in local economic development, repertoires should be taken into account by observing actors in their everyday experiences and experiments across different institutions. Finally, this research shows that repertoires of development are subject to change through groups' ongoing experiences of learning to communicate and coordinate with each other, and that understanding the contingencies therein can help us to better grasp the causes of economic stability and change. by Seth Daniel Pipkin.

5000|$|The {{politically}} charged momentum of charter schools is partially {{due to the}} fact that it has gained supporters from both sides of the political spectrum; liberals support the idea of “accountable reform” within the public school system, while conservatives support a system that competes with traditional public schools. State and local support of charter schools is inextricably embroiled within <b>parochial</b> <b>politics,</b> and affected by the needs, desires, and incentives posed by local education systems. Accordingly, attitudes towards charter schools vary by state, and it is difficult to make a general statement about charter schools in the national political imagination. Ray Budde, in his 1996 article “The Evolution of the Charter Concept” explained that while the stakeholders in a traditional public school district may not be inclined to introduce reforms for altruistic or idealistic reasons, they might “restructure the establishment if they felt that they were under severe pressure and that not changing would have more serious consequences than changing.” [...] Budde’s 15-year-old prediction has proved true, as many urban school systems have been pushed to adopt drastic reform measures solely to stop students from fleeing to charter schools.|$|E

40|$|Very {{preliminary}} {{and incomplete}} This paper investigates {{the impact of}} Muslim political representation on religious conflict in India during 1980 - 2007. We code religion from name and construct updated conflict data from Times of India archives. The analysis is currently conducted at the district level. We instrument the share of Muslims elected to state assemblies from the index district with the share of Muslims who won against non-Muslims in close elections in that district. Preliminary results suggest that raising the share of Muslim politicians in state assemblies results in a sizeable decline {{in the incidence of}} Hindu-Muslim riots, consistent with evidence that Muslims are more often the victims of such incidents. A significant but small part of the total effect appears to arise from positive selection of minority leaders. Our results are consistent with <b>parochial</b> <b>politics</b> and with theories that indicate the relevance of political identity for policy outcomes (Besley and Coate, 1997). They also suggests a cause of conflict, and hence a solution for the control of conflict, that has not been previously considered in the conflict literature. * Contact...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn December 13, 2001, the 107 th Congress authorized {{a round of}} base realignment and closure (BRAC) for 2005. This policy decision was preceded by years of political dispute and dialogue between Congress and the executive branch. Much of this debate centered on the Clinton Administration's privatization-in-place of two bases scheduled for closure by the 1995 BRAC Commission and the dispute over estimated BRAC costs and savings. After painstaking compromise and a national security crisis, reformed BRAC legislation was passed, balancing political leadership and national strategy with job loss and disruption to local communities. A comprehensive analysis of journal articles, books, relevant congressional records, government reports, and legislation identifies the variables that explain Congress's decision to amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and authorize a BRAC round in 2005. Congress eventually approved BRAC 2005 because: (1) a new presidential administration concurred with DoD's argument regarding excessive infrastructure and anticipated savings from BRAC; (2) national economic conditions could not support both spending for excess infrastructure {{and the war on}} terrorism; (3) studies confirmed that most communities can rebound economically after a base closure; and (4) the improved BRAC law purportedly reduced the <b>parochial</b> <b>politics</b> of base closings.

40|$|The Black Consciousness {{philosophy}} {{with its}} focus on black solidarity, the exclusion of whites from the black struggle for liberation, being consciously black and black self-determination, amongst some of the principles espoused by the Black Consciousness philosophy may prima-facie seem to be advocating a <b>parochial</b> <b>politics</b> of race or even a racially exclusionist politics obsessed with cultural authenticity and racial peculiarity. Black Consciousness from such an optic {{may seem to be}} more in line with other race centred systems such as apartheid based on white superiority as opposed to a politics that rejects a race centred approach to political life. Certain readings of Black Consciousness reflect the philosophy as espousing a more regressive as opposed to a progressive liberatory politics. Furthermore, Black Consciousness with {{its focus on}} race its critics will argue is not in line with a politics of non-racialism which seeks a total rejection of race. However, such an understanding of non-racialism is a very limited and unsophisticated one as it entails a rejection of race without first engaging with the concrete reality of race, while also assuming that a rejection of race entails integration. Indeed, it may be a great goal to attain a society in which race does not matter and in which it is not a determining factor in the life of any individual. Yet, to not see race when race has had and continues to have a profound impact on South African society, especially the poor black majority, may serve to be more regressive than progressive. In a society where inequality manifests along racial lines a hastily sought integration may not serve to attain the desired outcome of a genuine non-racial society. Equality thus becomes a central perquisite to make possible the attainment of a non-racial society unhindered by the limitations of white superiority and black inferiority. With the persistence of inequality accompanied by white domination and acquiescing blacks a non-racial society will serve to be an illusion. Biko, through his articulation of the Black Consciousness philosophy sought the attainment of a radical egalitarianism; this from the Black Consciousness optic being the condition upon which a non-racial politics and society could be forged. Black Consciousness has the ability to create a truly non-racial subject, its sophisticated conception of race which conceives of race as being consciously contrived can serve to illustrate the implicit non-racial outlook of the Black Consciousness philosophy. Through the project of Black Consciousness the end goal could indeed be perceived as being a radical egalitarian non-racial society. The overall tenor is that Black Consciousness complements non-racialism more than it contradicts it...|$|E
