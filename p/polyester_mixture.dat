40|$|Department Of Mechanical EngineeringWhile fiber-reinforced polymer {{composites}} (FRPCs) exhibit excellent in-plane properties, {{dominated by}} microscopic fiber reinforcement, their out-of-plane performance, {{governed by the}} polymer matrix, is relatively poor, and their vulnerability to delamination is of great concern. Reinforcing the polymer matrix by adding nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has gained popularity as their extremely large surface area and exceptional properties allow high reinforcing efficiency. However, load transfer between nano-reinforcement and matrix relies on the capacity to disperse and distribute them in the host matrix and also to ensure good distribution on the fabric. When the nanofiller agglomerates are larger than the gaps in a porous fabric medium, “filtration” becomes an issue. The nanofiller aggregates tend to block these gaps leading to slow and incomplete resin impregnation. This inevitable phenomenon mainly occurs near the inlet, where most of filtration takes place, {{while the rest of}} the composite shows a “diluted” resin-rich phase even for well-dispersed nanofiller-resin mixture prior to infusion. It is important to effectively investigate the final properties of the composite prior to service to ensure a quasi-defect-free or safe composite when using liquid molding techniques. In a conventional vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process, a filtration effect leads to an inhomogeneous microstructure of multiscale composites. For this reason, concerns over producing high-quality and multifunctional composites structures serve as the driving forces for the development of hierarchical composites via interface/interphase modification by means of coated nanoscale additives, and their applications in large-scale parts are therefore envisaged. However, to date, limited studies have been reported on monitoring and control of this novel materials processing in order to reduce part-to-part variability for reliable manufacturing. Here, we introduce novel methodologies for resin flow, cure and process monitoring of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) /glass fiber/unsaturated polyester composites using percolated CNT conductive networks. Two cases are considered where CNTs are: (1) premixed in a resin, or (2) spray-coated on fiber reinforcements prior to infusion. In the case of CNT-coated glass fibers, systematic experiments showed that resistance behavior of the as-deposited conductive network can be used to identify critical events that take place during the entire composite processing cycle, including the onset of crosslinking and gel point of resin, which are necessary to evaluate the part quality. A combination of short-length and low-density MWCNTs exhibited the best sensitivity. 3 D real-time monitoring was successfully carried out with simultaneous in-plane and through-thickness resin flow monitoring. A case study was investigated, where the design and manufacturing guidelines applicable to spray-coated CNTs and CNT/exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) hybrids on fiber reinforcements were developed for electromagnetic (EMI) shielding. The research adopted a multi-phase approach that combined both numerical and experimental methods to help lay the groundwork for the fundamental understanding of the underlying physics governing the EMI shielding mechanisms of the composite materials. Simulation and experimental results showed that the contributions of reflection and absorption to EMI shielding is enhanced by sufficient impedance mismatching, while multiple reflections have a negative effect. For a given amount of carbon nanomaterial in the glass-fiber-reinforced composite, coating the outermost, instead of intermediate glass fiber plies with the MWCNT:xGnP weight ratio of 8 : 2 was found to maximize the conductivity and EMI shielding efficiency. In the case of infusing MWCNTs premixed in a resin, a study was performed to correlate the rheological behavior of MWCNT/unsaturated <b>polyester</b> <b>mixture</b> to the conditions experienced during flow. The resin containing well-dispersed MWCNTs resulted in a nominal increase in suspension viscosity with shear thinning behavior, and was within the desired range for VARTM. Trade-offs among sensitive parameters, such as viscosity, degree of dispersion, MWCNT type and concentration, was investigated to minimize CNT filtration. The degree of dispersion appeared as the dominant factor that dictates the degree of filtration. The filtration level was characterized in situ by monitoring the electrical resistance change in the glass fibers during infusion. As the CNT/resin mixture enters the initially insulating glass fiber layup, the electrodes placed in the fibers display decreases in electrical resistance as the mixture flow progresses. At the completion of infusion, the final resistance readings indicate the uniformity of CNT distribution affected by filtration. Concomitantly, the CNT/resin mixture flow behavior was monitored. Similarly, events that take place after the completion of infusion were indirectly monitored. We have demonstrated simple yet effective methods to monitor the manufacturing processes and predict the final part quality of multiscale hybrid composites, which can be integrated into the existing processes with minimal modifications. ope...|$|E

Polyurethane is lighter, more flexible, and less prone to chipping and breakage than polyester or natural materials. Like <b>polyester,</b> polyurethane <b>mixtures</b> can vary, and different mixtures have different textures and strengths. If the polyurethane is too soft it will split apart when the hold is tightened, or the bolt might get pulled through the hold. If the polyurethane is too hard it will be brittle like polyester. Polyurethane holds do not hold up as well when exposed to the sun and rain, so {{they are not as}} good for permanent outdoor walls as other holds will be. Polyurethane also has significant issues in life-span compared with Polyester, with some busy climbing walls getting as little as one years use from polyurethane holds. Climbers often complain of polyurethane feeling plastic-like and becoming warm with intensive use. Additionally, the lack of rigidity sometimes gives climbers a feeling that the hold is flexing under their weight. Polyurethane is the leading hold material in the USA. However, there is an Atlantic split with most of Europe preferring modern Polyester mixes.|$|R

40|$|Surfaces {{which are}} {{strongly}} non-wetting to oil and other {{low surface tension}} liquids can be realized by trapping microscopic pockets of air within the asperities of a re-entrant texture and generating a solidliquid- vapor composite interface. For low surface tension liquids like hexadecane (γlv = 27. 5 mN/m), this composite interface is metastable due to the low value of the equilibrium contact angle. Consequently pressure perturbations can result in an irreversible transition of the metastable composite interface to the fully-wetted interface. In this work, we use a simple dip-coating and thermal annealing procedure to tune the liquid wettability of commercially available <b>polyester</b> fabrics. A <b>mixture</b> of 10 % 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-heptadecafluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (fluorodecyl POSS) and 90 % polyethyl methacrylate (PEMA) is used to uniformly coat the fabric surface topography. Contact angle measurements show that a robust metastable composite interface with high apparent contact angles can be supported for hexadecane (γlv = 27. 5 mN/m) and dodecane (γlv = 25. 3 mN/m). To tune the solid surface energy of the coated surface, we also developed a reversible treatment using thermal annealing of the surface in contact with either dry air or water. The tunability of the solid surface energy along with the inherent re-entrant texture of the polyester fabric result in reversibly switchable oleophobicity between a highly non-wetting state and a fully wetted state for low surface tension liquids like hexadecane and dodecane. This tunability can be explained within a design parameter framework which provides a quantitative criterion for the transition between the two states, as well as accurate predictions of the measured values of the apparent contact angle (θ*) for the dip-coated polyester fabrics.

40|$|In HVAC and {{refrigeration}} systems, a {{small portion}} of the oil circulates with the refrigerant flow through the cycle components, while most of the oil stays in the compressor. The circulating oil can form a fairly homogeneous mixture with the liquid refrigerant, or it can exist as a separate oil-rich film inside the small tubes and headers of a microchannel heat exchanger; the amount of oil held up is affected by the system conditions. The oil retention in the microchannel type condenser is of particular interest as the amount of oil in excess in this component affects the heat transfer capacity and increases the frictional pressure losses. This paper presents a new physics-based model of the oil retention in microchannel-type condensers. The model calculates the local thermodynamic properties in each section for the refrigerant R- 410 A and <b>Polyester</b> (POE) oil <b>mixture</b> based on the local oil concentration, pressure, temperature, and mass flux. Then the model, which was experimentally validated, predicts the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. The simulation results indicated that the pressure losses increased by over 20 % when the oil mass flow rate fraction increased up to 5 weight percent. The augmented mixture viscosity resulted in high frictional pressure drops and shear stress during the two phase flow condensation. The refrigerant side correlations were validated against literature data for in-tube two-phase flow condensation but further investigation is needed for the single-phase annular type flow in microchannel with refrigerant vapor and oil. At low degree of superheat the heat transfer coefficient of the refrigerant and oil mixture was basically unaffected by the oil mass fraction up to 3 weight percent. When the oil mass fraction was higher than 3 weight percent, then the heat transfer capacity of the condenser decreased. At high degree of superheat, the heat transfer coefficient of the oil and refrigerant mixture was penalized when the Oil Mass Fraction (OMF) was higher than 2 weight percent. Further investigation is needed on the suitability and accuracy of the heat transfer coefficients correlations to be adopted with superheated vapor refrigerant and lubricant film in annular flow at the inlet section of the microchannel type condenser...|$|R
40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters {{produced}} and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy {{by a wide}} range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB) -co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate (3 HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175 - 180 °C. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non- 3 HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3 -hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3 -hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3 HB and 3 HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3 - hydroxyalkanoate (3 HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3 HB, 3 HV, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methylvalerate (3 HMV) and 3 -hydroxy- 3 - methylbutyrate (3 HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3 HB, 3 HV and minor amounts of 3 HMV and 3 HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &sup 1 H and ¹&sup 3 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these <b>polyesters</b> are <b>mixtures</b> of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non- 3 HB monomers (30 ± 5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3 HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3 HV fraction. The 3 HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28 % of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41 % based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both {{the quantity and quality of}} the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3 HB-co- 3 HV-co- 3 HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380 - 460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95 ± 3 %) copolymers of 3 HB, 3 HV, 3 HMV and 3 HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3 HB and 3 HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3 HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3 HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390 - 560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 °C, glass transition temperatures between - 8 and 0 °C, and melting enthalpies (ΔHm) between 9. 1 and 31. 5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3 HMV and 3 HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3 HV& 3 HMV-rich copolymers and 3 HB& 3 HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3 HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers...|$|R
