METHODS: After weaning, 56 Wistar rats which had been submitted to under-nutrition since birth, were divided randomly into 7 groups, according to the diet supplied, namely: control, vitamin deficient, mineral deficient, vitamin and mineral deficient, vitamin deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture", mineral deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture", and vitamin and mineral deficient supplemented with "multi-mixture". The recorded weight gains during the treatment period, together with the <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> and the food <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios,</b> were taken as indicators of the efficiency of "multi-mixture" as a vitamin and/or mineral supplement.

5000|$|The most {{important}} aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition. There are multiple systems which rate proteins by their usefulness to an organism based on their relative percentage of amino acids and, in some systems, the digestibility of the protein source. They include biological value, net protein utilization, and PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acids Score). Also see complete protein, nitrogen balance and protein combining. The PDCAAS {{was developed by the}} FDA as an improvement over the <b>Protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (PER) method. The PDCAAS rating is a fairly recent evaluation method; it was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as [...] "the preferred 'best'" [...] method to determine protein quality. These organizations have suggested that other methods for evaluating the quality of protein are inferior.|$|E
50|$|The PDCAAS {{value is}} {{different}} from measuring the quality of protein from the <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (PER) and the biological value (BV) methods. The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably {{differ from those of}} humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it {{does not take into account}} certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.|$|E
5000|$|When {{measuring}} the nutritional value of protein, the original <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (PER) method, first proposed by Thomas Burr Osborne and Lafayette Mendel in 1917, {{was the most}} widely used method until 1990. This method was found to be flawed for the biological evaluation of protein quality because the young rats used in the study had higher relative requirements for sulfur-containing amino acids than did humans. As such, the analytical method universally recognized by the FAO/WHO (1990), as well as the FDA, USDA, United Nations University and the National Academy of Sciences when judging the quality of protein is the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score, as it is viewed as accurately {{measuring the}} correct relative nutritional value of animal and vegetable sources of protein in the diet.Based on this method, soy protein is considered to have a similar equivalent in protein quality to animal proteins. Egg white has a score of 1.00, soy concentrate 0.99, beef 0.92, and isolated soy protein 0.92. In 1990 at an FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or [...] "leveled down" [...] to 1.0, as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.|$|E

Significantly higher amounts of chlorophyll a and numbers of zooplankton were found in ponds fertilized with chicken manure.

The addition of wheat bran to puppy rations, bringing the neutral detergent fibre up to 16 % in a 21 % crude protein diet had no deleterious effects on feed intake, feed and protein efficiency or growth in Beagle puppies. Over a sufficiently long period of time, the growth of this group did not differ from that of the controls (12 % neutral detergent fibre, 23 % crude protein) although it was higher at intermediate times. The effects of the high fibre (22 or 23 % neutral detergent fibre) diets on growth, feed intake feed efficiency and <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> are consistent with an energy deficit resulting from the animals' inability to adapt fully to the dilution of their rations leading to lower growth, less efficient use of feed and, in the case of group 3 (22 % crude protein, 22 % neutral detergent fibre), a lower <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio.</b> The <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> of group 4 (16 % crude protein, 23 % neutral detergent fibre) was higher than that of group 3, most likely the result of a more limiting amount of dietary protein leading to a more efficient use for growth by the animal. We have concluded that intermediate levels of neutral detergent fibre (up to 16 %) were not deleterious even in puppy rations. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus vulgaris {{both look}} alike and {{belong to the}} genus Citrullus except that Citrullus colocynthis has thick black ring round its circumference. However, {{they are among the}} underutilized seeds of the World. Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus vulgaris seed flours were {{analyzed}} for their amino acid and proximate compositions which was further subjected to statistical analysis to determine the correlation between the proximate compositions of the two species. The seeds show significant difference in fat and protein contents, but they are both good sources of fats and protein with values (56. 00 and 49. 59) % fat and (24. 37 and 32. 96) % protein contents for Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus vulgaris respectively. However, they are closely related in fibre (1. 91 and 2. 00) %, moisture (3. 08 and 2. 75) % and ash contents (3. 15 and 3. 53) % respectively. The percentage essential amino acids of the seeds are also closely related: Citrullus colocynthis (52. 73) and Citrullus vulgaris (50. 86). The biological values of Citrullus colocynthis and Citrullus vulgaris are significantly different (12. 83 and 26. 35) with <b>Protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> that are closely related (2. 71 and 2. 58) respectively...|$|R
40|$|Hazelnut {{meal was}} {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} protein source to fishmeal in diets for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (initial wt 57. 5 ± 0. 1 g). Hazelnut meal was incorporated in the diet at levels of 0 % (control), 7. 5 %, 15 %, 22. 5 %, and 30 %. Diets were tested in triplicate for ten weeks. Higher levels of hazelnut meal produced better growth performance, that was sig- nificantly higher in fish fed 30 % hazelnut meal than in the control (p< 0. 05). Feed utilization and <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> followed a similar trend while the level of hazelnut meal did not significantly affect whole body composi- tion. Apparent digestibility of dry matter and energy of fish fed hazelnut meal at all levels was significantly lower than in fish fed the control (p< 0. 05). Crude and digestible protein, as well as energy retention, were significant- ly correlated with hazelnut meal level. Nevertheless, energy retention declined in fish fed 30 % hazelnut meal. Based on growth performance and nutrient retention, the optimal level of hazelnut meal in diets for rainbow trout may be around 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Five test diets were {{formulated}} using locally {{available feed}} ingredients:fishmeal, groundnut cake, rice bran, tapioca flour, and vitamin/mineral premix. Diets contained 35 % crude protein with graded lipid levels. Sardine oil was incorporated at four dietary levels: 2. 07 %, 4. 07 %, 6. 07 %, or 8. 07 %, with corresponding total lipid levels of 8. 11 %, 10. 24 %, 12. 28 %, and 14. 33 %. A diet without sardine oil (6. 05 % total lipid) served as control. The diets were fed to giant freshwater prawns, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, for 112 days. A significantly higher weight gain {{was recorded in}} the treatment with 6. 07 % sardine oil and the specific growth rate, food conversion rate, and <b>protein</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> were best in this treatment. The diet containing 8. 07 % sardine oil produced the highest RNA: DNA ratio in the prawn muscle, significantly similar to the ratio in prawns fed the 6. 07 % diet and significantly higher than in prawns fed the other diets. Digestive enzyme analyses in the digestive tract and midgut gland showed the greatest activity in prawns fed the 8. 07 % diet...|$|R
