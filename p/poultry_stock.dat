40|$|Abstract Salmonellosis is a {{frequent}} disease in <b>poultry</b> <b>stocks,</b> caused by several serotypes of the bacterial species Salmonella enterica and sometimes transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated meat or eggs. Symptom-free carriers of the bacteria contribute greatly to the propagation of the disease in <b>poultry</b> <b>stocks.</b> So far, several candidate genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to carrier state or to acute disease have been identified using artificial infection of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis or S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains in diverse genetic backgrounds, with several different infection procedures and phenotypic assessment protocols. This diversity in experimental conditions {{has led to a}} complex sum of results, but allows a more complete description of the disease. Comparisons among studies show that genes controlling resistance to Salmonella differ according to the chicken line studied, the trait assessed and the chicken's age. The loci identified are located on 25 of the 38 chicken autosomal chromosomes. Some of these loci are clustered in several genomic regions, indicating the possibility of a common genetic control for different models. In particular, the genomic regions carrying the candidate genes TLR 4 and SLC 11 A 1, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and the QTL SAL 1 are interesting for more in-depth studies. This article reviews the main Salmonella infection models and chicken lines studied under a historical perspective and then the candidate genes and QTL identified so far. </p...|$|R

Five QTL controlling variation for resistance to carrier state in a chicken F(2) progeny derived from the White Leghorn inbred lines N and 6 (1) had been previously identified using a selective genotyping approach. Here, a second analysis on the whole progeny was performed, which led to the confirmation of two QTL on chromosomes 2 and 16. To assess the utility of these genomic regions for selection in commercial lines, we tested them together with other QTL identified in an [Nx 6 (1) ] x N backcross progeny and with the candidate genes SLC 11 A 1 and TLR 4. We used a commercial line divergently selected for either low or high carrier-state resistance both in young chicks and in adult hens. In divergent chick lines, one QTL on chromosome 1 and one in the SLC 11 A 1 region were significantly associated with carrier-state resistance variations; in divergent adult lines, one QTL located in the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 16 and one in the SLC 11 A 1 region were involved in these variations. Genetic studies conducted on experimental lines can therefore be of potential interest for marker-assisted selection in commercial lines...|$|R

The EU requirements concerning poultry welfare (cage modernization etc), new growing methods friendly with the environment and food safety have led to a decline of the number of laying hens, to the closing of some poultry farms and to an increase of production cost because of the new investments.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Bacteria belonging to the Salmonella enterica species are responsible for diseases in several animal species and in humans. Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium are two of the main sources of human food poisoning. One of the most important factors is that poultry can carry these bacteria without any clinical symptoms, and thus the carriage of disease goes unnoticed prior to culling. Selection and breeding of chickens more resistant to Salmonella carrier state, i. e. able to rapidly clear Salmonella, could reduce the spread of these bacteria in <b>poultry</b> <b>stocks</b> and hence improve food safety. Selection for resistance to carrier-state requires the use of genetic markers in poultry breeding programs. Identification of such markers by several authors has been done using different approaches.

In the survey among 7 lines, a considerable {{degree of differentiation}} was estimated between each pair of lines; genetic differentiation in-dex (pairwise FST) ranged from 0. 0706 to 0. 2590. Fur-thermore, 2 genetic clustering analyses of individuals, a neighbor-joining approach based on interindividual distances and the Bayesian procedure, which can as-sign individuals to the origins of their lines based on information on multilocus genotypes, were applied to a pairwise comparison of line differentiation. In the clus-tering approaches between the lowest differentiated line pair (pairwise FST = 0. 0706), individuals from 2 differ-ent line origins could not be separated into 2 distinct clusters, which indicates that the genetic boundary of these lines is ambiguous. On the other hand, between the highest differentiated pair (pairwise FST = 0. 2590), all individuals could be strictly clustered into 2 distinct groups, consistent with the origins of their lines. In the clustering based on interindividual distances, firm sepa-rations of individuals were observed in only relatively highly differentiated pairs of lines. Furthermore, in the Bayesian procedure, even in pairs with a relatively low differentiation, individuals from 2 lines formed 2 dis-tinct clusters according to their origins.

40|$|The {{influenza}} virus, {{a member}} of the Orthomyxoviridae family, causes regular, large-scale morbidity and mortality in birds and humans and significant human suffering and economic loss. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} develop a novel influenza vaccine. Vaccines are an essential tool for the control of influenza because they increase resistance to infection, prevent illness and death and help to limit virus transmission to other birds and mammals, including humans. By reducing the environmental contamination of influenza virus in global <b>poultry</b> <b>stocks,</b> the risk of a new pandemic virus being generated by the human-avian link is diminished. Marek’s Disease is a common lymphoproliferative disease of poultry that is readily controlled worldwide using the live attenuated vaccine, CVI 988. The Marek’s Disease Virus (MDV) CVI 988 viral genome, available as a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC), forms viable infectious viral particles when transfected into Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) cells. Using BAC mutagenesis, two non-essential genes in the MDV CVI 988 BAC (UL 41 and US 10), were identified and replaced by the low pathogenic influenza haemagglutinin 10 (H 10) gene. These live recombinant MDV-H 10 vectors will allow simultaneous vaccination against both pathogens. In addition, the non-essential genes were also replaced with GFP creating MDV-GFP constructs. Both genes were expressed initially using a CMV promoter, although this disrupted the MDV CVI 988 BAC; a second promoter, PGK- 1, proved more successful. A third MDV gene (UL 50) was deleted, but severe attenuation prevented the incorporation of H 10 into this open reading frame. Future work to test the MDV-HA constructs in vivo will be carried out in collaboration with the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie in Italy.
