We introduce two new optimality filter entries based on the objective function, and thus better suited {{for the purposes of}} minimization, and <b>propose</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> inexact Hessians. We show that the global convergence properties of the method remain true under such modifications. We also introduce a new optimization solver for the solution of nonlinear programming problems, called ipfilter, based on our primal-dual interior-point filter approach. The numerical results reported show that ipfilter is competitive both in efficiency and robustness and can handle large instances...|$|R

The formation of such resonant solitons excited by femtosecond pulses in InxGa 1 â€‘xAsyP 1 â€‘y quantum wells is investigated numerically using a phenomenological model based on the local-field approximation, and a realistic configuration for their experimental observation is <b>proposed.</b> The pumping <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>using</b> complex resonant soliton dynamics as an efficient source of continuum generation are also discussed...|$|R

Each type of cutting tool leaves its own individual pattern, which can be identified as surface roughness. This research aims to enhance the surface finish quality by investigating a new method depending on the pattern left by the cutting tool. Formulae for the new method (two pass) were presented and discussed. Practically, the new technique improves surface roughness, straightness error, and roundness error by more than 50 %, 51 %, and 42 %, respectively, at the <b>proposed</b> cutting <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> all <b>used</b> workpiece materials.
