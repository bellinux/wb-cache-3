In March 1871 land plots on all the farmland were remeasured. Due to the differing altitudes {{it was possible that}} there were differences in the measurements, but in 232 cases the <b>permissible</b> <b>difference</b> was exceeded. In 100 cases it amounted to even twice the limit. The owners gave the land over to the Separationsverfahren (roughly, the process of crop rotation) and “had it given back afterwards” (uncertain literal translation of “und ließen es sich hinterher zurückgeben” from German original), as a result of which the total area of farmland was reduced. In 1906, it became apparent that roughly 90 acres / 36 hectares (180 Äcker) of Holungen, which were actually registered in the land registry, were missing. In 1925, the land was recorded twice, one for the forest treasury and the other for the municipality of Weißenborn. Holungen objected, but without any success.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} verb stem alternations {{involving}} tone, glottalization, and length in the Chin language Zahao (Osburne 1975), spoken in Burma. The {{emphasis is on}} tone, but the length facts are extremely interesting, and are given a preliminary treatment in the final section. It is argued that verbs must list stem alternants in the lexicon, but the possible pairs, and the choice of alternant in a given environment, are controlled by markedness. The data offer a theoretical challenge for an output-based grammar like Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993), in which the lexicon plays a relatively minor role in the grammar since it is inaccessible to direct control. The Zahao data adds {{to the list of}} well-known cases in which allomorphs must be listed in the lexicon, and allomorph selection is then controlled by phonological markedness (e. g. French ma/mon, ce/cet, see Tranel 1998). In Zahao, markedness indirectly constrains the set of possible tonal allomorph paradigms, because positional markedness selects the least marked allomorph in one environment, and pressure to realize the full lexical entry selects the more marked allomorph elsewhere. Output-output constraints limit the <b>permissible</b> <b>difference</b> between the two allomorphs. H and L tones tie on markedness, and exchange rules are analyzed as the result of this markedness parity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEPA’s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program Tier 1 battery {{consists}} of eleven assays intended {{to identify the}} potential of a chemical {{to interact with the}} estrogen, androgen, thyroid, or steroidogenesis systems. We have collected control data from a subset of test order recipients from the first round of screening. The analysis undertaken herein demonstrates that the EPA should review all testing methods prior to issuing further test orders. Given the frequency with which certain performance criteria were violated, a primary focus of that review should consider adjustments to these standards to better reflect biological variability. A second focus should be to provide detailed, assay-specific direction on when results should be discarded; no clear guidance exists on the degree to which assays need to be re-run for failing to meet performance criteria. A third focus should be to identify <b>permissible</b> <b>differences</b> in study design and execution that have a large influence on endpoint variance. Experimental guidelines could then be re-defined such that endpoint variances are reduced and performance criteria are violated less frequently. It must be emphasized that because we were restricted to a subset (approximately half) of the control data, our analyses serve only as examples to underscore the importance of a detailed, rigorous, and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the battery...|$|R
40|$|The study evaluates current {{periodicity}} {{of engine}} air filter replacement by measuring influence of air flow restriction value on some vehicle performance parameters. Experience of usage, costs of exploitation and technical condition of vehicle are connected with technically and economically based system of technical servicing. Periodicity of motor air filter replacement, declared by automobile manufacturer Renault ranges from 30 000 km to 120 000 km, depending on model and engine type. According {{to the same}} recommendations, periodicity must be reduced by a half, if conditions of use include dusty roads and exploitation of vehicle in the urban conditions. Aim of the research is to evaluate current mileage, when replacement of motor air filter is actually performed by local Renault dealer. To reach the goal, air filter elements from 30 Renault Trafic II vehicles of the same model and type, and 60 Renault Master II, also of the same model and type which are used in Latvia were collected. Influence of air filter clogging on several vehicle exploitation parameters, such as engine power and fuel consumption was analyzed. Value of maximum <b>permissible</b> pressure <b>difference</b> before and after air filter was determined. Air filters, collected from vehicles, were tested on Mustang MD- 1750 test bench for value of air pressure difference. Results obtained with all the samples have been presented and critically examined...|$|R
40|$|Tolerance is the <b>permissible</b> <b>difference</b> between sample {{measurement}} and the aim {{and is used}} to determine the acceptability of a product. A well-known example is the color tolerance of printed solids in ISO 12647 - 2. The first edition of ISO 12647 - 2 was published in 1996. It has gone through two major revisions. In the 2004 revision, the magnitude of the color tolerance (âˆ†E*ab) was changed. In the 2013 revision, a new color tolerance metric (âˆ†E 00) was included. No justification was found regarding the ISO 12647 - 2 revisions. In this research, %Pass is used to study the effect of color tolerance in a database. Recognizing that tolerance is a man-made decision, if the tolerance is too tight, the %Pass will be low; and vice versa. This research also examines the use of the equal %Pass to determine the tolerance equivalency between the old (âˆ†E*ab) and the new (âˆ†E 00) parameter. The results show that there is no convergence between âˆ†E*ab and âˆ†E 00 when using the boundary data approach. However, there is an equivalent tolerance between âˆ†E*ab and âˆ†E 00 using the equal %Pass approach. The current ISO 12647 - 2 standard, using 3. 5 âˆ†E 00 for CMY and 5 âˆ†E 00 for black, resulted in unequal %Pass. By using the equal %Pass approach, the black solid tolerance {{does not need to be}} different than cyan and magenta solids, but the yellow solid tolerance can be smaller than cyan and magenta solids...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{water quality}} {{assessment}} {{is a basic}} and crit. tool for informing sustainable management of water resources. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the reservoir and river water quality of the Cauvery River in the vicinity of the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, Karnataka, India. The results will assist water management in the study area for varied future demands including, irrigation, industries, and river conservation. Ecol. important parameters such as dissolved oxygen, COD, BOD, and physico-chem. parameters were analyzed. The results were compared with std. <b>permissible</b> limits. The <b>differences</b> in various parameters were statistically significant (P < 0. 01) when comparing the upstream and downstream stretches of the river, particularly in summer. To identify a good technique for water quality assessment, all of the water quality parameters have been calcd. by correlating various parameters and comparing them over two crit. dry seasons. The dendrogram of the water-quality parameters clearly indicate that river water is safe for drinking, fishing, irrigation, and industrial purposes. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|A web-based {{survey of}} fiscal health was {{administered}} to Wisconsin cities and villages {{during the spring of}} 2007. A total of 200 communities responded to the survey. Of those responding, 49 percent reported that their current revenue base is inadequate and more than 64 percent responded that their fiscal condition in five years will be inadequate. Some of the strategies most actively pursued in response to fiscal stress include delaying capital expenditures, targeted budget cuts and delaying routine maintenance expenditures. Strategies least likely to be pursued include reducing hours of public facilities, eliminating services and pursuing regional cooperation agreements. The same survey was administered in 2004 and while statistical comparisons are not <b>permissible</b> due to <b>differences</b> in responding communities, a few points are noteworthy. Compared to 2004, communities are slightly more optimistic today about their current financial condition (46 percent had adequate revenues in 2007 compared to 51 percent in 2004). Conversely, communities have dimmer prospects looking out the next five years today compared to 2004 (64 percent foresee having inadequate revenues in 2007 compared to 54 percent in 2004). ...|$|R
