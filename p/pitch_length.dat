For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal thread cutting tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one <b>pitch</b> <b>length</b> of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{temperature}} analysis on power RF LDMOS with different feature parameters of die thickness, <b>pitch</b> S <b>length</b> and finger width. The significance of these three parameters is determined from temperature comparison obtained by 3 D Silvaco-Atlas device simulator. The first three simulations focus on temperature variation with the three factors at different output power density respectively. The results indicate that both the thinner die thickness and the broaden <b>pitch</b> S <b>length</b> have distinct advantages over the shorter finger width. The device, at the same time, exhibits higher temperature at a larger output power density. Simulations are further carried out on structure with combination of different <b>pitch</b> s <b>length</b> and die thickness at a large 1 W/mm output power density and the temperature reduction reaches as high as 55 %...|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{original}} throwing Laws of Cricket, the umpires officiating were under {{an obligation to}} call [...] "no-ball" [...] to a delivery {{that they were not}} entirely happy was absolutely fair. This Law gave the umpires absolutely no discretion. In 2000, the Laws were changed to put an allowable figure of straightening of 5° for spinners, 7.5° for medium pacers and 10° for fast bowlers in an attempt to more clearly define what was legal. But these figures proved difficult to enforce due to umpires being unable to discern actual amounts of straightening and the differentiation between the three different allowable figures. Testing in Test Match conditions is not currently possible [...] "when the identification of elbow and shoulder joint centres in on-field data collection, where a shirt is worn, also involves large errors. In a match the ability to differentiate anatomical movements such as 'elbow extension' by digitising segment end-points, particularly if you have segment rotations, is extremely difficult and prone to error. This is certainly the case with spin bowlers. It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers, where an appropriate <b>pitch</b> <b>length</b> and run-up can be structured. This is clearly the only way to test players, where data would be able to withstand scientific and therefore legal scrutiny." ...|$|E
