40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} performance of various millimeter-wave FET switches realized in a metamorphic HEMT technology. The single-pole multi-throw switch configurations are targeting wireless communication fontends and imaging radiometers at 60, 94 and 120 GHz. In SPDT switches, state-of-the-art insertion loss of 1. 4 and 1. 8 dB is achieved at 60 and 94 GHz, respectively. Rivalled only by PIN diode switches, an insertion loss of < 2 dB is demonstrated up to 120 GHz. Shorted stubs are used to compensate for <b>parasitic</b> <b>FET</b> capacitance and allow for matching. Linearity data is presented for 60 and 94 GHz SPDT switches. A comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art planar SPDT switches is included. A 2 : 6 switch network for multi-antenna transceivers achieves < 4 dB insertion loss at 60 GHz...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Any planar {{resistor}} (channel) {{close to}} a conducting layer left floating (gate) forms a capacitor C whose thermal voltage noise (kT/C noise) has a backgating effect on the sheet re-sistance of the channel that is a powerful source of 1 /f resistance noise in planar resistors and, hence, in planar devices. This 1 /f spectrum is created by the bias voltage VDS applied to the resistor, which is a disturbance that takes it out of thermal equilibrium and changes the resistance noise {{that existed in the}} unbiased device. This theory, which gives the first electrical explanation for 1 /f electrical noise, not only gives a theoretical basis for the Hooge’s formula but also allows the design of proper shields to reduce 1 /f noise. Index Terms—Backgating effect, distributed bias, excess noise, kT/C noise, noise measurement, <b>parasitic</b> <b>FET,</b> RC cell, 1 /f electrical noise. I...|$|E
40|$|A Design-Oriented FET {{model in}} {{conjunction}} with an appropriate design procedure for distributed amplifiers is presented. The advantage of including the effects caused by <b>FET</b> <b>parasitics</b> in a newly defined simple unilateral FET circuit to be utilized in the conventional distributed amplifier design procedure allows an accurate prediction of the low-frequency gain and the 3 -dB cutoff frequency, The simplicity of this formulation {{and a set of}} generalized design charts provide an interesting opportunity to designers. Comparisons among different experimental data from literature and the results obtained by this theory confirm the validity of the Design-Oriented FET model and the effectiveness of the given graphical design method...|$|R
