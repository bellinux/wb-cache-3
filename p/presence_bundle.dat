However, the non-uniform chiral properties of SWNTs present inherent problems for precise control of the properties of the saturable absorber.

On the other hand, immunostaining of Alzheimer's brain sections with another antibody specific for the microtubule-associated protein τ shows strong staining of PHF on both NFT and NP.

Among the morphological traits that vary with strata, the <b>presence</b> of <b>bundle</b> sheath extensions (BSEs) is related to water transport, photosynthesis, and leaf mechanical support and classifies leaves as homobaric or heterobaric. This study analyzed the proportion {{of these types of}} leaves in a Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest (LLODF) and a Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF), and among the strata of each forest type. The morphological leaf traits of 89 LLODF tree species and 57 MOF tree species were examined. The proportion of homobaric and heterobaric leaves did not differ between forests. However, in both forest types, the distribution of species with heterobaric or homobaric leaves depended on strata, with heterobaric species occurring mainly in higher strata, and homobaric species in lower strata. Thus, light stratification acts as an ecological filter on the composition of the vegetation of these forests, favoring heterobaric species in places with higher light intensity and temperature, such as the highest strata of canopy. On the other hand, homobaric species are more frequent in lower strata, where light is less available and humidity higher...|$|R

Although the tubular aluminium silicate hydrate, imogolite, is known to be frequently associated with allophane in soils and other weathering environments (Wada & Harward, 1974), there has been no simple method for recognizing its presence in allophanic lays or any satisfactory procedure for estimating its amount.

HL- 1 cells are characterized {{by the absence of}} βII-tubulin, by the <b>presence</b> of <b>bundles</b> of filamentous βIV-tubulin and diffusely distributed βI- and βIII-tubulins. Mitochondrial isoform of creatine kinase (MtCK), highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, is absent in HL- 1 cells.

The absence of βII-tubulin isotype in isolated mitochondria and in HL- 1 cells results in increased apparent affinity of oxidative phosphorylation for exogenous ADP. This observation is consistent with the assumption that the binding of βII-tubulin to mitochondria limits ADP/ATP diffusion through voltage-dependent anion channel of MOM and thus shifts energy transfer via the phosphocreatine pathway. On the other hand, absence of both βII-tubulin and MtCK in HL- 1 cells can be associated with their more glycolysis-dependent energy metabolism which is typical for cancer cells (Warburg effect) ...|$|R

It is concluded that the relationships existing between vesiculated nerve processes and the surface of smooth muscle cells constitute neuromuscular junctions. Profiles of protrusions of smooth muscle cells are often seen protruding into the intercellular spaces. Here they occur singly or in groups, originating from one or more cells. Because of the plane of section the protrusions may sometimes appear as individual entities between the muscle cells.

The inter-tube gap represented a length-scale bottleneck which was shown to impede {{the growth of the}} larger structures in the flow at the expense of promoting smaller ones. Such forcing mesoscale length gave rise to 3 -D effects on the time-averaged flow variables even in the fully developed region. Furthermore, a sharp decrease of the liquid kinetic turbulent energy was obtained upon insertion of the heat-exchange tubes even for low enclosure occlusions.

In each patient progressive prolongations of His-Purkinje conduction (S 2 H 2) which appeared as ventricular extrastimuli were induced at closer coupling intervals (S 1 S 2). There was an inverse linear relationship of S 2 H 2 to S 1 S 2 which was cycle length-dependent: i. e., at any S 1 S 2 interval the resultant S 2 H 2 was less at shorter drive cycle lengths. The degree of S 2 H 2 delay varied widely (from 30 to 340 ms) and {{was unrelated to}} the <b>presence</b> of <b>bundle</b> branch block, H-V intervals, or capability of ventriculoatrial conduction. Prolongation of S 2 H 2 was independent of intraventricular (muscle) conduction delay; such delay was usually absent at most, and occasionally all, S 1 S 2 coupling intervals during which S 2 H 2 was lengthening. Furthermore, in two patients both left and right ventricles were activated before the timed depolarization of the His bundle occurred, demonstrating that under the stress of extrastimuli, the impulse conducts through ventricular muscle with less delay than through the His-Purkinje system. We conclude that the His-Purkinje system typically displays slow conduction response to ventricular stress. The site of this conduction delay is probably at the distal "gate"...|$|R
