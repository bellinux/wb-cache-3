40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Salmon {{populations in}} Washington have {{suffered}} severe declines in numbers {{leading to the}} listing of many as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Populations in Puget Sound are especially threatened due to degradation and loss of habitat resulting from timber harvest, farming, the effects of urbanization, and increasing human population. A critical component of salmon recovery efforts is the funding of restoration projects carried out {{by a variety of}} organizations in the area. The vast quantity of degraded habitat and the limited funding available require prioritization of restoration projects. In Washington, two organizations that {{have a long history of}} grants for habitat restoration are the Washington State Salmon Recovery Funding Board (SRFB) and the NOAA Restoration Center (NOAA RC). Over a thirteen year period the SRFB granted over $ 217 million and the NOAA RC granted nearly $ 22 million to habitat restoration projects in the Puget Sound recovery region. This research includes the creation of an original database of salmon habitat restoration projects in Puget Sound funded by the SRFB and the NOAA RC between 1999 and 2011. A restoration project type hierarchy was created based on the scientific literature about restoration and prioritization. This hierarchy was compared to the data gathered from the two organizations to determine if funding decisions align with the recommended prioritization of habitat restoration projects. The results show that overall the funding decisions of the SRFB align with the restoration <b>project</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> although there is annual variability that differs from the hierarchy. The NOAA RC shows funding decisions that vary more annually with priorities that often do not align with the restoration <b>project</b> <b>hierarchy...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, Arabic {{language}} {{has become one}} of the most used languages in the web. However, the majority of existing solutions to improve web usage do not take into account the characteristics of this language. The process of browsing search results is one of the major problems with traditional web search engines, especially with ambiguous queries. Using a ranked list as return result of a specific user request is time consuming and the browsing style seems to not be user-friendly. In this paper, we propose to study how to integrate and adapt the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as a new system for Arabic Web Search Results Clustering based on their hierarchical structure. The effectiveness of our proposed system is illustrated by an experimental study using Arabic comprehensive set of documents from the Open Directory <b>Project</b> <b>hierarchy</b> as benchmark, where we compare our system with two others: Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) and Lingo. The comparison focuses on the quality of the clustering results and produced label by different systems. It shows that our system outperforms the two others...|$|E

The cluster labels generated by Armil provide the user with a compact guide to assessing {{the relevance of}} each cluster to her information need. Striking the right balance between running time and cluster well-formedness was a key point {{in the design of}} our system. Both the clustering and the labelling tasks are performed on the fly by processing only the snippets provided by the auxiliary search engines, and use no external sources of knowledge. Clustering is performed by means of a fast version of the furthest-point-first algorithm for metric kcenter clustering. Cluster labelling is achieved by combining intra-cluster and inter-cluster term extraction based on a variant of the information gain measure. We have tested the clustering effectiveness of Armil against Vivisimo, the de facto industrial standard in Web snippet clustering, using as benchmark a comprehensive set of snippets obtained from the Open Directory <b>Project</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> According to two widely accepted “external” metrics of clustering quality, Armil achieves better performance levels by 10 %.

40|$|SUMMARY: In {{the early}} stages of a {{large-scale}} housing project, many interior design alternatives remain to be confirmed after a rough review of the costs. The project participants move on to the later stages of budgeting and construction without the exact information on the interior costs, and several occasions may arise when costs increase or time delays occur, driven by interior design specification changes resulting from the client’s evolving demands during construction. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the costs during the decision-making process for interior design items in an apartment unit plan. This study implements a decision support system for a large-scale apartment building project in which the clients can make cost-based decisions that meet their requirements, while the builders can control both resource planning and interior design construction costs. To perform a cost review for a housing project with a uniform apartment plan, it is necessary to manage the information for the basic apartment plan constituting the interior information. In this study, we developed an information model to support cost-based decision making in the interior design phase. An interior design object library was developed by analysing the relationship of the housing <b>project</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and interior information attributes. The proposed model was validated in an example study to show that the model could support the decision-making process of various project participants by providing real-time cost information when the interior design was created or changed...|$|E

This paper presents a simple algorithm that automatically assigns labels to hierarchical clusters. The algorithm evaluates candidate labels using information from the cluster, the parent cluster, and corpus statistics. A trainable threshold enables the algorithm to assign just a few high-quality labels to each cluster.

Small businesses {{do not have the}} necessary market-based information. As an alternative to traditional proxy approaches, this paper argues for a multi-criteria model to determine an appropriate equity risk premium, and thereby, a cost of capital. Design/methodology/approach – The study proposes a multi-criteria model – an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) – to determine the cost of capital for small businesses. Findings – Since the three proxy methods are shown to have numerous shortcomings, the use of the AHP model is clearly a method to determine the equity risk premium and the cost of capital for small businesses.

The factors and their relative importance impacting on workers' productivity are investigated by using a structured questionnaire survey approach.

Perceived best practices that impact on improvement of productivity on site were identified from 19 targeted experts.
