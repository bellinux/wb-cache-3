The authors explored both questions by using multilevel logistic regression modeling to analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K). After statistically controlling {{for a wide range of}} potential confounds, they found that children with reading <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> first grade were significantly more likely to display poor task engagement, poor self-control, externalizing behavior problems, and internalizing behavior <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> third grade.

5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I have no <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> walking about", [...] "I have some <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> all dimensions). 12321 indicates having no <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures.

The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world.
