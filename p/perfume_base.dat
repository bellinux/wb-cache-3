The perineal glands are located between the scrotum and the prepuce in males and between the anus and the vulva in females.|$|E

50|$|His {{position}} {{as the head of}} the large chemical works, iron furnaces and machine shops upon the great estate of Count Hugo secured to him excellent opportunities for conducting large-scale experimental research. From 1830 to 1834 he investigated complex products of the distillation of organic substances such as coal and wood tar, discovering a number of valuable hydrocarbon compounds including creosote, paraffin, eupione and phenol (antiseptics), pittacal and cidreret (synthetic dyestuffs), picamar (a <b>perfume</b> <b>base),</b> assamar, capnomor, and others. Under the name of eupione, Reichenbach included the mixture of hydrocarbon oils now known as waxy paraffin or coal oils. In his paper describing the substance, first published in the Neues Jahrbuch der Chemie und Physik, B, ii, he dwelt upon the economical importance of this and of its associate paraffins, whenever the methods of separating them cheaply from natural bituminous compounds would be established.|$|E

50|$|Orris {{concrete}} melts when {{it reaches}} around body temperature. It has a woody, fatty-oily, yet distinctly violet-like odor: sweet floral, warm & tenacious with a fruity undertone. Orris concrete is used in perfumery (as such) when the presence of myristic acid is not prohibitive, e.g.: in soap perfumes where the weak acid only acts as a fixative. Also note, the methyl and ethyl esters of myristic acid are often used for blending in violet type <b>perfume</b> <b>bases.</b> Because of the high costs involved in producing orris concrete it limits its application to a certain degree. Yet even small amounts of this exquisite material lends to very fine effects in various perfume types other than the old fashioned violet.|$|R

5000|$|Patou's {{clothes were}} marketed mostly to rich American women. When {{the stock market}} crashed, however, so did the market for luxury fashion. The House of Patou survived through its {{perfumes}}, which remain well known today.The best known of Patou's perfumes is [...] "Joy," [...] a heavy floral scent, based on the most precious rose and jasmine, that remained the costliest perfume in the world, until the House of Patou introduced [...] "1000" [...] (a heavy, earthy floral <b>perfume,</b> <b>based</b> on a rare osmanthus) in 1972. Before Joy, the House of Patou released many other perfumes, many which were to celebrate particular events. For example, Normandie (an oriental forerunner to perfumes such as Yves Saint Laurent's Opium) celebrated the French ocean liner of the same name, and Vacances (a mixture of green and lilac notes) celebrated the first French paid national holidays. Other Patou perfumes of the same time were Amour Amour (the forerunner of Joy, using the same rose notes, but without the jasmine), Adieu Sagesse, Que Sais-Je? (these three were released at the same time; Patou's idea was that the light floral Amour Amour was suitable for blondes; the tart, spicy Adieu Sagesse for redheads, and the heavy floral Que Sais-Je? for brunettes), L'Heure Attendue (a wonderful, unique oriental perfume), Divine Folie (a floral vanilla), Câline (a wonderful chypre perfume, similar to the much later Diorling by Christian Dior), Moment Suprême (a <b>perfume</b> <b>based</b> on lavender), Colony (which had a strong pineapple note), Chaldée (Patou's Huile de Chaldée sun oil had become so popular, many customers were buying it purely for its smell, therefore, Chaldée the perfume (a dry musk) was produced), Le Sien (one of the first perfumes for men and women), and Cocktail (literally a floral cocktail). All these, {{with the exception of}} Le Sien, were re-released during the 1980s (under the name Ma Collection), and were available until recently, all in a 50ml Eau de Toilette Spray, 75ml Eau de Toilette bottle, and 30ml pure perfume bottle, each with a unique art deco box. A Jean Patou silk scarf, printed in a pattern complementing that of the box was included with the pure perfume. Joy remains the world's second best-selling scent (the first is Chanel No. 5), Joy was created by Henri Alméras for Patou {{at the height of the}} Great Depression (1935) for Patou's former clients who could no longer afford his haute couture clothing line.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of {{building}} a perfume from [...] "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using fragrance bases or simply bases.

40|$|M. Tech. Business Administration. Business School. Evoked sets can {{be defined}} as the group of {{products}} or companies that come to mind when considering a purchase. An evoked set is a set of products of which a consumer is aware and which are considered for purchase. The proliferation of brands occurring in the consumer goods markets, create information processing problems for the consumers. They must often devise means to simplify their purchase decisions. One of the results of this simplification process is the existence of what is referred to as "evoked set", which include the brands the buyer considers when he contemplates purchasing a unit of the product class. Since the evoked set is a subset of the products available in the marketplace, the evoked set formation is seen as an information load reducing mechanism used by consumers to reduce the cognitive complexity of the brand choice process. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the most powerful brands of <b>perfumes</b> <b>based</b> on an analysis of consumers' unaided recall of perfume brands. This study seeks to provide a snapshot of some of the leading perfume brands from a consumer decision making process, rather than a business perspective...|$|R
