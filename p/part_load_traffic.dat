40|$|Abstract—In {{cellular}} networks, {{the base}} station power con-sumption is not simply proportional to the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of its coverage. As the <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> fluctuates spatially and temporally, {{the base station}}s consequently suffer from heavy energy wastage when the <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> of their coverage are low.

40|$|Purpose. The article {{analyzes}} the railway load LM 71 {{for the purpose}} of its application in national design projects of the railway girder bridges. Purpose of the article is harmonization of national design codes of enginnering structures with the European standards (Eurocodes). Methodology. Analytical calculation methods (influence lines), the matrix analysis and computer programming are used in the article. Findings. Deflected mode parameters of the railway bridges under the influence of loads C 14 and LM 71 have certain differences. The extent of these differences depends on length, material of drift structures and also on dynamic coefficients. These dependences should be considered in national design codes and in harmonized with Eurocodes standards. In the further researches relationships between load C 14 and models SW, HSLM taking into account various dynamic effects and trains speedis planned to determine. Originality.

40|$|Bridges are {{structures}} that propose the service life up to hundred years. However, the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models significantly {{differ from the}} characteristic load models used in the design. The analysis of former design codes of bridges used at the last century in Latvia showed the considerable increase of values of characteristic <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> The <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> proposed in Eurocode 1 : “Actions on structures – <b>Part</b> 2 : <b>Traffic</b> <b>loads</b> on bridges” considerably increase the actual <b>traffic</b> <b>loads</b> passing Latvian bridges. Therefore, {{the use of the}} actual <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> models for assessment of the load carrying capacity of the older bridges will extend the service life and save financial founds for the maintenance of the bridges. Earlier, the obtaining of the correct traffic data was complicated. Today after implementation of the Weight-In-Motion system, it is possible to collect vehicle information without interruption of the traffic flow. This includes data of the number of axles, vehicle wheelbase, speed and axle loads that describes the actual loading cases on the roads and bridges. The analysis of the recorded data of Weight-In-Motion the system allowed to obtain the load distribution diagrams, determine the position of the heaviest axel, traffic speed and intensity values.

The throughput of the proposed method with appropriate sensing level - 92 dBm and conventional sensing level - 62 dBm keeps increasing with <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> This is because with high <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> our proposed method does not have collisions due to hidden node.

The flow entry could be set up before the UE starts to send data through the Wi-Fi AP, and thus, this mechanism reduces the time complexity of the inter-system change procedure. We measure the delay times of the sequential and parallel inter-system change procedures and compare them with the delay time of the traditional (non-SDN) network environment illustrated in Fig.  1. In the experimental environment mentioned in Section 2, we assume the connection and authentication process time of the Wi-Fi network is 380  ms according to [19]. The {{results show that the}} delay time for the non-SDN procedure is 524  ms, the sequential procedure saves 18  ms (3.44  %), and the parallel one can save 25  ms (4.77  %). We also measure the delay times of above procedures with <b>loaded</b> <b>traffic.</b> We generate the <b>loaded</b> <b>traffic</b> by two opposite direction data traffic (each has 1000  Mb/s data rate) on the HP 3800 series switch.

If the connection and authentication process time can be reduced to 90  ms [19], the delay time for the non-SDN procedure will be 221  ms, the sequential and the parallel ones can save 6  ms (2.71  %) and 13  ms (5.88  %), respectively. Moreover, the delay times of the non-SDN, sequential, and parallel procedures with <b>loaded</b> <b>traffic</b> will become 234, 236, and 226  ms respectively.
