5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the <b>political</b> <b>system</b> by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-modern era early {{forms of}} {{globalization}} were {{already beginning to}} affect a world system, marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization. The world system leading up to proto-globalization was one that hinged on one or more hegemonic powers assimilating neighboring cultures into their <b>political</b> <b>system,</b> waging war on other nations, and dominating world trade.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} the scopes of engineering bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems,</b> which are <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> {{based on the}} properties of life that self-organize the increasing complexity of human social systems. We describe bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> and conjecture about various ways to get to them, most notably, metaheuristics, modeling and simulation and complexified topologies. Bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> operate with nature-based dynamics, inspired on the knowledge that has been acquired about complexity from natural social systems and life. Bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> are presented as the best alternative for organizing human sociopolitical interactions as computation and microelectronics-based technology profoundly modify {{the ways in which}} humans decide. Therefore, weakening classical <b>political</b> <b>systems.</b> For instance, dwindling top-down power structures, modifying the notion of geographical spatiality and augmenting the political granularity. We also argue that, more than a new theoretical proposal, bio-inspired <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> are coming to be the <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> of the future.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> in a framework where transitions are driven by reforms and revolts, and where <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> are a priori unconstrained, ranging continuously from single-man dictatorships to full-scale democracies. The dynamics are governed by the likelihood of transitions and their outcome, which are both determined endogenously. We find that reforms and revolts result in extreme <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> - reforms by enfranchising {{the majority of the}} population leading to democracies, and revolts by installing autocracies. Reinforcing this polarization, extreme <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> are persistent across time: Democracies are intrinsically stable, leading to long episodes without political change. Autocracies, in contrast, are subject to frequent regime changes. Nevertheless they are persistent, since ensuing revolts lead to autocracies comparable to their predecessors. Taken together, our results suggest that the long-run distribution of <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> is bimodal with mass concentrated on the extremes. The dynamics are consistent with cross-country data. ...|$|R
5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and <b>political</b> <b>system,</b> but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German <b>political</b> <b>system</b> operates under {{a framework}} {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, {{and the rule of law}} are valid in perpetuity.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The <b>political</b> <b>system</b> was not {{prepared}} for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Political</b> <b>systems</b> and {{technology}} are interdependent and influence each other. On the one hand, <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>political</b> leaders aim at influencing the technological development and benefiting from technological progress; on the other, technological development has a considerable proportion {{of its own}} dynamics and potential to influence society and <b>political</b> <b>systems.</b> This chapter particularly focuses on electronic democracy and virtual communities and accordingly discusses recent ideas and plans of political leaders, derives requirements for technology, presents systems and prototypes, and reports cases demonstrating how and what technology is really used. ...|$|R
5|$|In Spain from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence {{took place}} amidst a multi-cultural Spain. Spain, at the time, {{was under the}} control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother. Because the nation was {{under the control of}} French rule, the Spanish formed coalitions of ethnic groups to reclaim their own {{political}} representation, instead of the current French <b>political</b> <b>system</b> in power.|$|E
5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new <b>political</b> <b>system,</b> such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context. He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new <b>political</b> <b>system</b> and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.|$|E

He appreciated his efforts to compare <b>Political</b> <b>Systems</b> of Chinese, Russian, Cuban and Algerian revolutions.

5|$|Such {{measures}} impelled Pericles' {{critics to}} hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy.

5|$|The Northwest Territories <b>political</b> <b>system</b> used at {{this time}} was run by an early form of {{consensus}} government.
