5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, <b>protactinium</b> {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and <b>protactinium</b> tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. <b>Protactinium</b> carbide PaC is formed by reduction of <b>protactinium</b> tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. <b>Protactinium</b> forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the <b>protactinium</b> atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> {{exhibits}} two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent <b>protactinium</b> in solutions {{is obtained}} {{by the action of}} strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent <b>protactinium</b> is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. <b>Protactinium</b> forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent <b>protactinium</b> are close to those of tantalum(V) and niobium(V). The complex chemical behavior of <b>protactinium</b> is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) {{produced}} 125grams of 99.9% pure <b>protactinium</b> by processing 60tonnes {{of waste}} material in a 12-stage process, {{at a cost}} of about 500,000USD. For many years, this was the world's only significant supply of <b>protactinium,</b> which was provided to various laboratories for scientific studies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US provided <b>protactinium</b> {{at a cost of}} about 280USD/gram.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> (formerly protoactinium) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms various chemical compounds where <b>protactinium</b> is usually {{present in the}} oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. The average concentrations of <b>protactinium</b> in the Earth's crust is typically {{on the order of}} a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for <b>protactinium</b> outside of scientific research, and for this purpose, <b>protactinium</b> is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> {{bromides}} {{are produced}} {{by the action of}} aluminium bromide, hydrogen bromide, carbon tetrabromide or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and thionyl bromide on <b>protactinium</b> oxide. An alternative reaction is between <b>protactinium</b> pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide. Protactinium(V) bromide has two similar monoclinic forms, one is obtained by sublimation at 400–410°C and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of 390–400°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> iodides {{result from}} the oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, <b>protactinium</b> forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na3PaF8 where <b>protactinium</b> ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a nearly perfect cube.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, <b>protactinium</b> is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of <b>protactinium</b> {{is similar to that of}} titanium. <b>Protactinium</b> is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. <b>Protactinium</b> easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>protactinium</b> {{is located}} in the {{periodic}} table between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for <b>protactinium</b> outside of scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of <b>protactinium</b> are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic {{structure}} {{composed of}} double-chain units where <b>protactinium</b> has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three <b>protactinium</b> atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> in {{the body}} tends to {{accumulate}} in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of <b>protactinium</b> {{in the human body}} is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope, which might be present in the air as aerosol, is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> is {{paramagnetic}} and no magnetic transitions {{are known}} for it at any temperature. It becomes superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K. <b>Protactinium</b> tetrachloride is paramagnetic at room temperature but turns ferromagnetic upon cooling to 182 K.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric {{structure of}} monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the <b>protactinium</b> ions. The coordination 7 of <b>protactinium</b> originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to <b>protactinium</b> atoms {{belonging to the}} nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water. The pentachloride melts at 300°C and sublimates at even lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where <b>protactinium</b> ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The <b>protactinium</b> coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where <b>protactinium</b> ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} of <b>protactinium</b> lighter than (and including) {{the most stable}} isotope 231Pa (i.e., 212Pa to 231Pa) is alpha decay and the primary mode for the heavier isotopes (i.e., 232Pa to 240Pa) is beta decay. The primary decay products of isotopes of <b>protactinium</b> lighter than (and including) 231Pa are actinium isotopes and the primary decay products for the heavier isotopes of <b>protactinium</b> are uranium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Twenty nine {{isotopes}} of <b>protactinium</b> {{are known}} with mass numbers 212–240 {{as well as}} three excited isomeric states. Only 231Pa and 234Pa {{have been found in}} nature. All the isotopes have short lifetime, except for protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years). The most important isotopes are 231Pa and 233Pa, which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of <b>protactinium.</b> 233Pa has convenient half-life and energy of γ-radiation, and thus was used in most studies of <b>protactinium</b> chemistry. Protactinium-233 is a β-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> forms mixed binary oxides {{with various}} metals. With alkali metals A, the {{crystals}} have a chemical formula APaO3 and perovskite structure, or A3PaO4 and distorted rock-salt structure, or A7PaO6 where oxygen atoms form a hexagonal close-packed lattice. In all these materials, <b>protactinium</b> ions are octahedrally coordinated. The pentoxide Pa2O5 combines with rare-earth metal oxides R2O3 to form various nonstoichiometric mixed-oxides, also of perovskite structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> {{metal can}} be {{prepared}} by reduction of its fluoride with calcium fluoride, lithium or barium at a temperature of 1300–1400°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> {{occurs in}} {{uraninite}} (pitchblende) at concentrations of about 0.3-3 parts 231Pa per million parts (ppm) of ore. Whereas the usual content {{is closer to}} 0.3 ppm (e.g. in Jáchymov, Czech Republic), some ores from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have about 3 ppm. <b>Protactinium</b> is homogeneously dispersed in most natural materials and in water, but at much lower concentrations {{on the order of}} one part per trillion, that corresponds to the radioactivity of 0.1 picocuries (pCi)/g. There is about 500 times more <b>protactinium</b> in sandy soil particles than in water, even the water present in the same sample of soil. Much higher ratios of 2,000 and above are measured in loam soils and clays, such as bentonite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white <b>protactinium</b> pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and <b>protactinium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) <b>protactinium,</b> or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting <b>protactinium</b> tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{chloride}} {{is prepared}} by reacting <b>protactinium</b> oxide with carbon tetrachloride at temperature of 200–300°C. The by-products (such as PaOCl3) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400°C; {{it can also}} be obtained directly from <b>protactinium</b> dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400°C.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes of <b>protactinium</b> {{have been}} discovered, {{the most stable}} being 231Pa with a {{half-life}} of 32,760 years, 233Pa with a half-life of 27 days, and 230Pa with a half-life of 17.4 days. All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 1.6 days, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives less than 1.8 seconds. <b>Protactinium</b> also has two nuclear isomers, 217mPa (half-life 1.2 milliseconds) and 234mPa (half-life 1.17 minutes).|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of actinium in the Earth's crust {{is only about}} 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. <b>Protactinium</b> is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium, the distribution of <b>protactinium</b> follows that of 235U.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>protactinium</b> oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); {{the former}} is {{isomorphic}} with ThO2 and the latter is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protactinium</b> oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on <b>protactinium</b> metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} can {{be prepared}} by reacting <b>protactinium</b> oxide with either bromine pentafluoride or bromine trifluoride at about 600°C, and protactinium(IV) fluoride is obtained from the oxide and a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at 600°C; a large excess of hydrogen is required to remove atmospheric oxygen leaks into the reaction.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of <b>protactinium,</b> protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 {{years and is}} a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 {{as part of the}} chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and <b>protactinium</b> isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of highly {{sensitive}} mass spectrometers, an application of 231Pa as a tracer in geology and paleoceanography has become possible. So, the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 is used for radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling {{of the formation of}} minerals. In particular, its evaluation in oceanic sediments allowed to reconstruct the movements of North Atlantic water bodies during the last melting of Ice Age glaciers. Some of the protactinium-related dating variations rely on the analysis of the relative concentrations for several long-living members of the uranium decay chain – uranium, <b>protactinium,</b> and thorium, for example. These elements have 6, 5 and 4 valence electrons and thus favor +6, +5 and +4 oxidation states, respectively, and show different physical and chemical properties. So, thorium and <b>protactinium,</b> but not uranium compounds are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, and precipitate into sediments; the precipitation rate is faster for thorium than for <b>protactinium.</b> Besides, the concentration analysis for both protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years) and thorium-230 (half-life 75,380 years) allows to improve the accuracy compared to when only one isotope is measured; this double-isotope method is also weakly sensitive to inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the isotopes and to variations in their precipitation rate.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, <b>protactinium</b> {{crystallizes}} in the body-centered tetragonal structure {{which can}} be regarded as distorted body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200°C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700°C is 9.9/°C.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of neptunium, <b>protactinium,</b> uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more {{similar to those of the}} 3dtransition metals.|$|E
5|$|Two major <b>protactinium</b> isotopes, 231Pa and 233Pa, are {{produced}} from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable {{and are usually}} removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is {{a major contributor to}} the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|Among all of these, {{the only}} {{isotopes}} {{that occur in}} sufficient quantities in nature to be detected in anything more than traces and have a measurable contribution to the atomic weights of the actinides are the primordial 232Th, 235U, and 238U, and three long-lived decay products of natural uranium, 230Th, 231Pa, and 234U. Natural thorium consists of 0.02(2)% 230Th and 99.98(2)% 232Th; natural <b>protactinium</b> consists of 100% 231Pa; and natural uranium consists of 0.0054(5)% 234U, 0.7204(6)% 235U, and 99.2742(10)% 238U.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and <b>protactinium,</b> but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and <b>protactinium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of <b>protactinium</b> nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including <b>protactinium,</b> uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for <b>protactinium</b> and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E
