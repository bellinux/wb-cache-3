25|$|It {{was during}} her {{performances}} in Kyoto that she also became {{known for her}} performances of nembutsu odori (or nembutsu dance) {{in honor of the}} Amida Buddha. Though this dance traces its origins to Kūya, a tenth-century evangelist of Pure Land Buddhism, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular folk dance, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and sexual innuendo. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various <b>public</b> <b>establishments</b> and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.|$|E
25|$|With the Revolution, {{the city}} {{administration}} suddenly found itself without a royal master. On 15 July 1789, {{immediately after the}} fall of the Bastille, the astronomer Bailly was proclaimed the first modern Mayor of Paris. The old city government was abolished on 15 August, and a new municipal assembly created, with three hundred members, five from each of sixty Paris districts. On 21 May 1790, the National Assembly reorganized the city government, replacing the sixty districts with forty-eight sections. each governed by sixteen commissaires and a comissiaire of police. Each section had its own committees responsible for charity, armament, and surveillance of the citizens. The Mayor was elected for two years, and was supported by sixteen administrators overseeing five departments, including the police, finances, public works, <b>public</b> <b>establishments,</b> public works, and food supplies. The Municipal Council had thirty-two elected members. Above this was the Council General of the Commune, composed the Mayor, the Municipal Council, the city administrators, and ninety six notables, which met only to discuss the most important issues. This system was too complex and meetings were regularly disrupted by the representatives of the more radical sections.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{went from}} banning {{all types of}} veils in 1936 to {{restoring}} original dress code between 1980 and 1984. Practical decisions started with the Iranian Cultural Revolution in April 1980, when {{it was decided that}} women in government offices and educational institutions would observe the veil. The 1983 penal code prescribed punishment of 74 lashes for women appearing in public without Islamic hijab (hijab shar'ee), leaving the definition of proper hijab ambiguous. The same period witnessed tensions around the definition of proper hijab, which sometimes resulted in vigilante harassment of women who were perceived to wear improper clothing. The government felt obliged to address this situation, and in 1984 Tehran’s public prosecutor announced that a stricter dress-code should observed in <b>public</b> <b>establishments,</b> while clothing in other places should correspond to standards observed by the majority of the people. A new regulation issued in 1988 by the Ministry of the Interior based on the 1983 law further specified what constituted violations of hijab. Iran's current penal code stipulates a fine or 10 days to two months in prison as punishment for failure to observe hijab in public, without specifying its form. The dress code has been subject of alternating periods of relatively strict and relaxed enforcement over the years, with many women pushing its boundaries, and its compulsory aspect has been a point of contention between conservatives and the current president Hassan Rouhani. In governmental and religious institutions, the dress code requires khimar-type headscarf and overcoat, while in other public places women commonly wear a loosely tied headscarf (rousari). Iranian government endorses and officially promotes stricter types of veiling, praising it by invoking both Islamic religious principles and pre-Islamic Iranian culture.|$|E

500|$|This system changed {{under the}} British, when tax {{payments}} {{were made in}} cash, and {{were used for the}} maintenance of the army, police and other civil and <b>public</b> <b>establishments.</b> A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the [...] "Indian tribute". Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the homespun textile industry suffered during British rule, {{with the exception of the}} producers of the finest cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses. This was due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in spinning and weaving.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Trotter noticed that racial {{segregation}} was spreading in Boston: {{the number of}} hotels, restaurants, and other <b>public</b> <b>establishments</b> refusing service to African Americans was increasing. [...] He came to realize that, in order to effect real change, the radical message needed {{to be taken out}} of Boston, and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903. At the suggestion of Trotter, William H. Ferris went to Washington D.C. in January 1903. Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. Richard W. Thompson spoke in support of Washington as replies at the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 and Jesse Lawson did the same on February 3. In 1999, Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson's paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris, who was present at the talk.|$|E

60|$|I {{was much}} {{struck by the}} great extravagance in small things {{manifested}} by the post-office through the States, and {{have reason to believe}} that the same remark would be equally true with regard to other <b>public</b> <b>establishments.</b> They use needless forms without end-- making millions of entries which no one is ever expected to regard. Their expenditure in stationery might I think be reduced by one- half, and the labor might be saved which is now wasted in the abuse of that useless stationery. Their mail bags are made in a costly manner, and are often large beyond all proportion or necessity. I could greatly lengthen this list if I were addressing myself solely to post-office people; but as I am not doing so, I will close these semi-official remarks with an assurance to my colleagues in post- office work on the other side of the water that I greatly respect what they have done, and trust that before long they may have renewed opportunities for the prosecution of their good work.|$|E
