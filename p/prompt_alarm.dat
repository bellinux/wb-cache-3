If Call Control detected eight failures to set up calls within that eight minutes, then it force-changed all the side-conscious units onto the other side, locked that side in service and raised a <b>prompt</b> <b>alarm.</b> In periods of very low traffic, there would typically be fewer than eight call set-up attempts on {{the exchange}} in eight minutes and this would have prevented the above security system from working. The exchange was therefore provided with an automatic Test Call Unit, which originated a test call every 30 seconds. As well as thus enabling Call Control to detect eight failures in less than eight minutes (if all call-attempts were failing), the Test Call would raise its own <b>prompt</b> <b>alarm</b> if it detected 31 sequential call-attempt failures, indicating that neither security side of the exchange was able to connect calls.|$|E

In the event of the equipment detecting a serious fault in one of the side-conscious units, all the units in that section were locked onto the side which was giving good service and a <b>prompt</b> <b>alarm</b> was sent to a manned centre to indicate that the exchange needed urgent attention.|$|E

50|$|As a {{maintenance}} aid, the exchange {{was equipped with}} a Maintenance Data Recorder (MDR). This had a rather primitive printer, which displayed the identities of equipment in use {{at the time that}} the exchange had detected a call failure. For example, in the event of a successful repeat attempt to provide dial-tone, the MDR would print. If the repeat attempt failed, then the MDR would print twice in quick succession, giving details of the equipment in use on both the failed paths. The prints were not easy to read. All that emerged were short burn marks on the special paper in up to 45 different places in each of two rows. It was necessary to hold a plastic graticule (see picture below right, under that of an MDR) over the paper to find out what the presence of each burn mark indicated. If more than eight call failures were detected in less than 8 minutes, then the critical common control units would be forced to change from the side in service (A or B) to the other side, the automatic 8-minute changeover would be suspended and a <b>prompt</b> <b>alarm</b> would be sent out.|$|E
50|$|Appropriate visual stimuli, {{such as the}} {{movements}} of nearby large or dark colored objects, can elicit attacks by the red paper wasps, which will fly at the object in alarm, attempting to sting it. An alarmed Polistes canadensis can release venom onto its nest; the odor of venom will <b>prompt</b> <b>alarm</b> responses in its nestmates, lower their thresholds for attack, and even attract more nestmates to the alarm. Through this chemical means of communicating alarm, the colony is able to rise quickly with its sting chambers open to defend its nest against predators. Because red paper wasps uniquely occupy multiple combs unattached to each other, the chemical alarm substance may have arisen as a necessary adaptation for a more efficient alarm for a sparsely dispersed nest. It is not known whether these red paper wasps can release venom at the nest independent of stinging behavior in order to communicate alarm to nestmates. While these wasps have been seen to open the sting chamber independently of venom release on the nest, the solo release of venom has not been observed. The Polistes canadensis may open its sting chambers {{as part of a}} defensive display (involves bending of the gaster toward the source of alarm) or in preparation for stinging.|$|E
40|$|The Fermi Lab Liquid ARgon experiment, FLARE, a huge {{neutrino}} argon-liquid project detector of 50 kt mass, {{might in}} a near future enlarge the neutrino telescope accuracy revealing in detail solar, supernova, atmospheric {{as well as}} largest solar flares neutrino. Indeed the solar energetic (E_p > 100 MeVs) flare particles (protons, alpha) while scattering among themselves or hitting the solar atmosphere must produce on sun prompt charged pions, whose decay (as well as their sequent muon decays) into secondaries is source of a copious solar neutrino "flare" (at tens or hundreds MeV energy). These brief (minutes) neutrino "burst" at largest flare peak may overcome by three to five order of magnitude the steady atmospheric neutrino noise on the Earth, possibly leading to their emergence and detection above the thresholds. The largest prompt "burst" solar neutrino flare may be detected in future FLARE neutrino detectors both in electron and positron and possibly in its muon pair neutrino component. Our estimate for the recent and exceptional October - November 2003 solar flares and last January 20 th 2005 exceptional flare {{might lead to a}} few events for future FLARE or near unity for present Super-KamiokandeII. The neutrino spectra may reflect the neutrino flavor oscillations and mixing in flight.

Persons with mild dementia usually have problems in performing activities of daily living due to episodic memory decline. These can include simple activities, such as bathing, changing clothes and preparing meals. Through extended field test trials involving end users, we have demonstrated that assistive technology that provides timely <b>prompts,</b> <b>alarms</b> and reminders can enable them to preserve their abilities and improve their quality of life. Understanding the user context, especially when targeting demented individuals, and providing the required personalized assistive services is the objective of our research work. Finding the appropriate user interface to interact with the provided services is often a barrier. Thus, we have adopted the approach of a multimodal interactive system with the living environment including a TV set, iPad-like tablets, sensors/actuators, and wireless speakers connected to a reasoning engine that is able to consider the complexity of the users' profile defined by his/her cognitive abilities. In this paper we will mainly focus on the interaction level with the system as well as on the validation stages performed to meet the users' requirements.

40|$|Automated {{decision}} support tools {{are designed to}} aid users and improve their performance in certain tasks by providing advice {{in the form of}} <b>prompts,</b> <b>alarms,</b> assessments, or recommendations. However, recent evidence suggests that sometimes use of such tools introduces decision errors that are not made without the tool. We refer to this phenomenon as “automation bias” (AB), resulting in a broader definition of this term than used by many authors. Sometimes, such automation-induced errors can even result in overall performance (in terms of correct decisions) which is actually worse with the tool than without it. Our literature review reveals an emphasis on mediators affecting automation bias and some mitigation strategies aimed at reducing it. However, {{there is a lack of}} research on the cognitive causal explanations for automation bias and on adaptive mitigation strategies that result in tools that adapt to the needs and characteristics of individual users. This thesis aims to address some of these gaps in the literature and focuses on systems consisting of a human and an automated tool which does not replace, but instead supports the human towards making a decision, with the overall responsibility lying with the human user. The overall goal of this thesis is to help reduce the rate of automation bias through a better understanding of its causes and the proposal of innovative, adaptive mitigation strategies. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive literature review on automation bias including examples, mediators, explanations, and mitigations while identifying areas for further research. This review is followed by the presentation of three experiments aimed at reducing the rate of AB in different ways: (1) an experiment to explore causal mechanisms of automation bias, the effect of the mere presence of tool advice before its presentation and the effect of the sequence of tool advice in a glaucoma risk calculator environment, (2) simulations that apply concepts of diversity to human + human systems to improve system performance in a breast cancer double reading programme, and (3) an experiment to study the possibility of improving system performance by tailoring tool setting (sensitivity / specificity combination) for groups of similarly skilled users and cases of similar difficulty level using a spellchecking tool. Results from the glaucoma experiment provide evidence of the effect of the presence of tool advice on user decisions - even before its presentation, as well as evidence of a newly introduced cognitive mechanism (users’ strategic change in decision threshold) which may account for some automation bias errors previously observed but unexplained in the literature. Results from the double reading experiment provide evidence of the benefits of diversity in improving system performance. Finally, results from the spell checker experiment provide evidence that groups of similarly skilled users perform better at different tool settings, that the same group of users perform better using a different tool setting in difficult versus easy tasks, and that use of simple models of user behaviour may allow the prediction, among a subset of tool settings for a certain tool, the tool setting that would be most appropriate for each user ability group and class of case difficulty...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The SafeBoosC phase II {{randomised}} {{clinical trial}} recently demonstrated {{the benefits of}} a combination of cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation (rStO 2) by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a treatment guideline to reduce the oxygen imbalance in extremely preterm infants. AIMS: To analyse rStO 2 -alarm-related clinical decisions and their heterogeneity in the NIRS experimental group (NIRS monitoring visible) and their impact on rStO 2 and SpO 2. METHODS: Continuous data from NIRS devices and the alarms (area under the curve of the rStO 2 out of range had accumulated 0. 2 %h during 10  min), clinical data at discrete time points and interventions <b>prompted</b> by the <b>alarms</b> were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-seven infants had data that fulfilled the requirements for this analysis. 1107 alarm episodes were analysed. The alarm triggered a treatment guideline intervention in 25 % of the cases; the type of intervention chosen varied among clinical sites. More than 55 % of alarms were not followed by an intervention ('No action'); additionally, in 5 % of alarms the rStO 2 value apparently was considered non-reliable and the sensor was repositioned. The percentage of unresolved alarms at 30  min after 'No action' almost doubled the treatment guideline intervention (p< 0. 001). Changes in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2), were observed only after treatment guideline interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 25 % of rStO 2 alarms were followed by a clinical intervention determined by the treatment guideline. However, the rStO 2 and SpO 2 returned to normal ranges after the intervention, supporting the notion that decisions taken by the clinicians were appropriate.

40|$|Abstract Background Semi-structured {{interview}} {{scales for}} psychosis are {{the gold standard}} approach to assessing psychotic and other symptoms. However, such assessments have limitations such as recall bias, averaging, insensitivity to change and variable interrater reliability. Ambulant, real-time self-report assessment devices may hold advantages over interview measures, but {{it needs to be}} shown that the data thus collected are valid, and the collection method is acceptable, feasible and safe. We report on a monitoring system for the assessment of psychosis using smartphone technology. The primary aims were to: i) assess validity through correlations of item responses with those on widely accepted interview assessments of psychosis, and ii) examine compliance to the procedure in individuals with psychosis of varying severity. Methods A total of 44 participants (acute or remitted DSM- 4 schizophrenia and related disorders, and prodromal) completed 14 branching self-report items concerning key psychotic symptoms on a touch-screen mobile phone when <b>prompted</b> by an <b>alarm</b> at six pseudo-random times, each day, for one week. Face to face PANSS and CDS interviews were conducted before and after the assessment period blind to the ambulant data. Results Compliance as defined by completion of at least 33 % of all possible data-points over seven days was 82 %. In the 36 compliant participants, 5 items (delusions, hallucinations, suspiciousness, anxiety, hopelessness) showed moderate to strong (rho 0. 6 - 0. 8) associations with corresponding items from interview rating scales. Four items showed no significant correlation with rating scales: each was an item based on observable behaviour. Ambulant ratings showed excellent test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change. Conclusions Ambulatory monitoring of symptoms several times daily using smartphone software applications represents a feasible and valid way of assessing psychotic phenomena for research and clinical management purposes. Further evaluation required over longer assessment periods, in clinical trials and service settings. </p...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Monitoring radionuclide effluents has historically been recognized as an important operational activity and a mandatory requirement. US DOE facilities generally require that a continuous air monitor (CAM) instrument be installed to provide an alarm for safety purposes, and that a fixed air sampler (AS) be installed to provide emissions quantification information for both compliance and liability functions. It is very important that aerosol losses in the sampling systems be minimal for the Cams to provide <b>prompt</b> and reliable <b>alarms</b> and that FASs yield data that accurately characterize the emissions. Recognizing that the particle sampling characteristics have a significant role in determining the ability of sampler to properly signal an alarm, this study was conducted to characterize the collection efficiency of aerosol sampler systems as affected by variations in particle size and sampler flow rate. The results presented deal with the aerosol sampling aspects of an overall sampling system, which consists of an inlet-elbow, a transport line, and a EL- 900 CAM prototype manufactured by EG&G. Results show that only 12 % of 10 []m aerodynamic diameter (AD) aerosol particles penetrate through the complete sampling system when it is operated at flow rate of 84. 9 L/min in a free stream velocity of 9 m/s. About 88 % of the losses occurred on the internal walls of the inlet-elbow probe and about 10 % in the transport line. The EL- 900 has a cutpoint larger than 20 []m AD and a penetration of 88 % for 10 m AD aerosol particles when operated at 84. 9 L/min. Deposition of 10 []m AD aerosol particles at the EL- 900 take place primarily {{in the center of the}} filter, where the counting efficiency of the detector is highest. A FAS has been developed for sampling radionuclide aerosol particles from the workplace. Wind tunnel testing was used to verify sampling performance. When the sampler was oriented at O' over various ranges of free stream velocities, sampling flow rates and particle sizes, the aspiration efficiency of aerosol was typically greater than 95 %. The aspiration efficiencies varied from 80 % to 106 % for 10 []m AD particle over the previously noted range of free stream velocities and inlet orientations...|$|R
40|$|Acid-related disease (ARD) is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a range of conditions in which acid {{is involved in the}} generation of symptoms and/or complications. Two of the most common ARDs are gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). PPIs are today regarded as the gold standard in the treatment of both symptoms and mucosal injury in patients with GERD as well as for prevention and acute treatment of PUD. Since the PPIs were introduced in the late 1980 -ies there has been a sharp increase in the usage in the Western world. Although this increase coincides with the GERD epidemic it has also led to concerns related to PPI over-utilization, with high costs and associated long-term side-effects. In contrast, there is an apparent underutilization of PPIs as gastroprotective therapy in patients at elevated risk of PUD when taking certain medication. Observational studies have also suggested that the clinical efficacy of PPI therapy may be reduced because of poor adherence. Despite PPIs being among the most widely used prescription drugs there are scarce data on the natural utilization patterns of PPIs. Furthermore the implementation of various cost-containment programs, imposing restrictions on PPI prescriptions, has rarely been evaluated in a systematic manner. A much debated issue is whether the diagnosis and initial treatment of GERD, after excluding patients with an indication for <b>prompt</b> esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (<b>alarm</b> symptoms or age above 50 years), should be based on symptoms or if EGD shall be performed upfront. A number of patient reported questionnaires have been developed in order to facilitate the symptom-based diagnosis of GERD. In the first study a validation of a questionnaire (GerdQ) as a diagnostic tool for GERD was performed. A GerdQ cutoff score ≥ 9 gave the best balance between sensitivity, 66 % (95 % CI 58 - 74 %) and specificity, 64 % (95 % CI 41 - 83 %), for GERD. It was concluded that GerdQ is a useful complementary tool for the diagnosis of GERD. In the second study the GerdQ questionnaire was integrated into an algorithm for the symptom-based diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD and compared against an endoscopy-based approach. In this randomized controlled trial patients with symptoms of GERD, but without alarm features, the symptom-based approach (response rate 87 %) was non-inferior, but not superior (p= 0. 14) to the endoscopy-based approach (response rate 80 %). The net cost-savings in the 8 weeks within-trial analysis was 146 € in favor of the symptom-based approach. To conclude we found that patients with a high likelihood of GERD (high GerdQ scores) profited from a symptom-based approach while patients with low likelihood of GERD (low GerdQ scores) favored further investigation with EGD/pHmetry. In sum the first two papers show that when facilitated by GerdQ the responsibility for diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with GERD, without indication for EGD, could confidently be transferred to primary care. This will hopefully lead to a reduced number of costly and unnecessary referrals. In the third paper we used the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) to retrieve all individual level prescriptions dispensed on a PPI from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2008. Dispensations (or the absence of dispensations) were used as a proxy for starting, shifting or discontinuing PPI therapy. The study found that although GERD is considered a chronic disease a considerable alteration in the pool of patients treated with PPI was demonstrated. High proportions of patients discontinued PPI therapy long-term (23 % and 39 % per year in two different periods) likely reflecting the relapsing-remitting nature of GERD or, but less likely, a lasting remission. The switch between different PPIs was low (5 % and 7 % in two different periods) likely reflecting the natural switching patterns due to treatment failure or intolerance. A new restrictive prescription policy program defining generic alternatives as preferred treatment was successfully introduced among new PPI users with the proportion of patients receiving esomeprazole dropping from 57 % before to 20 % after the introduction of the new policy. A mandatory shift in ongoing esomeprazole users was harder to implement with 64 % not shifting from esomeprazole to generic PPI during the first year after implementation. Amongst the 36 % who shifted from esomeprazole to generic PPI, one out of four subsequently shifted back to esomeprazole. In the fourth paper we assessed the association between PPI adherence and the risk of upper GI complications (ulcer, bleeding and perforation) among NSAID users. This case-control study, being the largest of its kind, linked nationwide Swedish data from the Prescribed Drug Registry with the National Patient Registry. A total of 3. 649 cases of upper GI complications were identified. Patients with poor adherence (< 20 % PPI coverage) had approximately twice the risk of peptic ulcer (OR= 1. 88; 95 % CI 1. 22 - 2. 88) compared with fully adherent patients (≥ 80 % PPI coverage). As NSAIDs are among the most frequently prescribed prescription drugs, and upper GI complications carry a high mortality risk, efforts to increase adherence with PPIs should be an integrated part of clinical practice. In sum this thesis addresses relevant questions of importance for the diagnosis and treatment of acid-related diseases. We have validated a questionnaire (GerdQ) as a diagnostic tool for GERD and also demonstrated that a symptom-based management algorithm is equally efficacious, but less costly, compared to an endoscopy based approach. The thesis has also provided intriguing new data on the natural utilization patterns for PPIs. Lastly it has been demonstrated that NSAID users with poor adherence to PPI have twice the risk of developing a serious upper GI event compared to full adherers. </p...|$|R
