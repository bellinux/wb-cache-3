40|$|This work {{studied the}} effect of using {{recycled}} scraps {{in the production of}} rigid PVC extrusion pipe. Different formulations with varied percentages of scraps were extruded and various tests carried out on the sample specimen to determine their corresponding mechanical properties. It was finally discovered that among the two sources of scraps, the in-house scraps contained less impurities and blending about 10 % of it with virgin PVC material in the production gave improved mechanical properties. The second type of scrap, ‘post consumer used scraps ’ were found to have higher percentages of impurities. This and other factors including continuous reextrusion, ageing, degradation and poor formulation from its origin affected the properties. SIGNIFICANCE: The study of the effects of using recycled materials provides valuable information to the industrialist producing PVC pipes in the country. If the use is found satisfactory it will reduce environmental pollution, benefit manufacturers of these products and employment opportunities will be provided in the <b>ploughing</b> <b>back</b> of waste to wealth...|$|E

40|$|Given {{the fact}} that {{numerous}} challenges prohibit African immigrants from availing financial capital {{for the purpose of}} starting a business in South Africa, this paper sets out to investigate whether those that succeeded experienced a significant increment in their financial capital three or more years after start-up. This paper was designed within the quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. A triangulation of three methods was utilised to collect and analyze the data. From a quantitative perspective, the survey questionnaire was used. To complement the quantitative approach, personal interviews and focus groups were utilised as the methods within the qualitative approach paradigm. The primary data collection instrument used was the survey questionnaire which was complemented by personal interviews and focus group debates. The results revealed that the majority (71, 1 %) African immigrants had an estimated start-up financial in the range of R 1 000 and R 5 000, which tended to vary across the different ethnic groups studied. After three of more years, the estimated financial capital of the majority (39, 3 %) of the respondents moved to a new range of R 50 001 to R 100 000. Noting a disparity in capital growth exhibited by the different ethnic groups, it was found that all the Ethiopians who started with a capital within the range of R 1 000 -R 5 000 moved into a new capital range (R 50 001 - R 100 000) three or more years after business start-up. Although the absolute migration in terms of capital demonstrated by the Ethiopians is not into the highest capital range, they were nonetheless the only country that experienced this phenomenal growth. In terms of occupying the highest capital range (R 250 001 - R 500 000), 11, 1 % of Cameroonians moved into that range followed by 7, 4 % of Somalians. Using an increase in financial capital (generated by <b>ploughing</b> <b>back</b> profits) as a proxy for growth, we were able to prove that these African immigrants owned business grow and the rate of growth varied across the different ethnic groups studied. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study has}} been {{conducted}} with the main objective of analyzing members’ marketing participation and factors influencing their participation in dairy cooperatives in Arsi Zone of the Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. In this study, three stage random sampling method was adopted for {{the selection of the}} respondents. The {{study has been}} employed survey method with field orientation and structured interview schedule was used as a tool for collecting data from members. 151 members from 4 dairy cooperatives were selected at random for the study using probability proportionate to size of the population (PPS). Additionally, 56 participants of FGD (32 dairy cooperative officials, 15 reputed elders of the local community, 4 village (PA) leaders, and 5 marketing experts from zonal and woreda promotion offices) were involved in the study. Karl Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation(r), the Ordinal Logistic Regression Model, and preference indices were used to analyze the data. The survey result revealed that most of the dairy cooperative members, i. e. 89 members (58. 9 %) were regular participants in decision making with respect to dairy marketing through their dairy cooperatives and involving in the dairy marketing functions of the dairy cooperatives simultaneously and 61 members (40. 4 %) participated some times in the same. Number of milking Cows owned, Position of a member in the cooperative, Training undergone in dairy marketing, Information seeking behavior, and Communication skills were found to be positively correlated with members’ marketing participation while Distance to the nearest Dairy Cooperative's milk collection centre was negatively correlated with the same. The parameter estimates of the ordinal logistic regression model has shown that Experience in Dairy Marketing vi, Milk Purchased through Cooperatives, Training Undergone in Dairy Marketing, and Perception about Cooperatives were among the significant factors affecting marketing participation of members in dairy cooperatives. Lack of market access for members’ milk especially during the fasting months, Lack of improved dairy cows, Lack of facilities (cooling, transportation, and storage), shortage and poor quality of animal feeds, Lack of credit to expand dairy activities, Poorly developed infrastructure like roads, water supply, and electric power, high cost of exotic breeds, high transaction costs and ever increasing in the price of animal feeds, members’ low attention towards dairy sector, and low commitment and negligence of Cooperative officials in discharging their responsibilities were among the main constraints perceived by members of dairy cooperatives and participants of FGD. In order to tackle the main constraints of dairy cooperatives so far identified and improve marketing participation of members in their dairy cooperatives, the dairy stakeholders (members, cooperatives, Government, and NGOs) should think of better market access for dairy products. In addition to this, there must be a national level dairy industry program like Operation Flood program of India so as to facilitate the enhancement of milk production in the country. The financial needs can be met from the sale of material assistance (primarily from the members of dairy cooperatives) received in the form of milk and milk products, and <b>ploughing</b> <b>back</b> the funds for the development activities...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. The South African {{mining sector}} remains a {{cornerstone}} of the South African economy in terms of employment and investment opportunities. The exports of the minerals also result in foreign exchange earnings. The mining industry {{is known to be}} a high-risk environment where the employees are constantly exposed to potential hazards. It is also a rewarding industry that is <b>ploughing</b> <b>back</b> millions of rand into society and the local economy each year. Apart from being recognised as an industry that is highly unionised and creating employment opportunities, it is also being plagued by re-occurring fatalities. Considering the negative impact that any accident can have on a mine, for example increased costs, loss of operating income, negative publicity and weakened investor relations, one wants to avoid it at all cost. It builds a strong argument that safety, health and the environment (SHE) are not things that are managed once an accident has occurred and it does not have a single point of impact. It is {{something that needs to be}} understood, especially the interaction between the individuals and the systems that exists, and then be pro-actively managed. By introducing an integrated approach, key concepts will be introduced into the organisation, transferred between employees, improved on and kept alive that will help to improve SHE results. By improving the knowledge and skills of employees to manage SHE pro-actively, these principles can be applied across the business resulting in achieving benefits across the business. The aim of this research report is to determine, based on literature review, what the latest trends in managing safety, health and the environment (SHE) are that can yield positive results. In chapter two, an extensive literature review was conducted, identifying two methods of managing SHE in high risk environments such as the mining industry. The integrated approach, as presented by Mulder (2010) is considered to be the most applicable and appropriate due to the fact that it proposes an approach that cuts across business functions. This approach identifies five “pillars” that must be in place to ensure that the fundamentals of SHE is in place. The fundamentals of this approach can also be applied in any other area of the organisation and will yield positive business results throughout the organisation and not only to improve SHE. Although this integrated approach is the most comprehensive, it does not include aspects of managing knowledge, which is a key ingredient in this approach. The methodology followed in this research report to supplement this shortcoming and to develop a set of practical business recommendations is described in Chapter three. The crux of the methodology followed was to conduct an extensive literature review to identify current trends and best practices. The methodology used in during this report also yielded “hidden” opportunities based on the findings from the literature review and the focus group that was held as a result of these findings. The aim of the focus group was to supplement the approach as presented by Mulder (2010) with knowledge management principles that was identified by a group of well-trained and experienced employees. The employees are all members of the management team responsible for implementing and managing SHE within the organisation where the study was conducted. The detail of how the focus group was conducted, the development of the knowledge management approach and how the different knowledge maps evolved, resulted in the final agreed upon knowledge map, which is described in detail in Appendix C. In Chapter four, a comparison is made between what is presented based on the integrated approach by Mulder, and knowledge management principles. These results are also compared to the current SHE approach of a mining company. The analyses conducted are set out in detail in Chapter 4 of this report. Based on the findings and the gaps identified in Chapter 4, a set of business recommendations were made that could be considered to improve on the current SHE results as achieved by the mining organisation where the study was conducted. These results are practical and business orientated, based on the findings of the literature review and the focus group that was established to investigate ways of improving SHE at the mining operation. The results were presented in diagramme form, indicating how knowledge management principles should be included as a sixth leg into the approach suggested by Mulder. There were also a set of detail actions to be implemented to ensure that knowledge management is established and sustained in the organisation with specific focus on SHE and the SHE department. These recommendations were set out and clarified in Chapter five. In Chapter six a conclusion was drawn. Throughout the literature analysed, it was well argued that SHE is a very important focus area for any mining operation. This point was emphasised by the involvement from the stakeholders and the DMR that is currently stopping mining operations after serious accidents occur, resulting in millions of Rand lost in terms of revenue. It is also well established that managing SHE should be the core focus of any mining operation to ensure that they stay operational and maintain good public and investor image. To ensure that the required SHE results are achieved and maintained, the focus should be to reduce the risk right at the source. In the mining environment, this means managing SHE right at the coal face, (also referred to as the working face). It was also well argued that there are several ways of doing so and that as time has passed, methods of doing so has evolved through trial and error and through learning from the errors that were made. One crucial point to take note of is that this learning and improvement were not always captured because knowledge and knowledge management principles were never seen or used in the South African coal mining industry to improve on SHE results. Therefore, this research reports focuses on improving SHE by using the most recent and relevant approaches. These approaches were identified by conducting an in depth literature review identifying the most recent trends to manage SHE in high risk organisations. In the literature review, knowledge management principles were also identified as a key enabler of managing SHE. Combining knowledge management principles, with the other identified methods lead to the development of an integrated approach. The reasons why this is approached is supported by the author is that it is an approach that is practical and focussed. The principles can be applied within any business function and throughout the organisation and can lead to improved business results, not only in the SHE function. The integrated approach, as presented in this research report, is presented as a set of action plans that can be implemented throughout the organisation and across business functions...|$|E
