We have proposed a SVC (simplified virtual clock) scheduling mechanism. Simulation results have confirmed the viability of BRFQ (bit-round fair queuing), VC (virtual clock) and SVC scheduling mechanisms. When SVC is used, traffic isolation is somewhat loosened but not entirely eliminated. It is also shown that for selected packet switch structure, SVC scheduling mechanism performs best: it requires minimal buffer sizes and it produces smallest (mean and maximum) packet delays...|$|E

Blitzkrieg uses an object system to simplify the implementation of the partial evaluation system and to allow users to easily express their own domain-specific optimizations. The viability of Blitzkrieg is shown by applying it to the Stormer integrator on a 6 -body problem (achieving a factor of 610 speedup) and the Runge-Kutta integrator on the same problem (a factor of 365. 5 speedup).

The characteristics of the microwave devices are found by proper examination of S-parameters, which relates power levels at different ports by using s-parameter values, auxillary parameters like insertion, isolation, coupling, VSWR,reflection coefficient etc., can be obtained. Network Analyzer is a sophisticated testing device {{which is used to}} characterize active and passive components, such as amplifiers, mixers, duplexers, filters, couplers, and attenuators.

40|$|Abstract — Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier {{modulation}} technique which divides the available spectrum into many carriers. OFDM uses the spectrum efficiently compared to FDMA by spacing the channels much closer together and making all carriers orthogonal {{to one another}} to prevent interference between the closely spaced carriers. The main advantage of OFDM is their robustness to channel fading in wireless environment, but here MB-OFDM transmitter baseband is designing {{in order to provide}} high speed for application than OFDM. The objective of this project is to design and implement a baseband of MB-OFDM transmitter on FPGA hardware which provides very high speed for application. This project concentrates on developing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). The work also includes in designing a mapping module, serial to parallel and parallel to serial converter module. The design uses FFT and IFFT for the processing module which indicate that the processing block contain inputs data.

These upgrades, especially including an elongated pulse length, require broad changes to the control system that has served NSTX well. A new fiber serial Front Panel Data <b>Port</b> <b>input</b> and output (I/O) stream will supersede the aging copper parallel version. Driver support for the new I/O and cyber security concerns require updating the operating system from Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) v 4 to RedHawk (based on RHEL) v 6. While the basic control system continues to use the General Atomics Plasma Control System (GA PCS), the effort to forward port the entire software package to run under 64 -bit Linux instead of 32 -bit Linux included PCS modifications subsequently shared with GA and other PCS users. Software updates focused on three key areas: (1) code modernization through coding standards (C 99 /C 11), (2) code portability and maintainability through use of the GA PCS code generator, and (3) support of 64 -bit platforms.

The quality and effectivity of control systems is rising with help of simulation environments. We have decided to use products of The MathWorks, Matlab/Simulink and Matlab/SimScape for modeling of heating systems. Matlab/SimScape libraries contain special blocks for modeling hydraulic, thermal and mechanical components, which {{has been used to}} model this system. 1 Description of modeling environment Simulink- is a graphical user interface for modeling and simulation of block schematics. The core of the Matlab is used to compute the simulating results. Simulink is primarily used for modeling dynamic systems. Simulink’s libraries offer a plenty of blocks useful for modeling complex systems. With help of integrating methods, we can simulate the system and analyze it in time. Simscape – is a library of basic real world mechanics, hydraulics and electronics components. System, built from these blocks, is modeled from view of energy flow. Model works directly with physical parameters, so it approximates good real systems. Simscape generates differential equations from the modeled system that can communicate with other components from Matlab/Simulink after the simulation has been started. SimHydraulics – is a tool for modeling and simulation of hydraulic systems. It allows modeling of multi-domain systems, which contain connection of hydraulic and mechanical components. 2 Block description Model of heating system was built-up according to project of real heating system.

40|$|Container port is {{one special}} type of port {{that serves the}} {{shipping}} logistics that have been packaged in a container. The existence of the port, in particular, a container port, {{is very important for}} economic development in the region, even to the country. There are three main components in the framework of the process of stevedoring that should be kept interactions, namely: input, process, and output. In a container <b>port,</b> <b>input</b> is the arrival of container ships and the arrival container itself. The input process {{is in the form of}} services to ships and process of container stevedoring. While the output is the number of containers transported. The process of container stevedoring has an indicator that serves to measure productivity as well as indicators of container service quality. In general, the service quality of container is measured to know how long the process of stevedoring is carried out. Faster implementation of stevedoring will make the shipping part be more satisfied. The performance of the port operators and also stevedoring equipment is a major factor in the process of stevedoring. Unloading operations prioritize operator working position because of the speed of stevedoring cranes (stevedoring equipment) entirely within the control of the operator. With the burden and risk of heavy work, the operator is required to always optimally and minimize errors in each job. PT XYZ is a world-class container terminal company in cooperation with an international port manager. The container terminal is a major project of Indonesia Port Corporation (IPC II) to realize the construction of an international port in Indonesia. Equipped with a capacity of 4. 5 million TEUs, (twenty-foot equivalent unit) to enable the Triple E class container ships passing through Indonesia without transshipment at other ports. Until now Triple-E ship is the largest class of container ships with a carrying capacity of up to 12, 000 - 15, 000 TEUs. Amenities of existing port terminal at the Port of Tanjung Priok only serve vessels with a maximum capacity of 6, 000 TEUs, while the growing trend of the use of container ships in the world to use vessels with a capacity of > 10, 000 TEUs in order to reduce logistics costs per TEU, so as to serve aboard Direct Call with large size must be prepared adequate facilities. Due to the high activity of stevedoring hence careful planning is needed through three operational experiments (simulation) of stevedoring at PT XYZ before operational execution begins officially. The study used the quantitative approach with descriptive and comparative design. Total sample obtained was as many as 15 operators. Data processing technique included sign test, ANOVA test, interviews with respondents and cross tab to obtain the condition of respondent (operator) characteristics in relation to the impact of loading and unloading operations experiment perceived by respondent (operator). Based on the objectives, this study succeeded in analyzing differences from the three trials of loading and unloading operations conducted at PT XYZ. There is significant difference found among the three trials performed. The average box obtained was only 11 boxes per hour in May, 17 boxes per hour in July and 20 boxes per hour in August. However, the average number of the box per hour was still below the target set by the company those were 27 - 30 boxes per hour. Whereas PT XYZ has been using the system on the loading and unloading process, the Terminal Operating System, called COSMOS. This result contradicted the expected finding since by implementing the system, the operator in the field can immediately know the exact location of containers concerning the properties and delivery schedule of the container, thus loading and unloading time will be shorter. Therefore, managerial implication formulated to meet the target set by the company namely performing the further experiment by considering any operational mistakes found in the existing loading and unloading trial and better control on equipment used. Moreover, characteristics of the operator, including age, the level of education and work experience are not needed to be taken into account in the further operational process since the follow-up trial requires considerable training thus operator will be able to control system better...|$|E
