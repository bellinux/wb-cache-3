During nanoparticle synthesis, the number concentrations in the process room may exceed 10 × 106 cm− 3. During such conditions, {{it is essential that}} the occupants in the room wear highly reliable high-performance respirators to prevent inhalation exposure. Here we have studied the in-use program protection factor (PPF) of loose-fitting powered air purifying respirators, while workers were coating components with TiO 2 or Cu x O y nanoparticles under a hood using a liquid flame spray process. The PPF was measured using condensation particle counters, an electrical low pressure impactor, and diffusion chargers. The room particle concentrations varied from 4 × 106 to 40 × 106 cm− 3, and the count median aerodynamic diameter ranged from 32 to 180 nm. Concentrations inside the respirator varied from 0. 7 to 7. 2 cm− 3. However, on average, tidal breathing was assumed to increase the respirator concentration by 2. 3 cm− 3. The derived PPF exceeded 1. 1 × 106, which is more than 40 × 103 times the respirator assigned protection factor. We were unable to measure clear differences in the PPF of respirators with old and new filters, among two male and one female user, or assess most penetrating particle size.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose of the study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of several types of personal respiratory protection equipment at styrene exposed laminators under real work place conditions. Subjects and method: 99 male styrene exposed workers were examined. During their lamination activities the average styrene concentrations in air ranged between 30 to 60 ppm (maximum: 205 ppm). The laminators were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive active carbon badges. The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load. During the work shift some laminators did not use respiratory protection masks. The majority used either a half face mask with active carbon filter or an <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> <b>respirator.</b> Results: The respiratory masks were worn during an average between 31 % and 72 % of the work time. The styrene concentrations of the ambient air were-depending on the activity- in the range of 30 to 60 ppm. The end-ofshift concentrations of MA and PGA in urine samples varied considerably, their means range from 153 to 606 mg/g creatinine.

5000|$|According to NIOSH and OSHA, a {{combination}} of engineering controls, protective personal equipment, safety education, alternative proppant, and work site safety practices {{are the key to}} protecting workers from respirable crystalline silica exposure. One particular engineering control that is used in field testing is the mini-baghouse that reduces the silica dust produced by the sand movers. Personal protective equipment is normally used in jobs with silica exposure, however NIOSH discovered that incorrect respirators, a half mask type, was used and did not meet the silica exposure levels. [...] NIOSH and OSHA recommend a full face <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> <b>respirator</b> (PAPR) for all workers exposed to high levels of silica. Another control measure is using a silica substitute proppant such as sintered bauxite, ceramics, or resin-coated sand, however OSHA notes that the safety testing must be performed on these alternatives. Besides these controls measures, the recommend exposure limits (REL) and permissible exposure levels (PEL) need to be set lower than current levels.

40|$|Certain {{models of}} NIOSH-approved {{filtering}} facepiece <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> <b>respirators</b> are manufactured with stapled head straps. Depending on the manufacturer, these head straps may be stapled to the filter media itself. This may cause leakage through the filter media of the respirator, potentially exposing {{the user to}} an unacceptable level of contaminant. In this study, monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres were generated to challenge four replicates of a N 95 single use respirator model made by the same manufacturer. Nominal particle sizes of the PSL spheres used to challenge the respirators were 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrometers in diameter. All respirators were sealed onto a custom built testing assembly and tested in a sealed chamber. Particle sizes of interest were generated using a nebulizer, and passed through a diffusion dryer and a Krypton- 85 radioactive source prior to entering the test chamber. The dryer reduces the humidity of the aerosol generating by the nebulizer, while the radioactive source neutralizes the charge of the aerosol cloud. The test chamber was constructed using a glass aquarium measuring 32 x 53 x 122 centimeters. Three stainless steel air diffusers were placed above the testing compartment to evenly distribute the aerosol in the chamber. An exhaust manifold was placed at {{the lower part of}} the chamber beneath another stainless steel diffuser below the area where test respirators were placed. The respirators were challenged as received from the manufacturer with 0. 5, 1 and 2 micrometer-sized (PSL) spheres. The same procedure was repeated for each respirator after sealing the areas where the head straps were stapled with silicon rubber. Testing was conducted at a flow rate of 85 liters per minute, as specified in the NIOSH respirator testing protocol. A laser particle counter was used to measure the concentration inside and outside of the respirator. The results showed unsealed efficiencies for particle sizes 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrometers of 96. 68 %, 99. 72 %, 99. 88 % and sealed efficiencies of 97. 35 %, 99. 82 %, 99. 93 % respectively. There were no differences for particle size or sealing at 1. 0 and 2. 0 micrometers. A significant drop in efficiency was observed when testing with 0. 5 micrometer PSL spheres.

40|$|The use of {{respirators}} in {{the health}} care setting is a relatively new but important step forward in the efforts to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis (TB). <b>Air</b> <b>purifying</b> <b>respirators</b> provide a barrier to prevent health care workers from inhaling Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The level of protection a respirator provides is determined by the efficiency of the filter material and how well the facepiece fits or seals to the health care worker's face. A number of studies have shown that surgical masks will not provide adequate protection in filtering out the TB organism. Additionally, surgical masks are not respirators and therefore, are not NIOSH certified and do not satisfy OSHA requirements for respiratory protection. The proper use of respirators represents a significant improvement in employee protection against TB. NIOSH realizes that the use of respirators involves a number of new and perhaps confusing practices for the health care community. This manual is designed to serve as a practical guide for those individuals responsible for initiating and running a TB respiratory protection program in health care facilities. Other areas of the hospital may also require the use of respirators but the program and respirators used may be different. If such a program exists in your facility and has an experienced program administrator, it would be effective to administer the TB respirator program under the existing program and use existing facilities for fit-testing, cleaning, maintenance, storage, etc. This document is not designed to provide information on ventilation systems, negative pressure isolation rooms, and risk assessment methodologies, which should be included in a total TB prevention program.

40|$|In August 2000, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services {{requested}} {{technical assistance}} from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in an investigation of severe obstructive lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans) in former workers of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri. Affected workers {{had worked in the}} room where butter flavoring was mixed into heated soybean oil (mixing room) and in the adjacent microwave popcorn packaging-area. A NIOSH medical and environmental survey at the plant in November 2000 showed that plant employees had 3. 3 times the rate of obstruction on NIOSH spirometry tests compared to national rates; the prevalence of obstruction in never-smokers was 10. 8 times the national rate. Nineteen of 21 workers with obstruction had fixed obstruction (unresponsive to bronchodilators), and most chest x-rays and diffusing capacity tests were normal. These findings are consistent with constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans. Five of six quality control (QC) workers who repeatedly popped bags of product in microwave ovens (approximately 100 bags per worker per work shift) in a poorly ventilated room were found to have obstruction on spirometry. A strong exposure-response relationship was demonstrated between quartiles of estimated cumulative exposure to diacetyl (a volatile butter flavoring chemical contaminating the air in the plant) and the frequency of airways obstruction on spirometry tests. NIOSH investigators provided <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> <b>respirators</b> that filtered both vapors and particulates for mixers and assisted with employee training in respiratory protection. In January 2001, NIOSH investigators conducted a detailed engineering control assessment and provided exposure control recommendations. NIOSH performed seven additional cross-sectional medical and environmental surveys from April 2001 through August 2003 to determine if controls were effective in reducing exposures and protecting workers. Follow-up Environmental Findings: As a result of the implementation of exposure controls from January 2001 through May 2003, average diacetyl air concentrations declined two orders of magnitude in the mixing room (from 38 ppm to 0. 46 ppm) and the QC laboratory (from 0. 54 to 0. 002 ppm), and three orders of magnitude in the packaging area (from 1. 69 ppm to 0. 002 ppm for machine operators). Follow-up Medical Survey Findings: A total of 373 current workers participated in one or more NIOSH surveys. Participation by current workers at each survey ranged from 71 % to 91 %. One hundred eighty six of the 373 total participants participated in more than one survey (50 %). However, participation in more than one survey was much greater for workers hired prior to the first NIOSH survey (Cohort- 1; 100 of 146 participants, 68 %) than for workers hired after the first NIOSH survey (Cohort- 2; 86 of 227 participants, 38 %). From the first to last survey, there was a statistically significant decline in the prevalence of eye, nose, and throat irritation in Cohort- 1 participants but no significant changes in the prevalences of other symptoms or spirometry abnormalities, or in mean percent predicted FEV 1. Cohort- 2 participants had lower prevalences of symptoms and spirometry abnormalities, and a higher mean percent predicted FEV 1, compared to Cohort- 1 participants at their first survey. There were no statistically significant changes in these outcomes over time for Cohort- 2 participants. Of the 88 Cohort- 1 participants who participated in three or more NIOSH medical surveys, 19 (22 %) had FEV 1 declines of greater than 300 ml and/or 10 % from their first to their last spirometry test, compared to 3 of 41 (7 %) Cohort- 2 participants who participated in three or more surveys. Four of nine participants who worked as mixers after the 1 st NIOSH survey had FEV 1 declines of greater than 300 ml and/or 10 % of baseline, including one mixer who declined more than 1300 ml in nine months while working as a mixer. The total FEV 1 decline in this mixer was 2800 ml over 2. 75 years, which included a 1500 ml decline over two years after stopping work as a mixer. The NIOSH investigation at the Gilster-Mary Lee microwave popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri, determined that inhalation exposure to butter flavoring chemicals is a risk for occupational lung disease. With the exposure controls implemented to date, workers in the microwave popcorn packaging area should now be at minimal risk as long as isolation of the mixing room and mezzanine is maintained and all ventilation systems are operational. The exposure controls implemented in the QC laboratory have likely minimized the risk to workers in this area as well. However, QC laboratory workers should have regularly scheduled spirometry to assure that their lung function remains stable. Mixers are still at potential risk from open handling of butter flavorings and from tank emissions. Use of appropriate respiratory protection by mixers and other workers who enter the mixing room and mezzanine area is a short-term solution to this problem. Re-engineering the oil and butter flavoring mixing process to a closed system (so that mixers do not have to handle open containers of flavoring and no longer have to open tanks that contain heated oil and/or butter flavoring) is recommended to eliminate this risk. Until a closed process is implemented, all workers who enter the mixing room or mezzanine should use appropriate respiratory protection when in those locations and should have regularly scheduled spirometry to identify early declines in lung function that may be due to exposures to butter flavoring chemicals.

40|$|The {{question}} often arises {{about the}} reusability of organic vapor adsorption beds, such as air- <b>purifying</b> <b>respirator</b> cartridges, after periods of storage without use (airflow). The extremes of practice are: (1) use once and discard or (2) reuse multiple times assuming the protection is still afforded. The {{goal is to}} develop data and a model to provide guidance to decide when reuse is acceptable. They have studied the loss of protection of a commercial organic vapor cartridge after storage for varying periods of time. Three vapors (ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, and hexane) were individually loaded onto test cartridges using a breathing pump. Extents of loading, times of loading, and vapor concentrations were varied. After selected periods of storage the cartridges were again challenged with the same vapor concentration. The increases in concentration of a vapor in the effluent air (simulated breaths) from a cartridge immediately upon reuse depended on the storage period, the extent of loading during initial use, the volatility of the vapor, and the water vapor adsorbed, but not much on the vapor concentration...|$|R

40|$|The use of TiO 2 as {{photocatalyst}} {{in building}} materials is a rapidly developing technology in environmental engineering. In {{the presence of}} UV-light, anatase, a crystalline form of TiO 2, acts as a photocatalyst and decomposes organic particles and exhaust gases. Materials treated with TiO 2 also become highly hydrophilic {{and can be used}} as self-cleaning materials. Furthermore, these materials have a great potential to cope with the increasing air pollution, caused by traffic and industry. Due to the photocatalytic effect, NOx is oxidized resulting in an <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> action. For an optimal application of TiO 2 in building materials, {{it is important that the}} photocatalytical TiO 2 is accessible to UV-light. To ensure the adhesion of TiO 2 to the surface of the material, a layer of polymer modified cement mortar can be applied and TiO 2 can be added to the fresh mortar mixture. In this paper, <b>air</b> <b>purifying</b> efficiency is investigated for unmodified and polymer modified mortar mixtures with TiO 2 addition. The influence of different compositions, hydration time and relative humidity on the photocatalytic activity is studied. status: publishe...|$|R
