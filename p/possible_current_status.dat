40|$|Heavy metal {{pollution}} of soil {{is a significant}} environmental problem with a negative potential impact on human health and agriculture. Rhizosphere, as an important interface of soil and plants, {{plays a significant role}} in phytoremediation of contaminated soil by heavy metals, in which, microbial populations are known to affect heavy metal mobility and availability to the plant through release of chelating agents, acidification, phosphate solubilization and redox changes, and therefore, have potential to enhance phytoremediation processes. Phytoremediation strategies with appropriate heavy metal-adapted rhizobacteria or mycorrhizas have received more and more attention. In addition, some plants possess a range of potential mechanisms that may be involved in the detoxification of heavy metals, and they manage to survive under metal stresses. High tolerance to heavy metal toxicity could rely either on reduced uptake or increased plant internal sequestration, which is manifested by an interaction between a genotype and its environment. A coordinated network of molecular processes provides plants with multiple metal-detoxifying mechanisms and repair capabilities. The growing application of molecular genetic technologies has led to an increased understanding of mechanisms of heavy metal tolerance/accumulation in plants and, subsequently, many transgenic plants with increased heavy metal resistance, as well as increased uptake of heavy metals, have been developed for the purpose of phytoremediation. This article reviews advantages, <b>possible</b> mechanisms, <b>current</b> <b>status</b> and future direction of phytoremediation for heavy-metal-contaminated soils. </...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Superallowed 0 + → 0 + nuclear {{beta decay}} {{provides}} a direct {{measure of the}} weak vector coupling constant, GV. We survey current world data on the nine accurately determined transitions of this type, which range from the decay of 10 C to that of 54 Co, and demonstrate that the results confirm conservation of the weak vector current (CVC) but differ at the 98 % confidence level from the unitarity condition for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. We examine {{the reliability of the}} small calculated corrections that have been applied to the data, and assess the likelihood of even higher quality nuclear data becoming available to confirm or deny the discrepancy. Some of the required experiments depend upon the availability of intense radioactive beams. Others are <b>possible</b> today. <b>CURRENT</b> <b>STATUS</b> OF WORLD DATA Superallowed Fermi 0 + → 0 + nuclear beta decays [1, 2] provide both the best test of the Conserved Vector Current (CVC) hypothesis in weak interactions and, together with the muon lifetime, the most accurate value for the up-down quarkmixing matrix element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, Vud. At present, the value of Vud deduced from nuclear beta decay is such that, with standard values [3] of the other elements of the CKM matrix, the unitarity test from the sum of the squares of the elements in the first row fails to meet unity by more than twice the estimated error. According to CVC, the measured ft-values for Fermi decays closely reflect the value of the weak vector coupling constant, GV, and are independent of nuclear structure, outside of small correction terms that are of order 1 %. Specifically for an isospin- 1 multiplet Ft = ft(1 + δR) (1 − δC) ...|$|R

40|$|In biostatistical {{applications}} {{interest is}} often {{focused on the}} estimation {{of the distribution of}} time between two consecutive events. If the initial event time is observed and the subsequent event time is only known to be larger or smaller than an observed point in time, then the data is described by the well understood singly censored <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model, also known as interval censored data, case I. Jewell, Malani, Vittinghoff (1994) extended this <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model by allowing the initial time to be unobserved, with its distribution over an observed interval [A,B] known; the data is referred to as doubly censored <b>current</b> <b>status</b> data. This model has applications in AIDS partner studies If the initial time is known to be uniformly distributed, the model reduces to a submodel of the <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model with the same asymptotic information bounds as in the <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model, but the distribution of interest is essentially the derivative of the distribution of interest in the <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model. As a consequence the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is inconsistent. Moreover, this submodel contains only smooth heavy tailed distributions for which no moments exist. In this paper, we discuss the connection beween the singly censored <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model and the doubly censored <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model (for the uniform initial time) in detail and explain the difficulties in estimation which arise in the doubly censored case. We propose a regularized MLE corresponding with the <b>current</b> <b>status</b> model. We prove rate results, efficiency of smooth functionals of the regularized MLE, and present a generally applicable efficient method for estimation of regression parameters, which does not rely on the existence of moments. We also discuss extending these ideas to a non-uniform distribution for the initial time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLongitudinal {{studies of}} the {{clinical}} high risk (CHR) syndrome for psychosis have emphasized the conversion vs non-conversion distinction and thus far have not focused intensively on classification among non-converters. The present study proposes a system for classifying CHR outcomes over time when using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes and evaluates its validity. MethodThe system for classifying CHR outcomes {{is referred to as}} “current status specifiers,” with “current” meaning over the month prior to the present evaluation and “specifiers” indicating a set of labels and descriptions of the statuses. Specifiers for four <b>current</b> <b>statuses</b> are described: progression, persistence, partial remission, and full remission. Data from the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study were employed to test convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the <b>current</b> <b>status</b> distinctions. ResultsValidity analyses partly supported <b>current</b> <b>status</b> distinctions. Social and role functioning were more impaired in progressive and persistent than in remitted patients, suggesting a degree of convergent validity. Agreement between CHR <b>current</b> <b>statuses</b> and <b>current</b> <b>statuses</b> for a different diagnostic construct (DSM-IV Major Depression) was poor, suggesting discriminant validity. The proportion converting to psychosis within a year was significantly higher in cases meeting progression criteria than in those meeting persistence criteria and tended to be higher than in those meeting full remission criteria, consistent with a degree of predictive validity. DiscussionCHR syndrome <b>current</b> <b>status</b> specifiers could offer a potentially valid and useful description of <b>current</b> clinical <b>status</b> among non-converters.
