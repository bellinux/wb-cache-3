30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a {{comprehensive}} multi-scale three-dimensional (3 D) resistor network numerical model {{to predict the}} <b>piezoresistivity</b> behavior of a nanocomposite material composed of an insulating polymer matrix and conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This material {{is expected to be}} used as highly sensitive resistance-type strain sensors due to its high <b>piezoresistivity</b> defined as the resistance change ratio divided by the mechanical strain. In this multi-scale 3 D numerical model, three main working mechanisms, which are well known to induce the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of strain sensors fabricated from nanocomposites, are for the first time considered systematically. They are (a) the change of the internal conductive network formed by the CNTs, (b) the tunneling effect among neighboring CNTs, and (c) the CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity.</b> Comparisons between the present numerical results and our previous experimental ones were also performed to validate the present numerical model. The influence of the CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity</b> on the total <b>piezoresistivity</b> of nanocomposite strain sensors is explored in detail and further compared with that of the other two mechanisms. It is found that the first two working mechanisms (i.e., the change of the internal conductive network and the tunneling effect) play a major role on the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of the nanocomposite strain sensors, whereas the contribution from the CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity</b> is quite small.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistance due to mechanical deformation of carbon nanotube (CNT) /polymer composites can be rationalized {{in terms of}} two main effects: i) changes in the composite electrical resistivity due {{to changes in the}} CNT network configuration, and ii) deformation of the CNTs themselves. The contribution of CNT dimensional changes (ii) to the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNT/polymer composites is investigated here. A model based on a representative volume element which describes the CNT geometrical contribution to the composite electromechanical response (<b>piezoresistivity)</b> in terms of the CNT and matrix deformations is proposed. Finite element analysis is performed to correlate the macroscale composite strain to the individual CNT strain. The CNT geometric contribution to the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of the composite is quantified for a range of matrix elastic modulus and different CNT orientations. Based on the model predictions and previous experimental results, it is estimated that the contribution of the CNT deformation to the composite <b>piezoresistivity</b> is only about 5 %, indicating that the dominant effect in the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNT/polymer composites is the change in the CNT network configuration...|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} 3 D resistor network numerical model for predicting the <b>piezoresistivity</b> behaviors of strain sensors made from CNT/polymer nanocomposites. Besides {{the change of}} the internal conductive network formed by the conductive CNTs and the tunneling effect among neighboring CNTs, {{the contribution of the}} CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity</b> was incorporated simultaneously. This modeling was realized by using a multi-scale technique in which we firstly compute the strain of a CNT in a RVE, then transform it into the strain of a randomly oriented CNT in the polymer matrix under a prescribed strain, and finally build up the relationship between the electrical conductivity change of the CNT using the above strain information and the CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity</b> obtained from the first-principle computations [14]. An iterative model, which combines the 3 D resistor network model and the fiber reorientation model, was constructed to predict the total <b>piezoresistivity</b> of the nanocomposite sensors from the updated information including CNT position, the internal conductive network, the tunneling effect among those neighboring CNTs, and the electrical conductivity of CNTs. The computational results qualitatively agree with our previous experimental results very well. Moreover, the contribution of the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNTs on the total <b>piezoresistivity</b> of the nanocomposite sensors is comparatively small, compared with those from the change of the internal conductive network and tunneling effects. The present numerical results can provide some valuable information for designing the highly sensitive resistance-type strain sensors made from the nanocomposites containing CNTs or other nanofillers.|$|E

Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction in combination with micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed that with increasing pyrolysis temperature, the content of free carbon in the X-ray amorphous SiOC matrix increases without changes in the overall composition.

In particular, it has been confirmed that the conductance of a CNT could be dramatically changed by introducing a mechanical strain as a consequence of structural change (e.g., chirality change [2]). Due to this <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNTs, great interest has recently been aroused in building strain sensors not only using CNTs themselves (either single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) or multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)) [3 – 5] but also incorporating them into an insulating polymer matrix [6 – 9], as summarized in a recent review paper [10]. As compared to conventional metal-foil strain gauges, higher sensitivities have been observed in these novel sensors at least at a macro-scale [5 – 9]. Moreover, a linear <b>piezoresistivity</b> has been identified within very small strain ranges (e.g., 200 [*]με [4] or 1, 300 [*]με [5]), whereas nonlinear <b>piezoresistivity</b> has also been reported for a quite large strain range (e.g., 6, 000 [*]με [6, 7]). In spite of these exciting results, the fundamental understanding of <b>piezoresistivity</b> behavior in a CNT/polymer nanocomposite is still lacking, largely due to less effort being put into theoretical and numerical investigations.|$|E
30|$|To {{include the}} CNTs’ <b>piezoresistivity</b> effect in a multi-scale way, we firstly {{calculate}} {{the strain of}} an embedded CNT by applying a mechanical tensile strain on a micro-mechanics-based cylindrical representative volume element (RVE), which simulates the CNT deformation for the case of multiple one-directionally aligned CNTs in a polymer matrix. Then, we transform the strain of the CNT into that of an arbitrary-oriented CNT dispersed in macroscopic CNT/polymer nanocomposites. By employing this strain information and the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNTs themselves predicted from the first-principle computations at the atomistic scale [13, 14], we update the electrical conductance of the CNTs in the internal conductive network of the macroscopic nanocomposite sensors under the applied strain. By using this updated electrical conductance of CNTs and incorporating the internal network change of CNTs and tunneling effect simultaneously, we finally comprehensively evaluate the <b>piezoresistivity</b> of the nanocomposite strain sensors.|$|E

Then, by integrating this fiber reorientation model into the 3 D resistor network model in an iterative way, the resistance change of the nanocomposites caused by the applied strain is estimated. Moreover, the predicted electrical conductivity and <b>piezoresistivity</b> of CNT/polymer nanocomposites are verified using our previous experimental data [6 – 8]. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters (i.e., cross-sectional area of tunnel current, height of barrier, alignment of CNTs, electrical conductivity, and nanofiller electrical conductivity) are systematically investigated [12].

40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} polymers (ECPs), offering capabilities such as {{electrostatic discharge}} protection and electromagnetic interference shielding, {{have been the}} subject of intensive research and development both in academia and industry. The emergence of new conductive nano-fillers in recent decades, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs), further fuels more enthusiasm. Thanks to CNTs’ excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical/electronic properties, CNT-filled polymers possess not only conductive properties, but a range of other properties desirable for multi-functional and high performance applications. In order to fully exploit the benefits of CNT-based conductive polymers (CNT-ECPs), researchers have conducted diverse studies primarily to characterize the electrical conductivity of the composites. A crucial area that is less studied is the piezoresitive behaviors of CNT-ECPs, that is, the change in material conductive properties due to an applied stress or strain. Given broad usage of ECPs, it would be reasonable to assume that ECP products commonly operate under certain stress or strain conditions. For instance, an electrostatic discharge (ESD) -protected conductive coating for spacecraft would be affected by strain induced by mechanical or aerodynamic loads. A more systematic understanding of the materials’ <b>piezoresistivity,</b> therefore, is instrumental in ensuring satisfactory conductive performance of those material applications. Additionally, knowledge of conductive characteristics of the CNT-ECPs against stress/strain can open the door to newer material applications, e. g., strain gage or multifunctional conductive coating with strain-sensing capability. This research aims to achieve a more fundamental understanding of the mechanism of piezoresistive property of CNT-ECPs, and to develop a model that permits quantifying the structure-property relationships of CNT-ECPs’ <b>piezoresistivity.</b> In this research, expanded experimental studies with various thermoplastic CNT-ECPs revealed that <b>piezoresistivity</b> in CNT-ECPs is dominated by changes in inter-tube resistances. Additionally, the gauge (sensitivity) factors of the CNT-ECPs follow an exponential relationship with (v – vc), where v is the volume concentration of CNT in the composite and vc is the tube volume concentration at its percolation threshold.
