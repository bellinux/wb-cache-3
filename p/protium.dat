5|$|Hydrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol H and atomic number1. With a standard atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) {{is the most}} abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars {{are mainly composed of}} hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed <b>protium</b> (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.|$|E
5|$|By definition, any two atoms with an {{identical}} number of protons in their nuclei {{belong to the}} same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called <b>protium),</b> one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson. All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as <b>protium,</b> {{has a single}} proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has {{played a key role}} in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Deuterium is a {{hydrogen}} isotope with a nucleus containing a neutron and a proton; {{the nucleus of}} a <b>protium</b> (normal hydrogen) atom consists of just a proton. The additional neutron makes a deuterium atom roughly twice as heavy as a <b>protium</b> atom.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} <b>protium.</b> In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when <b>protium</b> is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in <b>protium</b> NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E
25|$|Tritiated water {{contains}} tritium (3H) {{in place}} of <b>protium</b> (1H) or deuterium (2H), and therefore is radioactive.|$|E
25|$|Threatened {{species were}} Euterpe edulis, Tabebuia cassinoides, <b>Protium</b> kleinii, Swartzia flaemingii, Lobelia anceps, Ocotea odorifera, Hibiscus bifurcatus, Brosimum glaziovii and Pharus latifolius.|$|E
25|$|Isotopes differ {{according}} to their number of neutrons, which directly impacts physical properties based on mass and size. Typical hydrogen is called hydrogen-1 or <b>protium</b> and has no neutrons. Deuterium or hydrogen-2 has one neutron and tritium or hydrogen-3 has two neutrons. These additional neutrons significantly impact {{the mass of the}} element, leading to different chemical physical properties. This effect is especially prevalent in hydrogen isotopes, since addition of a neutron doubles the mass from <b>protium</b> to deuterium. For higher order elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, the mass difference is diluted.|$|E
25|$|This is {{discussed}} below. It is notable that although most stars, including the Sun, generate energy {{over most of}} their lives by fusing hydrogen into heavier elements, such fusion of light hydrogen (<b>protium)</b> has never been successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial fusion, including the hydrogen fusion that occurs in so-called hydrogen bombs, requires heavy hydrogen (either tritium or deuterium, or both) in order for the process to work.|$|E
25|$|In Marvel Family #10, Atlantis appears. It was sunk about 8000 BC by an {{earth fault}} below the Island, but the Sivana Family hope {{to use an}} element there for a machine to prevent the Marvels calling their {{lightning}} down. A scientist Chal-Patzun, hoped to have Atlantis raised in the Future by his descendants, his son having gone to the mainland. He had discovered an element called <b>Protium,</b> which in 10,000 years would become Neutrium, and in another 10,000 years, Electrium. A machine powered by this would raise the Island. Before Atlantis sinks, Georgia Sivana, having traveled to the past, steals a vial of <b>Protium.</b> During the 20th century his descendant, Dr. Charles Patterson, is shot by Sivana while in the vault after he tries to stop him taking Neutrium. It is raised around AD 12,000 by Dr. Charles Patterson's own descendant, Chass Passon, though two of the vials had been stolen by the Sivanas {{in the past and}} present, leaving just eight. Sivana Jr. succeeds in taking a vial of Electrium just after the Island is raised. Atlantis is apparently located around the Atlantic coast latitude 35. See more on Sivana Family.|$|E
25|$|The {{predicted}} {{abundance of}} CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis {{is expected to}} be on the order of 10−15 that of H, making them essentially undetectable and negligible. Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of the elements from lithium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of beryllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only stable nuclides known experimentally to have been made before or during Big Bang nucleosynthesis are <b>protium,</b> deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.|$|E

25|$|Deuterium or hydrogen-2, {{with one}} proton and one neutron, {{is also known}} to have cosmic origin. Like <b>protium,</b> {{deuterium}} was produced {{very early in the}} universe's history during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. As protons and neutrons combined, helium-4 was produced with a deuterium intermediate. Alpha reactions with helium-4 produce many of the larger elements that dominate today's solar system. However, before the universe cooled, high-energy photons destroyed any deuterium, preventing larger element formation. This {{is referred to as the}} deuterium bottleneck, a restriction on the timeline for nucleosynthesis. All of today's deuterium originated from this proton-proton fusion after sufficient cooling.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of hydrogen isotopes also impacted {{the field of}} physics in the 1940s, as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was first invented. Today, organic chemists utilize NMR for mapping protein interactions or identifying small compounds, but NMR was first a passion project of physicists. All three isotopes of hydrogen {{were found to have}} magnetic properties suitable for NMR spectroscopy. The first chemist to fully express an application of NMR was George Pake, who measured gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) as a crystal and powder. The signal observed, called the Pake doublet, was from the magnetically active hydrogens in water. Pake then calculated the proton-proton bond distance. NMR measurements were further revolutionized when commercial machines became available in the 1960s. Before this, NMR experiments involved constructing massive projects, locating large magnets, and hand wiring miles of copper coil. Proton NMR remained the most popular technique throughout advancements in following decades, but deuterium and tritium were used in other flavors of NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium has a different magnetic moment and spin than <b>protium,</b> but generally a much smaller signal. Historically, deuterium NMR is a poor alternative to proton NMR, but has been used to study the behavior of lipids on membranes. Recently, a variation of deuterium NMR called 2H-SNIF has shown potential for understating position specific isotope compositions and comprehending biosynthetic pathways. Tritium is also used in NMR, as it is the only nucleus more sensitive than <b>protium,</b> generating very large signals. However, tritium's radioactivity discouraged many studies of T-NMR.|$|E
25|$|Vapor isotope effects {{occur for}} <b>protium,</b> deuterium, and tritium, because each isotope has {{different}} thermodynamic {{properties in the}} liquid and gaseous phases. For water molecules, the condensed phase is more enriched while the vapor is more depleted. For example, rain condensing from a cloud will be heavier than the vapor starting point. Generally, the large variations in deuterium concentrations of water are from the fractionations between liquid, vapor, and solid reservoirs. In contrast to the fractionation pattern of water, non-polar molecules like oils and lipids, have gaseous counterparts enriched with deuterium relative to the liquid. This {{is thought to be}} associated with the polarity from hydrogen bonding in water that does not interfere in long-chain hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|Note that labile protons (-OH, -NH2, -SH) have no {{characteristic}} chemical shift. However such resonances can {{be identified}} by the disappearance of a peak when reacted with D2O, as deuterium will replace a <b>protium</b> atom. This method is called a D2O shake. Acidic protons may also be suppressed when a solvent containing acidic deuterium ions (e.g. methanol-d4) is used. An alternate method for identifying protons that are not attached to carbons is the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment, which correlates protons and carbons that are one bond away from each other. A hydrogen that is not attached to a carbon {{can be identified}} {{because it does not}} have a crosspeak in the HSQC spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Different {{isotopes}} {{of chemical}} elements have slightly different chemical behaviors, {{but for most}} elements the differences are far too small to use, or even detect. For hydrogen, however, this is not true. The larger chemical isotope-effects seen between <b>protium</b> (light hydrogen) versus deuterium and tritium manifest because bond energies in chemistry are determined in quantum mechanics by equations in which the quantity of reduced mass of the nucleus and electrons appears. This quantity is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (of which deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution in other chemical elements. This isotope effect of heavy hydrogen is magnified further in biological systems, which {{are very sensitive to}} small changes in the solvent properties of water.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen isotope {{biogeochemistry}} is {{the scientific}} study of biological, geological, and chemical processes in the environment using the distribution and relative abundance of hydrogen isotopes. There are two stable isotopes of hydrogen, <b>protium</b> 1H and deuterium 2H, which vary in relative abundance on the order of hundreds of permil. The ratio between these two species can be considered the hydrogen isotopic fingerprint of a substance. Understanding isotopic fingerprints and the sources of fractionation that lead to variation between them can be applied to address a diverse array of questions ranging from ecology and hydrology to geochemistry and paleoclimate reconstructions. Since specialized techniques are required to measure natural hydrogen isotope abundance ratios, the field of hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry provides uniquely specialized tools to more traditional fields like ecology and geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Protium</b> is a spin 1/2 {{subatomic}} particle {{and is therefore}} a fermion. Other fermions include neutrons, electrons, and the radioactive isotope tritium. Fermions are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle, where no two particles can have the same quantum number. However, bosons like deuterium and photons, are not bound by exclusion and multiple particles can occupy the same energy state. This fundamental difference in 1H and 2H manifests in many physical properties. Integer spin particles like deuterium follow Bose-Einstein statistics while fermions with half integer spins follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Wave functions that describe multiple fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to swapping particles, while boson wave functions are symmetric. Because bosons are indistinguishable and can occupy the same state, collections of bosons behave very differently than fermions at colder temperatures. As bosons are cooled and relaxed to the lowest energy state, phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity occur.|$|E
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurred within}} the first three minutes {{of the beginning of}} the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (<b>protium),</b> 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4). Although 4He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by spallation and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some 7Li and 7Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the most}} common {{hydrogen}} isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name <b>protium.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hydrogen is {{the only}} element that has {{different}} names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of [...] and [...] ) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for <b>protium,</b> P, is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for <b>protium.</b> In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) allows any of D, T, , and [...] to be used, although [...] and [...] are preferred.|$|E
2500|$|Deuterium (or hydrogen-2, symbol [...] or , {{also known}} as heavy hydrogen) {{is one of two}} stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen (the other being <b>protium,</b> or hydrogen-1). The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common <b>protium</b> has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in [...] of hydrogen. Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or, on a mass basis, 0.0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while <b>protium</b> accounts for more than 99.98%. The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another (see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).|$|E

2500|$|The most {{fundamental}} description of hydrogen isotopes {{in a system}} is the relative abundance of deuterium and <b>protium.</b> [...] This value can be reported as the isotope ratio R or the fractional abundance F defined as: ...|$|E
2500|$|... where H and H are {{the amounts}} of {{deuterium}} and <b>protium,</b> respectively. [...] Fractional abundance is equivalent to mole fraction, and yields atom percent when multiplied by 100. [...] In some instances atom percent excess is used, which reports the atom percent of a sample minus the atom percent of a standard.|$|E
2500|$|Semiheavy water, HDO, exists {{whenever}} there is water with light hydrogen (<b>protium,</b> [...] ) and deuterium (D or [...] ) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen actually contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of [...] and , in dynamic equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} {{hydrogen}} isotope biogeochemistry {{relies on the}} fact that various physicochemical processes will preferentially enrich or deplete deuterium relative to <b>protium</b> (see kinetic isotope effect, etc.). [...] There are various measures that have been developed to described the fractionation in an isotope between two pools, often the product and reactant of a physiochemical process. [...] α notation describes the difference between two hydrogen pools A and B with the following equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (proton NMR, hydrogen-1 NMR, or 1H NMR) is the application of nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} in NMR spectroscopy with respect to hydrogen-1 nuclei within the molecules of a substance, {{in order to determine}} the structure of its molecules. [...] In samples where natural hydrogen (H) is used, practically all the hydrogen consists of the isotope 1H (hydrogen-1; i.e. having a proton for a nucleus). [...] A full 1H atom is called <b>protium.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Heavy water (deuterium oxide, , [...] ) {{is a form}} {{of water}} that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium ( [...] or D, also known as heavy hydrogen), rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope ( [...] or H, also called <b>protium)</b> that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal [...] "light water".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Protium</b> or hydrogen-1, {{with one}} proton and no neutrons, {{is the most}} {{abundant}} element in the solar system, formed in the earliest rounds of stellar explosions after the Big Bang. After the universe exploded into life, the hot and dense cloud of particles began to cool, first forming subatomic particles like quarks and electrons, which then condensed to form protons and neutrons. [...] Elements larger than hydrogen and helium were produced with successive stars, forming from the energy released during supernovae.|$|E
2500|$|All {{isotopes}} of {{a chemical}} element contain {{the same number of}} protons with varying numbers of neutrons. [...] The element hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, H, H and H, which are sometimes referred to as <b>protium</b> (H), deuterium (D) and tritium (T), respectively. [...] Both H and H are stable indefinitely, while H is unstable and undergoes beta decay to form He. [...] While there are some important applications of H in geochemistry (such as its use as an ocean circulation tracer) these will not be discussed further here.|$|E
2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, deuterium and <b>protium</b> are stable isotopes {{which never}} undergo radioactive decay. [...] Therefore, the D/H ratio of a pool containing hydrogen will remain constant {{as long as}} no hydrogen is added or removed from the system, a property known as conservation of mass. [...] When two pools of hydrogen A and B mix with molar amounts of hydrogen m and m, each with their own starting fractional abundance of deuterium (F and F), then the fractional abundance of the resulting mixture is given by the following exact equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Urey {{created the}} names <b>protium,</b> deuterium, and tritium {{in an article}} {{published}} in 1934. The name is based in part on advice from G. N. Lewis who had proposed the name [...] "deutium". The name is derived from the Greek deuteros (second), and the nucleus to be called [...] "deuteron" [...] or [...] "deuton". Isotopes and new elements were traditionally given the name that their discoverer decided. Some British chemists, like Ernest Rutherford, wanted the isotope to be called [...] "diplogen", from the Greek diploos (double), and the nucleus to be called diplon.|$|E
2500|$|Deuterium is {{frequently}} {{represented by the}} chemical symbol D. Since it is an isotope of hydrogen with mass number 2, it is also represented by [...] IUPAC allows both D and , although [...] is preferred. A distinct chemical symbol is used for convenience because of the isotope's common use in various scientific processes. Also, its large mass difference with <b>protium</b> (1H) (deuterium has a mass of , compared to the mean hydrogen atomic weight of , and protium's mass of [...] ) confers non-negligible chemical dissimilarities with protium-containing compounds, whereas the isotope weight ratios within other chemical elements are largely insignificant in this regard.|$|E
2500|$|Helium-3 (He-3, {{also written}} as 3He, see also helion) is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron (common helium having two neutrons). Its {{hypothetical}} existence was first proposed in 1934 by the Australian nuclear physicist Mark Oliphant {{while he was}} working at the University of Cambridge Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant had performed experiments in which fast deuterons collided with deuteron targets (incidentally, the first demonstration of nuclear fusion). [...] Helium-3 was thought to be a radioactive isotope until it was also found in samples of natural helium, [...] which is mostly helium-4, taken both from the terrestrial atmosphere and from natural gas wells. Other than <b>protium,</b> helium-3 is the only stable isotope of any element with more protons than neutrons.|$|E
