5|$|The {{character}} of this stage changed drastically after the dramatic injury sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before brought attention to safety conditions on this and other courses in the Giro. With the course passing over numerous different surfaces, including tram tracks and cobblestones, the peloton collectively protested racing this course, and as such it was neutralized, with everyone receiving {{the same time as}} the stage winner and no points were awarded for the points classification as had been planned. There were also <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> at the side of the road in many places, forcing the riders into narrow tunnels to get through them.|$|E
5|$|The {{funeral of}} Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh (né Kevin Brady), {{the third and}} last of the Milltown attack victims to be buried, was {{scheduled}} for 19 March. As his cortège proceeded along Andersontown Road, a car being driven by two British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, entered the street and sped past two teams of stewards, who were attempting to direct traffic out of the procession's path. As the corporals continued along Andersontown Road, they came across the cortège, and mounted the footpath to avoid colliding with it. They continued until blocked by <b>parked</b> <b>cars,</b> at which point they attempted to reverse, but were blocked by vehicles from the cortège and a hostile crowd surrounded their vehicle.|$|E
50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> fits more <b>cars</b> per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> lots and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> structures.|$|R

5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E

On January 31, 2014, parking was banned {{on both sides of the}} street in an effort to reduce violence and drug activity.

It was not clear that Bryant was mobile, nor was it even clear from which direction the shots were coming.|$|E
25|$|The parking {{strategy}} for sequencing resembles {{the process of}} parking cars along a curb. Each car is a sequenced clone, and the curb is the genomic target. Each clone sequenced is screened to ensure that subsequently sequenced clones do not overlap any previously sequenced clone. No sequencing effort is redundant in this strategy. However, much like the gaps between <b>parked</b> <b>cars,</b> unsequenced gaps less than {{the length of a}} clone accumulate between sequenced clones. There can be considerable cost to close such gaps.|$|E
25|$|As with {{previous}} Need for Speed titles, Most Wanteds soundtrack contains {{a variety of}} licensed music. It mainly comprises electronic music (including dubstep, such as Skrillex, Techno, such as Deadmau5, and electronica, such as Zedd), alternative rock and hip hop, such as Dizzee Rascal. Among these songs are two remixes of The Who songs originally from the album Who's Next. Most Wanted also contains songs from Criterion Games' previous title, Burnout Crash!, which play over the stereo of <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E

25|$|During the mid-1970s, Berkowitz {{started to}} commit violent crimes. He bungled a {{first attempt at}} murder using a knife, then {{switched}} to a handgun and began a lengthy crime spree throughout the New York boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. He sought young female victims. He was purportedly most attracted to women with long, dark, wavy hair. All {{but one of the}} crime sites involved two victims; he infamously committed some of his attacks while the women sat with boyfriends in <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> He exhibited an enduring enjoyment of his activities, often returning to the scenes of his crimes.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick {{itself is}} {{relatively}} flat and {{is ideal for}} cycling. Brunswick East is bounded by the Merri Creek Trail, and Brunswick West by the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, though neither of these {{can be described as}} flat. The Upfield Bike Path follows the Upfield railway line from Fawkner, through Coburg and Brunswick, joining the Capital City Trail at Park Street. Streets in Brunswick vary, from too narrow for two cars to pass, to reasonably wide. Not all of the wider streets have cycle lanes, though even riding in lanes in the narrower street often means riding close to <b>parked</b> <b>cars,</b> presenting a significant hazard to cyclists from opening car doors.|$|E
25|$|The Briskeby Line is in poor {{condition}} {{because of}} insufficient maintenance. The transit authorities {{are in the}} process of upgrading the line, which will involve new stations, possibly located at more suitable locations. A report published by Ruter found several shortcomings in the line. In addition to its low technical standard, it often sees operations interrupted by incorrectly <b>parked</b> <b>cars,</b> especially in Riddervolds gate. The intersection of Inkognitogata and Riddervolds gate have a curve radius of , which hinders the newer SL95 trams from operating on the line. Because the use of Inkognitogata the services do not pass through the important transit hub at Solli plass.|$|E

The bus was empty having just {{dropped off the}} last passengers, and the bus driver managed to escape unharmed, along with the cash box the hijackers had tried to steal. The hijacked bus was then driven through the area, striking a number of <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> and signs, before being reversed into another Metrobus vehicle which was in service with passengers. There were no injuries, but the road was closed {{for a number of}} hours while the police investigated. Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested.

25|$|The bombing {{occurred}} at 4:58 PM on 19 July 1992, 57 {{days after the}} bombing of Capaci, in which Borsellino's friend, anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed {{with his wife and}} police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the massacre of Via D'Amelio, Antonino Vullo, said the judge had stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30pm to around 4:00pm, when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed nothing unusual except some <b>parked</b> <b>cars.</b> The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.|$|E
25|$|Copenhagen's {{relatively}} well-developed bicycle {{culture has}} given rise to the term copenhagenization. This is the practice where other cities try to follow the example Copenhagen has set in recent decades, by moving from their own (often long-held) car-centric transport policies to those that attempt to greatly increase the number of journeys by bicycle; they do this by developing bicycle infrastructure and/or improving their current bicycle infrastructure just as Copenhagen has done and continues to do. An example of a city which has introduced bike lanes acknowledging inspiration from Copenhagen is Melbourne in Australia where kerbside bike lanes separated from moving and <b>parked</b> <b>cars</b> by a low concrete kerb are referred to as 'Copenhagen lanes'. The concept of Copenhagenization has been featured by CNNs Richard Quest in the Futures Cities series and on Al Jazeera's Earthrise series.|$|E
