25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E
500|$|Many tawny nurse sharks found off {{the coasts}} of Japan, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands lack a second dorsal fin. This <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> has been speculated to result from {{pregnant}} females being exposed to water of unusually high salinity and/or temperature, possibly from human activity. In 1986, a [...] long adult male with both a missing dorsal fin and partial albinism (in the form of white body color with gray-brown eyes) was captured off Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. This anomalous individual is the largest albino shark known to date, having survived {{for a long time}} in the wild despite its lack of camouflage.|$|E
500|$|On a {{visit to}} the College of Arms, Bond finds that the family motto of Sir Thomas Bond is [...] "The World Is Not Enough", and that he might be (though unlikely) Bond's ancestor. On the pretext that a genetically-inherited minor <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> (a lack of earlobes) needs a {{personal}} confirmation, Bond impersonates a College of Arms representative, Sir Hilary Bray, to visit Blofeld's lair atop Piz Gloria, a fictional mountain top in the Engadin, somewhere between Samedan and Pontresina, where he finally meets Blofeld. Blofeld has undergone plastic surgery partly to remove his earlobes, but also to disguise himself from the police and security services who are tracking him down.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} of Richard's defenders was Horace Walpole. In Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third (1768), Walpole disputed all the alleged murders {{and argued that}} Richard may have acted in good faith. He also argued that any <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> was probably {{no more than a}} minor distortion of the shoulders. However, he retracted his views in 1793 after the Terror, stating he now believed that Richard could have committed the crimes he was charged with, although Pollard observes that this retraction is frequently overlooked by later admirers of Richard. Other defenders of Richard include the noted explorer Clements Markham, whose Richard III: His Life and Character (1905) replied to the work of Gairdner. He argued that Henry VII killed the princes and that evidence of other [...] "crimes" [...] was nothing more than rumour and propaganda. An intermediate view was provided by Alfred Legge in The Unpopular King (1885). Legge argued that Richard's [...] "greatness of soul" [...] was eventually [...] "warped and dwarfed" [...] by the ingratitude of others.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receipt of}} Moniz's monograph, Freeman {{reviewed}} it anonymously for the Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry. Praising {{the text as}} one whose [...] "importance can scarcely be overestimated", he summarised Moniz's rationale for the procedure as {{based on the fact}} that while no <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> of cerebral cell bodies was observable in the mentally ill, their cellular interconnections may harbour a [...] "fixation of certain patterns of relationship among various groups of cells" [...] and that this resulted in obsessions, delusions and mental morbidity. While recognising that Moniz's thesis was inadequate, for Freeman it had the advantage of circumventing the search for diseased brain tissue in the mentally ill by instead suggesting that the problem was a functional one of the brain's internal wiring where relief might be obtained by severing problematic mental circuits.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{lameness}} {{is caused}} by a <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality,</b> such as scar tissue, that prevents normal motion of a limb. Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{language}} impairment (SLI) {{is diagnosed}} when a child's language does not develop normally {{and the difficulties}} cannot {{be accounted for by}} generally slow development, <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> of the speech apparatus, autism spectrum disorder, acquired brain damage or hearing loss. Twin studies have shown that it is under geneticinfluence. Although language impairment can result from a single-gene mutation, this is unusual. More commonly SLI results from the combined influence of multiple genetic variants, each of which is found in the general population, as well as environmental influences.|$|E

5000|$|Psychogenic disease (or {{psychogenic}} illness) {{is a name}} {{given to}} physical illnesses that are believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders. It is most commonly applied to illnesses where a <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> or other biomarker {{has not yet been}} identified. In the absence of such [...] "biological" [...] evidence of an underlying disease process, it is often assumed that the illness must have a psychological cause, even if the patient shows no indications of being under stress or of having a psychological or psychiatric disorder.|$|E

5000|$|At the trial, expert {{evidence}} was led that Stellmacher {{was suffering from}} [...] "amnesia and automatism" [...] due to hypoglycaemia and/or epilepsy, possibly triggered by his fasting and drinking. The central issue was not {{whether or not he}} should be convicted of murder—it was accepted that he was not liable—but rather whether or not he had suffered from a temporary mental disorder, necessitating a special verdict. The court held that Stellmacher's automatism, in this case, was due to physical factors, not any <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality,</b> so a special verdict was not required. He was found not guilty and acquitted outright.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} twelve weeks of a pregnancy, an {{abortion}} may be {{performed at the}} request of the woman.

50|$|Macrostomia is {{characterized}} as a <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality</b> that causes clefts to form {{on the face of}} affected individuals. These clefts can form on either or both sides of the face, but they are most commonly seen on the right cheek and have a higher rate of occurrence in males. Macrostomia is very irregular and on average occurs only once in every 150,000 to 300,000 live births. It's unusual for macrostomia to occur on its own and it is included as a symptom for many diseases including craniofacial microsomia. The clefts result from improper development and fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes. The clefts cause problems with facial muscle development. The origin of macrostomia is not yet fully understood it could have multiple causes.|$|E

5000|$|Each verse {{describes}} the isolation and suffering of a child, {{two of whom}} have a <b>physical</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In the first verse, a boy is injured {{in a car accident}} and misses school for an extended period; when he returns to class, his hair has changed color from black to white. In the second verse, a girl refuses to change clothes in the presence of other girls due to the birthmarks that cover her body. The third child is a boy whose parents make him come directly home after school; during services at their church, they [...] "shake and lurch" [...] across the floor. During a 2010 live performance for the Dutch radio station Kink FM, Brad Roberts whispered [...] "Pentecostal" [...] during the third verse, suggesting this is the denomination of the church.|$|E
