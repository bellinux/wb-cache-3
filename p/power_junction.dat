Abstract—Resilient control systems play a special role in the area of cyber-physical systems, where the design must address the question how complex dynamic plants are to be controlled safely and reliably when a control system is under a cyber attack. In this paper we describe a control theoretical framework based on the concept of passivity for designing a control network which can tolerate, for instance, denial-of-service attacks on networks used in the closed loop. In particular, we demonstrate how the resilient <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> structure could be applied, and provide simulated results. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>power</b> <b>junction</b> {{field effect}} {{transistor}} (JFET) {{is the second most}} mature SiC device, after the SiC Schottky diode, and is commonly associated with normally on functionality; but this feature is often viewed problematically for off-line dc-to-dc converter applications. Two inherently safe, single-switch dc-dc converter designs have been developed that put into practice pure SiC JFET devices (i. e., without cascoded devices) that possess enhancement-mode functionality and bias-enhanced blocking. These ‘Quasi-Off ’ devices are designed to block half of the rated blocking voltage at zero gate bias and achieve full rated blocking voltage with a modest negative bias, typically between 0 and- 5 V. Inherent safety is provided by utilizing the enhancement mode functionality of these devices as well as appropriate gate driver design. Bias enhanced blocking matches the dynamic stress encountered by modern high-frequency power supply topologies to the ratings of the device while recognizing that the larger dynamic stress is typically encountered only when the power supply (and especially the gate driver) is functioning properly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As {{transistors}} {{continue to}} evolve along Moore’s Law and silicon devices {{take advantage of this}} evolution to offer in-creasing performance, there is a critical need to accurately es-timate the silicon-substrate (junction or die) thermal gradients and temperature profile for the development and thermal man-agement of future generations of all high-performance integrated circuits (ICs) including microprocessors. This paper presents an accurate chip-level leakage-aware method that self-consistently in-corporates various electrothermal couplings between chip <b>power,</b> <b>junction</b> temperature, operating frequency, and supply voltage for substrate thermal profile estimation and also employs a realistic package thermal model that comprehends different packaging layers and noncubic structure of the package, which are not accounted for in traditional analyses. The evaluation using the proposed methodology is efficient and shows excellent agreements with an industrial-quality computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) based commercial software. Furthermore, the methodology is shown to become increasingly effective with increase in leakage as technology scales. It is shown that considering electrothermal couplings and realistic package thermal model not only improves the accuracy of estimating the heat distribution across the chip but also has significant implications for precise power estimation and thermal management in nanometer-scale CMOS technologies.
