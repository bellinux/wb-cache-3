5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
5|$|All major {{characters}} in the miniseries were <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> five members of The Kids in the Hall, except for the mayor's son, who was played by young actor Landon Reynolds-Trudel.

For the second successive year, the Flyers failed to qualify for the playoffs. Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game. Suspension, further injuries, and a lack of form meant Hextall appeared 45times for the Flyers. He recorded 16wins during the season, resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL, 35.56%.|$|E

5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E

5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard Mandel, the passages <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, {{because it had}} been mixed with a middle-frequency range and compressed dynamics. Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E
