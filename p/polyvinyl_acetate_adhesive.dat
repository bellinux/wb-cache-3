Samples were taken from trees of Hyrcanian forests in Iran with nominal dimensions of 20  ×  20  ×  360  mm 3. Comparing the results of elastic properties of clear oak wood beams with scarf-jointed samples wood showed that scarf joints with the bonding angles of 70 ° and 75 °, covered by <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>adhesive,</b> did not demonstrate any significant effect on modules of elasticity. Scarf-jointed beams with smaller joint angles (60 ° and 65 °) were considerably weaker or totally unreliable in their moduli of elasticity.

For each species, twelve 30 x 225 x 300 mm(3) panels were manufactured using a panelling machine specifically designed for rotational wood-dowel welding with optimized parameters obtained from a previous study. Six edge-glued panels {{of the same size}} were manufactured from each species using a non-structural <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>adhesive</b> and tested for comparative purposes. The experimental programme included three-point bending at 255 -mm span and visual inspection of the panels to assess performance at standard moisture conditions and after an ageing cycle with variable relative humidity. Average breaking load of 1. 79 and 1. 70 kN was obtained at standard moisture conditions for welded panels of yellow birch and sugar maple, respectively. Fractures consistently occurred in the dowel's cross section, whereas no slippage was observed along the welded interface. Delamination between wood slats occurred after the ageing cycle, but did not affect the bending properties. Results confirm the suitability of wood-dowel welding for producing furniture panelling with Canadian hardwood species. Further research is needed to design panels with a more efficient position and use of welded dowels and with panel product properties that are comparable or superior to those of glued counterparts...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (PVAc) are the polymers of great interest because of many desirable characteristics. They {{can be used for}} many purposes. One of the major uses of these polymers is they can be used to produce adhesives for paper converting, packaging and laminating. The purpose of this work is to develop a suitable process for producing PVA based adhesives. In this work, both <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol <b>adhesives</b> were prepared. Adhesives were prepared by the polymerization and alcoholysis of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). Different performance tests were conducted after preparing these adhesives. In this study it was found that better quality adhesives can be prepared from polyvinyl alcohol. Different performance tests were conducted on the adhesives prepared. It was found from the performance tests that polyvinyl alcohol adhesive is the best adhesive {{that can be used for}} lamination. Drying time for polyvinyl alcohol was found 12. 9 minutes which was better than <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Moreover, pull-off test shows that maximum allowable pressure for PVA adhesive is higher than PVAc adhesives and the value is 195 psi...|$|R

These strategies have been used to investigate the molecular origins of some of the shortcomings of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> <b>adhesives,</b> and also to attempt to enhance the properties of these widely used adhesives. A model is presented to predict the incidence of particle formation, which was used to accurately predict that the polymerisation of vinyl acetate in the presence of large polystyrene seed particles would not be possible without the formation of secondary particles. Numerous attempts were made to reduce the incidence of secondary particle formation using the mechanistic basis of the model as a guide, without success. As a result, the inverse route to core-shell morphology was used to create the desired morphology. Microscopic characteristics that favoured the formation of particles containing one centrally located polystyrene core were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy techniques were developed to allow characterisation of the morphology produced in two-stage styrene-vinyl acetate polymerizations Latices having a range of morphologies, including the desired core-shell, were subjected to a range of physical tests to evaluate their performance as wood adhesives. The information gained from this testing was used to correlate performance between tests. The results have also been explained on the basis of microscopic structure...|$|R

2500|$|The high {{plasticization}} {{temperature of}} PET {{in the range}} of [...] is the reason why almost all common organic impurities such as PVC, PLA, polyolefin, chemical wood-pulp and paper fibers, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> melt <b>adhesive,</b> coloring agents, sugar, and protein residues are transformed into colored degradation products that, in their turn, might release in addition reactive degradation products. Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000µm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower.

40|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{manufacture}} of three-dimensional laminated veneer products (LVP) is damage due to stretching and/or buckling of the veneer. To reduce or eliminate this problem, veneer densification or adding a strengthening layer to the veneer can be an alternative. To study how veneer modification influences the veneer-to-adhesive bond strength, three methods of modification were studied in relation to an unmodified reference veneer: (1) densified veneer, (2) veneer pre-bonded with paper and hot melt adhesive (HMA), (3) veneer pre-bonded with non-woven polypropylene (NW) fabric glued to the veneer (a) with a urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive, (b) with a mixture of UF and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (PVAc) <b>adhesive,</b> and (c) with a PVAc adhesive. Densification, pre-bonding with paper, and NW with UF/PVAc adhesive mixture resulted in no or only a slight decrease in strength of the bond-line compared to the reference.

Results indicated that stress capacity in both corner joints was not significantly decreased with increasing polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) in wood. Despite the high compression strength in mitered joint, the induced compression stresses were low in comparison with butted joint. The stress capacity in mitered joint bonded with epoxy adhesive enhanced with increasing the level of furfurylation. This was true for shear stress parallel to grain as well. Generally, it could be concluded that mitered joint made of furfurylated members and bonded with epoxy adhesive would be stronger than other corner joints...|$|R

Thus, the bamboo stems were treated by immersion method with chemical product (solution of 1 % of active ingredients of copper chrome borate - CCB) and water by 15 days. Before treating the stems, the external and internal parts were removed to obtain the flat strips of bamboo with 4 mm of thickness, 45 cm of length and 5 cm of width. The "Cascophen RS" (resorcinol-formaldehyde) and "Cascorez-extra" (<b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> commercial <b>adhesives</b> were used to bond the flat strips.

30|$|Glued {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{are often}} used in joints for {{furniture}} such as chairs. However, such joints are not sufficiently resistant to withdrawal forces {{because of the difficulty}} of applying a clamping pressure to the surfaces being glued.

In this study, we discussed the applicability of the shrink-fit method used in green woodworking to strengthen glued round mortise and tenon joints. The test specimens were assembled using wet mortise members and air-dried tenon members with <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> resin emulsion <b>adhesive.</b> Withdrawal tests on joint specimens of four hardwood species were conducted to study the reinforcing effects of the shrink fit on the withdrawal performance of the mortise and tenon joints. The proposed shrink-fitted glued round mortise and tenon joint exhibited sufficient withdrawal strength equivalent to that of the joint glued with epoxy resin adhesive. After applying four humidity cycles to simulate seasonal variations in moisture content, withdrawal strength did not decrease significantly. The proposed joint could withstand the withdrawal force to some extent after adhesion was fractured by shear force.|$|R

Nanocomposites were prepared by compounding a <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> (PVAc) latex <b>adhesive</b> with increasing {{contents of the}} untreated RBP or the processed nanofibrils, and the resulting nanocomposites were analyzed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The presence of cellulose nanofibrils had a strong influence on the viscoelastic properties of PVAc latex films.

At any given concentration, the CM-MD-RBP cellulose nanofibrils showed superior reinforcing potential, especially in the glass transitions of PVAc and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), and in the rubbery plateau. The untreated RBP fibrils that were only mechanically disintegrated showed higher reinforcement effect than those that were only chemically modified.

The effects of various factors on the {{graft copolymerization}} were studied such as reaction time, reaction temperature, initiator concentration as well as match of mixed monomers. By single-factor tests, the optimum graft copolymerization conditions with higher grafting efficiency and grafting percent ratio correspond to the reaction time of 3 h, the graft polymerization reaction temperature of about 65 °C, the initiator concentration of 9. 7 × 10 - 3 mol/L, the mixed grafting monomers concentration of 1. 0 mol/L, the volume ratio of vinyl acetate to butyl acrylate of 5 : 5. The starch graft copolymer after purification was characterized, and its properties were determined. IR spectra of graft copolymers indicated that the carbonyl group characteristic absorption peak existed at 1730 ～ 1740 cm- 1 besides that of starch. The XRD pattern showed there were several dispersion peaks, therefore the graft copolymerization was the concomitant structure of a little crystalline state and amorphous state. TG and DTA curves confirmed the occurrence of graft copolymerization, and showed that the thermal stability of starch copolymer was better than that of pure corn starch.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the thesis were to investigate the adhesives influence on the mechanical properties in laminated multi-layer paperboard. The study also strived to find a method to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. This was investigated by constructing handsheets of laminated paperboard by gluing a bulky, CTMP center ply, Chromofoil, of two different grammages, 290 g/m 2 and 360 g/m 2, together with two outer plies of ordinary copy paper, Multi- Copy 80 g/m 2. The sheets were glued with two types of dispersion adhesives, a starch based <b>adhesive</b> and a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> based <b>adhesive.</b> Twelve types of test specimens were constructed and tested {{in a series of}} mechanical tests, which involved a tensile test, a two-point bending test and a Scott Bond test. The method called “digital image correlation” was used trying to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. The study also involved an evaluation of the possibility to predict the bending stiffness of laminated multi-layer paperboard by using calculations according to classic laminate theory. The results show that it is fully possible to use these calculated values as a prediction, with low risk of overestimating the bending stiffness of the paperboard and without involving the adhesive layer in the calculation. The method provided high absolute values in bending and tensile properties, which increased with increasing amount of glue applied. This came at the cost of grammage, which lead to low index values. The overall conclusion is that the effect from the adhesives is somewhat negative, since the mechanical properties would have been improved if the adhesive had been replaced with more fiber. The major source of errors during the experiments was the roughness of the manufacturing method. This lead to an uncertainty about whether the right amount of adhesive had been applied to the test specimens. Due to this the validity of the results could be questioned. Digital image correlation proved to be a rather sensitive method that requires a high accuracy setup and execution for it to be applicable in this type of study. The failure mode of the glue seam correlated well to the amount of glue applied. A lower amount of adhesive applied increases the likeliness of failure of the glue seam. ...|$|R
