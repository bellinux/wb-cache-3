50|$|Based in San Anselmo California, Sonic Studio, LLC {{continues}} to manufacture products {{that address the}} needs of the world’s most discriminating audio professionals with powerful PCM and DSD origination, editing and processing capabilities, and integrated <b>premastering</b> for both CD, SACD and rich media distribution. Sonic Studio’s NoNOISE noise and distortion reduction tools and streamlined workflow have allowed the product lines to remain at the forefront of restoration for DVD post-production and archival re-release.|$|E
5000|$|All CDs are pressed from {{a digital}} data source, {{with the most}} common sources being low error-rate CD-Rs or files from an {{attached}} computer hard drive containing the finished data (e. g., music or computer data). Some CD pressing systems can use digital master tapes, either in Digital Audio Tape, Exabyte or Umatic formats. However such sources are suitable only for production of audio CDs due to error detection and correction issues. If the source is not a CD, the table of contents for the CD to be pressed must also be prepared and stored on the tape or hard drive. In all cases except CD-R sources, the tape must be uploaded to a media mastering system to create the TOC (Table Of Contents) for the CD. Creative processing of the mixed audio recordings often occurs in conventional <b>premastering</b> sessions. The nickname often used for this is [...] "mastering," [...] but the official name, as explained in Bob Katz book, Mastering Audio, edition 1, page 18, is <b>premastering.</b> After all, there {{still has to be}} the creation of another disc which has the premastered audio but which supplies the surface on which the metal master will be electroformed. So, there still needs to be the grandmother disc before the master stamper can be formed atop.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{claims to}} the contrary, only Sonic Solutions’ “Sonic System” {{software}} was able to generate <b>PreMaster</b> CDs. PMCDs were subsequently obsoleted by the more modern and generalized DDP specification. Several factors led to {{the decline of the}} <b>PreMaster</b> CD standard. First, the CD-R mechanisms that were able to read and write the hidden cue sheet metadata went out of production in the late 1990s. Second, only Laser Beam Recorders or LBRs manufactured by Sony were able to read PMCDs, which limited the formats adoption by replicators.|$|R
5000|$|PMCD (<b>PreMaster</b> CD) is a {{specially}} formatted, recordable Compact Disc {{designed to be}} sent to a CD pressing plant for replication. The <b>PreMaster</b> CD format, developed in the early 1990s by the CD-ROM division of Sony, in cooperation with [...] "START Lab Inc." [...] of Tokyo and Sonic Solutions, contained a hidden “PreMaster Cue Sheet” that held the metadata needed for replication that a Red Book CD-DA lacks. The <b>PreMaster</b> CD format made use of the fact that not all data-recording surfaces are specified for use in the Red Book CD-DA or Yellow Book CD-ROM standards. CD transports were not able to recover the data hidden in the Cue Sheet unless forced to buy proprietary software. The Cue Sheet specified a broad range of metadata, including number of channels, per track pre-emphasis status, per track copy protection bit setting, per track ISRC Codes, per disc UPC/EAN, etc.|$|R

40|$|The {{workshop}} {{described in}} this document had two goals: (1) to establish guidelines for the CD-ROM {{as a tool to}} distribute datasets; and (2) to evaluate current scientific CD-ROM projects as an archive. Workshop attendees were urged to coordinate with European groups to develop CD-ROM, which is already available at low cost in the U. S., as a distribution medium for astronomical datasets. It was noted that NASA has made the CD Publisher at the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) available to the scientific community when the Publisher is not needed for NASA work. NSSDC's goal is to provide the Publisher's user with the hardware and software tools needed to design a user's dataset for distribution. This includes producing a master CD and copies. The prerequisite <b>premastering</b> process is described, as well as guidelines for CD-ROM construction. The production of discs was evaluated. CD-ROM projects, guidelines, and problems of the technology were discussed...|$|E

50|$|Under {{the auspices}} of Sonic Solutions, the Sonic Studio audio {{workstation}} has driven the professional production and delivery of commercial Compact Discs. The original “Sonic System” pioneered the desktop delivery of Red Book masters on recordable CD, {{in the same way}} that the original Macintosh and LaserWriter spawned the desktop publishing revolution. Prior to the introduction of the Sonic System, Compact Disc were assembled and <b>premastered</b> using bulky, expensive and unreliable U-matic videotape-based systems.|$|R

40|$|Information {{problem solving}} (IPS) {{is the process}} of locating, selecting, evaluating, and {{integrating}} information from various sources to fulfill an information need. In academia, it is central to conducting literature reviews in research projects. This paper presents a case study on effective and efficient instructional design for learning this complex skill. It includes an analysis of students’ output and (perceived) studiability of an online IPS-course that was designed according to the 4 C/ID-model, a contemporary holistic instructional design model. Results were based on data retrieved from 49 Open University <b>premaster</b> students. The results show that a holistic approach to instructional design is effective: all students passed the course and they appreciated course studiability. However, due to the holistic (‘whole task’) design approach, the students’ time on task was relatively high as was the time teachers spent on providing instructional support, which questions efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{read-only}} memory (ROM) disk with an AgOx mask layer was proposed and studied in this letter. The AgOx films sputtered on the <b>premastered</b> substrates, with pits depth of 50 nm and pits length of 380 nm, were studied by an atomic force microscopy. The transmittances of these AgOx films were also {{measured by a}} spectrophotometer. Disk measurement {{was carried out by}} a dynamic setup with a laser wavelength of 632. 8 nm and a lens numerical aperture (NA) of 0. 40. The readout resolution limit of this setup was λ/(4 NA) (400 nm). Results showed that the super-resolution readout happened only when the oxygen flow ratios were at suitable values for these disks. The best super-resolution performance was achieved at the oxygen flow ratio of 0. 5 with the smoothest film surface. The super-resolution readout mechanism of these ROM disks was analyzed as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an explorative study on perceived merits of contemporary holistic approaches to designing information literacy instruction in a university setting. Seven teachers in educational sciences evaluated their <b>premaster’s</b> course on conducting a literature review designed according to a modern design approach, named Four-Component Instructional Design (4 C/ID). They noted their perceptions on course quality {{by means of a}} standardized course evaluation questionnaire and a SWOT analysis. Results of the questionnaire showed that teachers were positive on whole-task information literacy instruction, confirming the {{results of an}} earlier study on 4 C/ID-caused instructional effects. The SWOT analysis indicated that teachers recognized the value of applied 4 C/ID principles like whole-task-centeredness, structured guidance, and scaffolding. We added suggestions on enhancing the positive effects of whole-task instructional design based on identified educational weaknesses such as relatively poor constructive alignment and threats such as imperfect curriculum coherence...|$|R
50|$|Windows XP {{includes}} {{technology from}} Roxio which {{allows users to}} directly burn files to a compact disc through Windows Explorer. Previously, end users had to install CD burning software. In Windows XP, CD and DVD-RAM (FAT32 only for DVD-RAM) burning has been directly integrated into the Windows interface. Data discs are created using the Joliet and ISO 9660 file systems and audio CDs using the Redbook standard. To prevent buffer underrun errors, Windows XP <b>premasters</b> a complete image of files to be burnt and then streams it to the disc burner. Users can burn files to a CD {{in the same way}} they write files to a floppy disk or to the hard drive via standard copy-paste or drag and drop methods. The burning functionality is also exposed as an API called the Image Mastering API. Windows XP's CD burning support does not do disk-to-disk copying or disk images, although the API can be used programmatically to do these tasks. Creation of audio CDs is integrated into Windows Media Player. Audio CDs are burnt using track-at-once mode. CD-RW discs can be quick erased.|$|R
5000|$|The disc is {{permanently}} {{housed in}} a cartridge (68×72×5 mm) with a sliding door, similar to the casing of a 3.5" [...] floppy disk. This shutter is opened automatically by a mechanism upon insertion. The audio discs can either be recordable (blank) or <b>premastered.</b> Recordable MiniDiscs use a magneto-optical system to record data. A laser heats {{one side of the}} disc to its Curie point, making the material in the disc susceptible to a magnetic field. A magnetic head {{on the other side of}} the disc alters the polarity of the heated area, recording the digital data onto the disk. Playback is accomplished with the laser alone: taking advantage of the Faraday effect; the player senses the polarisation of the reflected light and thus interprets a 1 or a 0. Recordable MDs can be recorded on repeatedly; Sony claims up to one million times. As of May 2005, there were 74 minute and 80 minute discs available. 60 minute blanks, which were widely available in the early years of the format's introduction, were phased out long before and are rarely seen.|$|R
40|$|Two novel {{read-only}} memory (ROM) disks, {{one with an}} AgOx mask layer {{and the other with}} an AgInSbTe mask layer, are proposed and studied. The AgOx and the AgInSbTe films sputtered on the <b>premastered</b> substrates with pit depths of 50 nm and pit lengths (space) of 380 nm are studied by atomic force microscopy. Disk readout measurement is carried out using a dynamic setup with a laser wavelength of 632. 8 nm and an object lens numerical aperture (NA) of 0. 40. Results show that the superresolution effect happens only at a suitable oxygen flow ratio for the AgOx ROM disk. The best superresolution readout effect is achieved at an oxygen flow ratio of 0. 5 with the smoothest film surface. Compared with the AgOx ROM disk, the AgInSbTe ROM disk has a much smoother film surface and better superresolution effect. A carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of above 40 dB can be obtained at an appropriate readout power and readout velocity. The readout CNR of both the AgOx and AgInSbTe ROM disks have a nonlinear dependence on the readout power. The superresolution readout mechanisms for these ROM disks are analyzed and compared as well.

5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, <b>premaster</b> mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing rings and centre clamps. This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|R
