5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. <b>Precisely</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E

The mines produced steam coal, and the factories and the railroads of the Northeast needed it, in vast amounts. The reality, however, was far less simple. The great need of the coal-transportation market attracted aggressive competitors, and the laissez-faire environment of the day encouraged tactics that included paper railroads, buying and selling of corporations {{as though they were}} used cars, and financial manipulation by syndicates of investors.|$|E

Romney's spokeswoman said he could not sign the pledge because it could have unforeseen deleterious consequences.

2500|$|However, {{neither the}} WHI nor the Million Women Study {{differentiated}} {{the results for}} different types of synthetic progesterones used. [...] Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) -- the type most commonly used in the United States—was the only one examined by the WHI, which in its analysis and conclusions extrapolated the benefits versus risks of MPA to all synthetic progesterones. [...] This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT for menopause. [...] In fact, primate research indicates that {{the side effects of}} MPA may be much worse than those of other synthetic progesterones, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. [...] Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> differences in effects are when other synthetic progesterones are used versus natural progesterone in HRT for menopause, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT for menopause.|$|E
2500|$|Priestley {{continued}} {{this series}} of arguments in The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777); the text was designed as an [...] "appendix" [...] to the Disquisitions and [...] "suggests that materialism and determinism are mutually supporting." [...] Priestley explicitly stated that humans had no free will: [...] "all things, past, present, and to come, are <b>precisely</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Author of nature really intended them to be, and has made provision for." [...] His notion of [...] "philosophical necessity," [...] which {{he was the first}} to claim was consonant with Christianity, at times resembles absolute determinism; it is based on his understanding of the natural world and theology: like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, but because a benevolent God has created these laws, Priestley argued, the world as a whole will eventually be perfected. He argued that the associations made in a person's mind were a necessary product of their lived experience because Hartley's theory of associationism was analogous to natural laws such as gravity. Priestley [...] contends that his necessarianism can be distinguished from fatalism and predestination because it relies on natural law. Isaac Kramnick points out the paradox of Priestley's positions: as a reformer, he argued that political change was essential to human happiness and urged his readers to participate, but he also claimed in works such as Philosophical Necessity that humans have no free will. Philosophical Necessity influenced the 19th-century utilitarians John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, who were drawn to its determinism. Immanuel Kant, entranced by Priestley's determinism but repelled by his reliance on observed reality, created a transcendental version of determinism that he claimed allowed liberty to the mind and soul.|$|E
