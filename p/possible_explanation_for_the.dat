5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E

However, there is currently not enough data to support this suggestion. Its origins might also result from other tectonic processes that are currently not understood.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, astronomers found {{unexpectedly}} {{high levels}} of infrared emissions from Titan. One possible explanation for this was the surface was warmer than expected, due to a greenhouse effect. Some estimates of the surface temperature even approached temperatures in the cooler regions of Earth. There was, however, another <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infrared emissions: Titan's surface was very cold, but the upper atmosphere was heated due to absorption of ultraviolet light by molecules such as ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the most}} common theory among {{scientists}} was still the concept of scala naturae, proposed by Aristotle. According to this theory, living beings were classified on an ideal pyramid that represented non-living things (such as minerals and sediment) and the simplest animals on the lower levels, with complexity increasing progressively towards the top, occupied by human beings. In the Western world of the time, people believed animal species were eternal and immutable, created with a specific purpose, as this seemed the only <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incredible variety of living beings and their surprising adaptation to their habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{first ever}} extra-solar auroras were {{discovered}} in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora {{was found to be}} a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material {{from the surface of the}} brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.|$|E
25|$|Chris McKay {{agreed with}} Strobel that {{presence}} of life, as suggested in McKay's 2005 article, is a <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> findings about hydrogen and acetylene, but also cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely {{the possibility that}} the results are due to human error, to a meteorological process, or to the presence of some mineral catalyst enabling hydrogen and acetylene to react chemically. He noted that such a catalyst, one effective at −178°C (95 K), is presently unknown and would in itself be a startling discovery, though less startling than discovery of an extraterrestrial life form.|$|E

25|$|The Forum did not, however, list this {{information}} for Afghanistan, Iraq, or Tunisia. It {{is probable that}} the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seeming discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for every woman {{between the ages of}} 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.|$|E
25|$|James Allen {{also offered}} a <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{use of the}} same throne name by 2 {{successive}} kings. He suggested that the almost constant references to Akhenaten, in particular the 'desired of Akhenaten' versions, may be proclamations of legitimacy {{on the part of}} Neferneferuaten. That is, the epithets are being used to announce or proclaim her as Akhenaten's chosen successor/coregent. One implication then, is there may have been resistance to the choice of Neferneferuaten or such resistance was anticipated. This appears to be supported by her funerary items being usurped to deny her a king's burial.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use. Placebo response rates in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to make accurate generalizations about reverse imagery, as this was something that varied by emperor, some trends do exist. An example is reverse types of the military emperors {{during the second half of}} the third century, where virtually all of the types were the common and standard personifications and deities. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lack of originality is that these emperors were attempting to present conservative images to establish their legitimacy, something that many of these emperors lacked. Although these emperors relied on traditional reverse types, their portraits often emphasized their authority through stern gazes, and even featured the bust of the emperor clad in armor.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{households}} that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle {{half of the}} income distribution tables provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3.9%, from 48.2% to 44.3%. During the same time period, the number of households with incomes below $25,000 decreased 3.5%, from 28.7% to 25.2%, {{while the number of}} households with incomes above $75,000 increased over 7%, from 23.2% to 30.4%. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> increase in the higher earnings categories is that more households now have two wage earners. However, a closer analysis reveals all of the 7% increase can be found in households who earn over $100,000.|$|E
25|$|A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mental {{symptoms}} of subclinical thyroid disease, {{might be found}} {{in the fact that the}} brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid. Also, hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to low-grade hyperthyroidism can result in an anxiety disorder before other Graves' disease symptoms emerge. E.g., panic disorder has been reported to precede Graves' hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs.|$|E
