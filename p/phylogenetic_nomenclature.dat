5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the spelling for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> that a more solid justification for assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladistic}} method (or cladism) {{has emerged}} since the 1960s. In 1958, Julian Huxley {{used the term}} clade. Later, in 1960, Cain and Harrison introduced the term cladistic. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree, ignoring ranks. A taxon is called monophyletic, if it includes all the descendants of an ancestral form. Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g. dinosaurs, with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic, while groups representing more than one branch from {{the tree of life}} are called polyphyletic. The International Code of <b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> or PhyloCode is intended to regulate the formal naming of clades. Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode, which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes.|$|E
5|$|With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia {{has been}} {{discarded}} {{as it is}} a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.|$|E
40|$|Revisionary {{taxonomy}} {{is frequently}} dismissed as merely descriptive, which belies its strong intellectual content and hypothesis-driven nature. Funding for taxonomy is inadequate and largely diverted to studies of phylogeny that neither improve classifications nor <b>nomenclature.</b> <b>Phylogenetic</b> classifications are optimal for storing and predicting information, but phylogeny divorced from taxonomy is ephemeral and erodes the accuracy and information {{content of the}} language of biology. Taxonomic revisions and monographs are efficient, high-throughput species hypothesis-testing devices that are ideal for the World Wide Web. Taxonomic knowledge remains essential to credible biological research and is made urgent by the biodiversity crisis. Theoretical and technological advances and threats of mass species extinctions indicate that this is the time for a renaissance in taxonomy. Clarity of vision and courage of purpose are needed from individual taxonomists and natural history museums to bring about this evolution of taxonomy into the information age...|$|R

500|$|The above {{scheme is}} the one most {{commonly}} encountered in non-specialist and general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they {{have given rise to}} successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes.

500|$|Under <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> dinosaurs {{are usually}} {{defined as the}} group {{consisting}} of Triceratops, Neornithes, their most recent common ancestor (MRCA), and all descendants. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined {{with respect to the}} MRCA of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon, because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: [...] "Dinosauria = Ornithischia + Saurischia", encompassing ankylosaurians (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), stegosaurians (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), ceratopsians (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), ornithopods (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including [...] "duck-bills"), theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and sauropodomorphs (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).|$|E
500|$|Basal sauropodomorph {{systematics}} {{continue to}} undergo revision, and many genera once considered classic [...] "prosauropods" [...] {{have recently been}} removed from the group in <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> on the grounds that their inclusion would not constitute a clade (a natural grouping containing all descendants of a single common ancestor). Yates and Kitching (2003) published a clade consisting of Riojasaurus, Plateosaurus, Coloradisaurus, Massospondylus, and Lufengosaurus. Galton and Upchurch (2004) included Ammosaurus, Anchisaurus, Azendohsaurus, Camelotia, Coloradisaurus, Euskelosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, Lessemsaurus, Lufengosaurus, Massospondylus, Melanorosaurus, Mussaurus, Plateosaurus, Riojasaurus, Ruehleia, Saturnalia, Sellosaurus, Thecodontosaurus, Yimenosaurus and Yunnanosaurus in a monophyletic Prosauropoda. Wilson (2005) considered Massospondylus, Jingshanosaurus, Plateosaurus, and Lufengosaurus a natural group, with Blikanasaurus and Antetonitrus possible sauropods. Bonnan and Yates (2007) considered Camelotia, Blikanasaurus and Melanorosaurus possible sauropods. Yates (2007) placed Antetonitrus, Melanorosaurus, and Blikanasaurus as basal sauropods and declined to use the term Prosauropoda, as he considered it synonymous with Plateosauridae. However, he did not {{rule out the possibility that}} a small group of prosauropods consisting of Plateosaurus, Riojasaurus, Massospondylus and their closest kin were monophyletic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systematic}} {{placement of}} groups within Labyrinthodontia is notoriously fickle. Several groups are identified, {{but there is}} no consensus of their phylogenetic relationship. Many key groups were small with moderately ossified skeletons, and there is a gap in the fossil record in the early Carboniferous (the [...] "Romer's gap") when most of the groups appear to have evolved. Further complicating the picture is the amphibian larval-adult life cycle, with physical changes throughout life complicating phylogenetic analysis. The Labyrinthodontia appear to be composed of several nested clades. The two best understood groups, the Ichthyostegalia and the reptile-like amphibians have from the outset been known to be paraphyletic. Tellingly, labyrinthodont systematics was the subject of the inaugural meeting of International Society for <b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>Nomenclature.</b>|$|E

50|$|The First International <b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> Meeting, {{which took}} place from July 6, 2004 to July 9, 2004 in Paris, France, was {{attended}} by about 70 systematic and evolutionary biologists from 11 nations.

It organizes periodic scientific meetings and is overseeing the completion and implementation of the PhyloCode. In the second meeting, rules concerning the choice of name for crown clades were discussed, along with rules to clarify the use of binomial species names in the context of <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and to enhance the information content of these names (regarding the monophyly or paraphyly of the genus name, considered a prenomen, {{in the context of the}} PhyloCode). It was also decided then to expand the CPN (Committee on <b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>Nomenclature)</b> from nine to twelve members. The third meeting convened at Dalhousie University in Halifax, from July 20 to 22. The editors of the Companion Volume presented a progress report, and a demonstration of the RegNum on-line registration database was given. Both of these are important to the society because they are required to implement the PhyloCode. Other discussions at the meeting covered the problem of hybrids in rank-based and <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> phyloinformatics, and teaching <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} classification, {{the order}} Pelycosauria is paraphyletic—that is, it is a grouping {{of animals that}} does not contain all descendants of a common ancestor, as is often required by a different system of naming organisms, <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> In traditional taxonomy, Therapsida was separated from Pelycosauria in its own biological order, and mammals were separated from both as their own class, though such usage has not been continued {{by a majority of}} scientists since the 1990s. In <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> [...] "Pelycosauria" [...] is not used, since it does not constitute a clade (a group of organisms descended from one common ancestor and including all the descendants of that ancestor), as the group excludes the therapsids. Instead, it represents a paraphyletic [...] "grade" [...] of basal synapsids leading up to the clade Therapsida. The following classification was presented by Benton in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|The two approaches, {{evolutionary}} taxonomy and the phylogenetic systematics {{derived from}} Willi Hennig, {{differ in the}} use of the word [...] "monophyletic". For evolutionary systematicists, [...] "monophyletic" [...] means only that a group is derived from a single common ancestor. In <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> there is an added caveat that the ancestral species and all descendants should be included in the group. The term [...] "holophyletic" [...] has been proposed for the latter meaning. As an example, amphibians are monophyletic under evolutionary taxonomy, since they have arisen from fishes only once. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, amphibians do not constitute a monophyletic group in that the amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) have evolved from an amphibian ancestor and yet are not considered amphibians. Such paraphyletic groups are rejected in <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> but are considered a signal of serial descent by evolutionary taxonomists.|$|E

These various names change as new discoveries are made and are discussed below.|$|E
50|$|Evolutionary {{taxonomy}} {{differs from}} strict pre-Darwinian Linnaean taxonomy (producing orderly lists only), {{in that it}} builds evolutionary trees. While in <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> each taxon must consist of a single ancestral node and all its descendants, evolutionary taxonomy allows for groups to be excluded from their parent taxa (e.g. dinosaurs are not considered to include birds, but to {{have given rise to}} them), thus permitting paraphyletic taxa.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Sherwood Romer {{rejected}} Säve-Söderbergh's {{theory of}} a biphyletic amphibia {{and used the}} name Anthracosauria to describe the labyrinthodont lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up Säve-Söderbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> use Anthracosauria.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, under <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> {{the content}} of taxa are delimited using a {{definition}} {{that is based on}} phylogeny (i.e., ancestry and descent) and uses specifiers (e.g., species, specimens, apomorphies) to indicate actual organisms. The formula of the definition indicates an ancestor. The defined taxon, then, is that ancestor and all of its descendants. Thus, {{the content of}} a phylogenetically defined taxon relies on a phylogenetic hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The order Apiales {{is placed}} within the asterid group of eudicots as {{circumscribed}} by the APG III system. Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an unranked {{group called the}} campanulids, and within the campanulids, it belongs to a clade known in <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> as Apiidae. In 2010, a subclade of Apiidae named Dipsapiidae was defined to consist of the three orders: Apiales, Paracryphiales, and Dipsacales.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> ties {{names to}} clades, groups {{consisting}} solely of an ancestor {{and all its}} descendants. All {{that is needed to}} specify a clade, therefore, is to designate the ancestor. There are a number of ways of doing this. Commonly, the ancestor is indicated by its relation to two or more specifiers (species, specimens, or traits) that are mentioned explicitly. The diagram shows three common ways of doing this.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Linnaean way {{of defining}} taxa {{is through the}} use of anatomical traits. When the actual phylogenetic relationship is unknown, well defined groups sometimes turn out to be defined by traits that are primitive rather than derived. In Linnaean systematics, evolutionary grades are accepted in higher taxonomic ranks, though generally avoided at family level and below. In <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>nomenclature</b> evolutionary grades (or any other form of paraphyly) are not accepted.|$|E
