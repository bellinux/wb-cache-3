One point of view is that <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all <b>pit</b> <b>bulls,</b> mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning <b>pit</b> <b>bulls.</b> Another point of view is that comprehensive [...] "dog bite" [...] legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet-keeping practices, is a better {{solution to the problem of}} dangerous <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> than BSL.|$|R

25|$|The {{breeding}} {{history of}} Pit Bulls {{makes it impossible}} to rule out a violent propensity for any one dog as gameness and aggressiveness can be hidden for years. Given the Pit Bull's genetical physical strengths and abilities, a <b>Pit</b> <b>Bull</b> always poses the possibility of danger; given the Pit Bull's breeding history as a fighting dog and the latency of its aggressiveness and gameness, the <b>Pit</b> <b>Bull</b> poses a danger distinct from other breeds of dogs which do not so uniformly share those traits.|$|E

25|$|In American Dog Owners Ass'n v. City of Yakima, 777 P.2d 1046 (Wash.1989, en banc), the Washington Supreme Court {{reviewed}} a <b>pit</b> <b>bull</b> ban in Yakima, Washington.

The trial court issued a temporary injunction {{against the city}} and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city.

40|$|Objective: Maiming {{and death}} due to dog bites are {{uncommon}} but preventable tragedies. We postulated that patients {{admitted to a}} level I trauma center with dog bites would have severe injuries and that the gravest injuries would be those caused by <b>pit</b> <b>bulls.</b> Design: We reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to our level I trauma center with dog bites during a 15 -year period. We determined the {{demographic characteristics of the}} patients, their outcomes, and the breed and characteristics of the dogs that caused the injuries. Results: Our Trauma and Emergency Surgery Services treated 228 patients with dog bite injuries; for 82 of those patients, the breed of dog involved was recorded (29 were injured by <b>pit</b> <b>bulls).</b> Compared with attacks by other breeds of dogs, attacks by <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> were associated with a higher median Injury Severity Scale score (4 vs. 1; P = 0. 002), a higher risk of an admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or lower (17. 2 % vs. 0 %; P = 0. 006), higher median hospital charges ($ 10, 500 vs. $ 7200; P = 0. 003), and a higher risk of death (10. 3 % vs. 0 %; P = 0. 041). Conclusions: Attacks by <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> are associated with higher morbidity rates, higher hospital charges, and a higher risk of death than are attacks by other breeds of dogs. Strict regulation of <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> may substantially reduce the US mortality rates related to dog bites...|$|R
