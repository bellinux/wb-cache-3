Those first five licenses were issued in alphabetical order --- a practice followed by other national organizations belonging to the FAI.|$|E

50|$|All current Bank of England {{banknotes}} {{are printed}} by contract with De La Rue at Debden, Essex. They include the <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England (Victoria Cleland for notes issued since September 2015). All the notes issued since Series C in 1960 also depict Elizabeth II in full view, facing left. A watermark, hidden, featuring the Queen facing right {{is shown in}} the left hand side of the £20 and £50, and the central window of the paper £5 and £10. The new polymer notes do not contain a watermark. More recent issues also include the EURion constellation. This is a pattern of yellow circles which stop copying of banknotes. They are easily identified by photocopiers.|$|E
50|$|The siege {{notes are}} printed on card stock using a lithographic process. The {{text of the}} notes is in Arabic, with {{different}} shapes (just above center and beneath the upper rectangle) representing the various denominations. The seal of the Governor-General appears in both English and Arabic on the higher denominations {{to the left and}} Gordon’s signature (either manuscript or hectographic) appears beneath his seal generally to the right on the higher denomination notes. Initially all notes were hand-signed by Gordon. As the issuance grew, notes with a hectographic signature were issued; however, merchants were reluctant to accept the <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> variety, so Gordon returned to signing each note. On the reverse of most notes is a stamp of an Italian lawyer (Tito Figari) based in Cairo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design and}} {{cover for the}} album {{were said to be}} {{inspired}} by [...] "Marilyn Monroe-esque 1950s fashion sense". The standard cover of the album features her and a group of her fans acting as paparazzi. According to Siti, the Hollywood retro album cover was chosen because it represents her 21 years of journey as an entertainer. She genuinely feels that her career has been supported by her fans, photographers, make-up artists, fashion designers, and journalists, and, [...] "It is appropriate for me to visually portray them through SimetriSitis album cover design." [...] The exclusive version of album, available only for pre-order on Lazada Malaysia, features a different cover, complete with <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> of hers.

2500|$|Confederate Treasury Notes were hand {{signed by}} various clerks, with {{exception}} of the 50 cent issues that had the <b>printed</b> <b>signatures</b> of Robert Tyler and Edward C. Elmore. [...] The first six notes issued were hand signed by the Register and Treasurer themselves. [...] While hand signatures were considered an anti-counterfeiting tool, {{the sheer number of}} bills being produced could not reasonably be signed individually by two men each. Women were often hired as clerks to sign [...] "for Register" [...] and [...] "for Treasurer"; up to 200 clerks were eventually hired for each.|$|R
5000|$|The first fully printed notes {{appeared}} in 1855 relieving the cashiers {{of the task}} of filling {{in the name of}} the payee and signing each note individually. The practice of writing the name of the Chief Cashier as the payee on notes was halted in favour of the anonymous “I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of …”, a feature that has remained unchanged on notes to this day. The <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> on the note continued to be that of one of three cashiers until 1870; since then it has always been that of the Chief Cashier. The Bank of England notes on its website that the promise holds [...] "for all time", even after notes have been withdrawn from circulation. This means that every Bank of England note can be exchanged for its face value at any time.|$|E
5000|$|The Restriction Period {{ended in}} 1821 as the Government had to anchor {{the value of}} the {{currency}} to gold in order to control sharply rising inflation and national debt. After a brief period to offset any sudden deflation, the UK returned to the gold standard on 1 May 1821. These notes could again be exchanged in full, or in part, for an equivalent amount of gold when presented at the bank. If redeemed in part, the banknote would be marked to indicate the amount that had been redeemed. From 1853 printed notes replaced handwritten notes, with the declaration [...] "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five pounds" [...] replacing the name of the payee. This declaration remains on Bank of England banknotes to this day. A <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> of one of three cashiers appeared on the printed notes, though this was replaced by the signature of the Chief Cashier from 1870 onward.|$|E
5000|$|The Bank of England's first post-World War I {{one pound}} notes were two-sided green notes which were printed - not handwritten. The {{name of the}} payee was {{replaced}} by the declaration [...] "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of one pound". This declaration remains on Bank of England banknotes to this day. This signature of the issuing cashier {{was replaced by the}} <b>printed</b> <b>signature</b> of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. In 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, one pound notes were issued in a new blue-orange colour scheme to deter counterfeiters, although the design remained the same. At the same time, metal thread running the paper was introduced as a security feature. After the war one pound notes were issued in their original green colour. The earliest post-World War II notes did not have the metallic thread security feature, but those issued from September 1948 onward did.|$|E
