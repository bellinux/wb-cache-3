5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in}} the skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E

[...] Baird and Jackie had only recently found out who Pedersen was, after being told by journalist Bill Smithies of the Liverpool Echo. [...] Baird was shocked that Pedersen did not look anything like the Stanley or the Lennon family, having <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and fair hair.|$|E

50|$|Louis Bayard (born November 30, 1963 in Albuquerque, New Mexico) is an American author. His {{historical}} mysteries include The <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Eye,</b> Mr. Timothy, The Black Tower, The School of Night and Roosevelt's Beast, {{and have}} been translated into 11 languages.|$|R
50|$|His novel, The <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Eye,</b> is {{a murder}} mystery set at West Point in 1830, where the young Edgar Allan Poe was a cadet. The book was {{nominated}} for an Edgar (2007) and a Dagger. It was optioned for a film adaptation by writer-director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart).|$|R
500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks in a loud voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|Mary was a {{precocious}} child. In July 1520, when scarcely {{four and}} a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the virginals (a type of harpsichord). A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives for advice and commissioned him to write De Institutione Feminae Christianae, a treatise on the education of girls. By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin. She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek. Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani, [...] "This girl never cries". Also, as the miniature portrait of her shows, Mary had, like both her parents, a very fair complexion, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and red or reddish-golden hair. She was also ruddy cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father.|$|E
2500|$|The off-white coat, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and rosy pink skin {{distinguish}} the coats of double-dilutes {{from those of}} true white horses. True white horses have unpigmented skin and hair due to the incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest during development.|$|E

50|$|The {{novel is}} one of the {{earliest}} to engage the historical Edgar Allan Poe as a protagonist in a detective novel. Poe is considered to be the inventor of the classic tropes of detective fiction with his character C. Auguste Dupin, so it is natural that writers would utilize him in their fictions, especially given the recent rise of the historical novel. Many other writers have done this, including Louis Bayard in The <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Eye</b> and true crime writer Harold Schechter in a series of novels.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2007, Reed {{performed}} the narration for {{a screening of}} Guy Maddin's silent film Brand upon the Brain!. In June 2007, he performed live at the Traffic Festival 2007 in Turin, Italy, a five-day free event organized by the city. [...] That same month saw the re-release of Reed's and The Underground's <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Eyes,</b> {{as part of the}} soundtrack of the French-language film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (imdb.com).|$|E
2500|$|True {{white hair}} {{is rooted in}} unpigmented skin that lacks melanocytes. In contrast, diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary due to the {{concentration}} or chemical structure of the pigments made by these pigment-producing cells, not {{the absence of the}} cells themselves. [...] There are at least five known types of pigment dilution in horses, three which, as described below, can act to produce off-white phenotypes. Horses with strongly diluted coat colors usually have <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> cream-colored coats, and rosy-pink skin. White markings are usually visible upon closer inspection.|$|E
2500|$|The Cream gene {{produces}} {{two types}} of diluted color. [...] Cremellos, perlinos, and smoky creams have rosy-pink skin, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and cream-colored coats that can appear almost white. These coat colors, collectively called [...] "double dilutes" [...] or [...] "blue-eyed creams", result when a horse is homozygous for the cream gene. When heterozygous, the cream gene is also responsible for palomino and buckskin. [...] A few Palominos have a very light hair coat is occasionally mistaken for either cremello or white. [...] White markings and patterns are visible against the slightly-pigmented coat and skin. The cream gene is not known {{to be associated with}} any health problems.|$|E
6000|$|He was an {{exceedingly}} tall and graceful personage, of that sangre azul which marked high Visigothic descent; golden-haired and fair-skinned, with hands as small and {{white as a}} woman's; his lips were delicate but thin, and compressed closely {{at the corners of}} the mouth; and his <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> had a glassy dulness. In spite of his beauty and his carriage, Amyas shrank from him instinctively; and yet he could not help holding out his hand in return, as the Spaniard, holding out his, said languidly, in most sweet and sonorous Spanish-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the blue nuthatch differs significantly from all other nuthatches. The three taxa of the species, nominate S. Azurra and two other subspecies, vary predominantly in the coloring of their mantles, chests and bellies. All are broadly black and white – especially when viewed in low light conditions in which their dark blue coloring is not apparent – but their upper plumage is shot through with dramatic notes of cobalt, azure and other lighter shades of blue, as well as grays and purples. The head is black, or blackish-blue with a broad, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> ring.|$|R
60|$|Kotick, Matkah's baby, {{was born}} {{in the middle of that}} confusion, and he was all head and shoulders, with <b>pale,</b> watery <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> as tiny seals must be, but there was {{something}} about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely.|$|R
2500|$|Cream coat {{colors are}} {{described}} by {{their relationship to}} the three [...] "base" [...] coat colors: chestnut, bay, and black. [...] All horses obtain two copies of the MATP gene; one from the sire, and one from the dam. [...] A horse may have the cream allele or the non-cream allele on each gene. Those with two non-cream alleles will not exhibit true cream traits. [...] Horses with [...] one cream allele and one non-cream allele, popularly [...] called [...] "single dilutes," [...] exhibit specific traits: all red pigment in the coat is gold, while the black pigment is either unaffected or only subtly affected. These horses are usually palomino, buckskin, or smoky black. These horses often have light brown eyes. Horses with 2 copies of the cream allele also exhibit specific traits: cream-colored coats, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and rosy-pink skin. These horses are usually called cremello, perlino, or smoky cream.|$|E

60|$|It is {{impossible}} to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had {{the eye of a}} vulture--a <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye,</b> with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.|$|R

60|$|The sunbonnet slowly {{swung around}} again {{and stared at}} the ring. Then the little red right hand reached forward, took the ring, placed it on the {{forefinger}} of the left hand, with all the other fingers widely extended for the sunbonnet to view, and all the while the pan was still held against her side by the other hand. Fleming noticed that the hands, though tawny and not over clean, were almost childlike in size, and that the forefinger was much too small for the ring. He tried to fathom the depths of the sun-bonnet, but it was dented on one side, and he could discern only a single <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> and a thin black arch of eyebrow.|$|R
