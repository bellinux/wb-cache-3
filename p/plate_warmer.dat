II. RAYLEIGH-B ' ENARD CONVECTION Thermal convection is to pattern formation what the hydrogen atom is to quantum mechanics: the paradigm case. First studied experimentally by B'enard {{at the turn of}} the century [5], it was analysed by Lord Rayleigh [6] in 1916. He considered the stability of a fluid confined between two infinite, flat, horizontal plates separated by a distance d. The plates have uniform temperatures T 1 and T 2. The difference = T 2 Γ T 1 is maintained between them, with the lower <b>plate</b> <b>warmer.</b> Lord Rayleigh showed that the motionless fluid is unstable to overturning convection when a certain dimensionless number R, now called the Rayleigh number, exceeds a critical value R c, where R...|$|E

40|$|Like {{psychomotor}} stimulants, a weak amphetamine-like agent, such as phenylpropanolamine, {{enhances the}} analgesic effects of morphine (MOR). Thus, {{it is possible}} that full psychomotor stimulant potency is not required to increase the analgesic action of opiates. The validity of this assumption is here tested by studying the ability of (-) -norpseudoephedrine (NPE), an enantiomer of phenylpropanolamine and a metabolite of cathinone, to influence both the analgesic effects of MOR and its discriminative stimulus properties. In mice NPE (5. 6 - 10. 0 - 17. 0 mg/kg i. p.) did not prolong the latency to lick or to remove paws from a <b>plate</b> <b>warmed</b> at 54 degrees C. However, it significantly potentiated the analgesic effect of 3. 2 mg/kg of MOR. These results were replicated in rats by use of the formalin test, which measures the numbers of hind paw flinches produced by injecting 50 microl of formalin into the dorsal surface of the paw. The higher dose of NPE (17 mg/kg) increased the effect of sub-analgesic doses of MOR (0. 56 and 1. 0 mg/kg). In rats trained to discriminate between 0. 5 mg/kg of amphetamine and solvent in a two-lever operant behavior reinforced by water access. NPE induced a dose-dependent increment of drug lever responding from 0 % at 1. 0 mg/kg to 100 % at 32. 0 mg/kg. In contrast, NPE did not generalize for the MOR cue up to the dose of 56. 0 mg/kg, which produced a substantial reduction of the response rate. However, when given in combination, NPE attenuated the discriminative effects of MOR and potentiated its inhibitory action on the response rate. These results exclude a direct action of NPE on the mu opiate system. In conclusion, NPE preserves amphetamine-like properties and these properties are probably responsible for the interaction of the drug with the analgesic and discriminative effects of MOR. Therefore, this study contradicts the assumption that the analgesic effects of MOR can be enhanced by a sympathomimetic drug that lacks significant psychostimulant actions...|$|R

Gravity modeling of profiles indicates that the Pacific plate is flexed downward adjacent to the Queen Charlotte Fault.

40|$|Experiences {{early in}} life {{strongly}} shape values, attitudes and behaviour and serve as reference points ever after. Those {{who grew up in}} a society where resources are scarce may behave differently in an affluent society than those who got used to affluence even as children. This hypothesis was tested among 600 households in a major Swedish city who responded to questions about energy related behaviour and environmental attitudes. The households belonged to different generations, or age groups, lived in flats or detached houses and the questions were about energy use in their dwellings. On fourth of the total energy in Sweden is delivered to households for heating and appliances. Household electricity use is increasing. The results show that there are no differences in environmental attitudes between generations. Generally, the concern with climate change is high and both young and old think it is important to conserve energy. However, energy related behaviour differed between age groups. The young people preferred higher temperatures indoors than the old ones, they liked showering better than bathing, they often used electric kettles for heating water because it was faster than other alternatives and they seldom rinsed the <b>plates</b> in <b>warm</b> water before putting them in the dish washer. The old people bathed more often than the young ones, their refrigerators and freezers were older but they valued energy efficiency higher. The old people showed more acceptances for lowering indoor temperature, they put lids on cooking pots more often and they more often aired clothes instead of washing them. All these behaviours impact electricity use and the demand for space heating and hot water. Some behaviour common among the young generation are favourable for energy efficiency, others are not. Scenarios of energy futures should take such differences in behaviour between generations into account. They should also be considered in policymaking, when planning information campaigns and when designing other policy instruments...|$|R

Recently it was successfully used for in vivo recordings from individual spinal cord neurons in zebrafish larvae (Brustein et al., 2003). The staining technique can be also applied in brain slices of any developmental stage, from embryonic to adult. Materials 1.

The water intake volume, oxygen consumption volume, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity were determined during the investigation. ResultsWhen Fuzi and Ganjiang were administered together, the rate at which mice remained on a <b>warm</b> <b>plate</b> (“remaining rate”) and the times and distances of their movement were all significantly reduced (P< 0. 05). Compared with the Normal group, the reduction was 55. 1 %, 48. 3 % and 44. 8 %, while compared with the Fuzi group, the reduction was 57. 6 %, 34. 3 % and 36. 0 %, indicating that “cold” tropism was significantly increased. Compared with the Normal and Fuzi groups, the ATPase activity and the respiratory oxygen consumption volume of the Fuzi + Ganjiang group were significantly increased (P< 0. 05), suggesting an improvement in energy metabolism and showing a “hot” characteristic when Fuzi and Ganjiang are present together. Additionally, the T-AOC and T-SOD activity were significantly enhanced (P< 0. 05). ConclusionThe behavior of mice tending toward “cold” tropism can be regarded as a quantitative reflection of Fuzi having fewer characteristics consistent w ith a “hot” nature when not used with Ganjiang, the functional mechanism of which may be a change in the ATPase activity in liver tissue...|$|R
