In contrast to New York, Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid-19th century, growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830, to a city of 30,000 in 1850 and nearly 300,000 by 1870.

Ladin comes from Latin (like Italian, French and Spanish) and resembles Romansh which is spoken in Switzerland. Maintaining the local language, that is not only spoken by the older people but also by many of Cortina's younger inhabitants, has become a symbol of their attachment to the local mountainous heritage. The community is also <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Ladin or Tyrolean culture, that continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages, in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{history of}} Object-Oriented Programming can be {{interpreted}} as a continuing quest to capture the notion of abstraction – to create computational artifacts that represent the essential nature of a situation, and to ignore irrelevant details. Objects are defined by their essential behavior, not by their physical representation as data. The basic Object-Oriented paradigm of organizing programs as active objects and message passing has now been accepted by the mainstream, for which ECOOP can be justifiably proud. Future developments in the field will focus on capturing computational ideas that can't be expressed well simply by functional abstraction. Programming will evolve from textual programming languages to using natural language, graphics, demonstrated actions, and other techniques. 1 The revolution is dead. Long live the revolution! ECOOP has plenty to be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> in <b>its</b> 20 -year history of promoting Object-Oriented Programming. Object-Oriented Programming is a revolution, that, largely, we’ve won.
