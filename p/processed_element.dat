40|$|Abstract — Petri nets are a {{suitable}} language for modeling business processes with complex flow structures. Processes {{with a number}} of alternative, concurrent or sequential flow structures on the same process abstraction level may result in complex processes. Such complex and poorly unstructured processes are particularly difficult for users to understand. Process decomposition can significantly improve the comprehensibility and consistency of process models and enables faster reuse of process models. To maintain homogenous process decomposition demands a significant amount of modeling experience. In this paper, we will present our approach for (semi-) automatic detection of nonuniformly specified <b>process</b> <b>element</b> names on the same process decomposition level. Our detection system validates <b>process</b> <b>element</b> names regarding reasonable hierarchical specifications. The aim of our approach is to (semi-) automatically highlight nonuniformly specified <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> in order to improve process model consistency. The approach is based upon an OWL-based description of Petri nets. I...|$|R

In exploring the currently overlooked ontology-related interactions between the analysis and design phases of software development for MAS, iterative verification during the design and development of the system becomes also possible. A validation approach to complement this ontology-based view was recently developed in [20] to precisely use ontologies during the creation of the MAS requirement models. With respect to improving the process of creating intermediate software work products, using an ontology-based development methodology is impossible without the appropriate <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> that can harness domain knowledge within ontologies. In other words, the presence of problem solving methods is couple with partial usage of any ontology for any single agent. Thus, <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> are required to identify the “bits” within an ontology that are required at any single time. That is why the next section focuses on identifying the <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> required to create an ontology-driven methodology.|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{simulation}} models {{have the potential}} to provide a cost-effective, objective, and flexible approach to assessing design and management alternatives, particularly when these alternatives involve the emerging technologies of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, in order for this potential to be realized, models must be valid for the application and must provide results that are credible and reliable. The process of ensuring validity, credibility, and reliability typically consists of three elements- verification, validation and calibration. In current traffic engineering practice, there appears to be little uniformity in the definition of each of these three <b>process</b> <b>elements.</b> It also appears that there exists a lack of consensus among both model developers and model users regarding the actions required to carry out each <b>process</b> <b>element</b> and the division of responsibilities between the two groups. This paper attempts to provide traffic model developers and users with a framework for the verification, validation and calibration of traffic models.

40|$|Incremental and {{component}} based {{development are}} considered well-suited as means to improve software quality {{and to reduce}} development time and costs. Introducing such processes is considered a Software Process Improvement (SPI) activity. However, the introduction is complex since it implies a radical {{change in the way}} employees perform their work tasks. Careful planning is therefore crucial to ensure a successful introduction. This thesis proposes a methodology for the planning phase of SPI projects where the goal is to introduce an incremental development process in an organization. The method gathers information about the employees competence and uses this information in combination with explorative statistical techniques to identify the <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> of greatest potential benefit (e. g., incremental testing) for the introduction. Thus, the method is part of the SPI planning activities at the organization level. Once a <b>process</b> <b>element</b> has been identified, it should be evaluated at the project level (as an SPI pilot project) before it ultimately is implemented in the whole organization. The proposed method thus seeks to identify and introduce <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> in an incremental fashion; those <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> of greatest potential benefits should be introduced and evaluated first. The method was developed and used in conjunction with a SPI project in a Norwegian organization. This thesis also evaluates a component based development pilot project within the same organization and identifies lessons learned and success factors. They may be useful in the next cycle of the planning phase to further improve component based development within the organization. In addition, the success factors may be useful during the project level SPI planning phase for other organizations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large process models may {{comprise}} {{hundreds or}} thousands of <b>process</b> <b>elements,</b> like activities, gateways, and data objects. Present-ing such process models to users and enabling them to interact with these models constitute crucial tasks of any process-aware information systems (PAISs). Existing PAISs, however, neither provide adequate techniques for visualizing and abstracting process models nor for interacting with them. In particular, PAISs do not provide tailored process visualizations as needed in complex application environments. This paper presents ex-amples of large process models and discusses some of the challenges to be tackled when visualizing and abstracting respective models. Further, it presents a comprehensive framework that allows for personalized process model visualizations, which can be tailored to the specific needs of the different user groups. First, process model complexity can be reduced by abstracting the models, i. e., by eliminating or aggregating <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> not relevant in the given visualization context. Second, the appearance of <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> can be customized independent of the process modeling language used. Third, different visualization formats (e. g., process diagrams, process forms, and process trees) are supported. Finally, it will be discussed how tailored visualizations of process models may serve as basis for changing and evolving process models at a high level of abstraction. ...|$|R
40|$|The Responsive Space {{initiative}} {{has several}} implications for flight software {{that need to}} be addressed not only within the run-time element, but the development infrastructure and software life-cycle <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> as well. The runtime element must at a minimum support Plug & Play, while the development and <b>process</b> <b>elements</b> need to incorporate methods to quickly generate the needed documentation, code, tests, and all of the artifacts required of flight quality software. Very rapid response times go even further, and imply little or no new software development, requiring instead, using only predeveloped and certified software modules that can be integrated and tested through automated methods. These elements have typically been addressed individually with significant benefits, but it is when they are combined that they can have the greatest impact to Responsive Space.
