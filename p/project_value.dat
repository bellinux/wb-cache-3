500|$|A bypass of Clackline {{was also}} constructed, {{realigning}} [...] of Great Eastern Highway [...] {{north of the}} town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert, allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11million. The final <b>project</b> <b>value</b> was $9.2million. Issues and challenges in the project's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{the above}} four methods cannot provide the {{confidence}} levels (or probabilities) of different results. For the investors, {{they hope to}} fully recognize the impacts of all risk factors on the <b>project</b> <b>values.</b> If they overlook the impacts of risk factors, they may bias the <b>project</b> <b>values,</b> and lower the decision’s reliability (Mohamed and McCowan 2001). Therefore, the confidence levels are very important for investors because if investors are not sure whether they can obtain enough profits, they may choose to give up. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} apply an appropriate method for risk measurement of international OG projects, which can link the probabilities with all the possible results. A probabilistic model, which simulates the risk factors to obtain all possible results, is a suitable method because it can comprehensively evaluate the impacts of risk factors on the <b>project</b> <b>values,</b> and it can also link the probabilities with all the possible results (Hu and Shen 2001; Yan et al. 1999). Therefore, a probabilistic model is applied in this paper to measure the risks of international OG projects.|$|R
