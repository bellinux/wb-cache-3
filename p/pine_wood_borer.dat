40|$|The blue <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> <b>borer</b> (Phaenops cyanea) and {{the black}} pine sawyer beetle (Monochamus galloprovincialis) (Fig. 1) both are pests of the white pine (Pinus silvestris) and other Pinus species. Both insects have nearly the same demands {{regarding}} their breeding site. Larval development requires a fresh, unwilted inner bark. An infestation occurs on freshly cut trees or on trees suffering from stress (e. g. after dry seasons, loss of needles caused by feeding caterpillars or damage by forest fires). Phaenops cyanea detects susceptible pines by their volatile emissions (SCHÜTZ et al. 2004) {{and is able to}} infest the trees already at a low stress level. During feeding the larvae avoid the resin ducts of the tree and thus evade the oleoresin defence. The beetle is endemic in Europe and – under favourable climatic conditions – can cause substantial damage to pine forests. It is the most significant bark-breeding beetle of white pine in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany. Monochamus galloprovincialis is found in Europe and northern Africa. The larvae tend to a more copious feeding which makes them more susceptible to the oleoresin defence of the tree. Thus, M. galloprovincialis prefers trees that are weakened by a higher degree of stress. The economic damage caused by feeding of thebeetle is low. However, the beetle has gained a special attention of forest scientists because of its association with the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus which is causing the pine wilt disease (PWD) in Pinus. The only outbreak of the PWD within Europe is limited to an area of 258. 000 ha in Portugal. (MOTA et al. 1999). Die Forstschädlinge Phaenops cyanea (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) und Monochamus galloprovincialis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) befallen beide Kiefern (Pinus sylvestris), die geschwächt sind, z. B. durch Wasser-Stress. Die Larven von P. cyanea entwickeln sich in oder unter der Rinde, während Larven von M. galloprovincialis nach einem Fraß im Kambium des befallenen Baumes auch tief in das Holz eindringen. P. cyanea befällt bereits Bäume, die nur einem geringen Stress ausgesetzt waren, während M. galloprovincialis Bäume bevorzugt, die erheblich geschwächt oder bereits tot sind. Die vorliegende Studie soll anhand elektrophysiologischer Experimente untersuchen, welchen olfaktorischen Hinweisen die beiden Insekten bei ihrer Suche nach einem geeigneten Eiablageplatz folgen. Duftstoffe von Pinus sylvestris wurden auf Aktivkohle gesammelt und mit Gaschromatographie, Massenspektroskopie und Elektroantennographie untersucht (GC-MS/ EAD). Die stärksten Signale von P. cyanea traten im Retentionsindex-Bereich von 936 (&# 945;-Pinen) bis 1200 auf, wobei insbesondere bizyklische Terpene und Terpenoide wie &# 945;-Pinen, &# 946;-Pinen, 1, 8 -Cineol und trans- Verbenol detektiert wurden. M. galloprovincialis reagierte auf einen weiteren Bereich von Stoffen, ebenfalls beginnend mit &# 945;-Pinen, bis hin zu Stoffen mit einem Retentionsindex von ca. 1300. Es scheint eine spezifische Empfindlichkeit für monozyklische und azyklische Terpene und Terpenoide vorzuliegen, insbesondere für &# 947;-Terpinen, Terpinolen, &# 946;-Myrcen und p-Cymen...|$|E

40|$|Non-indigenous {{marine species}} {{are a major}} concern worldwide. For some species, {{insufficient}} historical and biogeographical data can leave their origin and patterns of dispersal difficult to determine. Among such species are marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers.</b> This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining both historical and biological methods, to address marine borer impacts, management attempts, and their status in New Zealand. This research had two key components. Firstly, a historical review sought to improve the understanding and awareness of the historic impacts and responses to borers, with particular reference to New Zealand between 1850 and 1930. Marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> have had profound impacts throughout history, responsible for significant structural and economic damage to wooden ships and marine infrastructure globally. In New Zealand, trade and economy {{played an important role}} in providing both the transportation vectors and infrastructure for marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> to inhabit. Ongoing trialling of timber alternatives and chemicals for the preservation of infrastructure followed, with little success until the introduction of ferro-concrete in the early 1900 s. When considered in a global context, the New Zealand case study of borer impacts and management attempts highlights their significant role in environmental history. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequence analyses were used to examine the questionable invasion histories and status of common marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> in New Zealand. It has been assumed that many marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> invaded New Zealand via wooden ships. However, these purported introductions are historic, and the specific origins of many species are unclear. Species from three families and two phyla were collected around the North Island, New Zealand; Teredinidae (Bivalvia: Mollusca), Sphaeromatidae and Limnoriidae (Isopoda: Arthropoda). Low levels of genetic divergence (0 - 2 %) were found among the New Zealand populations of two species, Limnoria quadripunctata and Sphaeroma quoianum, suggesting a non-indigenous status. Limnoria quadripunctata also showed a close genetic affinity to populations in Chile, supporting a non-indigenous status, with its widespread distribution in New Zealand explained by multiple introductions. For Lyrodus pedicellatus, a lack of genetic affinity to conspecifics sequenced elsewhere (France), greater genetic diversity compared to the native Bankia australis, and evidence of population structuring among New Zealand locations, suggested L. pedicellatus may be native to New Zealand. Lyrodus pedicellatus from New Zealand was highly divergent (> 20 %) from global L. pedicellatus populations, suggesting that either identifications of specimens on global databases are incorrect, or the New Zealand species represents a morphologically undescribed cryptic congener. In conclusion, COI sequences provided a useful tool in elucidating the status of marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> in New Zealand, and highlighted a need for taxonomic resolution of some species. Collectively the two chapters illustrate the knowledge gaps and lack of recognition surrounding marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers,</b> globally and in New Zealand. This research provides an extensive understanding of their significant historical role in marine environmental history and assists in re-evaluation of their current native or non-indigenous status in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Identification and {{analysis}} of microRNAs involved in {{the response to the}} pine wilt disease Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a dramatic disease affecting conifers across the world. This pest is caused by the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus which is vectored to trees by a <b>wood</b> <b>borer</b> insect, the <b>pine</b> sawyer beetle (Monochamus spp.). Once PWN reaches a healthy pine it systemically colonizes the vascular system causing the occlusion of vessels. Trees unable to curb B. xylophilus infection wilt and die. PWD is now a severe environmental problem in Iberian Peninsula where it is causing strong economic and ecologic impact. The study of PWD pathosystem has gained great interest especially with regard to the molecular response involved in adaptation capacity of pine species to face nematode infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small RNAs regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level during growth and development, and in response to abiotic stress and pathogens. These non-coding RNAs range in size from 20 to 24 nucleotides and negatively regulate gene expression by degrading target mRNAs or inhibiting their translation, playing a role in biotic and abiotic stress responses [1]. Several miRNAs have been described in response to different pathogens including nematodes [2]...|$|R
