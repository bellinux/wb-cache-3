5|$|Cadet George Washington Street was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported black and light blue striped jerseys and caps, with white <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> blue socks. The Naval Academy wore maroon socks, caps, and belts, with white <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> jerseys. Both teams also nailed strips of leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your <b>Pants</b> <b>and</b> Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan is a {{business}} partner of Drake's. He was meant to act, {{not only as a}} partner, but as a mentor to the main character, and to provide insight into his criminal activities. In all games, Sullivan wears a bowling-style shirt, dockers <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> chews on a cigar wherever he goes. He is constantly in enormous debt, but is likable enough to pull people into investing in his ventures.|$|E
5|$|Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula {{spent time}} there before filming began {{to learn how}} Miamians dressed and gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the most {{interesting}} parts of his styling were the matching scarves, which resembled extended shirt collars. Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E

5|$|From about 1970, Hubbard was {{attended}} aboard ship {{by the children}} of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to {{other members of the}} crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959. The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors, though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.|$|E
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E

5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> a blue jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger {{on his left}} shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} the album with producers Michael Angelo, Focus..., and Jake and the Phatman, among others. He {{also worked with}} singer-songwriter Joi, former Tony! Toni! Toné! member D'wayne Wiggins, singer-songwriter Teedra Moses, singer Dawn Robinson, formerly of Saadiq's other group Lucy Pearl, singer-songwriter Babyface, and rapper Allie Baba, Saadiq's nephew. The album's title is a reference to his mother's nickname for him, also a childhood name. Its cover artwork {{was inspired by the}} blaxploitation films of the 1970s. It shows Saadiq dressed in a vintage cornflower blue suit, knicker <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> lime green argyle socks, while leaning on a white 1967 Mercury Cougar.|$|E

60|$|So he ran on {{like one}} in a nightmare. His feet grew heavy like lead, he <b>panted</b> <b>and</b> gasped, his breath came hot and dry in his throat.

The album charted at number three, below fellow new album In the Zone by Britney Spears (number one) and above remix album Let It Be... Naked by The Beatles (number five). Blink-182 charted highest in Canada, where it debuted at number one. The album was also {{successful}} in other countries, debuting in the top ten in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your <b>Pants</b> <b>and</b> Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob wishes he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several attempts to do so, but all of these fail.

5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange <b>pants,</b> <b>and</b> black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi <b>pants</b> <b>and</b> a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E
