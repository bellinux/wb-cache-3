40|$|Where does poetry end and <b>prose</b> begin? What is a <b>prose</b> poem? What aesthetic, {{ideological and}} {{marketing}} purposes are fulfilled when we call things by certain names? Is {{the very act}} of calling a piece of <b>prose</b> a ‘poem’ enough to make a <b>prose</b> poem or have <b>prose</b> poets in fact developed certain compositional strategies meant to erase accepted distinctions between literary genres and expand the range of formal possibilities of poetry?

This paper addresses some of the above questions with reference to the state and status of the <b>prose</b> poem in Australia.

Because of their small size, short <b>prose</b> pieces can attain high levels of lexical density and may thereby resemble <b>prose</b> poems, but the focus in short <b>prose</b> is less on language itself (and thus on rhythm, metre, or other phonological effects) than on the rapid presentation of a situation.|$|R

The method used in this paper is comparative-statistical analysis. The rhythm of classic <b>prose</b> was based on the quantity of syllables, while the medieval Latin <b>prose</b> rhythm was based on word stress and called cursus. Although the use of cursus was more popular in Latin <b>prose,</b> it can also be found elsewhere, including Italian <b>prose.</b> The analysis reveals that rhythmical sentences endings have a role in Dante’s <b>prose</b> and that the cursus appear in his Latin works, as well as in his works in vernacular...|$|R

In fact, they promise, if we look well into them, That here is probably a practical faculty and intellect of the highest kind; which again, on the speculative, especially on the poetical side, will never be considerable, nor has even tried to be so. This young soul does not deal in meditation at all, and his tendencies are the reverse of sentimental. Here is no introspection, morbid or other, no pathos or complaint, no melodious informing of the public what dreadful emotions you labor under: here, in rapid prompt form, indicating that it is truth and not fable, are generous aspirations for the world and yourself, generous pride, disdain of the ignoble, of the dark, mendacious;--here, in short, is a swift-handed, valiant, STEEL-bright kind of soul; very likely for a King's, if other things answer, and not likely for a Poet's. No doubt he could have made something of Literature too; could have written Books, and left some stamp of a veracious, more or less victorious intellect, in that strange province too.

6000|$|They {{then began}} to talk in the homely style of middle-aged ladies, and Mrs. Veal <b>proses</b> {{concerning}} the conversations they had formerly held, and the books they had read together. Her very recent experience probably led Mrs. Veal to talk of death, and the books written on the subject, and she pronounced, ex cathedrâ, as a dead person was best entitled to do, that [...] "Drelincourt's book on Death was the best {{book on the subject}} ever written." [...] She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, two Dutch books which had been translated, and several others; but Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death and the future state of any who had handled that subject. She then asked for the work [we marvel the edition and impress had not been mentioned,] and lectured on it with great eloquence and affection. Dr. Kenrick's Ascetick was also mentioned with approbation by this critical spectre, [the Doctor's work was no doubt a tenant of the shelf in some favourite publisher's shop]; and Mr. Norris's Poem on Friendship, a work, which I doubt, though honoured with a ghost's approbation, we may now seek for as vainly as Correlli tormented his memory to recover the sonata which the devil played to him in a dream. Presently after, from former habits we may suppose, the guest desires a cup of tea; but, bethinking herself of her new character, escapes from her own proposal by recollecting that Mr. Bargrave was in the habit of breaking his wife's china. It would have been indeed strangely out of character if the spirit had lunched, or breakfasted upon tea and toast. Such a consummation would have sounded as ridiculous as if the statue of the commander in Don Juan had not only accepted of the invitation of the libertine to supper, but had also committed a beef-steak to his flinty jaws and stomach of adamant. A little more conversation ensued of a less serious nature, and tending to show that even the passage from life to death leaves the female anxiety about person and dress somewhat alive. The ghost asked Mrs. Bargrave whether she did not think her very much altered, and Mrs. Bargrave of course complimented her on her good looks. Mrs. Bargrave also admired the gown which Mrs. Veal wore, and as a mark of her perfectly restored confidence, the spirit let her into the important secret, that it was a scoured silk, and lately made up. She informed her also of another secret, namely, that one Mr. Bretton had allowed her ten pounds a year; and, lastly, she requested that Mrs. Bargrave would write to her brother, and tell him how to distribute her mourning rings, and mentioned there was a purse of gold in her cabinet. She expressed some wish to see Mrs. Bargrave's daughter; but when that good lady went to the next door to seek her, she found on her return the guest leaving the house. She had got without the door, in the street, {{in the face of the}} beast market, on a Saturday, which is market day, and stood ready to part. She said she must be going, as she had to call upon her cousin Watson, (this appears to be a gratis dictum on the part of the ghost,) and, maintaining the character of mortality to the last, she quietly turned the corner, and walked out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|After {{the time}} of Burns, as was to be expected, Scottish song multiplies itself tenfold. The nation becomes awakened to the treasures of its own old literature, and attempts, what after all, alas! is but a revival; and like most revivals, not {{altogether}} a successful one. Of the twelve hundred songs contained in Mr. Whitelaw's excellent collection, whereof {{more than a hundred}} and fifty are either wholly or partly Burns's, the small proportion written before him are decidedly far superior in value to those written after him; a discouraging fact, though not difficult to explain, if we consider the great social changes which have been proceeding, the sterner subjects of thought which have been arising, during the last half-century. True song requires for its atmosphere a state rather of careless Arcadian prosperity, than of struggle and doubt, of earnest looking forward to an unknown future, and pardonable regret for a dying past; and in that state the mind of the masses, throughout North Britain, has been weltering confusedly for the last few years. The new and more complex era into which we are passing has not yet sufficiently opened itself to be sung about; men hardly know what it is, much less what it will be; and while they are hard at work creating it, they have no breath to spare in talking of it. One thing they do see and feel, painfully enough at times, namely, that the old Scottish pastoral life is passing away, before the combined influence of manufactures and the large-farm system; to be replaced, doubtless, hereafter, by something better, but in the meanwhile dragging down with it in its decay but too much that can ill be spared of that old society which inspired Ramsay and Burns. Hence the later Scottish song-writers seldom really sing; their <b>proses</b> want the unconscious lilt and flash of their old models; they will hardly go (the true test of a song) without music. The true test, we say again, of a song. Who needs music, however fitting and beautiful the accustomed air may happen to be, to [...] "Roy's Wife of Aldivalloch," [...] or [...] "The Bride cam' out o' the byre," [...] or either of the casts of [...] "The Flowers of the Forest," [...] or to [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] itself? They bubble right up out of the heart, and by virtue of their inner and unconscious melody, which all that is true to the heart has in it, shape themselves into a song, and are not shaped by any notes whatsoever. So with many, most indeed, of Burns's; and a few of Allan Cunningham's; the [...] "Wet sheet and a flowing sail," [...] for instance. But the great majority of these later songs seem, if the truth is to be spoken, inspirations at second hand, of people writing about things which they would like to feel, and which they ought to feel, because others used to feel them in old times; but which they do not feel as their forefathers felt--a sort of poetical Tractarianism, in short. Their metre betrays them, as well as their words; in both they are continually wandering, unconsciously to themselves, into the elegiac--except when on one subject, whereon the muse of Scotia still warbles at first hand, and from the depths of her heart--namely, alas! the barley bree: and yet never, even on this beloved theme, has she risen again to the height of Burns's bacchanalian songs.|$|E
