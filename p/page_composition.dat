500|$|According to Ernesto Priego, {{while the}} work adapts a comic-book source, the {{painting}} is neither a comic nor a comics panel, and [...] "its meaning is solely referential and post hoc." [...] It directs the attention of its audience to features such as genre and printing methods. Visually and narratively, the original panel was the climactic element of a dynamic <b>page</b> <b>composition.</b> Lichtenstein emphasizes the onomatopoeia while playing down articulated speech by removing the speech balloon. According to Priego, [...] "by stripping the comics panel from its narrative context, Whaam! is representative {{in the realm of}} fine art of the preference of the image-icon over image-narrative".|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{represents the}} first study of the choral compositions and arrangements of internationally recognized American choral artist Robert Page. An octogenarian {{at the time of}} this writing, Robert Page is known not only as a composer/arranger of choral music, but also as one of the nation’s leading conductors of choruses, orchestras, operas and musical theater productions. Robert Page is one of the last living links to some of the twentieth century’s greatest musical minds, having collaborated closely with Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, Dimitri Shostakovich, Eugene Ormandy, and such living legends as Kryzysztof Penderecki, Lorin Maazel, Charles Dutoit, Mariss Jansons, and Ned Rorem. ^ At present, many of <b>Page’s</b> <b>compositions</b> and arrangements are available from Hinshaw Publications and Boosey 2 ̆ 6 Hawkes. In addition to examining these works, this document will also provide a catalogue for all known unpublished works of Robert Page. The aim of this survey is threefold: (1) To provide biographical information on one of the modern era’s most celebrated American choral artists, (2) To examine each of <b>Page’s</b> <b>compositions</b> and select representative arrangements from the modern conductor’s vantage point, and (3) To begin the process of cataloguing Robert <b>Page’s</b> <b>compositions</b> and arrangements. ...|$|R

50|$|As a {{composer}} of microtonal music Sandberg intended to translate {{and interpret the}} sacred texts of all the worlds’ religions to musical form. He began his monumental project with the Hebrew Bible, from his own European Jewish tradition. He theorized that microtonal music, incorporating the tonal traditions of Asia, was an appropriate means for setting Hebrew, an Oriental language, to music. Over {{the course of his}} life, Sandberg produced some twenty thousand <b>pages</b> of musical <b>composition.</b> His magnum opus was Symphonic Psalms, the setting of the Book of Psalms to music, a task which comprised more than twelve thousand <b>pages</b> of <b>composition.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brown {{draws from}} a range of influences, {{including}} monster and superhero comic books, underground comix, and comic strips such as Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. His later works employ a sparse drawing style and flat dialogue. Rather than the traditional method of drawing complete pages, Brown draws individual panels without regard for <b>page</b> <b>composition</b> and assembles them into pages after completion. Since the late 1990s Brown has had a penchant for providing detailed annotations for his work and extensively altering and reformatting older works.|$|E

5000|$|In typography, {{a column}} is {{one or more}} {{vertical}} blocks of content positioned on a page, separated by gutters (vertical whitespace) or rules (thin lines, in this case vertical). Columns are most commonly used to break up large bodies of text that cannot fit in a single block of text on a page. Additionally, columns are used to improve <b>page</b> <b>composition</b> and readability. Newspapers very frequently use complex multi-column layouts to break up different stories and longer bodies of texts within a story. Column can also more generally refer to the vertical delineations created by a typographic grid system which type and image may be positioned. In page layout, the whitespace {{on the outside of}} the page (bounding the first and last columns) are known as margins; the gap between two facing pages is also considered a gutter, since there are columns on both sides. (Any gutter can also be referred to as a margin, but exterior and horizontal margins are not gutters.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewers have praised Asano's art and writing, but {{noted the}} {{limitations}} of the short story format for character development as well as Asano's overuse of character tropes. About.com's Shaenon Garrity called it an excellent debut work which, while not as good as Asano's later works and lacking in some stories, has great art and writing. Deb Aoki called the manga [...] "mysterious, humorous, magical and tragic all at the same time," [...] adding that it [...] "reminds us that living can be the greatest adventure of all." [...] Grant Goodman of PopCultureShock called the manga unique and solid, but felt that half of the chapters were not memorable and that the theme of [...] "life's losers" [...] made the stories feel repetitive and predictable. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network complimented the stories that were slightly surreal as well as Asano's penwork, but disliked the [...] "woe-is-me" [...] facet of the stories. David Welsh of The Comics Reporter disliked the use of overdone tropes in the stories, but praised the design of average-looking characters and the <b>page</b> <b>composition,</b> finding the stories [...] "polished and effective," [...] but not [...] "lingering in the mind". Johanna Carlson of Comics Worth Reading found the traits of the characters to be annoying but said that the detailed and expressive art grounded the story, making it more believable. Leroy Douresseaux of ComicBookBin praised Asano's ability to depict the struggles of young people in the first volume, but felt that this was downplayed by the large number of characters. He called Asano's ability to [...] "balance and compare and contrast what is celebrated and what is ridiculous about life" [...] the most engaging part of the second volume. Publishers Weekly found that Asano's characters were [...] "prone to platitudes" [...] {{but not as much as}} in Solanin, with the shorter stories also making the characters more sympathethic, and called the artwork and storytelling attractive. Al Sparrow of IGN noted the theme of survival in the stories, remarking that Asano portrays youth through an unfiltered lens. Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics found the stories to vary in quality, but called the manga charming and described the art as a [...] "beautifully delicate creation".|$|E

The details of a Web <b>page’s</b> <b>composition</b> are also studied to determine their effect on performance.

50|$|Bloom's {{training}} under Zimmerman and Ross was {{rigorous and}} traditional. Zimmerman focused on drawing and Ross on painting. Zimmerman encouraged {{his students to}} create full <b>page</b> <b>compositions</b> rather than partial sketches. To develop their powers of observation, he also insisted that they draw from memory rather than directly from the model. He hung William Blake prints {{on the walls of}} the settlement house, and encouraged students to synthesize images from multiple sources. He took Bloom and Levine on a field trip to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where Bloom was impressed by the work of Rouault and Soutine and began experimenting with their expressive painting styles. Ross, whose leanings were more academic, taught Bloom how to handle paint in the style of the earlier masters. Thus Zimmerman and Ross fostered respect for artistic tradition while also teaching that art was not merely a matter of copying, but of using one's imagination to create a formal design: ideas that would later influence a school of painting known as Boston Expressionism.|$|R
40|$|As {{a box of}} {{fourteen}} separate comics with no fixed reading order, Chris Ware’s Building Stories (2012) clearly epitomizes an apparent paradox that seems valid for {{a large part of}} contemporary comics production: it foregrounds a clever reliance on print materiality, while encouraging multimodal reading practices that are readily associated with digital media. Taking my cue from Lev Manovich’s description of the database logic in The Language of New Media and from Jared Gardner’s compelling argument in Projections about the importance of comics for twenty-first-century storytelling, I will argue that the random-access structure of Building Stories hones the affinities that comics share with the database logic. While non-chronological page layouts are a well-known feature of Ware’s comics, the database perspective offers fresh insights on overlooked <b>page</b> <b>compositions</b> and on the experimental structure of Building Stories. Furthermore, by looking at intermedial references to photography in Ware’s work, I will argue that drawing and style take a central role in articulating this nonlinearity, posing a challenge to the overbearing emphasis on narrative sequentiality still pervasive in comics theory.
