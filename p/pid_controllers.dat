25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> is that two <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded <b>PID</b> <b>controllers..</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} level of wrecker, fuzzy <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> for the uprighting was proposed. First, the uprighting model was built in this article. Then, the hydraulic circuit of wrecker uprighting system was built in AMESim. Furthermore, the fuzzy <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> and the conventional <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> were simulated respectively in Matlab software based on this model.

25|$|Another problem {{faced with}} <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> {{is that they}} are linear, and in {{particular}} symmetric. Thus, performance of <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, when {{high gain}} {{electronic}} amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> became popular, and 4–20 mA current loop signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard.

25|$|The most {{significant}} improvement is to incorporate feed-forward control with {{knowledge about the}} system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either gain scheduling in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple <b>PID</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Derivative action predicts system {{behavior}} and thus improves settling time {{and stability of}} the system. An ideal derivative is not causal, so that implementations of <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>PID</b> <b>controllers,</b> {{when used}} alone, can give poor {{performance}} when the PID loop gains must be reduced {{so that the}} control system does not overshoot, oscillate or hunt about the control setpoint value.

The main improvement is in endowing the classical controller with a certain adaptive control capability.

However, discrete analog <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.|$|E
25|$|Designing and tuning a PID {{controller}} {{appears to}} be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.|$|E
25|$|While <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> are {{applicable}} to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, {{and do not}} in general provide optimal control. The fundamental difficulty with PID control {{is that it is}} a feedback control system, with constant parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an observer without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> were used and today are still {{used in the}} simpler DP systems. But modern controllers use a mathematical model of the ship {{that is based on}} a hydrodynamic and aerodynamic description concerning some of the ship's characteristics such as mass and drag. Of course, this model is not entirely correct. The ship's position and heading are fed into the system and compared with the prediction made by the model. This difference is used to update the model by using Kalman filtering technique. For this reason, the model also has input from the wind sensors and feedback from the thrusters. This method even allows not having input from any PRS for some time, depending {{on the quality of the}} model and the weather. This process is known as dead reckoning.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (<b>PID</b> <b>controllers,</b> state space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.).
