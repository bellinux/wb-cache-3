25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All <b>programs</b> <b>menu</b> as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All <b>Programs</b> <b>menu</b> cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|R

40|$|Child Nutrition Programs {{in schools}} in the United States provide healthy, safe, {{affordable}} meals for a diverse population of children every school day. The USDA requires the menu for children with food allergies to be modified with no additional meal reimbursement. Food allergies affect up to 8 % {{of children in the}} U. S.; eight allergens (milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat) account for over 90 % of allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess self-efficacy of child nutrition <b>program</b> <b>menu</b> planners in California schools who design and implement menus for children with food allergies. Also identified were menu planning protocols used in the accommodation process, self-reported menu modification frequency, and cost perceptions to produce meals modified for children with food allergies. A two phase data collection included an electronic Delphi panel (n= 16) and general survey (n= 212) to menu planners for children with food allergies at California public schools. Based on food and labor costs, results indicated child nutrition <b>program</b> <b>menu</b> planners perceived modified meals cost more than non-modified meals planned to accommodate children with wheat, soy, milk products, and multiple allergens. This study estimated that 0. 96 % of lunch meals served in California were modified to eliminate food allergens. Ready availability and ease of sourcing substitute foods reduced perceptions of negative labor impacts on operations. Self-efficacy was measured using factors of perceived skill, perceived knowledge, frequency of training, perceived cost of menu modifications, district enrollment, years of work experience in child nutrition programs, education level, sex, and age of respondent, in providing meal accommodations for students with food allergies. Knowledge was the sole predictor of self-efficacy for menu planners of allergen modified menus for children. Findings from this study regarding perceived cost of accommodations and benchmarks of frequency of accommodations for children with specific food allergies can be utilized to calculate impact of additional food and labor costs. Child nutrition <b>program</b> <b>menu</b> planners were found to have high self-efficacy in planning modified meals; knowledge and adequate funding are keys to success...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalent}} ADSL service facilitates {{simultaneous use}} of telephone and high-speed data communication services. It {{is one of}} the best choices in current network technology for local loops. In this paper, we present solutions to design an interactive true video-on-demand (ITVOD) system for ADSL services with scarce resources at the set-top box. In the proposed system, we not only provide interactive functions (including fast-forward and fast-backward schemes for seeking video), but also furnish an innovative playing mechanism of the video-based <b>program</b> <b>menu</b> pages. The proposed mechanisms can save a large amount of system resources required beyond the capability of the original OSD (on-screen-display) device at the set-top box. To achieve a reliable service with scarce resources at the set-top box and variant qualities on ADSL links, we also implement an effective and efficient error control mechanism to tightly couple the packet retransmission and rate control mechanisms. The proposed mechanisms can also be deployed on hand-held devices (such as cellular phone and PDA) to support the multimedia networking services with scarce system resources...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine ethnic and cultural influences on body composition, lifestyle, and aspects of body image (perception, acceptability, and satisfaction) of younger (age 18 - 40 years) Australian and Japanese males, the latter including groups living in Australia and Japan. The sample sizes of the three groups were 68 Japanese living in Australia, 84 Japanese living in Japan, and 72 Australian Caucasian males respectively. The methodology included body composition assessments (by anthropometry and DXA), lifestyle and body image questionnaires, and dietary records. The study found significant p< 0. 05) ethnic differences in the %BF at given BMI levels and for Japanese the BMI values of 23. 6 kg/m 2 and 28. 6 kg/m 2 were found to be equivalent to 25 and 30 for Caucasians when used to classify individuals as "overweight" and "obese". Equations in common use for the calculation of body composition in Japanese males were evaluated using modern methods of body composition assessment and found to need considerable modification. New regression equations that represent BMI-%BF relationships for Japanese and Australians were proposed: Japanese: Log %BF = - 1. 330 + 1. 896 (log BMI), (R 2 = 0. 547, SEE = 0. 09); Australians: Log %BF = - 1. 522 + 2. 001 (log BMI), (R 2 = 0. 544, SEE = 0. 10). Equations were also developed to predict %BF for Japanese and Australian males from body composition assessments using anthropometry and DXA: Japanese: %BF = 0. 376 + 0. 402 (abdominal) + 0. 772 (medial calf) + 0. 217 (age), (R 2 = 0. 786, SEE = 2. 69); Australians: %BF = 2. 184 + 0. 392 (medial calf) + 0. 678 (supraspinale) + 0. 467 (triceps), (R 2 = 0. 864, SEE = 2. 37). Lifestyle factors were found to influence perceptions of body image. Australian males participate in physical activity more frequently than their Japanese counterparts (Australians = 98. 6 % involved in vigorous activity at least once per week, Japanese living in Japan = 85. 7 %, Japanese living in Australia = 72. 1 %). Significant differences p< 0. 05) in energy contribution patterns were found between the Japanese group (Protein: 14. 4 %, Carbohydrate: 50. 4 %, Fat: 28. 1 %) and Japanese living in Australia (JA: Protein: 16. 3 %, Carbohydrate: 47. 3 %, Fat: 32. 3 %) and the Australians (Protein: 17. 1 %, Carbohydrate: 47. 9 %, Fat: 30. 6 %). This shows that the Japanese living in Australia have adopted a more westemised diet than those living in Japan. Body Image assessments were done on all study groups using the Somatomorphic Matrix (SM) computer program and questionnaires, including the Ben-Tovim Walker Body Attitudes Questionnaires, (BAQ) the Attention to the Body Shape Scale (ABS), and the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Japanese males tended to overestimate their weight and amount of body fat, while Australian Caucasian males underestimated these parameters. The Japanese groups had higher scores on the selfdisparagement subscale and lower scores on the strengths and the attractiveness subscales of the BAQ questionnaire than Australian males. Australian males also had higher scores on the EAT total score and the dieting subscale of the EAT questionnaire than Japanese males. When all groups of subjects selected their perceived body image from the SM <b>program</b> <b>menu,</b> these results had no relationship with measured body composition values, suggesting that further development of this program is needed for use in these populations...|$|E
40|$|This Major Field Project Report {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a computer-based tutorial program coded in Prolog. The purpose of this application was {{to solve a problem}} related to unanticipated blocks to effective learning experienced by students in the Doctor of Arts in Learning and Technology at Nova University. These blocks were associated with assignments involving the Prolog computer language. Students encountered tasks that required knowledge of the Prolog language to complete assignments but they had no previous experience with programming in logic. A tutorial program was conceived as an instructional intervention to remediate this deficiency. Design criteria and performance criteria were developed. Use of off-the-shelf programs as prototypes reduced the coding task after the internal logic had been ver 1 fied by testing a model of the software coded in Prolog. The software was written in Prolog and was accessible online for students to use and examine. This software uses the Prolog language to teach itself. The final tutorial application design parameters reflect both the intended operational environment, the Nova University Unix (tm) system and resident C-Prolog Interpreter. This tutorial program model serves as an example of an operational deli very system for a tutorial instructional system. Specific problems are addressed in the code for the program, screen clearing, interactive components of the language and design of expert systems. Because the Prolog language does not provide system dependent capability such as clearing the screen the UNIX system was accessed to provide this function. Prolog is a database language that {{describes the}} problem being addressed {{and is a member of}} the family of declarative computer languages. The Prolog database contains facts and rules that evaluate the information in the database. A Prolog database is both information and source code containing instructions to be executed at run-time. Fortunately, Prolog contains a built-in predicate that reads the Keyboard and makes possible real-time interaction with students. Although Prolog is a declarative language, it is also procedural and this capability provided for development of expert systems that controlled and evaluated the input of students. The tutorial content and conceptual design represent a functional prototype and is not intended to stand as a paradigm of Prolog coding or program design. Source code for this software was divided into frames. Each frame was supported by an expert system that processed student input or used a set of rules to direct branching decisions. Documentation for the program, both internal (source code) and external (on-line), should enable student comprehension of the driving source code. Students were able to access the source code by selecting menu options that printed the rules and database facts to the screen for each tutorial frame and also the entire program. Remark statements embedded in the source code. These were statements explained what each expert system controlled and identified branching destinations. Source code for this software served two purposes. F 1 rst it operated as the database of facts and rule and provided input facilities for the program at run-time. Second the code presented on request a functional example of Prolog code. The <b>program</b> <b>menu</b> provided options for downloading of the source code or portions of it. Design criteria for the program was stated in terms of performance expectations. These statements were used to evaluate the attainment of performance goals. The performance of the tutorial program was evaluated and the results are presented. This report also contains a UNIX 2 ̆ 2 man 2 ̆ 2 system entry file prepared for the program and also a user’s manual. A structured walk through explains the purpose and function of each Prolog coded frame. Syntax and branching is described where appropriate in the walk through...|$|E
