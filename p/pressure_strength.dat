Test results show that: 1.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} star formation and feedback on ram pressure stripping using high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations, building on a previous series of papers that systematically investigated stripping using a realistic model for the interstellar medium, but without star formation. We find that star formation does not significantly affect {{the rate at which}} stripping occurs, and only has a slight impact on the density and temperature distribution of the stripped gas, indicating that our previous (gas-only) results are unaffected. For our chosen (moderate) ram <b>pressure</b> <b>strength,</b> stripping acts to truncate star formation in the disk over a few hundred million years, and does not lead to a burst of star formation. Star formation in the bulge is slightly enhanced, but the resulting change in the bulge-to-disk ratio is insignificant. We find that stars do form in the tail, primarily from gas that is ablated from the disk and the cools and condenses in the turbulent wake. The star formation rate in the tail is low, and any contribution to the intracluster light is likely to be very small. We argue that star formation in the tail depends primarily on the pressure in the intracluster medium, rather than the ram <b>pressure</b> <b>strength.</b> Finally, we compare to observations of star formation in stripped tails, finding that many of the discrepancies between our simulation and observed wakes can be accounted for by different intracluster medium pressures.

We {{investigate}} {{the motion of}} artificial satellites with large area-to-mass ratios in high-altitude low inclined orbits, perturbed simultaneously by solar radiation pressure and Earth’s oblateness. Our study is based on recent theoretical advances in circumplanetary dust dynamics (Hamilton & Krivov 1996). Applying these methods to the motion of balloon satellites, we write down and analyze the orbit-averaged equations of motion in planar approximation. Contrary to many previous works, our consideration imposes no restrictions on eccentricities and radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>strengths.</b> The results show how the eccentricity and apses line of a satellite orbit evolve with time for various area-to-mass ratios, geocentric distances, and initial data. Our special interest is with complicated dynamical effects arising from the two perturbing forces above.
