5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest <b>physical</b> <b>presence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{studies have}} {{explored}} the affordances of 3 D virtual worlds. Although previous studies indicated that virtual worlds {{would be helpful}} for experiential and collaborative learning through enhancing <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence,</b> few studies have investigated what determines <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> and what are their roles in learning and teaching in virtual worlds. The current study investigates the influences of individual differences such as age, gender, and epistemological beliefs on <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence.</b> This study also investigates the influences of <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> on situational interest and perceived achievement in virtual role-play. The role-play activity allowed pre-service teachers (n= 151) to teach their peers in realistic classroom contexts within Second Life and {{to reflect on their}} language use as teachers. This study found that pre-service teachers' age and epistemological beliefs significantly influenced their <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> in the virtual world. This finding implies that <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> are influenced not only by the representational fidelity of virtual worlds but also by individual differences. In addition, <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> positively influenced situational interest and perceived achievement. More attention should be paid to the roles of <b>physical</b> and social <b>presence</b> in teaching and learning in virtual worlds...|$|R

This was soon followed by news that the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the conquistadores. A mixed embassy that included Chiapanecas, K'iche's and Kaqchikel Maya visited Hernan Cortés in the recently conquered Aztec capital, and were well received.|$|E

This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team can hit long balls up to him. He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E
50|$|Enterprise group {{planning}} {{will usually}} manifest in regular board of directors' or management committee' meetings with varying frequencies such as monthly, quarterly or annually.

5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with Edmonton's Dan McGillis {{early in the}} 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina's roster to add a <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> to the team and improve the team {{at both ends of}} the ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.|$|E

McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} <b>physical</b> <b>presence,</b> they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E

50|$|The use of ghost lore (referred to as Draugr) in the sagas is {{characteristic}} of the Norse lore and is directly connected to proper burial practices. Stories and references can be found throughout various sagas including the Laxdæla saga, Eirik's saga, and the Eyrbyggja saga. Ghosts are portrayed as menacing <b>physical</b> <b>presences</b> that intend to injure the living and haunt them. The Laxdæla saga portray how hauntings often take a menacing and ill hearted turn. These accounts of hauntings and menacing ghosts are often solved through proper burial practices. Burial customs are the primary explanation and solution of the problems faced by ghosts.

5|$|The attacking {{force has}} the natural {{advantage}} {{at the start}} of each game, likely indicating an important cultural aspect by mimicking the success of Viking raids. Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs' presence in battle. Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather than being a <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> on the battlefield, it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war. The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it is a war strategy game, which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages. In Balnakeil, a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 was found with weapons and a Hnefatafl board game. Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them, which explains why young boys also played these war-strategic board games.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth.

In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer.

5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E
5|$|According to Hussein's {{account of}} the events, Abu Nuwar and the Free Officers had planned for the Bedouin-dominated First Infantry Regiment in Zarqa to {{participate}} in a training exercise in the desert without ammunition to render it unavailable for Hussein to use against a planned anti-government demonstration scheduled to be held by Nabulsi on 14 April. Hussein was still wary of Nabulsi due to an alleged intercept of a message from Nasser imploring Nabulsi to resist his dismissal from the premiership. Hussein was informed of the Free Officers' alleged plot by Sharif Naser and Bedouin officers from Zarqa on the evening of 13 April. The incident coincided with a delivery by Abu Nuwar of an ultimatum to Prime Minister Said al-Mufti (Nabulsi's successor) warning Hussein to appoint a government reflecting the will of the elected parliament or face an army revolt. Al-Mufti apparently broke down emotionally in Hussein's presence, prompting the latter to inquire from Abu Nuwar about the ultimatum, to which Abu Nuwar professed his surprise. Hussein then brought Abu Nuwar along with him to inspect the scene at Zarqa, where Hussein was told by loyalist officers from Zarqa that rumors of his death had provoked heavy clashes between his loyalists and those of Abu Nuwar and that only the <b>physical</b> <b>presence</b> of Hussein would {{put an end to the}} fighting. Moreover, Hussein was told that Rashid and Ma'an Abu Nuwar (a distant cousin of Abu Nuwar) had been ordered to Amman to besiege the royal palace and arrest Hussein.|$|E

Estimating our initial hedonic model using OLS reveals that the number of negative reviews posted for a company is associated with decreased prices. Estimating a new hedonic model that controls for economies of scale provides the same conclusion, though the effect is slightly decreased.
