40|$|Dear Sir, The {{thought of}} having a photo gallery of authors and reviewers at first {{instance}} gives a mixed feeling about its benefits. On deeper thought it does makes sense of having a photo gallery in Journal. Many times we read the names of authors which are same or similar, which often confuses us, but a photograph helps us to identify them. It not only gives better recognition to authors but also helps the readers to know them better. As a visual memory, it would help the readers to remember and cite article with authorâ€™s identity when required. Some journals do give authors photographs but only in of main author and only in some section. Having a photo gallery including all authors in all formats of publication just extends it purpose. As mentioned in earlier Editorial this will truly help in developing a <b>personalized</b> <b>journal</b> and a strong academic network too [1] I feel reviewers are the backbone for functioning of the journal. They usually are unnoted and overlooked. Having a photo gallery for reviewers in every issue gives them acknowledgment and probably motivates them in their work. Thus photo gallery of authors and reviewers in the journal is an innovative and useful step taken by JOCR which can revolutionize journal presentation. I feel it would soon become a standard for every journal...|$|E

40|$|The concept {{discussed}} in this report rests {{on the premise that}} the conventional system fails to meet the needs for rapid exchange of the results of research and development in certain areas of applied science and technology: conventional publication involves several handlings of the material, is labour intensive and is therefore slow and expensive. The paper suggests that significant improvements could be made by the use of compatible text-editing systems by authors, referees and publishers, interconnected over computer networks. By creating a master digital record at the outset, many new output options are possible in addition to the conventional journal or report. Examples are new forms of current awareness publications, in the shape of <b>personalized</b> <b>journals</b> and the like, and immediate information retrieval techniques leading to delivery of full texts via the network. To pass full texts through the network will require the use of high-capacity satellite telecommunications, employing small Earth stations. Finally, it is suggested that a programme of studies should be carried out in association with actual experiments using the European Space Agency's Orbital Test Satellite...|$|R

What kinds of research models can involve young people in meaningful reflections on their lives and futures while simultaneously yielding valid data to inform services and policy? This paper reports on the methods developed for a longitudinal study of health and wellbeing among young people from refugee backgrounds in Melbourne, Australia. The study involves 100 newly-arrived young people 12 to 18 years of age, and employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods implemented {{as a series of}} activities carried out by participants in <b>personalized</b> settlement <b>journals.</b> This paper highlights the need to think outside the box of traditional qualitative and/or quantitative approaches for social research into refugee youth health and illustrates how integrated approaches can produce information that is meaningful to policy makers, service providers and to the young people themselves...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundHuman {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor 2 (HER 2) overexpression is detected in approximately 15 % to 20 % of all breast cancers (BCs). A revolutionary change in the prognosis of this subgroup of patients has occurred since trastuzumab therapy was introduced into daily clinical practice. However, because trastuzumab resistance is common, new molecules with complementary and/or synergistic mechanisms of action have been developed. Pertuzumab is a new anti-HER 2 humanized monoclonal antibody that prevents the formation of HER 2 dimers. Material and methodsA computer-based literature search was carried out using PubMed (keywords: breast neoplasm, dimerization, HER- 2, pertuzumab); data reported at international meetings are included. ResultsThis paper describes pertuzumab's mechanism of action, safety, and role in HER 2 -positive BCs. It also explores the role of pertuzumab as a single agent or combined with trastuzumab by reviewing data from preclinical research to ongoing clinical trials. Recently published trials, particularly the CLEOPATRA study, highlight the efficacy, tolerability, and increase in disease-free survival associated with this novel agent when combined with trastuzumab. ConclusionThe pertuzumab and trastuzumab anti-HER 2 dual blockade is likely to represent a substantial advance for patients with HER 2 -positive BCs and a new milestone {{on the way to}} <b>personalized</b> medicine. <b>JOURNAL</b> ARTICLESCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} review of studies {{related to the}} psychological characteristics of Sasang types was conducted {{with the goal of}} delineating generalizable psychological profiles based on Sasang typology, a traditional Korean medical typology with medical herbs and acupuncture that is characterized as <b>personalized</b> medicine. <b>Journal</b> articles pertaining to Sasang typology were collected using five electronic database systems in Korea and in the USA. As a result, 64 potentially relevant studies were identified and 21 peer-reviewed research articles that employed psychometric inventories were included. Beginning {{with the use of the}} Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in 1992, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, NEO-Personality Inventory, Temperament and Character Inventory and other personality assessment tools were employed in the identified studies. Because data synthesis could not be carried out due to the heterogeneity of the studies, the present review article sought to delineate the mutual relevance of the studies based on research results pertaining to the correlation between the aforementioned psychological assessment instruments. Results of the review indicate that two super-factors, Extraversion and Neuroticism, serve as the foundation in regards to delineating personality constructs, such that the So-Yang type scored high on the Extraversion dimension and low on the Neuroticism dimension, while the So-Eum type scored low on the Extraversion dimension and high on the Neuroticism dimension. The present {{systematic review}} indicates that Sasang typology shares similarities with the Western psychological tradition...|$|R

Educational Modelling Language: new {{challenges}} for instructional re-usability and <b>personalized</b> learning. International <b>Journal</b> of Learning Technology, 1, 1, 110 - 111. Learning technologies offer {{new challenges}} to the rapidly growing demand for more constructivist ways of learning (like competency-based, collaborative or adaptive learning). They could, for instance, play a catalyst role in a more effective exchange and reuse of learning objects to enable personalized learning. This article establishes to what extent current learning technologies specifications contribute to educational change, to actual sharing and reuse in educational practice. This article furthermore explains why we need an Educational Modelling Language centered around learning activities to give instructional meaning to learning objects. It is concluded that specifications for learning objects have been primarily designed to insure inter-operability at a rather low infrastructural level (e. g., test items, meta-data), focusing on technology issues and reuse of learning objects. Now adoptability issues are beginning {{to call for a}} pedagogical framework at a higher infrastructural level (e. g., a complete course), focusing on the instructional value and reuse of learning activities, like in the new Learning Design (LD) specification. LD enables the description of both learning content and processes within â€˜units of learningâ€™ from a variety of pedagogical perspectives (both objectivist and constructivist) ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the matched guise technique in the 1960 s (Lambert et al. 1960), there has been little methodological innovation in the field of language attitude research (Speelman et al. 2013). In social psychology, by contrast, a considerable number of new methods to measure implicit attitudes has been developed {{in the past two decades}} (Gawronski & De Houwer 2014). It is only recently that sociolinguistics has started to explore the potential of some of these social psychological techniques to study language attitudes (Redinger 2010, Pantos 2012, Campbell-Kibler 2012 for the Implicit Association Test; Speelman et al. 2013 for Auditory Affective Priming) and so far only the surface has been scratched when it comes to exploring the possibilities and limitations these new methods have to offer for linguistic attitude research. Moreover many of these measures remain unexplored by linguists altogether. In this paper, we report the results of a case study using the Personalized Implicit Association Test (Olson & Fazio 2004), one of these recently developed social psychological implicit attitude measures. The P-IAT measures the association between a target concept and an attribute concept (respectively language variety and valence in our study) by comparing participantsâ€™ reaction times in categorisation tasks in which the target and attribute concepts are paired either congruently or incongruently. We measured attitudes towards two regional varieties of Dutch in Belgium and Standard Belgian Dutch. Results show all participants strongly favour the standard variety over both regional varieties. Yet, between the two regional varieties, participants tend to prefer their own regiolect. In addition to the implicit attitude measurement using the P-IAT, the case study comprised an explicit attitude measurement based on semantic differential scales. Outcomes of the implicit and explicit measure were not significantly correlated. Potential methodological and theoretical explanations for this lack of correlation will be discussed in addition to a provisional evaluation of the P-IAT as a measure of language attitudes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is twofold. It sets out {{to contribute to the}} study of language attitudes on a methodological as well as a descriptive level. The main goal of the study is the methodological one. Notwithstanding some exceptions (e. g. Preston 1982), quantitative language attitude research has known little methodological innovation since the introduction of the matched-guise technique in the 1960 s (Lambert et al. 1960). This relative methodological stagnation forms a stark contrast with the recent explosion of new methods in social psychology. The latter field is heavily invested in the study of attitudes and has witnessed the development of a large amount of new attitude measures in the last few decades (Petty et al. 2009; Gawronski & De Houwer 2014). In this thesis, we investigate whether linguistic attitude research can take advantage of these recent developments in psychological attitude research: is it possible to use those new attitude measures to study the social meaning of language variation? The second goal of our research is a descriptive one. In the past decades, attitudes towards Dutch language variation have been relatively understudied. In the Netherlands, this situation is changing as more linguistic attitude studies are being carried out (cf. recent work by Grondelaers et al. 2009; Grondelaers & Van Hout 2010). By contrast, in Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, there is still much work to be done. Against this background, we aim to make a contribution to the emerging picture of the language attitudinal landscape in Flanders. To accomplish these goals, three studies were conducted. These studies focus on three different social psychological attitude measures and feature five varieties of Belgian Dutch. The first study explores the Personalized Implicit Association Test (P-IAT, Olson & Fazio 2004) to measure attitudes towards Standard Belgian Dutch and two regional varieties of Belgian Dutch (Chapter 2). The P-IAT is compared to two other attitude measures in this study: a direct rating task and a second social psychological technique called affective priming (AP, Speelman et al. 2013). Following up on the successful implementation of the P-IAT as a language attitude measure in the first study, the second study continues the exploration of the P-IAT. Experimental methods like the P-IAT often decontextualise the attitude object. Given the abundant evidence in both the social psychological and sociolinguistic literature that context significantly influences attitudes (e. g. Gawronski & De Houwer 2014; Campbell-Kibler 2007; Soukup 2013 a), we set out to investigate whether we could introduce context cues {{in the design of the}} P-IAT. If successful, the method could be used to measure attitudes in a more contextualised way. In the final study, we investigate the potential of the Relational Responding Task (RRT, De Houwer et al. 2015) as a measure for language attitudes. The RRT is used to measure which social meaning listeners associate with Standard Belgian Dutch and Colloquial Belgian Dutch. To provide the necessary background for the studies, we first present a state of the art of attitude measurement in linguistics and social psychology. In addition to this overview, we discuss in detail how the social psychological measures under study (AP, the P-IAT and the RRT) function. This is followed by a comparative review of their procedural characteristics, which points out potential advantages and shortcomings in the light of their use in sociolinguistic attitude research. Overall, on the methodological level, the results are promising: we have been able to successfully implement the P-IAT and RRT to measure language attitudes. However, further research is required to obtain a more thorough understanding of certain procedural aspects of the methods, but also to investigate a number of theoretical issues, such as the categorization processes involved in language attitudes. From a descriptive perspective, the results of our studies corroborate a number of findings that have come out of previous research and add to them. For instance, language users hold very positive attitudes towards Standard Belgian Dutch. This variety is particularly associated with status and competence and formal usage contexts, although it is also perceived positively in informal situations. Supraregional varieties of Dutch, by contrast, are exclusively associated with informal situations. Speakers of these varieties are perceived as sounding dynamic and trendy. Contrary to previous research, we have been able to measure these associations with supraregional Dutch using a direct attitude measure. The final chapter of this thesis situates our research in a larger framework to illustrate its theoretical relevance. Although the main {{objective of}} this work is to provide novel tools for sociolinguistic research on language attitudes, it also goes beyond this methodological aim. That is to say, our work fits within the tradition of Cognitive Sociolinguistics. This emerging field aims to combine the strengths of sociolinguistics and Cognitive Linguistics, namely the empirical study of intralinguistic variation and the study of meaning (Geeraerts & Kristiansen 2015). That Cognitive Sociolinguistic project takes shape in this thesis through the study of the social meaning language users attribute to language variation. References: Campbell-Kibler, K. (2007).
