With assistance from writings in contemporary philosophy, this paper analyzes aspects of both the parent culture and the subculture as they concern design <b>processes</b> and <b>media.</b> The analysis uncovers assumptions that normally assign such <b>processes</b> and <b>media</b> to a secondary role in which they to a secondary role in which they serve only as neutral and transparent skills. By constructing a set of alternative assumptions, the paper proposes a new, primary, role for design <b>processes</b> and <b>media</b> - a role that enables them to act as intentional and substantial generators of form. These alternative assumptions challenge deeply held beliefs, but examples show that when they are employed experimentally in computer-aided design, they reveal new possibilities unique to digital <b>processes</b> and <b>media.</b> ...|$|R

This paper first analyzes the specificity and the application scope of lossless watermarking methods. It explains why early attempts to achieve reversibility are not satisfactory. They are restricted to well-chosen images, strictly lossless context and/or suffer from Annoying visual artifacts. Circular interpretation of bijective transformations is proposed to implement a method that fulfills all quality and functionality requirements of lossless watermarking.

The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two <b>processes.</b> <b>Media</b> synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance <b>processes,</b> use of <b>media</b> supporting lower synchronicity should result in better com-munication performance. For convergence <b>processes,</b> use of <b>media</b> supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance. We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful perfor-mance of conveyance and convergence communication processes. The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium...|$|R
