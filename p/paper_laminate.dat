The proposed jute fibre reinforced laminated paper composite and reinforcement-fibre free <b>paper</b> <b>laminate</b> {{may help to}} combat the war against this pollut-ant to certain extent. The <b>paper</b> <b>laminate,</b> without reinforcement fibre, exhibited a few fold superiority in tensile properties than single paper strip.

The films found most effective in the preliminary studies were subsequently used for packaging and storage of dried fish at atmospheric and lower temperature and humidity conditions for confirming their suitability under these conditions. Polyethylene films of higher gauges showed better results under both sets of conditions. PVDC coated cellophane film also performed satisfactorily under the latter conditions which under the former condition got easily attacked by insects.

40|$|Packaging cartons, nowadays, are an {{integral}} part of food items for their storage and transportation. These are normally made from <b>paper</b> <b>laminate</b> board. However changing European Union (EU) regulations are forcing carton manufacturers to use thinner recycled materials. The packaging machinery manufacturers industry in the UK is dominated by small and medium enterprises where machines designs are normally developed through empirical knowledge. There is little known about the effects of changing carton materials on the overall carton process. Thus change in material properties for the cartons is affecting the carton erection process. This research work is aimed at establishing the best machine settings for erecting cartons so that the carton buckling can be reduced by incorporating the ideal machine settings irrespective of the materials used for the cartons. Techniques from the design of experiments are used here to predict the best settings for the machine. The settings thus predicted are finally validated by practical experimentation...|$|E

In {{order to}} solve the problem that the paper will be wrapped and {{distorted}} after being <b>laminated</b> by the <b>paper</b> <b>laminating</b> machine, an auto flip delivery mechanism of the <b>paper</b> <b>laminating</b> machine is designed. A set of flip mechanism is installed in the delivery part of the <b>paper</b> <b>laminating</b> machine for placing the small paper stacks right side up or side down, which effectively prevents the <b>laminated</b> <b>paper</b> from being wrapped and distorted.

40|$|Results of {{computer}} simulations and measurements of frequency-dependent dielectric properties of a binary composite material are presented. The studied composite had well-defined 3 D periodic structure and {{was made of}} paraffin and <b>paper</b> <b>laminate.</b> In the considered frequency range (10 (- 3) 10 (3) Hz), both the constituents were characterized by significantly different dispersive properties of complex dielectric permittivities. These frequency-dependent parameters were measured and were used for 3 D numerical simulations of the effective dielectric properties of the mixture. The simulations were performed using two methods, the finite-volume method and the finite-element method. Frequency variations of the computed effective complex permittivity of the composite are discussed and are compared with the experimental data. The results of the simulations show that the distributions of the micro-scale electric field and dielectric losses in {{the volume of the}} composite material are strongly frequency dependent. This effect is also analyzed using classical models for composite dielectric structures...|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} in two stages {{explored}} the possibilities and potential {{for improving the}} mechanical properties of the laminated paper material created with Mcor Technologies 3 D printer IRIS. The first stage explored the effects of coating, soaking or vacuum infusing five hardening agents wood glue, diluted wood glue, urethane wood lacquer, epoxy wood finish, and lamination epoxy on specimens of the material, whose strong and weak axis were afterwards tested with three-point bending tests. Except for the lamination epoxy, none of the agents responded well to the infusion or improved the material s properties particularly {{with any of the}} treatments. The lamination epoxy however, did, and was therefore investigated further with a second series of eight 2 by 2 cm specimens that were longer than the first, to provide more reliable results from the bending test. The measurements were compared to theoretical specimens of pure epoxy and aluminium, whose corresponding bending stiffness and strength was calculated using classic beam theory. Infused and heat treated, the composite <b>paper</b> <b>laminate</b> was stiffer than the theoretical aluminium in both orientations, twice so if accounting for the difference in density, and over two thirds as strong compared to its weight.

50|$|Perfboard is a {{material}} for prototyping electronic circuits (also called DOT PCB). It is a thin, rigid sheet with holes pre-drilled at standard intervals across a grid, usually a square grid of 2.54 mm (0.1 in) spacing. These holes are ringed by round or square copper pads, though bare boards are also available. Inexpensive perfboard may have pads {{on only one}} side of the board, while better quality perfboard can have pads on both sides (plate-through holes). Since each pad is electrically isolated, the builder makes all connections with either wire wrap or miniature point to point wiring techniques. Discrete components are soldered to the prototype board such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits. The substrate is typically made of <b>paper</b> <b>laminated</b> with phenolic resin (such as FR-2) or a fiberglass-reinforced epoxy laminate (FR-4).|$|R

40|$|Recently, smart {{materials}} have drawn wide attention from many researchers. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>laminated</b> shape memory polymer composite (SMPC) exhibiting two-way shape memory effect (SME) has been prepared {{by combining the}} pre-elongated shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) with the un-elongated elastic polyurethane (PU). Then the shape memory behaviors, laminated structure and two-way SME mechanism are investigated systematically. The results show that two-way shape memory behaviors, i. e., bending upon heating and reverse bending upon cooling, are achieved in the resulted SMPU-based-SMPCs. In addition, the SMPCs show the compositive thermal properties and dynamic mechanical properties due to their physical combination of layer-by-layer. Furthermore, the shape memory mechanism can be ascribed to the reversible change of two forces, i. e., recovery force in the SMPU layer and bending force in the elastic PU layer.
