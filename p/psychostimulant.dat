A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the <b>psychostimulant</b> and rewarding properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the <b>psychostimulant</b> effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a <b>psychostimulant</b> also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>psychostimulants</b> work by {{activating}} dopamine receptors causing increased focus or pleasure. The {{usage of}} <b>psychostimulants</b> {{has become more}} widespread in the medical world for treating conditions like ADHD. <b>Psychostimulants</b> {{have been shown to}} be used more frequently today amongst students and other social demographics as a means to study more efficiently or have been abused for their pleasurable side effects. Research suggests that when not abused, <b>psychostimulants</b> aid in the acquisition of procedural learning. Studies have shown that <b>psychostimulants</b> like d-amphetamine facilitates lower response times and increased procedural learning when compared to control participants and participants who have been administered the antipsychotic haloperidol on procedural learning tasks. While improvements in procedural memory were evident when participants were administered traces of <b>psychostimulants,</b> many researchers have found that procedural memory is hampered when <b>psychostimulants</b> are abused. This introduces the idea that for optimal procedural learning, dopamine levels must be balanced.|$|R
40|$|Rewarding {{properties}} of <b>psychostimulants</b> result from reduced uptake and/or increased release of dopamine at mesolimbic synapses. As exemplified by cocaine, many <b>psychostimulants</b> act by binding to the dopamine uptake transporter. However, {{this does not}} explain the action of other <b>psychostimulants,</b> including amphetamine. As most <b>psychostimulants</b> are weak bases and dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles uses an interior-acidic pH gradient, we examined the possibility that psychostimu-lants might inhibit acidification. Pharmacologically rele-vant concentrations of amphetamine as well as cocaine and phencyclidine rapidly reduced pH gradients in cul-tured midbrain dopaminergic neurons.

25|$|NRIs are {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} conditions like ADHD and narcolepsy due to their <b>psychostimulant</b> effects and in obesity due to their appetite suppressant effects. They are also frequently used as antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder, anxiety and panic disorder. Additionally, many drugs of abuse such as cocaine and methylphenidate possess NRI activity, though it is important to mention that NRIs without combined dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) properties are not significantly rewarding and hence are considered to have a negligible abuse potential. However, norepinephrine has been implicated as acting synergistically with dopamine when actions on the two neurotransmitters are combined (e.g., in the case of NDRIs) to produce rewarding effects in <b>psychostimulant</b> drugs of abuse.|$|E

25|$|While {{caffeine}} {{does not}} directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1–D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with 1 adenosine A1 receptor and 1 dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with 2 adenosine A2A receptors and 2 dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer {{has been identified as}} a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its <b>psychostimulant</b> effects and its pharmacodynamic interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} off-label in the U.S., {{which means they}} have not been approved for treating ASD. Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and aripiprazole were underway in early 2008. Aripiprazole may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the <b>psychostimulant</b> methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical children with ADHD. Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone secretin reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit. Oxytocin {{may play a role in}} autism and may be an effective treatment for repetitive and affiliative behaviors; two related studies in adults found that oxytocin decreased repetitive behaviors and improved interpretation of emotions, but these preliminary results do not necessarily apply to children. An experimental drug STX107 has stopped overproduction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in rodents, and it has been hypothesized that this may help in about 5% of autism cases, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans.|$|E

Several studies suggest an effect of a long-term treatment with <b>psychostimulants</b> on the structural as well as functional brain development.

40|$|The use of <b>psychostimulants</b> as an {{adjuvant}} {{therapy in}} treatment-resistant depression {{is not very}} common nowadays and {{has been the subject}} of much criticism. This article gives a brief review of the literature and reports on the findings from a retrospective study carried out in 65 depressed patients treated with <b>psychostimulants</b> (amphetamine and methylphenidate) in addition to conventional antidepressants. Thirty-eight out of 65 patients showed significant improvement, in particular with respect to energy mood, and psychomotor activity. The best response to <b>psychostimulants</b> was seen in inhibited types of depression and in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant. None of the patients developed drug dependency. The incidence of side effects was low, and agitation and restlessness improved with an additional short-term treatment with benzodiazepines. It is concluded that the rapid onset of action (2 - 3 hours) after administration may help cover the therapeutic latency period of conventional antidepressants and probably potentiates their effect.
