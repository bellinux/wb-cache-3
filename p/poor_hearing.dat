40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to determine whether differences exist in audiometric hearing status between individuals with and without multiple sclerosis (MS) and between individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and individuals with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Forty-seven subjects with MS (26 with RRMS and 21 with SPMS) and forty-nine control subjects without MS completed both a comprehensive case-history questionnaire and a conventional hearing evaluation. Statistical analyses, accounting for the potential confounding factors of age, sex, noise exposure, and use of ototoxic medications, revealed significant differences in hearing thresholds between subjects with and without MS at select audiometric test frequencies (p < 0. 05). At these audiometric test frequencies, the subjects with MS had <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds. Additional analyses revealed significant differences in hearing sensitivity at select audiometric frequencies between the subjects with RRMS and the subjects with SPMS, such that those with SPMS had <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds.

40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is to address the {{relationship}} between hearing status and need for recovery. In addition, the role of hearing status in the relationship between psychosocial work characteristics (i. e. job demands and job control) and need for recovery was assessed. The sample comprised 925 normally-hearing and hearing-impaired working adults (aged 18 - 65 years) participating in the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. Hearing status was determined using the national hearing (speech-in-noise) test over the internet. Psychosocial work characteristics and need for recovery were assessed using the job content questionnaire and the Dutch questionnaire on the experience and assessment of work. Regression models revealed a significant association between hearing status and need for recovery after work, <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> leading to an increasing need for recovery.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} self-reported hearing and portable music listening habits, measured hearing function and music exposure levels in Swedish adolescents. The study was divided into two parts. Materials and Methods: The first part included 280 adolescents, who were 17 years of age and focused on self-reported data on subjective hearing problems and listening habits regarding portable music players. From this group, 50 adolescents volunteered to participate in Part II of the study, which focused on audiological measurements and measured listening volume. Results: The results indicated that longer lifetime exposure in years and increased listening frequency were associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds and more self-reported hearing problems. A tendency was found for listening to louder volumes and <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds. Women reported more subjective hearing problems compared with men but exhibited better hearing thresholds. In contrast, men reported more use of personal music devices, and they listen at higher volumes. Discussion: Additionally, the study shows that adolescents listening for ≥ 3 [*]h at every occasion more likely had tinnitus. Those listening at ≥ 85 [*]dB[*]LAeq, FF and listening every day exhibited <b>poorer</b> mean <b>hearing</b> thresholds, reported more subjective hearing problems and listened more frequently in school and while sleeping. Conclusion: Although the vast majority listened at moderate sound levels and for shorter periods of time, the study also indicates that there is a subgroup (10 %) that listens between 90 and 100 [*]dB for longer periods of time, even during sleep. This group might be at risk for developing future noise-induced hearing impairments...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions. The results {{indicate}} that SOM of extreme duration, and maybe also the treatment of SOM, are risk factors for developing permanent hearing loss, both conductive and sensorineural. Objective. Fluctuating or persisting hearing loss of varying degrees is known to accompany secretory otitis media (SOM). The {{aim of this study}} was to detect possible hearing sequelae in young adults who had suffered from "refractory'' SOM during childhood. Material and methods. A total of 33 subjects (age 16 - 25 years) with previous SOM that had persisted for a mean of 11 years (range 6 - 19 years) were retrospectively examined at a mean of 18 years after their first myringotomy or tube insertion and compared to 15 healthy controls. The follow-up included audiometric examinations (pure-tone audiometry, distorted speech and impedance audiometry), otomicroscopy and scrutiny of medical records. Results. The SOM group had <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> at all frequencies with the exception of 1. 5 kHz in the range 0. 125 - 16 kHz. Those with the greatest number of myringotomies and tube insertions and those with the longest duration of SOM had significantly <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> at high frequencies (8 - 16 kHz) than those with fewer tube insertions and a shorter duration of SOM. The SOM group scored lower on distorted speech tests than the controls...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Investigate hearing {{function}} and headphone listening habits in nine-year-old Swedish children. Design: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} and included otoscopy, tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry, and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE). A questionnaire {{was used to evaluate}} headphone listening habits, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Study sample: A total of 415 children aged nine years. Results: The prevalence of a hearing threshold 20 dB HL at one or several frequencies was 53 %, and the hearing thresholds at 6 and 8 kHz were higher than those at the low and mid frequencies. SOAEs were observed in 35 % of the children, and the prevalence of tinnitus was 5. 3 %. No significant relationship between SOAE and tinnitus was found. Pure-tone audiometry showed <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds in children with tinnitus and in children who regularly listened with headphones. Conclusion: The present study of hearing, listening habits, and tinnitus in nine-year old children is, to our knowledge, the largest study so far. The main findings were that hearing thresholds in the right ear were poorer in children who used headphones than in children not using them, which could be interpreted as headphone listening may have negative consequences to children’s hearing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare hearing {{performance}} {{relating to}} the peripheral and central auditory system between solvent-exposed and non-exposed workers. METHODS: Forty-eight workers exposed to a mixture of solvents and 48 non-exposed control subjects of matched age, gender and educational level were selected {{to participate in the}} study. The evaluation procedures included: pure-tone audiometry (500 - 8, 000 Hz), to investigate the peripheral auditory system; the Random Gap Detection test, to assess the central auditory system; and the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, to investigate subjects' self-reported hearing performance in daily-life activities. A Student t test and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were computed to determine possible significant differences between solvent-exposed and non-exposed subjects for the hearing level, Random Gap Detection test and Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap. Pearson correlations among the three measures were also calculated. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects exhibited significantly <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds for the right ear than non-exposed subjects. Also, solvent-exposed subjects exhibited poorer results for the Random Gap Detection test and self-reported poorer listening performance than non-exposed subjects. Results of the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap were significantly correlated with the binaural average of subject pure-tone thresholds and Random Gap Detection test performance. CONCLUSIONS: Solvent exposure is associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> performance in daily life activities that relate to the function of the peripheral and central auditory system...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} processing with nonlinear frequency compression (NLFC) in hearing aids for young children with bilateral hearing loss. Methods: Sixty-four children aged between 2 and 7 years with bilateral hearing aids were recruited. Evaluations of cortical responses, speech intelligibility rating, consonant perception and functional performance were completed with the children wearing their personal hearing aids with conventional processing. The children were then refitted with new hearing aids with NLFC processing. Following a six-week familiarization period, they were evaluated again while using their hearing aids with NLFC activated. Results: The mean speech intelligibility rating and the number of cortical responses present for /s/were significantly higher when children were using NLFC processing than conventional processing in their hearing aids (p < 0. 05). Parents judged the children's functional real life performance with the NLFC hearing aids to be similar or better than that with the children's own hearing aids in both quiet and noisy situations. The mean percent consonant score was higher with NLFC processing compared to conventional processing, but the difference did not reach the 5 % significance level (p = 0. 056). An overall figure of merit (FOM) was calculated by averaging the standardized difference scores between processing schemes for all measures. Regression analysis revealed that, on average, greater advantage for NLFC processing was associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> at 4 kHz. Conclusions: Compared to conventional processing, the use of NLFC was, on average, effective in increasing audibility of /s/as measured by cortical evaluations, and higher ratings on speech intelligibility and functional performance in real life by parents.

40|$|Young {{listeners}} {{can quickly}} modify {{their interpretation of}} a speech sound when a talker produces the sound ambiguously. Young Dutch listeners rely mainly on the higher frequencies to distinguish between /f / and /s/, but these higher frequencies are particularly vulnerable to age-related hearing loss. We therefore tested whether older Dutch listeners can show perceptual retuning given an ambiguous pronunciation in between /f / and /s/. Results of a lexically-guided perceptual learning experiment showed that older Dutch listeners are still able to learn non-standard pronunciations of /f / and /s/. Possibly, the older listeners have learned to rely on other acoustic cues, such as formant transitions, to distinguish between /f / and /s/. However, the size and duration of the perceptual effect is influenced by hearing loss, with listeners with <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> showing a smaller and a shorter-lived learning effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{reviews the}} {{cochlear}} histology from four hearing preservation cochlear implantation experiments conducted on 73 guinea pigs from our institution, and relates histopathological findings to residual hearing. All guinea pigs had normal hearing prior to surgery and underwent cochlear implantation via a cochleostomy with a silastic-platinum dummy electrode. Pure tone auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds from 2 to 32  kHz were recorded prior to surgery, {{and at one}} and four weeks postoperatively. The cochleae were then fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified, paraffin embedded, and mid-modiolar sections were prepared. The treatment groups were as follows: 1) Systemic dexamethasone, 0. 2  mg/kg administered 1  h before implantation, 2) Local dexamethasone, 2 % applied topically to the round window for 30  min prior to cochlear implantation, 3) Local n-acetyl cysteine, 200  μg applied topically to the round window for 30  min prior to implantation, 4) inoculation to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) prior to implantation, and 5) untreated controls. There was a significant correlation between {{the extent of the}} tissue reaction in the cochlea and the presence of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), new bone formation and injury to the osseous spiral lamina (OSL). The extent of the tissue response, {{as a percentage of the}} area of the scala tympani, limited the best hearing that was observed four weeks after cochlear implantation. <b>Poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> at four weeks correlated with a more extensive tissue response, lower outer hair cell (OHC) counts and OSL injury in the basal turn. Progressive hearing loss was also correlated with the extent of tissue response. Hearing at 2  kHz, which corresponds to the region of the second cochlear turn, did not correspond with loco-regional inner hair cell (IHC), OHC or SGC counts. We conclude that cochlear injury is associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>hearing</b> early after implantation. The tissue response is related to indices of cochlear inflammation and injury. An extensive tissue response limits hearing at four weeks, and correlates with progressive hearing loss. These latter effects may be due to inflammation, but would also be consistent with interference of cochlear mechanics...|$|R
