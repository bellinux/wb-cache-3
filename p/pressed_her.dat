5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
25|$|HMS Sartine was a French {{merchant}} vessel from Bordeaux. The French Navy <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> into service on 3 August 1778 {{to assist in}} the defense of Pondichéry. The British captured her during the Siege of Pondicherry (1778), and took her into service under her existing name. HMS Sartine foundered in action off Calicut in November 1780.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Chotusitz, Frederick learned that the French had begun secret moves toward a separate peace with Austria. Hoping to cement his own gains in Silesia, he, too, began renewed peace talks with Austrian negotiators, held again in Breslau. Frederick now demanded the whole of Silesia, {{as well as the}} County of Glatz, concessions which Maria Theresa was reluctant to make; however, the British envoy, Lord Hyndford, <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> to make peace with Prussia and concentrate her forces against the French. The British treasury had financed much of Austria's war effort through cash subsidies, and Hyndford threatened now to withdraw Britain's support if Maria Theresa refused to give up the Silesian War for lost. The two belligerents eventually reached an agreement in the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, which ended the First Silesian War.|$|E

25|$|He {{was in a}} {{position}} to deal with Nicholas II every day, living in the same headquarters train with the Tsar. He was increasingly pessimistic about the outcome of the war for Russia but he could not assert any influence over Nicholas II who only trusted his wife Alexandra Feodorova who disliked Sergei Mikhailovich and had listed him among her enemies. The Tsarina following the rumors of corruption that had clouded Sergei’s reputation had <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> husband to make Sergei Mikhailovich resign from the artillery department. The scandal over the bribes did not die down in the last period of Imperial Russia and Grand Duke Sergei spent nearly all his time at Stavka. He became more cautious in an attempt to distance himself from Kshessinskaya, who had used him in her quest for financial profit. About the outcome of the war, Grand Duke Sergei had no hope.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara was so keen on Gaelic {{football}} that at {{one point}} she <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> father to found a women's team, and professed that Glenmalure Park, the home ground of the Rovers, became [...] "like a second home". She enjoyed fighting, and trained in judo as a teenager. She later admitted that she displayed a jealousy towards boys in her youth and the freedom they had, and that they could steal apples from orchards and not get into trouble.|$|E
500|$|Winehouse and Ronson {{contributed a}} cover of Lesley Gore's [...] "It's My Party" [...] to the Quincy Jones tribute album Q Soul Bossa Nostra {{released}} 9 November 2010. Winehouse and drummer Questlove of The Roots had agreed to form a group but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together: Salaam Remi had already created some material with Winehouse {{as part of the}} project. According to The Times, Universal Music <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> for new material in 2008, and Winehouse as of 2 September had not been near a recording studio. In late October Winehouse's spokesman was quoted as saying that Winehouse had not been given a deadline to complete her third album, for which she was learning to play drums.|$|E

500|$|Warner made no {{pretense of}} {{faithfulness}} to his wife, Ann, and kept {{a series of}} mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these [...] "girlfriends" [...] was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a [...] "startling" [...] resemblance to Warner's second wife. [...] The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> husband to terminate the affair. [...] Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast. [...] In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. [...] In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: [...] "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak." ...|$|E
500|$|The Admiralstab ordered Hertha, {{which had}} been on a {{training}} cruise for naval cadets, to join Dresden off Mexico. Bremen was also recalled to reinforce the German naval contingent; after arriving, she was tasked with transferring European nationals to German HAPAG liners. Dresden and the British cruiser [...] rescued 900 American citizens trapped in a hotel in Vera Cruz and transferred them to American warships. The German consul in Mexico City requested additional forces, and so Dresden provided a landing party of a maat (Junior Petty Officer) and ten sailors, armed with two MG 08 machine guns. On 15 April 1914, Dresden steamed to Tampico on Mexico's Caribbean coast. That month, the German-flagged merchant ship [...] arrived in Mexico, carrying a load of small arms for the regime of Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. The United States had put an arms embargo into effect in an attempt to reduce the violence of the civil war. The US Navy intercepted Ypiranga on 21 April. Dresden arrived, confiscated the merchantman, and <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> into naval service to transport German refugees out of Mexico. Despite the American embargo, the Germans delivered the weapons and ammunition to the Mexican government on 28 May.|$|E

2500|$|On January 25, 1917, Rossland, moored at Nakusp, sank at the dock. [...] Either her hull seams {{had opened}} or {{the weight of}} ice and snow on her decks and house had <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> down so far that water poured in through ports {{that had been left}} open. [...] She sank quickly, heeled over sharply on her port side, with the water up to the pilot house. [...] Rossland was raised in March 1917. [...] Her long-time master, Captain Forslund, bought her hull used it as a wharf boat for his place south of Needles.|$|E
2500|$|While Sir Cosmo faced tough {{criticism}} during cross-examination, {{his wife}} had it slightly easier. Dressed in black, with a large, veiled hat, she told the court she remembered little {{about what happened in}} the lifeboat {{on the night of the}} sinking, due to seasickness, and she could not recall specific conversations. Lawyers did not seem to have <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> very hard. Lucy Duff-Gordon noted that for the rest of her husband's life he was brokenhearted over the negative coverage by the [...] "yellow press", during his cross-examination at the inquiry. The final report by the inquiry determined that the Duff-Gordons did not deter the crew from any attempt at rescue through bribery or any other method of coercion.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the manuscript written by Clum, Boyer {{said he had a}} copy of a manuscript that Josephine prepared with the help of two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. Wyatts' cousins <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> for details about her personal life before and while living in Tombstone, but she was evasive. Josephine wanted to keep her and Wyatt Earp's tarnished history associated with Tombstone private and sanitize anything that could be seen negatively. [...] She finally consented to share that upon returning to Arizona, she believed Johnny Behan was going to marry her, and was disappointed and disillusioned when he repeatedly delayed the wedding. In her version of events, she said years later that she lived with a lawyer while working as a housekeeper for Behan and his ten-year-old son, Albert. Boyer argues that she actually lived with Behan. Boyer warns readers of [...] "her ‘little-old-lady’ attempts to tell only the decorous and proper." [...] Interviewers said she was often [...] "difficult" [...] to interview.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, {{she told}} Norman Ross, [...] "Children {{should have a}} {{wonderful}} childhood. I have not had it – I wish I had." [...] On the other hand, biographer Petsalis-Diomidis asserts that it was actually Evangelia's hateful treatment of George {{in front of their}} young children which led to resentment and dislike on Callas's part. According to both Callas's husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato, Callas related to them that her mother, who did not work, <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> to [...] "go out with various men", mainly Italian and German soldiers, to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas [...] "managed to remain untouched", but Callas never forgave Evangelia for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her by her mother. In an attempt to patch things up with her mother, Callas took Evangelia along on her first visit to Mexico in 1950, but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments, and after leaving Mexico, the two never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Evangelia lambasting Callas's father and husband, Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> {{to bring an action}} for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon she said to him [...] "Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife.|$|E
