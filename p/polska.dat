5|$|Soon after {{forming the}} Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the Polish Military Organisation (<b>Polska</b> Organizacja Wojskowa), {{which served as}} a {{precursor}} Polish intelligence agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (<b>Polska</b> Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (<b>Polska</b> Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E
5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia <b>Polska</b> (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Polish artists {{also worked}} abroad, outside of {{occupied}} Europe. Arkady Fiedler, based in Britain with the Polish Armed Forces in the West {{wrote about the}} 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. Melchior Wańkowicz wrote about the Polish contribution to the capture of Monte Cassino in Italy. Other writers working abroad included Jan Lechoń, Antoni Słonimski, Kazimierz Wierzyński and Julian Tuwim. There were artists who performed for the Polish forces in the West {{as well as for}} the Polish forces in the East. Among musicians who performed for the Polish II Corps in a <b>Polska</b> Parada cabaret were Henryk Wars and Irena Anders. The most famous song of the soldiers fighting under the Allies was the Czerwone maki na Monte Cassino (The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino), composed by Feliks Konarski and Alfred Schultz in 1944. There were also Polish theaters in exile in both the East and the West. Several Polish painters, mostly soldiers of the Polish II Corps, kept working throughout the war, including Tadeusz Piotr Potworowski, Adam Kossowski, Marian Kratochwil, Bolesław Leitgeber and Stefan Knapp.|$|E

25|$|The public {{postal service}} in Poland is {{operated}} by Poczta <b>Polska</b> (the Polish Post). It was created on 18 October 1558, when King Sigismund II Augustus established a permanent postal route from Kraków to Venice. The service was dissolved during the foreign partitions in the 18th century. After regaining independence in 1918, Poland saw the rapid {{development of the}} postal system as new services were introduced including money transfers, payment of pensions, delivery of magazines, and air mail. The government-owned enterprise of Polish Post, Telegraph and Telephone (<b>Polska</b> Poczta, Telegraf i Telefon) was established in 1928.|$|E

25|$|The Mint of Poland (Mennica <b>Polska)</b> in Warsaw was {{selected}} for the job and accepted it. Coins dated 2000 were struck in Warsaw and transported via Ukraine to Transnistria in trucks belonging to the Transnistrian Republican Bank.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Polska</b> Mennica (Mint of Poland) {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by stating that because the Transnistrian ruble is not internationally recognized as a currency, they were in fact producing tokens (and not coins), which is normal business for mints.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Polish {{community}} in Chernivtsi {{dates back to}} the late 18th century, when authorities of the Habsburg Empire encouraged Poles to move to Bucovina. By mid-19th century, several Polish organizations existed in the city, including Bratnia Pomoc and Czytelnia <b>Polska.</b> On initiative of publishers of the Gazeta <b>Polska</b> daily newspaper, collection of money for the construction of Polish House was initiated. In early 20th century, two Polish activists, doctor Tadeusz Mischke and judge Jakub Simonowicz purchased a house. In 1904, its expansion was initiated. It was carried out by architect Franciszek Skowron, interior decorator Konrad Górecki and sculptors from Zakopane, Skwarnicki and Gerasimowicz. The expansion was completed in 1905, and Polish House operated until World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Polish People's Republic (<b>Polska</b> Rzeczpospolita Ludowa) was {{established}} {{under the rule}} of the communist Polish United Workers' Party.

25|$|After Poland's defeat Zakulski {{joined the}} {{underground}} Military Organization Lizard Union (Związek Jaszczurczy) {{due to his}} prewar contacts in the Organizacja <b>Polska.</b> In the Podgórze district where he lived, on 3 March 1941 the Nazis created Kraków Ghetto on the orders of Gauleiter Hans Frank. Some 15,000 Jews were removed from {{their homes in the}} district of Kazimierz – the main spiritual and cultural centre of Kraków Jewry – and crammed into an area of Podgórze previously inhabited by 3,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The People's Republic of Poland (<b>Polska</b> Rzeczpospolita Ludowa) {{was officially}} proclaimed in 1952. In 1956 {{after the death}} of Bolesław Bierut, the régime of Władysław Gomułka became {{temporarily}} more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under Edward Gierek, {{but most of the time}} persecution of anti-communist opposition groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Soviet Bloc.|$|E

25|$|Polish {{historian}} Anna Cichopek {{stated in}} her university master's degree thesis later published {{as a book}} that all historical sources confirmed this one death. However, she also noted that in an archival photo of a funeral there were five coffins visible, thus suggesting that {{there might have been}} five fatalities; she also claimed in her book that The New York Times in 1946 had noted a death of a man (Anszel Zucker), and <b>Polska</b> Agencja Prasowa noted a death of another unknown woman (in addition to Róża Berger) and five wounded.|$|E
