This teaching toolkit was created {{as part of a}} £ 250, 000 commission from regional development agency One North East and Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre) to design resources for secondary school students on solar thermal energy, encouraging them to engage with science and technology subjects and consider careers in the renewable energy sector. Taylor developed the form of the teaching pack based on peer feedback collected from a cross-subject working group of secondary school teachers, who participated in detailed reviews of each stage of the design development - from initial concepts through to testing pilot resources, and reviewing the final design for production. Responding to the working group's identification of failings in previous teaching packs, Taylor's design for the delivery format incorporated detailed teaching plans and interactive exercises designed for delivery via electronic whiteboard, enabling instant 'out-of-the-box' integration into existing schemes of work in the form of individual lessons, subject-specific themed delivery over multiple lessons, or delivery as a cross-subject project throughout an entire school term - ensuring complete flexibility and ease of delivery.

The major activities in 2009 included field work, data analysis and presentations. The results of 2009 field work were presented at the 4 th International Congress of Fire Ecology and Management, Savannah, GA from November 30 to Dec 5, 2009 and at the Cape Sable seaside sparrow (CSSS) Fire Meeting, held at the Krome Center, Homestead, FL on December 8, 2009. Field sampling was conducted between March 23 and June 3, 2009, during which we resurveyed 234 sites: 191 Census sites, 3 sites on Transect B, 7 sites on Transect D, and 33 sites on Transect F. The number of sites sampled in 2009 was higher than in any previous year, primarily because {{a large number of}} sites burned in Mustang Corner fire and three other wild fires in 2008 were included in 2009 sampling.

40|$|Although {{recent years}} have seen an {{increasing}} focus on collaboration within language documentation projects, {{there has not been}} a commensurate push to create software that allows project members to efficiently work together. While some software, such as SIL’s FieldWorks suite, does support limited multi-user capabilities, they are often inadequate for the needs of teams whose members are technologically or geographically separated from each other. As a result, projects must resort to workarounds that are either error-prone (e. g. trust-based file access restrictions) or massively redundant (e. g. repeatedly copying the entire <b>project</b> <b>folder</b> as a backup). Similar obstacles to collaborative efforts are found in software development, where projects often require developers in different locations to edit the same files concurrently. To enable such collaboration, software developers have created VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS that can track, manage, and even undo every change made to a project. Traditionally, these systems use a client-server model that requires developers to connect to a network and then check files into and out of a centralized repository. Within the last decade, however, developers have begun to use DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS (DVCS), which use a decentralized peer-to-peer model rather than a client-server one. Instead of checking files out of a centralized repository, developers using DVCS typically clone a whole repository onto their own computer, make changes to the clone, and then later merge it back into the original repository. This distributed design allows for more flexible project structures, while still retaining the major benefits of traditional version control systems, such as file histories and the ability to roll back undesirable changes. The current presentation examines how DVCS such as Mercurial ([URL] ([URL] and Chorus ([URL] can be used to manage data for language documentation projects. Two features of DVCS are especially beneficial in this regard. First, DVCS tools are generally data agnostic, which allows projects to continue using their preferred linguistics software (e. g. Toolbox or FLEx), while still gaining the aforementioned benefits of version control systems. Second, the peer-to-peer structure of DVCS allows project members to continue collaborating even in the absence of a common network. DVCS therefore helps satisfy the recent call for more collaboration within language documentation, without requiring the development of entirely new linguistics software suites...|$|E

40|$|The current {{hierarchical}} folder {{system has}} long been found limited causing various difficulties in organizing and re-finding information on personal computers. Many alternative prototypes have been proposed to replace the current folder system. However, past empirical studies consistently observed that people prefer browsing folders in re-accessing information and only use searching as the last resort. Recognizing the complexity and our limited understanding of personal information organization and retrieval behavior in computer folders, my study was aimed to explore what people need from folders and the affordances and limitations of folders in the different stages of organization and retrieval, and furthermore provide implications for system design. Improved understanding on personal information organization and retrieval on computers is especially important today when personal information management (PIM) has entered public domain and the boundary between personal information management systems and general information systems becomes blurred. This multiple-case study investigated the participants??? information organization and retrieval behavior in their computer folders at four stages: keeping and discarding, organizing, re-organizing, and re-accessing. The difficulties they had at each stage were identified, and their computer folder structures and contents were analyzed. The participants include six PhD students and six administrative staff in an academic institution, with the former group representing the ???research??? end {{and the other one}} close to the ???administrative??? end in the activity spectrum proposed in (Bondarenko & Janssen, 2005). The data collection instruments include two rounds of in-depth semi-structured interviews, information re-access task observations, disk scans of several folders, and emails reporting re-access difficulties. The use of the two distinct groups of participants together with the multiple data sources and data collection methods provided rich and varied data for exploration {{and at the same time}} increased the opportunity to do triangulation in data analysis. The specific research questions include: 1) how do people keep and discard information items on computers, and what are on some people???s ???messy??? computer Desktops or in some ???messy??? folders? 2) From an integrative view, how do people organize information in computer folders, and what difficulties do they have in doing this? 3) What are the folder structures and contents like? 4) How do people re-organize folder structure and what difficulties do they have in doing this? 5) What are the tasks and strategies of re-accessing information on personal computers, and what difficulties do they have in re-accessing information? The result implies that: 1) people need an in-between mechanism for keeping or not keeping, as well as for discarding or not discarding a particular information item; 2) behind all the idiosyncratic folder creation behaviors, four elements are identified in how the participants organize information based on Hj??rland's typology of four views: rationalism, empiricism, pragmatism, and historicism; 3) the study identified two extreme types of folders in a spectrum ??? ???genre folders??? with no interfile relationships and ???<b>project</b> <b>folders???</b> with complicated relationships between files, which can be partly attributed to the impact of using folders as workplaces. With all the three types of relationships identified in PREMIS observed in various ???<b>project</b> <b>folders???</b> or folders close to this end, this study found that the various derivative relationships between files and/or groups of files led to the greatest difficulties for participants in finding and identifying files; 4) Behind the general browsing and search behaviors in folders, this study observed a re-access strategy similar to faceted navigation. The content analysis of the re-access difficulty examples reveals that the four FRBR tasks (finding, identifying, selecting and obtaining) in searching and making use of bibliographies and library catalogues also exist in information re-accessing on personal computers. This helps to define the ???re-access??? behavior on personal computers, and suggests the importance of the other tasks in addition to ???re-finding??? information...|$|R

Wilsdon. 2001) The overarching aim of the Digital Futures project {{was to investigate the}} complex web of issues surrounding e-commerce and sustainable development, and recommend ways in which government and business could maximise the sustainability benefits, and minimise the costs, of the emerging digital economy. The project drew together a consortium of government departments, companies, think-tanks and research organisations. Its formal activities ran from 1 October 1999 to i March 2001, and consisted of three main phases: Phase 1 (i October iQQQ- f 1 January 2000) -A detailed scoping paper was prepared on the key issues relating to e-commercea nd sustainable development. -A consortium of think-tanks and research organisations was established to undertake research into the various aspects of the debate. -Fifteen corporate partners were recruited to support the project, and participate in the research process. -UK Government support and funding was obtained for Phases 2 & 3. Phase 2 (1 February- 15 September 2000) -Each of the eight research organisations was commissioned to produce a detailed paper on a particular theme. -Detailed research was carried out using a variety of methodological approaches (desk-based analysis, interviews, opinion polling etc.) -Project partners in government and business were actively involved in the research to ensure it reflected a diversity of views. Phase 3 (i 6 September 2000 - 1 March 2001) -A series of workshops were held with project stakeholders, to discuss the research findings of Phase 2. -The eight research reports were edited into a book. -A summary report was written, drawing out the main conclusions and recommendations. -A one-day conference was held on 1 March 2001 for 200 decision-makers from government, business, academia and the voluntary sector. My role within the project was that of overall co-ordinator and editor of the book and summary report. I was also the lead researcher on one of the eight research themes. Whilst the project was underway, and in the year that has elapsed since its formal completion, I have been reflecting on the lessons learned. This report is a critical commentary based on that process of reflection. It consists of an introduction to the project, an outline of its aims, objectives and methodology, an account of the project's main activities, and full details of the project's results and conclusions.

Email overload has been estimated to be costing a loss of productivity in the U. S. of millions or even billions of dollars due to time spent reading, organizing and saving emails. As stated in New York Times in 2007 by Steve Lohr, 2 ̆ 2650 billion figure is {{an estimate of the}} cost of unnecessary interruptions in terms of lost productivity and innovation 2 ̆ 2. These interruptions which add to the information overload problems is a total of several activities that technology workers perform in their business day such as email, instant messaging, blogs, etc. In 2005 Bellotti, Moody, 2 ̆ 6 Whittaker stated 2 ̆ 2 it is used by millions of people to carry out their business each day 2 ̆ 2 (p. 2). 	Research studies have demonstrated different ways in which people use email. There have been studies done on the way people use email, manage their email, classify, store and retrieve email. Prior research has identified two different types of strategies used by people that use email. Researchers have named these two groups in slightly different ways; filers and pilers, prioritizers and archivers, no-filers and filers, cleaners and keepers (as cited in Tungare, M., 2 ̆ 6 Pérez-Quiñones, M. A. 2009). Other studies of email users have identified a trend where people will take time and organize their emails on a regular basis, or people will not and just leave emails in their in boxes. 	Nathan Zeldes a computing productivity manager from Intel states {{one of the biggest problems}} he thinks leads to over emailing, is 2 ̆ 2 mistrust 2 ̆ 2 (Overholt, 2001). Managers feel the only way to find out what is really happening is to be included in almost every email so they can find out what they need to know. Nathan 2 ̆ 7 s answer to the overload of emails being sent led him to create a class where co-workers at Intel learn proper techniques to manage their emails. These techniques are listed below and are called 2 ̆ 2 The 10 Commandments of Email According to Intel 2 ̆ 2 (Overholt, 2001). The 10 Commandments of Email According to Intel: 	 1. Don 2 ̆ 7 t use your inbox as a catchall folder for everything you need to work on. 	Read items once, and answer them immediately if necessary, delete them if 	possible, or move them to project-specific folders. 	 2. Set up a 2 ̆ 2 Five Weeks Folder 2 ̆ 2 that deletes its content automatically after five 	weeks. 	Use it as a repository for messages you 2 ̆ 7 re unsure about, such as that email 	you want to delete, but you 2 ̆ 7 re not sure if the guy 2 ̆ 7 s going to call you tomorrow and 	ask about it. 	 3. Assist colleagues 2 ̆ 7 inbox-filtering efforts by agreeing on acronyms to use in 	subject lines that quickly identify action items and other important 	messages. 	Sample acronyms: 3 ̆c AR 3 ̆e, Action Required; 3 ̆c MSR 3 ̆e, Monthly 	Status Report. 	 4. Send group mail only when it is useful to all recipients. Use 2 ̆ 2 reply-to-all 2 ̆ 2 and 	 2 ̆ 2 CC: 2 ̆ 2 	buttons sparingly. 	 5. Ask to be removed from distribution lists that you don 2 ̆ 7 t need to be on. 	 6. To cut down on pileup, use the 2 ̆ 2 out-of-office 2 ̆ 2 feature of your email, in 	addition to your voice mail, to notify people when you are traveling. 	 7. When possible, send a message that is only a subject line, so recipients don 2 ̆ 7 t 	have to open the email to read a single line. End the subject line with 3 ̆c EOM 3 ̆e, 	the acronym for End of Message. 	 8. Graphics and attachments are fun, but they slow down your ability to download 	messages when you 2 ̆ 7 re on the road. Use them sparingly. 	 9. If you 2 ̆ 7 re sending an attachment larger than 5 MB to a large group of recipients, 	consider putting it on the company 2 ̆ 7 s Web site or intranet instead. 	 10. Be specific. If you send a 20 -page attachment, tell the recipient that the 	important information is on pages 2 and 17. (Overholt, 2001) 	According to the user feedback from the employees at Intel, the tips and techniques are effective. They have also seen the quality of emails from other co-workers improved. 	 	Through field research, surveys, and observation this study will try to identify patterns or a series of patterns or themes commonly used by people within an office setting to sort/organize their email. These patterns or themes will be the basis for creating a taxonomy of the predefined hierarchical folder structures for storing emails. This study approach is intended to help users that do sort and organize their emails, define a folder structure in which they can sort their email into. This predefined structure will be designed for a specific user role, (but in the future could be adopted by other roles). The structure will be set up so that it can be easily learned and adapted. Once learned the decision of where to store an email, what level to store it, what name or naming structure should be used to name the folder should a new folder be created or not. Also will the name a user uses make sense to the user in the future so to enable a trigger that will provide a cue as to what email is stored or saved in this folder? These types of decisions will not be needed with this proposed taxonomy, allowing a simpler less cognitively taxing solution. 	Upon the completion of the ethnographic study a final folder structure will be proposed. This structure will be tested against the following research questions: 	RQ 1 : Does having a predefined folder structure speed up the process of sorting 	emails that need to be saved or deleted? 	RQ 2 : Does having a predefined folder structure improve the accuracy in 	recalling the placement of the emails within the identified folder taxonomy? 	The first part of the study used ethnographic field study and observations techniques. These data collection techniques included participant observations, interviews, and questionnaires. The second part used the empirical method to derive a conclusion. The study collected data through experimentation and the formulation and testing of the hypotheses. 	In the ethnographic filed study participants were recruited by word of mouth to take part in a study. A total of 5 IT professionals were selected to take part; three males and two females. To start, the participants were asked to create a picture of where they send and receive emails from. A series of direct and open-ended questions were asked to each participant. These question and answer session was video taped for later reference. Once an interview was completed a card sorting exercise was done to see how this sample population would sort and organize their emails. The participants were asked to sort a series of 75 cards. After the completion of the field study it was decide to use the following folder structure to test. The folder structure that was tested was created from the following folders: Archive, Projects, Personal and To Do 	The empirical study was conducted using a total of ten participants. The participants were recruited by word of mouth over a week period. Once the participants were identified they were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups. One of the groups was classified as the Treatment Group 1 Pre - Assigned Named Folders (PA). This was the group that was given a folder structure to test. The other was Group 2 they were the Self Named Folders (SN) group. This group was not provided any folder structure so they needed to create their structure from scratch. 	The time-on-task was tracked for each participant the test and results are summarized below (Figure 1. Data Analysis Summary). After the completion of the task the users were asked to complete a 20 question survey. The survey was to acquire qualitative data on their preferences of the task they had just completed. The last 11 questions were used to test recall of placement of files within the folder structure. Figure 1 : Data Analysis Summary 	 	The results showed that having a predefined folder structure did have a significant, positive impact on time-on-task. The findings seem to indicate that having the folder structure in place, for a specific user group had a significant difference in the time it took to complete the task. All the participating users had no problem, objections or request to use additional folders to sort the emails into the provided folders. The results also showed that having a predefined folder structure did have a significant impact on accuracy in recalling placement of email for Group 1 Pre - Assigned Named Folders (PA). The study observed that a longer amount of time-on-task was needed and a high error rate occurred for Group 2 Self Named Folders (SN). 	Users struggle to deal with the increased amount of received email in their in-box. This study looked at a way to provide a small target population a way to simply sort and organize their email. As one participant explained that had a high number of folders said, 2 ̆ 2 I could not keep up with filing emails 2 ̆ 2. This study provided only four different locations in which to look for emails. As another participant explained the down side of a large folder structure 2 ̆ 2 I had 257 folders: It started to get too confusing trying to decide which folder to place it in. Would it go in this one or that one, and then I still could never find it. 2 ̆ 2 Also observed was one participant that identified them self as someone that save all or almost all emails and had over one hundred folders. Even though they spent a lot of time organizing their folders they had still had a <b>project</b> <b>folder</b> with over a thousand emails in it the one folder. This user still had to rely on the applications ability to sort and search for emails. The multiple folders made the participant repeat the same search method over and over with in multiple folders instead of just one. 	 	The results also showed that having a predefined folder structure did have a significant impact on accuracy in recalling placement of email for Group 1 Pre - Assigned Named Folders (PA). The study observed that a longer amount of time-on-task was needed and a high error rate occurred for Group 2 Self Named Folders (SN). This is similar to the results studied by Boardman 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) that showed the current way in which people organize and maintain their email is expensive in terms of cognitive effort and time. The findings identified that one of the most common errors observed by Group 2 Self Named Folders was the ability to recall the placement of an email. 	During the ethnographic field study the biggest problem that was observed was time. If someone did take the time to organize and sort their emails in to multiple folders using a self created hierarchical folder structure it took an incredible amount of time to manage it. Also if someone did sort and organize emails into multiple folders they usually ended up not being able to keep up with the constant flow of incoming emails so they would abandoned sorting and organizing. They would try and do it similar to a spring cleaner, rereading larger amount of emails at one time and try and organize and delete emails in one overall long session taking several hour if not days to complete. 	What type of criteria does a user use to process or archive their email? Most user saved emails that contained important information that they felt they would need later. The data showed that the users in Group 1 (PA) had a 4. 46 times greater percentage of recalling the placement of a email then the users in Group 2 (SN). Would participants be willing to use the predefined folder structure? When asked on the post test survey if they would use this structure during a normal work day? The results showed that the users in Group 1 (Pre - Assigned Named Folders (PA) 3 out of the 5 participants said they either agreed or strongly agreed with this question. 	Overall the folder structure worked well, people in Group 1 were able to learn the purpose of each folder and sort the emails from the task in a very fast time. The folder structure that was tested was created from the following folders: Archive, Projects, Personal and To Do. The results of this study suggested a possible solution for future investigation of applying this taxonomy to different job roles. The findings are clearly targeted toward a small population and neglect a larger population of working professionals. Any future research should investigate different populations or work roles. Also, research should complete studies of a longer duration and if possible a larger test population to strengthen the results of future studies. The way in which we manage it is an important subject that needs continuous research. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bellotti, Moody, 2 ̆ 6 Whittaker. (2005).

In this paper we study the frequency of folders used by 140 k Github projects and use regression analysis to model how folder use {{is related to the}} extent of forking. We find that the standard folders, such as document, test, and example, are not only among the most frequently used folders, but their presence in a project increases the chances that a project code will be forked (i. e., used by others), and increases the number of such forks. This preliminary study of folder use suggests the opportunities to quantify (and improve) file or-ganization practices in large collections of repositories...|$|R

When operated in a testbed environment, it also supports uplinking these SCMF files to the testbed via Chill. This software features a free-form textural sequence editor featuring syntax coloring, automatic content assistance (including command and argument completion proposals), complete with types, value ranges, unites, and descriptions from the command dictionary that appear as they are typed. The sequence editor also has a "field mode" that allows tabbing between arguments and displays type/range/units/description for each argument as it is edited. Color-coded error and warning annotations on problematic tokens are included, as well as indications of problems that are not visible in the current scroll range. "Quick Fix" suggestions are made for resolving problems, and all the features afforded by modern source editors are also included such as copy/cut/paste, undo/redo, and a sophisticated find-and-replace system optionally using regular expressions. The software offers a full XML editor for RML files, which features syntax coloring, content assistance and problem annotations as above. There is a form-based, "detail view" that allows structured editing of command arguments and sequence parameters when preferred. The "project view" shows the user s "workspace" as a tree of "resources" (<b>projects,</b> <b>folders,</b> and files) that can subsequently be opened in editors by double-clicking. Files can be added, deleted, dragged-dropped/copied-pasted between <b>folders</b> or <b>projects,</b> and these operations are undoable and redoable. A "problems view" contains a tabular list of all problems in the current workspace. Double-clicking on any row in the table opens an editor for the appropriate sequence, scrolling to the specific line with the problem, and highlighting the problematic characters. From there, one can invoke "quick fix" as described above to resolve the issue. Once resolved, saving the file causes the problem to be removed from the problem view...|$|R

40|$|Great Bahama Bank (GBB) {{has long}} {{served as a}} {{frequently}} visited and well-studied example of a flat-topped, isolated carbonate platform. As such, GBB stands behind much of our understanding of modern processes and products of carbonate sedimentation. The geological models derived from studies on GBB are commonly used to illustrate depositional facies variations and frequently serve as reservoir analogs. We have used Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery and an extensive set of water depth measurements to first critically evaluate the magnitude and patterns of bathymetry across GBB. We then integrated the seafloor sample data of Reijmer et al (2009) along with {{a small number of}} additional samples with the Landsat imagery compiled into ArcGIS and analyzed with eCognition to develop a depositional facies map that is more robust than previous versions. The new maps, in our opinion, can serve as a template for better characterizing GBB at all scales, highlight future research areas where 2 ̆ 2 ground-truthing 2 ̆ 2 is needed to further investigate facies patterns, and facilitate better use of this isolated carbonate platform as an analog for both exploration- and reservoir-scale facies analysis. As examples of information that can be extracted from the maps, we analyze the platform margins of GBB with respect to their orientation, examine the relationship between water depth and facies type, interrogate facies position and breadth across the platform top, and relook at the occurences of whitings relative to the distribution of mud on the platform. The geospatial data for GBB are compiled into a 3. 9 GB GIS database which is included on the DVD of this digital publication. The GIS contains raw data, interpretive products, and visualization examples that were produced during the development of the water depth and facies maps of GBB, including the Landsat TM imagery, DEM, images developed by combining layers in the GIS, and facies and whitings maps. In addition, the <b>Projects</b> <b>folder</b> of the GIS contains files that automatically display images, maps, and DEMs with an appropriate symbology in ArcGIS version 10. 1 (. mxd), ArcGIS Explorer version (Build) 1750 and 2500 (. nmf), and GlobalMapper version 14 - 1 (. wks).
