50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> is a {{fundamental}} principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the EU is a union of member states, and all its competences are voluntarily conferred on it by its member states. The EU has no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly agreed in treaties by all member states remain {{the domain of the}} member states.|$|E
50|$|Thus, a Staatenverbund is a {{supranational}} institution that may exercise sovereign acts (laws, coin money, etc.) {{but may not}} independently fix areas where it may exercise this power. In the EU, this is reflected by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> powers by member states, according to which {{the institutions of the}} European Union may not issue standards unless they are allowed to do so by the EU treaties.|$|E
50|$|Article 4 {{relates to}} member states' {{sovereignty}} and obligations. Article 5 sets out the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral,</b> subsidiarity and proportionality {{with respect to}} the limits of its powers.

Article 7 deals with the suspension of a member state and article 8 deals with establishing close relations with neighbouring states.|$|R

Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the EU's 'cosmopolitan foreign policy constitution' (e. g. based on Articles 2, 3 and 21 TEU and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) and the universal {{recognition of human rights}} require re-interpreting the 'rules of recognition' of EU and international law by 'balancing' state-centered rules and principles with the human and constitutional rights of EU citizens and the person-centered 'principles of justice' underlying EU constitutional law and multilevel human rights law. As EU law recognizes citizens as 'agents of justice', constituent powers and 'democratic principals' entitled to constitutional rights and 'strict observance of international law' (Article 3 TEU) also in the EU external relations, the transnational constitutional rights and multilevel judicial remedies protected by EU law must be construed as entitling citizens to transnational rule of law and corresponding duties of EU institutions to protect citizens and their rights also in international dispute settlement procedures (e. g. under UN, WTO, regional trade and investment agreements). The EU constitutional <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral,</b> subsidiarity, proportionality and access to justice for multilevel judicial protection of equal freedoms and 'strict observance of international law' are relevant context for interpreting EU obligations under UN, WTO and other treaty and dispute settlement systems for the benefit of EU citizens that must hold the limited 'constituted powers' of multilevel governance institutions more legally, democratically and judicially accountable in order to protect transnational public goods and rule of law inside the EU...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> {{of powers}} {{occupies}} {{a prominent place}} in the Lisbon Treaty. Not only is it stated as a fundamental and horizontal principle in the common provisions of the Treaty on the European Union (Art. 5 TEU). 2 For the first time utmost care {{has been given to}} lay down, in a Treaty text, also the modalities and the consequences of the application of this principle. 3 As such, a catalogue of competence is introduced in Articles 2 - 6 TFEU which lists the “categories and areas of union competence” (Title I TFEU) whilst spelling out the nature of the competences conferred to the Union in those fields, for instance exclusive, shared or complementary. Moreover, it is recurrently and firmly stated that powers which are not conferred to the Union by the Treaties are to remain with the Member States (a. o. Arts. 4 (1) & 5 (2) TEU). Especially those new additions in the Treaties are revealing of the currently prevailing political context whereby the Member States seek to get a renewed grasp on the formulation, interpretation and application of the Treaty <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral.</b> This can hardly be considered in isolation from the development of case law of the CJEU, who deftly asserts exclusive jurisdiction to interpret this key structural principle of EU law...|$|E
40|$|Resumé The thesis {{deals with}} the {{exclusive}} powers of the European Union {{with a focus on}} legislative competencies. It is composed of four chapters; while deriving from Czech and foreign literature it contains theoretical view enriched by decisions of The European Court of Justice/The Court of Justice of The European Union. The first chapter focuses on the powers of the EU generally; it explains the term power and includes also the origin of the powers from historical and constitutional point of view. Corresponding with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> explained in the chapter 1. 3, the will of the member states could be considered {{as the basis for the}} powers of the EU. The thesis deals also with the theory of implied powers and the flexibility clause. These are the ways to avoid the rigidity which might be represented by strict obeying the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral.</b> The following chapter offers an overview of other types of powers and hints to their particularities in comparison to the group of exclusive powers. We are finding out that in case of shared competencies the member states can take action unless the blocking effect of the European regulations is applied while in other cases the EU has only a supporting function. The last two chapters which could be considered as the most important ones focus specifically on [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Setting {{powers in}} the European Union is a {{particularly}} complex problem, given the heterogeneity of both the Union and how the sharing of the powers between the EU and its Member States. By the changes brought forth by the Treaty of Lisbon new provisions were introduced in the European Union Treaty (TFEU), clear areas of exclusive competence of EU are established, also areas of shared competence and areas of coordination and support actions of the Member States. The anterior shortcomings of the previous legislation are being surpassed by the Treaty provisions, as the previous texts did not clearly show the areas of Community competence, establishing only general characteristics of community action against Member States in some areas. The limits of Union competences {{are based on the}} allocation principle. The exercise of community competences is based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral,</b> the Union shall act within the powers assigned to it by the Member States to achieve the targets set.

The Court does not indicate what would happen in procedural terms if it were to find a provision of EU law in contradiction with Germany's constitutional identity or which would not respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral.</b> This writer's view is that the only correct way to solve such an issue would be for a Constitutional court to refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling on the invalidity of such a provision...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis is: The perspectives of harmonization of direct income taxes in the European Union. The reason for choosing this topic was firstly the current issue, which offers a wide scope for research and polemic over new approaches and solutions in the European and international tax law. The European Union is a supranational organization founded on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> of powers. The ideas of the approximation of the laws are not only its own, but occur throughout the world community, because thanks to the harmonization of certain legislation the benefits of international trade can maximize. The idea of exclusion from economic cooperation today is practically unrealistic. In the European Union the harmonization of laws {{is directly related to}} the development of the internal market. The European Union has a long-term goal to create a market that acts as a market of one country. The instrument of harmonization seeks to eliminate differences in legal systems so as not to impede the implementation of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market. Taxation is a very specific and also sensitive area. The area of taxation is traditionally perceived as a sovereign expression of state sovereignty. The aim of this thesis is the attempt to find the best solutions how to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{offers a}} {{detailed}} legal and policy {{analysis of the}} most far-reaching and already controversial measures presently envisaged by the reform of the EU Tobacco Products Directive, standardized packaging and visual display bans of tobacco products, under EU law. In line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - the former prohibits logos, colors, brand images, and promotional elements on packaging other than brand names displayed in a mandated size, font and place, whereas the latter forbids the display of tobacco products at points of sale. Although the analysis predominantly focuses on the adoption of EU-wide schemes mandating these measures {{within the framework of}} the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, it also discusses the legal implications stemming from the adoption of similar mechanisms at the national level. While the actual case law may effectively substantiate the EU's competence to embrace both standardized packaging and display ban, the introduction of these measures, by revealing the shifting nature of the EU overall tobacco policy from the free movement imperative to a public health objective, questions the almost limitless EU's authority to harmonize pursuant the internal market legal basis. In the light of the above, the article examines how these measures score not only under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> but also those of proportionality and subsidiarity as well as the trademark system and the fundamental rights regime. Once more, a legislative initiative in the field of tobacco is set to test, under the pressure of the relevant industry, the outer limits not only of EU's legislative action but also of its underlying decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|When {{we look at}} {{competition}} and markets {{at the international level}} we are used to investigating regulation of Business to Business (B 2 B), Business to Consumer (B 2 C) and Consumer to Consumer (C 2 C) relationships. In international economic law, in addition, questions focus on the regulatory framework that is applicable for cross-border transactions or how to create markets through regulation. Rarely has international law been investigated from a Business to Agency (B 2 A) or even Agency to Agency (A 2 A) perspective. In recent years, the “mushrooming” of agencies at European level triggers the importance of looking more closely into the relationship of the agencies towards each other. Is there a struggle over competences and regulatory objects and would such competition lead to desirable outcomes? In this paper I will first draft the divergent underlying concepts of agency competition in Europe and the USA. I will show that due to the historical development of administrative law in Europe and the USA, the perception of the desirability of agency competition differs (II.). I will then discuss with reference to pharmaceutical law whether these different perceptions of agency competition are reflected in European law. Indeed, EU law and regulation likewise tends to avoid competition. Agency competition, thanks to rather clear competences and governance procedures, agency competition remains being the exception in European pharmaceutical regulation. However, structural differences and failures remain. (III). Finally, I will conclude these findings and hint at the limits of the desired process for further coherence. I will conclude that although a move towards even more convergence in European risk regulation is desirable, it does have its limits set by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> in Art. 5 (1, 2) EU read in conjunction with the areas of shared competence and the one to support, coordinate and supplement (IV.) ...|$|E
