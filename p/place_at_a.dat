5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E

It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; scores of others were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> benefit {{concert at the}} Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967.

In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober.

5|$|Blue Shift {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and time frame as that of Half-Life, taking <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. As in Opposing Force, Blue Shift shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.|$|E
