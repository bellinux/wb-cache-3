Should we extend the ban on vote buying to tax-cut promises? This article will argue for three conclusions. The first <b>is</b> that tax-cut <b>promises</b> should <b>be</b> understood as a form of vote buying. The second <b>is</b> that campaign <b>promises</b> <b>are</b> a form of vote buying. The third conclusion <b>is</b> that campaign <b>promises,</b> including tax-cut <b>promises,</b> should not <b>be</b> banned. An important distinction is drawn between enforceable wrongful incentives and unenforceable wrongful incentives.

25|$|Under the {{covenant}} Yahweh has promised Israel {{the land of}} Canaan, but the <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> conditional: if the Israelites are unfaithful, they will lose the land. The Deuteronomistic history explains Israel's successes and failures {{as the result of}} faithfulness, which brings success, or disobedience, which brings failure; the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians (721 BCE) and the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians (586) are Yahweh's punishment for continued sinfulness.|$|E

25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{the doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original <b>promise,</b> <b>is</b> required. In Ajayi V.

(1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E

25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E

It argues for nuclear power as a safe energy source and an essential preventive of global warming. Pandora's <b>Promise</b> <b>is</b> a 2013 documentary film, directed by Robert Stone. It presents an argument that nuclear energy, typically feared by environmentalists, {{is in fact the}} only feasible way of meeting humanity's growing need for energy while also addressing the serious problem of climate change. The movie features several notable individuals (some of whom were once vehemently opposed to nuclear power, but who now speak in support of it), including: Stewart Brand, Gwyneth Cravens, Mark Lynas, Richard Rhodes and Michael Shellenberger. Anti-nuclear advocate Helen Caldicott appears briefly.|$|E

So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

25|$|Jacksonville is the 49th largest {{local radio}} {{market in the}} United States, and is {{dominated}} by the same two large ownership groups that dominate the radio industry across the United States: Cox Radio and iHeartMedia. The dominant AM radio station in terms of ratings is WOKV 690AM, which is also the flagship station for the Jacksonville Jaguars. In May 2013, WOKV began simulcasting on 104.5 FM as WOKV FM. There are two radio stations broadcasting a primarily contemporary hits format; WAPE 95.1 has dominated this niche for over twenty years, and more recently has been challenged by WKSL 97.9 FM (KISS FM). WJBT 93.3 (The Beat) is a hip-hop/R station, 96.9 The Eagle WJGL operates a Classic Hits format while its HD subchannel WJGL-HD2 operates an Urban CHR format under the moniker Power 106.1, WWJK 107.3 is an Adult Variety station.

500|$|The French {{expression}} , {{which is}} the equivalent of [...] "a <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> a promise" [...] in English, and to which Chose Promise responds, dates from the 17th century. After his first show Réflexions profondes sur pas mal de trucs (Profound reflections on quite a few things), written with Arnaud Joyet and inspired by a videotape of François Rollin, Tsamere met Rollin at the Dinard Comedy Festival. He joined Tsamere and Joyet to write a new show. Rollin had seen his previous show, which played on theatrical [...] "flops", and told Tsamere that he could not perform this humour as himself without showing at the end that he could really do ventriloquism and play the guitar, which he could not. Therefore, the character of a teacher was created to play on failure.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics of}} the {{movement}} assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> irresponsible. Televangelists are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations. Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles. For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the Apostle, who {{is believed to have}} experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. [...] Cathleen Falsani, religion writer in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings [...] "Jesus was born poor, and he died poor. During his earthly tenure, he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health. When he talked about material wealth, it was usually part of a cautionary tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Chad Orton notes {{it would}} be {{physically}} impossible for three boys to carry five hundred people across the river in two hours. [...] In actuality, the rescue party had several rescuers instead of three, eighteen {{of which have been}} positively identified as being at the Sweetwater crossing. [...] The rescuers brought ten rescue wagons in addition to the wagons the Martin company had with them. [...] Many survivors wrote about riding the wagons across. [...] However, because of time constraints, not everyone could ride the wagons. [...] Some were carried, but other survivors wrote that they crossed the river themselves or with the help of people other than the three boys. [...] The boys mentioned in the story did help some people across, but not [...] "nearly every member" [...] as reported in the mythologized version of the story. [...] While the three boys were among those that helped several across, the ages were wrong. [...] C. Allen Huntington was 24. [...] David P. Kimball was 17. George W. Grant was 16. [...] There is no medical evidence that they died from effects of the crossing, and most lived active and relatively long lives. [...] Outside of Kimball's account, there is no other account of Brigham Young promising everlasting salvation to the rescuers based on a single act. [...] Orton notes that such a <b>promise</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent with Mormon doctrine. [...] John Thomas notes that Solomon Kimball did not witness the crossing, but relied heavily on other sources, particularly Orson F. Whitney's 1888 account, who also claimed that all of the boys died from the event, even though Huntington was still alive in 1888.|$|E
