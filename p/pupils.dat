40|$|AbstractVisual stimuli that isolate <b>pupil</b> {{color and}} <b>pupil</b> grating {{responses}} in human vision {{have been used}} to investigate the properties of stimulus-specific <b>pupil</b> responses in the rhesus monkey. We measured and compared <b>pupil</b> responses to light flux increments, isoluminant chromatic stimuli, and gratings of equal and lower space-averaged luminance. The parameters investigated were luminance contrast and chromatic saturation. The results demonstrate clearly the existence of <b>pupil</b> color, <b>pupil</b> grating and <b>pupil</b> light reflex responses in the rhesus monkey. Comparison of <b>pupil</b> color and <b>pupil</b> grating responses of equivalent amplitude reveals similar onset response latencies. However, both are approximately 40 ms longer than the corresponding <b>pupil</b> light reflex latency. In general these <b>pupil</b> responses are qualitatively similar to those observed in humans. However, when compared to equivalent human data, <b>pupil</b> onset response latencies are some 80 – 100 ms shorter and the <b>pupil</b> shows more rapid recovery from constriction...|$|R

5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 <b>pupils</b> aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of <b>pupils</b> come from White British backgrounds and very few <b>pupils</b> speak English as an additional language. The number of <b>pupils</b> supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. <b>Pupils</b> are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large <b>pupils</b> of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit <b>pupils.</b> These slit <b>pupils</b> can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's <b>pupils</b> are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the <b>pupils</b> of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's <b>pupils</b> will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
