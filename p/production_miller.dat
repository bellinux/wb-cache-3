500|$|Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield: Michael is Lincoln's {{brother and}} worked as a {{structural}} engineer before devoting full-time to his brother's case. In order to save his brother's life, Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role [...] "would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false." [...] A week before the start of <b>production,</b> <b>Miller</b> auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring with his performance; he was cast the following day.|$|E
50|$|During <b>production,</b> <b>Miller</b> based {{the visual}} design {{on the work}} of El Greco. The {{interior}} design of the production was based on the interiors of the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino, whilst the street set was based on a real street in Cyprus. For the scene where Iago asks Cassio about Bianca, Othello stands behind the open door. Most of the scene is shot from behind him, so the audience sees what he sees. However, not all the dialogue between Iago and Cassio is audible. Although this led to criticism when the episode was screened in the US, where it was assumed that the sound people simply had not done their job very well, it was actually done so as to increase subjectivity; if Othello is having difficulty hearing what they are saying, so too is the audience. Bob Hoskins played Iago as a Rumpelstiltskin type, an impish troublemaker who delights in petty mischief and mocks people behind their backs.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, Cedric Messina had cast Robert Shaw to play Lear, with an aim to do {{the show}} during the second season, but Shaw died {{suddenly}} in 1978 before production could begin, and the play was pushed back. Jonathan Miller had previously directed a Nottingham Playhouse production of King Lear in 1969, starring Michael Hordern as Lear and Frank Middlemass as the Fool. In 1975, he remounted that same production for the BBC Play of the Month, a heavily truncated version, which {{happened to be the}} BBC's last Shakespeare production prior {{to the beginning of the}} Television Shakespeare. During his producership, Miller tried to persuade the BBC to use the Play of the Month production as their Lear, but they refused, saying a new production had to be done. At the end of the fourth season, Miller's last as producer, his contract stipulated that he still had one production to direct. In-coming producer Shaun Sutton offered him Love's Labour's Lost, but Miller wanted to do one of the three remaining tragedies; Lear, Macbeth or Coriolanus. He had never directed Macbeth or Coriolanus before, but he felt so comfortable with Lear that he went with it. However, the production was basically the same as his 1969/1975 version, with the same two leading actors, the same costumes design, the same lighting, and the same design concept. The only significant difference is that more of the text is used in the latter <b>production.</b> <b>Miller</b> utilised a [...] "board and drapes" [...] approach to the play; all interiors were shot on or near a plain wooden platform whilst all exteriors were shot against a cycloramic curtain with dark tarpaulins. As such, although exteriors and interiors were clearly distinguished from one another, both were nonrepresentational. To enhance the starkness of the look of the <b>production,</b> <b>Miller</b> had lighting technician John Treays desaturate the colour by 30 per cent. Miller also used colour to connect characters; the Fool wears white makeup which washes off during the storm, Edgar wears a white mask when he challenges Edmund to fight, and Cordelia wears white make-up after her death. Similarly, the Fool has red feathers in his hat, Edgar has a red tunic, and Cordelia's red welts on her neck stand out starkly against the white of her skin after her death.|$|E

Both sectors rely strongly on the output of the raw milk producers and have few sectors to sell their products. Outside of the cut sectors, these sectors will be challenged the most from this new policy. </p...|$|E
40|$|The thymus plays a {{critical}} role in adaptive im munity as the site of mature T cell <b>production</b> (<b>Miller,</b> 2011). The thymus grows rapidly dur ing early life, generating a large T cell repertoire. It then enters an involution process, leading to decreased production of naive T cells, resulting in impaired immune function in the elderly and preventing complete reconstitution of the im mune system in various pathologies (Boehm, 2008; Rodewald, 2008; Carpenter and Bosselut, 2010). The mechanisms controlling thymic in volution are poorly understood, hampering the development of therapeutic strategies to enhance immune function {{in a wide variety of}} patients (Napolitano et al., 2008; Sauce and Appay, 2011). Although the thymus is composed mostly of T lymphocytes, T cell development requires a complex microenvironment including endothe lial, dendritic, and thymic epithelial cells (TECs; Manley et al., 2011). TECs are highly prolifer ative during thymic expansion, and then their cell cycle slows considerably (Gray et al., 2007; Aw and Palmer, 2011; Manley et al., 2011). Re cent data show that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF; or FGF 7) and growth hormone treat ment in aged rodents and humans leads to tran sient thymic expansion and increased production of naive T cells (Min et al., 2007; Napolitano et al., 2008). In particular, increased TEC num bers were observed upon KGF treatment (Min et al., 2007; Rossi et al., 2007). IL 22 also can support thymic regeneration in mice after ra diation treatment (Dudakov et al., 2012). These data suggest that increased numbers of TEC...|$|E

30|$|Treatment of piñon-juniper {{woodlands}} {{for recovery}} of sagebrush communities {{is important because}} of habitat needs of sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other wildlife, biological diversity, soil stability, and sustainability of grazing <b>production</b> (<b>Miller</b> et al. 2005, Pierson et al. 2007, Davies et al. 2011). A main goal of western juniper control treatments is to maintain or increase perennial bunchgrasses because their abundance are key to preventing establishment of and dominance by non-native annual grasses (Miller et al. 2005, Chambers et al. 2007). In our study, western juniper control resulted in recovery (Fescue, NGBER sites) or a potential path to recovery (Bluebunch site) of native herbaceous understories within 5 years post-treatment. Sites with more intact understories appear able to recover within 5 years after treatment while sites with less intact understories likely require longer periods of time. An advantage to burning in the fall (SEP) and late spring (APR) was to reduce fuel loading created by the cut trees and to kill smaller junipers. When fuels were dry in the fall (September and October; NGBER and Bluebunch sites) and late spring, burning was effective at consuming fuel sizes up to 1000 -hr fuels; results that others have also measured (Bourne and Bunting 2011, O’Connor et al. 2013). In our study, native herbaceous recovery in the SEP and APR treatments was slightly less than or equaled recovery in the winter burning and CUT treatments. However, land managers {{need to be aware}} that herbaceous responses to burning late Phase 2 and Phase 3 woodlands in the fall (September and October) is often less predictable because of depleted understories and the potential for greater mortality of native vegetation, which may promote weed dominance (Tausch 1999; Bates et al. 2006, 2011, 2013; Condon et al. 2011). Under these circumstances, seeding and weed control is required to advance vegetation recovery (Cox and Anderson 2004, Miller et al. 2005, Sheley and Bates 2008). To reduce the risk of weed dominance, winter or pile burning of cut trees may provide better guarantees of big sagebrush community recovery. There were benefits to winter burning treatments (JAN, MAR) with greater perennial bunchgrass recovery. However, there is a tradeoff with winter burning in that small junipers remain and fuels reduction only consumes, at most, 1 -hr and 10 -hr fuel types. Woodlands that are cut with trees left on site (CUT) or burned in the winter or early spring will require additional control of juniper saplings to maintain big sagebrush plant communities.|$|E
40|$|Reseach ArticleMule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), elk (Cervus elaphus), {{and cattle}} share rangelands {{throughout}} much of interior western North America. Considerable debate exists about {{the degree to which}} facilitation or competition occurs for forage between these three species (Nelson 1982, Wisdom and Thomas 1996, Miller 2002). Prior cattle grazing can have beneficial effects on elk nutrition. The removal of forage by cattle can improve forage quality by enhancing regrowth of forage or by changing ratios of live to dead plant material (Cook 2002), and forage quality on elk winter ranges in the interior Northwest can be improved by cattle grazing in the spring (Anderson and Scherzinger 1975, Clark 1996). To date, however, studies have not shown enhancement of forage quality in the summer following late spring or early summer grazing by elk or cattle. Competition for forage between mule deer, elk, and cattle is probably greatest on winter and spring/autumn ranges (Nelson 1982, Wisdom and Thomas 1996), and minimal between wild ungulates and cattle during summer (Miller 2002). Most summer ranges for mule deer and elk are on large areas of public land containing a diversity of habitats and high potential for forage <b>production</b> (<b>Miller</b> 2002). On some summer ranges, however, competition for forage may exist in late summer and early fall because forage quality can be poor and not meet nutritional requirements of wild ungulates and cattle (Torbit 1985, Hanley et al. 1989, Cook 2002). This is especially evident in regions where summer drought is the normal part of the climatic regime (Vavra and Phillips 1980, Svejcar and Vavra 1985). On the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), northeast Oregon, competition for forage may occur in late summer among all three species, especially between elk and cattle (Coe et al. 2001, Stewart et al. 2002). Conditions at Starkey typify those on summer ranges shared by mule deer, elk, and cattle in forests of the interior western United States. Consequently, we conducted a manipulative experiment on Starkey summer range to evaluate the potential for competition or facilitation for forage among mule deer, elk, and cattle in grand fir (Abies grandis) forests. Our specific objectives were to determine diet composition, dry matter intake rates, and percent dietary overlap of all three species in response to prior grazing by elk and cattle. In this paper we focus on results obtained from the bite count data. A detailed analysis of the nutritional consequences of previous grazing by elk or cattle on subsequent diets of mule deer, elk, or cattle will be presented elsewhere (Damiran in prep.). Results from our study could improve range management for mule deer, elk and cattle on public land, especially with regards to allocating forage among these three species when ranges are shared in forested habitats (Ager et al. 2004) ...|$|E
