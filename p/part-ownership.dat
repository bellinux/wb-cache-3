25|$|Wilberforce is {{the main}} villain of Gideon Defoe's novel The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists, where his {{opposition}} to Darwin is based in his <b>part-ownership</b> of a circus freakshow. He feels that Darwin's discovery (depicted in this book as teaching a chimpanzee to talk using note cards) will take away from his attraction's popularity, which he uses to kidnap young women {{and turn them into}} soap, hence his nickname.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2008 global {{recession}} started, {{sales of}} the XL2 have been very slow. During 2011 the company shipped only two aircraft and none {{during the first two}} quarters of 2012. In late September 2012 the sale of 50 XL2s to the city of Wuhan, China was announced. In October 2012 the Chinese order was increased to 200 aircraft, with components being shipped to Wuhan for final assembly. Chinese interests may also purchase a <b>part-ownership</b> in the company.|$|E
25|$|Sharad Pawar {{is alleged}} to have demanded {{compensation}} for allowing the planned-city Lavasa to be constructed.

25|$|On {{his second}} try at the 1928 federal election, Chifley won the Division of Macquarie in the House of Representatives, which covered Bathurst, Lithgow, and the Blue Mountains. He was in general a {{supporter}} of the James Scullin government's economic policies, and in 1931 he became Minister for Defence. At the 1931 federal election, the Scullin government was defeated in a landslide and Chifley lost his seat on a 16-point swing to the UAP's John Lawson. During the Great Depression in Australia he survived on his wife's family's money and his <b>part-ownership</b> of the Bathurst newspaper the National Advocate.|$|E
25|$|In 1774, {{having given}} up the stage, he had his first {{literary}} success – a poem entitled The Tears of A Genius, occasioned by the Death of Dr Goldsmith which {{attracted the attention of}} the reading public, and from then onwards he was able to make a living by writing. By 1776 he had moved to Bath, where he entered into a <b>part-ownership</b> of a book-shop in Milsom Street with a partner of the name of Clinch. As with his previous professions, he soon decided that he was not suited to the life of a book-seller and returned to London within a few years. However he made many friends in Bath and became part of the fashionable Bath society, making the acquaintance of the famous actress Mrs Siddons, for whom he would later write leading character parts in his plays. He later fell out with Mrs Siddons after borrowing £500 from her husband and becoming offended when she asked him to repay it.|$|E
500|$|After the campaign, {{it emerged}} that Agnew {{had failed to}} report three alleged {{attempts}} to bribe him, made {{on behalf of the}} slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in Southern Maryland. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: [...] "Nobody sat down in front of me with a suitcase of money." [...] Agnew was also criticized over his <b>part-ownership</b> of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over Chesapeake Bay. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.|$|E
500|$|Raymond's [...] "police daily strip," [...] {{named after}} its central {{character}} - J. Remington [...] "Rip" [...] Kirby - debuted on March 4, 1946, conceived (and initially scripted) by King Features editor Ward Greene. The plotting of the strips {{is harder to}} attribute, the scant evidence available supporting the notion that Raymond was more than simply an illustrator. However, as was relatively commonplace on such strips, published credit went to Raymond, whose name was the major selling feature; the artist even managed to gain a <b>part-ownership</b> deal with King and a better split of the profits than was usual. Rip Kirby was Raymond's reintroduction to newspaper strips after the war, and he was quick to forge a new [...] "up-to-date" [...] style for the strip, while keeping ties to the audience he had built up with Flash Gordon, Jungle Jim, and Secret Agent X-9.|$|E
500|$|In a subplot, Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{drops off}} a {{temporary}} liquor license renewal at the Snakehole Lounge nightclub, where the owner Freddy (Andy Milder) tells him {{they are seeking}} investors who can buy a share for $10,000. Although {{he does not have}} the money, Tom reveals <b>part-ownership</b> in a nightclub is a longtime dream of his, so he seeks assistance from his fast-talking friend, Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), who contributes $5,000. Tom has $4,000 of his own but still needs $1,000, so he seeks further help from his co-workers. Donna (Retta) expresses an interest, but decides against it when she meets Jean-Ralphio, of whom she immediately declares, [...] "I hate that guy." [...] Meanwhile, when Andy's (Chris Pratt) band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson) tells Andy he can no longer live with him, April (Aubrey Plaza) helps Andy look for an apartment. They find one near her house, prompting a smitten April to note that they can carpool to work together. But when Andy learns Tom needs $1,000, he forgoes the apartment to give Tom the money as a gift. April is surprised by the choice and disappointed with the result. In the episode's final scene, Tom is shown enjoying his nightclub part ownership, until he learns Donna has bought three shares herself.|$|E
2500|$|On July 17, 1996, News Corporation—which {{separated}} {{most of its}} entertainment holdings into 21st Century Fox in July 2013—announced that {{it would}} acquire New World in an all-stock transaction worth $2.48 billion; the merger deal also included rights to the LMA with KDFI (the New World Communications name continues in use as a licensing purpose corporation [...] for KDFW and its sister stations under Fox ownership, extending, from 2009 to 2011, to the former New World stations that Fox sold to Local TV in 2007); In January 1997, as other network-owned stations around the United States began adopting similar network-driven branding, KDFW-TV shortened its branding to simply [...] "Fox 4" [...] under the network's branding conventions (with its newscasts concurrently rebranding as Fox 4 News). The purchase by News Corporation was finalized on January 22 of that year, folding New World's ten Fox affiliates into the former's Fox Television Stations subsidiary, making them all owned-and-operated stations of the network. At that time, Channel 4 became the second English language network-owned commercial station in the Dallas–Fort Worth market; Viacom, then-owner of that network's Dallas station KTXA (channel 21, now an independent station), acquired <b>part-ownership</b> of UPN in 1996. It {{was also one of}} two stations that switched to Fox under the New World agreement that replaced an existing Fox O, only to later be sold to the network itself (in Atlanta, sister station WAGA had earlier replaced WATL as that market's Fox station in December 1994), making Dallas {{one of a handful of}} markets more than one station has served as an O of the same network.|$|E

A few months were passed in coast-trading, during which interval Shadrach wore off the land-rust that had accumulated upon him in his grocery phase; and in the spring the brig sailed for Newfoundland.|$|E
6000|$|The next visitor, who {{appeared}} {{half an hour}} later, was the terrier dog of the station. Bounce belonged, of right, to David Bowers, but, being amiable, it acknowledged the <b>part-ownership</b> of all the men. On suddenly beholding Jeff, it rushed {{at him with a}} mingled bark and squeal of joy, and thereafter, for full two minutes, danced round him, a mass of wriggling hair from tip of tail to snout, in uncontrollable ecstasy. Mingled misery and surprise at Jeff's sudden and unaccountable disappearance, prolonged agonies of disappointed expectation, the sickness of heart resulting from hope long deferred, all were forgotten in that supreme moment of joy at reunion with his long-lost human friend! ...|$|E

50|$|Mezzanine finance {{effectively}} secures a company’s debt on its equity, {{allowing the}} lender to claim <b>part-ownership</b> {{of the business}} if the loan is not paid back on time and in full.
