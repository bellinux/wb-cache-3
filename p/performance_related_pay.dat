50|$|Academic {{evidence}} has increasingly mounted indicating that <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay</b> {{leads to the}} opposite of the desired outcomes when it is applied to any work involving cognitive rather than physical skill. Research funded by the Federal Reserve Bank undertaken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with input from professors from the University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon University repeatedly demonstrated {{that as long as the}} tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay</b> works as expected. However once rudimentary cognitive skills are required it actually leads to poorer performance.|$|E

At first, family and non-family firms show no difference regarding the adoption of PR pay. However, among PR pay adopters, we find family firms to devote greater shares to this pay component, thus sacrificing part of their socioemotional wealth {{in order to meet}} stakeholders’ demand. A differentiation between different types of family firms reveals that especially true family firms, i. e. firms managed or owned by at least two family members, account for this particular behavior...|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: The {{case for}} profit sharing has {{attracted}} much recent attention, and the UK Spring Budget of I 987 offered tax relief on 'profit-related pay'. Nevertheless, economic {{research on the}} issue has been predominantly theoretical (Blanchflower and Oswald (I 987 b) and Estrin et al. (I 987) provide surveys). Weitzman (I 983; I 984; I 987) and Meade (I 986) have been especially influential. The object {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, in Section I the Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys (WIRS) of I 980 and I 984 are used to calculate the extent of income-sharing schemes in Great Britain. Second, Section II attempts to test the hypothesis that profit-related pay produces greater company prosperity. As claimed in a recent Green Paper: Profit <b>Related</b> <b>Pay</b> schemes should lead to a closer identification of employees with the companies in which they work [...] . The most important consequence [...] . is likely to be enhanced competitiveness and better business <b>performance.</b> (Profit <b>Related</b> <b>Pay,</b> I 986, Cmnd. 9835, p. 3) Section III examines tabulated evidence on the growth rate of, and quality of industrial relations within, sharing and non-sharing establishments. This was simulated by, inter alia, the following sentence taken from the Green Paper: The Government believes that the spread of Profit <b>Related</b> <b>Pay</b> would be beneficial [...] . for industrial relations, for productivity, for growth and for employment.

50|$|This paper, which {{proposed}} tournament theory, {{looks at}} <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay.</b> Under conventional systems workers are paid a piece rate - {{an amount of}} money that relates to their output, rather than the time they input.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the motivational effects {{in a sample}} of Romanian {{employees}} in private companies that implement pay for performance programs of one of the characteristics of these programs, namely pay dispersion, and on the potential mediating role of organizational justice in these effects. To this aim, we examined the relationships between the amounts of pay dispersion introduced by the respective financial incentive system, employee perceptions of distributive and procedural justice, work motivation, and base salary, respectively. The results of the data analysis, performed through structural equation modeling, support our hypotheses concerning the positive effect of <b>performance</b> – <b>related</b> <b>pay</b> dispersion on motivation and the mediating role of the two dimensions of organizational justice in this effect. Larger financial rewards allocated by the financial incentive system for high performers increase employee perceptions of distributive and procedural justice, which, in turn, foster work motivation. Base salary was also found to influence pay dispersion, as well as perceived distributive justice...|$|R
40|$|Agency theory {{assumes a}} {{potential}} {{conflict of interest}} between principal and agent. Principals provide incentives to agents to influence agents' behaviour {{in the interest of}} the principal. In practice, incentive systems are dominanted by financial incentives and consist of fixed and <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> variable <b>pay.</b> Empirical studies concentrated on the analysis of the sensitivity of variable pay. Most studies found very low values which were considered too low to have any incentive effect. This paper tries to give a theoretical answer to the empirical puzzle of low incentive factors. In the first step, we show that low values of the incentive factor occur if high environmental uncertainty, high risk aversion by the agent and/or high opportunity costs for the agent exist, In the second step, we show that investments in information gathering by the principal to reduce uncertainty lead to higher incentive factors as well as higher returns for the principal. The magnitude of improved returns is shown by assuming various information cost functions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} on productivity of Performance-Related Payments (PRP) and unions, and examines to what extent heterogeneity between firms characterises these influences. Design - For the Italian economy, the study presents firm-level quantile regressions for Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and controls for various observed characteristics of firms, worker composition and labour relations. Findings - The paper shows the significant effect of PRP and unions on the whole economy and on firms operating in the manufacturing industries. In these industries, the uniform incentive effects of PRP but the increasing impact of unions are estimated along the productivity distribution. Conversely, the role of management - significant in all sectors- is more efficacious in prospering large firms operating in services. Research limitations – The adoption of PRP schemes {{and the presence of}} unions maybe endogenous to firms’ productivity, and our estimates do not prove causal links but simply suggest correlations. Practical implications - The limited incentive effects of PRP schemes in services contribute towards explaining the slowdown in Italian productivity, whereas the role of unions is quite uniform among sectors. Originality- The paper addresses the hitherto poorly developed issue of firm heterogeneity and TFP, and offers the first Italian study of PRP and unions, which covers all dimensional classes of firms and non-agricultural sectors of the Italian economy. <b>Performance</b> – <b>related</b> <b>pay,</b> productivity. ...|$|R

5000|$|Employees {{would be}} secure {{in knowing that}} their {{performance}} was evaluated objectively according to the standard of their work instead of the whims of a supervisor, or against some ever-climbing average of their group. It is quite normal to put new starters towards {{the bottom of the}} pay band and, subject to normal performance, to move them up to the midpoint (market target) within 3 to 5 years. [...] Some unethical managers will suppress salaries by offering cost of living rises instead of true progression through the pay scale. This gives short term savings but, in the longer term leads to low morale, low performance, and even employee resignations after they have been trained. All very costly to the business.

Labour movements believe that a {{higher standard}} of living can actually be achieved by paying higher wages. Unfortunately higher wages are demanded and paid at the expense of productivity which is a vital ingredient for economic growth and ultimately economic survival. Employers within the South African economy can address the low productivity ratios through the implementation of <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> schemes.

40|$|Performance {{appraisal}} and its frequent link to <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay</b> is {{a controversial}} {{practice in the}} management of employee performance. This paper examines performance appraisal from the perspective of four Australian unions covering diverse occupations and industry sectors. Only one union supports the notion of <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay.</b> The others find performance appraisal difficult to embrace. Negative experiences and consequent problems lead them to argue that the process is complicated and usually puts workers at a disadvantage. It appears that any change in union attitude depends on their role in the performance appraisal and <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> <b>pay</b> process. Moreover, the imperfect power balance between management and employees means that union participation must be on a genuine basis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to propose a novel data {{analysis}} approach, ‘Analysis of Characterizing Phases’ (ACP), that detects and examines phases of variance within a sample of curves utilizing the time, magnitude and magnitude-time domain; and to compare the findings of ACP to discrete point analysis in identifying <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> factors in vertical jumps. Twenty five vertical jumps were analyzed. Discrete point analysis identified the initial-to-maximum rate of force development (p =. 006) and the time from initial-to-maximum force (p =. 047) as <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> factors. However, due to inter-subject variability in the shape of the force curves (i. e non-, uni- and bi-modal nature), these variables were judged to be functionally erroneous. In contrast, ACP identified the ability to: apply forces for longer (p <. 038), generate higher forces (p <. 027) and produce a greater rate of force development (p <. 003) as <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> factors. Analysis of Characterizing Phases showed advantages over discrete point analysis in identifying <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> factors because it: (i) analyses only related phases, (ii) analyses the whole data set, (iii) can identify <b>performance</b> <b>related</b> factors that occur solely as a phase, (iv) identifies the specific phase over which differences occur, and (v) analyses the time, magnitude and combined magnitude-time domains...|$|R
