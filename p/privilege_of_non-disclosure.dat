Indeed, these groups fulfil {{a particular place}} within society, which is among other things manifested {{by the fact that}} they are subject to a code of confidentiality and the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure.</b> Although the main thrust of this article is on their contribution to the rule of law, this article will also highlight the various manifestations of administrative mechanisms borrowed from the civil service system and how these two professionals execute the law. The article presents shortly each one of them tasks, professional standards and the legal framework. After the introduction of each professions, there is a discussion of a number of factors that may influence the execution of the law. Thirdly, the article gives an overview of their contribution. Finally, attention is paid to their Romanian and European organisation within Chambers, Unions and European Union Councils...|$|E
40|$|The {{normative}} {{concept of}} transparency, {{along with the}} open government laws that purport to create a transparent public system of governance promise the world—a democratic and accountable state above all, and a peaceful, prosperous, and efficient one as well. But transparency, in its role as the theoretical justification {{for a set of}} legal commands, frustrates all parties affected by its ambiguities and abstractions. The public’s engagement with transparency in practice yields denials of reasonable requests for essential government information, as well as government meetings that occur behind closed doors. Meanwhile, state officials bemoan the significantly impaired decision-making processes that result from complying with transparency’s sweeping and powerful legal mandates, and complain about transparency’s enormous compliance costs. This article argues that the frustrations with creating an open government originate in the concept of “transparency” itself, which fails to consider the tensions it conceals. The easy embrace of transparency as a basis for normative and utilitarian ends evades more difficult questions: When is transparency most important as an administrative norm? To what extent should an agency be held to that norm? Open government laws fall short in answering these questions because, relying on the assumptions of “transparency,” they typically operate at exceptionally high levels of abstraction. As a result, they establish both broad mandates for disclosure and broad authority for the exercise of a state <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure,</b> and they ultimately fail to produce an effective, mutually acceptable level of administrative openness. Transparency theory’s flaws result from a simplistic model of linear communication which assumes that information, once set free from the state that creates it, will produce an informed, engaged public that will hold officials accountable. To the extent that this model fails to describe accurately the state, government information, and the public, as well as the communications process of which they are component parts, it provides a flawed basis for open government laws. The article critiques the assumptions embedded in transparency theory and suggests an alternative approach to open government laws that would allow a more flexible, sensitive means to evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} information disclosure. It also proposes institutional alternatives to the current default regime in open government laws, which relies on weak judicial enforcement of disclosure mandates, and offers substantive suggestions that would improve efforts to establish a more accountable state and informed public...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{in the law}} of controverted {{elections}} is {{the subject}} of the present article. The author begins with some general observations. Firstly, according to section 52 of the provincial Controverted Elections Act, the rules of evidence are those of the law of England in force on the first of July 1867, or in other words, the common law of Parliament. These rules of evidence can hardly be of any assistance to our courts because at that time, disputed elections were tried by the House of Commons or its committees and decided in a thoroughly unjudicial manner. Secondly, the author describes briefly the grounds that may be alleged in an election petition, namely the ineligibility of the elected candidate, corrupt practices by the candidate and irregularities affecting the legality of the election. In the first part, the author examines the burden of proof. In all cases the onus for establishing the material fact of the corrupt practices or the noncompliance with the rules contained in the Election Act rests upon the petitioner. If the corrupt practices alleged in the petition are substantiated, the court must set aside the election unless the respondent establishes that the action is of no gravity and could not have affected the result of the election. On the other hand, an election will not be declared void by reason of transgressions of the law if the court is satisfied that it was conducted in accordance with the existing election law, and that the mistake or noncompliance did not affect the outcome of the election. The second part discusses the method of establishing facts and proof of their possible effect on the result of the election. As to presumption, for instance, the author examines the solution adopted by the courts when the number of unqualified voters exceeds the majority of the elected candidate and finds that invalidation of such an election may not be always justified. Finally, in the third part, the author analyses various clauses regarding the secrecy of the ballot. In federal law and in the law of the English-speaking provinces the privilege respecting the secrecy of the vote is judicially recognized and cannot be waived. In Quebec, a voter cannot be compelled to reveal for whom he has voted but he can be asked the question. In the United States, the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> belongs only to qualified voters, and the illegal voter can be compelled to disclose for whom he has voted. Rules of evidence regarding controverted elections are not well adapted to our times ; furthermore some sections of the ElectionAct and the Controverted Elections Act are not understood by our courts. The legislator should modify these statutes and make their language more precise in order to achieve completely and successfully the electoral reform now in progress...|$|E

40|$|This study {{makes an}} {{inventory}} of several aspects of the representation and assistance in tax matters. The study {{is divided into two}} parts: the first part (part A) is about the social position of the providers of representation and assistance in tax matters in the Netherlands; the second part (part B) contains the legal analyses. In this summary I only write down some of my main conclusions. The Dutch autorities provide insufficient financial means for those who cannot afford, but are still depending on the assistance by tax consultants. This concerns mainly the group of people who have had no or very little education. There is hardly paid any attention to the representation and assistance in tax matters in the Dutch tax laws themselves. For a good understanding of the matter one should look into various laws, in particular into the Dutch Civil Code. Futhermore {{there is a lot of}} – sometimes not so clear - caselaw. We need a clarification of the relation between the rules in the tax laws and those in the Civil Code. Also should there be a more consistant use of terminology. Futhermore the – currently different - regulations regarding representation in the relation with the serveral tax autorities and in court, should be adapted to one and other. In the Netherlands there is in general no obligation for tax payers to be represented by tax lawyers. In my opinion there is no reason to chance this. An obligation to be represented for example in court, would be a barrier to the access of the judge, mainly because of the (high) costs of it. In case of a workoverload of the Dutch supreme court (‘Hoge Raad’), such could however be an exemption which justifies obligated legal representation. The main reason why there no possibility of government contibution in case of assistance by tax experts, such as tax consultants, is the lack of a statutory regulation of the profession of the tax consultant. The introduction of a statutory regulation, can however also have disadvantages, such as government intervention. That is why I do not want a statutory regulation of the profession of tax consultant as such, but rather the recognition by law of the current organisations of tax consultants. In the Netherlands tax consultants do not have the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure.</b> In my opinion there is no good reason to refuse them this privelege, when the profession of tax consultant is legally recognized by means of the recognition by law of the current organisations of tax consultants. An exeption should be made for the situation of tax fraud. For this exeption could be linked to the recent legislation of the reporting of unusual transactions (‘Wet melding ongebruikelijke transacties’) ...|$|E
40|$|Information {{exchange}} between patients and health professionals {{is fundamental to}} achieving patient participation in decision-making and shared decision-making is said to require the exchange of "all information relevant to decision-making". This paper reports on a qualitative investigation of instances in which information that was potentially relevant to decision-making was not exchanged in consultations. Consultations from 5 diverse clinical areas in the UK were video-recorded and the health professionals and patients involved were interviewed separately before and after their consultations. This analysis is based on cases involving 20 patients. It draws on data from their 26 -recorded consultations and from the 137 associated interviews. Several strategies were used to identify instances in which patients and/or health professionals did not disclose information that was potentially relevant to decision-making. Analysis focussed on the types of information not disclosed, the reasons that health professionals and patients gave for non-disclosure, and the apparent or potential significance <b>of</b> the <b>non-disclosure.</b> We identified 34 instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information relating to the patient's problem and 52 instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information relating to treatment or management options. The types of information not disclosed were diverse and the reasons given for non-disclosure varied. Some, but not all, instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> had negative implications {{for the quality of}} decision-making and/or the patient's healthcare experience. Our findings have implications for future attempts to examine information exchange in consultations [...] whether for research or for professional assessment purposes. In particular, they highlight the importance of appraising instances <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information in context and of recognising the limitations of approaches that rely on single consultations and/or single perspectives for assessments of information exchange.

40|$|Drawing from a {{baseline}} sample of a cohort study, the study examines {{the extent and}} correlates <b>of</b> serostatus <b>non-disclosure</b> to sex partners and family members, and reasons for non-disclosure among HIV-infected pregnant women in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. This longitudinal cohort study recruited 1709 pregnant women living with HIV who attended three of the largest maternity centres in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, for delivery between September 2015 and May 2016. Relevant items on demographics, serostatus awareness, disclosure to sex partners and family members, and lifestyle behaviours were obtained using structured interviews. Age-stratified binary logistic regression models {{were used to determine}} the significant correlates <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> among the participants. A higher rate <b>of</b> HIV serostatus <b>non-disclosure</b> to sex partners (25. 6 %) in comparison to family members (20 %) was reported by the participants. Younger age, not living with partners and alcohol use were significantly associated with <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners. <b>Non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners was significantly (p< 0. 05) associated with poor adherence to the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), failure to keep clinic appointments and high viral load at the delivery of the baby. Perceived fear of intimate partner violence, fear of rejection, guilt of not disclosing {{at the onset of the}} relationship, sex partner's <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus, and guilt of unfaithfulness were some of the reasons for <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus to sex partners. <b>Non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> HIV serostatus is a public health concern with serious implications for both mother-to-child transmission, as well as horizontal transmission, in our setting.

40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{presented}} that examine disclosure of sensitive information and personalization in Internet-based surveys. In the first study, {{the impact of}} a personalized salutation on two forms <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> to a sensitive personal question (salary level) is tested. The results revealed that a personalized salutation tends to increase levels <b>of</b> active <b>non-disclosure</b> (measured through use of an I prefer not to answer option), but not passive non-disclosure (where the respondent selects no option). In the second study, participants are directed to the study via either a personalized URL (which incorporated an encoded identifier not obvious as such to the responder) or via a secure log-on page that required the user to type in identifying information. Non-disclosure to a sensitive question (salary) was significantly higher when participants went through a log-on procedure. We suggest that this pattern <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> to sensitive questions reflects increases in identifiability when a personalized salutation or logon procedure is used. We further suggest that the provision <b>of</b> an active <b>non-disclosure</b> option to a sensitive question is particularly appropriate in contexts in which anonymity may be compromised, since it enables participants to both protect their privacy and respond appropriately to the survey...|$|R

40|$|Objective: One of the {{indicators}} {{critical to the}} success of violence reduction programmes among female sex workers (FSWs) is the pattern of disclosure of violence. This study examines the rate <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> violence among FSWs in India by perpetrators of violence and programme exposure. Methods: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study conducted among FSWs in 2009 across four states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The analytical sample included 1341 FSWs who experienced physical violence in past six months. Multilevel logistic regression stratified by state was conducted to examine predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-disclosure.</b> Results: About 54 % of FSWs did not disclose their experience of violence to anyone with considerable variations in the pattern of disclosure across states. Another 36 % of FSWs shared the experience with NGO worker/peer. Compared to violence perpetrated by paying partners/stranger, that by non-paying partner were twice more likely to report non-disclosure (53 % vs. 68 %, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1. 8, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1. 3 – 2. 4). Similarly, FSWs who were not registered with an NGO/sex worker collective were 40 % more likely to report <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>of</b> violence against those registered (58 % vs. 53 %, AOR: 1. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 1. 9).
