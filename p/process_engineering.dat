40|$|Abstract—Typical complex {{software}} and systems engineering projects involve {{a set of}} different engineering disciplines and therefore heavily rely on systems integration approaches. Service-oriented architecture and Enterprise Service Bus provide a valuable basis for systems integration; however often depend on tedious manual work or invasive and therefore inflexible adaptations in case of even minimal changes to <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> or <b>engineering</b> tools. In this paper we describe the Engineering Service Bus (EngSB), an integration platform which not only integrates tools and systems, but also provides a bridge between <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> and existing <b>engineering</b> tools. We evaluate the EngSB by implementing a standard software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> for multi-engineering environments. Major results were that the EngSB allows for non-invasive and flexible integration of well-established tools in multi-engineering environments, while enabling the integration to {{take place on the}} level of <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> Keywords-(software+) <b>engineering,</b> non-invasive integration, component-based architectures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Today’s systems {{integration}} technologies enable {{the integration of}} (software+) engineering environments to support <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> across domain and tool boundaries. These <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> heavily rely on manual configuration of integration frameworks, resulting in costly, time-consuming, and error-prone human work. In this paper, we introduce an extended model-driven approach for the automated derivation of integration technology configurations for supporting <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> This allows both an efficient and effective derivation of initial configurations, as well as easy adaptations of existing configurations in case of changed <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> Based on a standard software <b>engineering</b> <b>process,</b> we show the feasibility of the proposed approach and discuss the advantages and limitations for software(+) engineering...|$|R
25|$|The {{middle ground}} between the craft {{production}} of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and knowledge transfer, which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer {{their way out of}} their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on employment and employability is an externality.|$|E
