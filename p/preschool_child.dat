40|$|Objectives : To {{determine}} the average weight and height and {{the prevalence of}} overweight or obesity and thinness in <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of the Southwestern highlands of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and compare them with their counterparts living at lower altitudes. Methods : A cross-sectional study of 559 <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> aged 12 - 71 months born and living permanently at high altitude, and 463 <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of comparable age born and living permanently at low altitude. For each child at high and low altitude, age was recorded and weight and height were measured. Weight for height Z-score with WHO standards was used for an assessment of normal weight, overweight or obesity and thinness. Results : The highland <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> {{were found to be}} significantly heavier and taller than their counterparts living at low altitude. 92. 1 % of all highland <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> and 67. 6 % of lowland <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> were found to have normal weight (p < 0. 0001). Overweight or obesity was insignificantly greater among <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of the highlands (2. 3 %) compared to the <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of the low lying areas (0. 9 %) (p< 0. 7). Thinness was significantly more prevalent among <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of the lowlands (31. 5 %) than <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> of the highlands(5. 5 %) (p< 0. 0001). At both high and low altitude, {{there were no significant differences}} in the prevalence of overweight or obesity and thinness between boys and girls. Conclusion : The findings of this study indicate that thinness is a major nutritional problem among lowland <b>preschool</b> <b>children.</b> This may be attributed to the prevailing tropical environmental conditions on the health of children at low altitude...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the communication attitude of Slovenian <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who stutter by means of the Communication Attitude Test for <b>Preschool</b> and Kindergarten <b>Children</b> who Stutter (KiddyCAT), and to determine whether differences in communication attitude existed among <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who stutter, and their peers who are fluent speakers. In addition, the test’s discriminant value, its internal reliability and the factors underpinning the Slovenian version of the KiddyCAT were explored. Methods and Procedure: Data were gathered on a normative sample of 49 <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who stutter and 74 who do not stutter. The children were divided into two subgroups according to age: a ‘’younger’’ (3 to 4, 4 years old) and ‘’older’’ (4, 5 to 6 years old) group. Outcomes and Results: Results showed that <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who stutter scored statistically significantly higher on the KiddyCAT than <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who do not stutter. The effect size was large. A mean increase in scores among the <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who stutter was observed, but was not statistically significant. An opposite observation, again not significant, was made for <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> who do not stutter. Also gender did not affect the test results.

Arm span was known to be an alternative anthropometric parameter to height. Ration between height and arm span varied in different race, age, and sex. Aim: The study was aim to know the ratio between height and arm span in toddlers and <b>preschool</b> <b>children.</b> Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with observational analysis. This research was held in March-May 2015. The subject was toddlers and <b>preschool</b> <b>children</b> age 1 - 5 years. Height and arm span data was acquired by doing measurement to subjects. Statistical test used linear regression test. Results: The number of subjects were 197 children aged 1 - 5 years.
