25|$|While in {{the first}} years, theorists were eager to claim that RHIC has {{discovered}} the quark–gluon plasma (e.g. Gyulassy & McLarren), the experimental groups were more careful not to jump to conclusions, citing various variables still in need of further measurement. The <b>present</b> <b>results</b> shows that the matter created is a fluid with a viscosity near the quantum limit, but is unlike a weakly interacting plasma (a widespread yet not quantitatively unfounded belief on how quark–gluon plasma looks).|$|E

60|$|Our only {{conclusion}} is that the psychological conditions which begat the ancient narratives produce the new legends. These surprise us by the apparent good faith in marvel and myth of many otherwise credible narrators, and by the coincidence, accidental or designed, with old stories not generally familiar to the modern public. Do impostors and credulous persons deliberately 'get up' the subject in rare old books? Is there a method of imposture handed down by one generation of bad little girls to another? Is {{there such a thing}} as persistent identity of hallucination among the sane? This was Coleridge's theory, but it is not without difficulties. These questions are the <b>present</b> <b>results</b> of Comparative Psychological Research.|$|E
