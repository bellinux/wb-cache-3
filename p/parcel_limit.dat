40|$|New Zealand has a legal 3 D cadastre, and {{has done}} since the {{inception}} of its cadastral survey and tenure systems around 150 years ago. However, the digital representation of the cadastre is 2 D with 3 D situations handled via static plan, section and elevation images and supporting textual information. Work is currently underway to develop a 3 D digital cadastre that will enable the 3 D spatial extents of property rights, restrictions and responsibilities to be captured, validated, lodged, integrated with existing data, visualised, and made available for use in other systems. This article presents the approach that is being promoted by regulators of New Zealand’s cadastral survey system in discussions with suppliers of land administration systems. Previous research concluded that the most appropriate way for New Zealand to develop a 3 D digital cadastre is to build upon its existing system. The 2 D digital cadastre would continue to be the default layer with 3 D situations incorporated as and where necessary. To enable this requires a new approach to handling parcels defined in 3 D. The representation of a 3 D parcel as a spatial object is being proposed to allow <b>parcels</b> <b>limited</b> in height to be integrated into the digital cadastre and subsequently maintained. While the authors discuss how New Zealand’s digital cadastre may be transitioned to 3 D, it is suggested that the generic nature of spatial objects could be applied to other jurisdictions. For this reason, the international appeal of the approach is considered as other jurisdictions and providers of software applications may benefit from New Zealand’s efforts...|$|R

If an entity could {{stop the flow of}} information they could delay or inhibit innovation. For example, in PARCEL the network of games manages the exposure of ideas to the solver population. Ideas with merit get more exposure spreading the idea further. A malicious solver could mark good ideas as poor to prevent their being seen. However, in the face {{of tens of thousands of}} solvers such an attack has almost no impact. If PARCEL chooses solvers randomly for the dissemination of an idea, even a large subgroup trying to suppress an innovation could only reduce the exposure an innovation gets, not eliminate it. Rather than a random dissemination, PARCEL would attempt to maximize its benefit by sharing the innovation with experts and near experts in the target knowledge domain. In fact, a workable radical idea that bucks the status quo could easily be suppressed by experts who myopically assume it will never work.

The model's simplicity notwithstanding, a set of six selected model parameters could not be fully identified from existing observations at one station.

Estimations of the covariance matrix based on (a) second order partial derivatives of a quadratic cost function at its optimum and (b) Monte Carlo simulations exploring the whole space of parameter values gave consistent results. Diagonalisation of the covariance matrix yielded two linear parameter combinations that were most effectively controlled by data from periods with and without lack of silica, respectively. The two parameter combinations were identified as the essential inputs that govern the successful simulation of intermittently decreasing chlorophyll a concentrations in summer.

40|$|The tidal {{interface}} or {{inter-tidal zone}} {{is that part}} of the coastal zone that falls between the extremes of Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) and Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT). It is an area of considerable interest and diverse human activity. The tidal interface possesses significant economic and commercial value {{while at the same time}} being a sensitive and delicately balanced environment. A number of competing and sometimes complementary rights, restrictions and responsibilities from private, public and commercial interests interact in the inter-tidal zone. The administration and governance of these interests in an equitable and sustainable manner is a complex and challenging task. Virtually all activities in the tidal interface are spatially governed. More often than not, the defining boundaries relate to the line of intersection between a particular tidal datum and the land mass. For example, in Australia, freehold titles to coastal land <b>parcels</b> are <b>limited</b> in their seaward extent by the line of Mean High Water. On the other hand, government jurisdiction in the marine environment extends seaward from the line of Lowest Astronomical Tide. The difficulty with boundaries defined on the basis of tidal datums is that rigorous and consistent realisation of the line of intersection between a nominated tidal datum and the land mass is notoriously difficult, creating spatial uncertainty and the potential for conflict and dispute. This paper describes and discusses the fundamental issue of dealing with spatial uncertainty in defining and realising boundaries which are linked to tidal datums. Some practical examples are presented to highlight the complexity of the problem. Having presented the background, a technical solution for realising the line of intersection between any given tidal datum and the land mass will be presented. Issues involved in implementing this solution will be described and its relevance and application to the development of a national marine cadastre will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{have looked}} for {{enhancements}} of the O/N 2 ratio in data {{measured by the}} Dynamics Explorer 2 (DE 2) satellite in the middle latitudes of the winter hemisphere, based on a prediction that {{was made by the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere/tonosphere general circulation model (NCAR-TIGCM) that such increases occur. The NCAR-TIGCM predicts that these enhancements should be seen throughout the low latitude region and in many middle latitude locations, but that the enhancements in O/N 2 are particularly strong in the middle-latitude, evening-to-midnight sector of the winter hemisphere. When this prediction was used to look for these effects in DE 2 NACS (neutral atmosphere composition spectrometer) data, large enhancements in the O/N 2 ratio (approx. 50 to 90 %) were seen. These enhancements were observed during the main phase of a storm that occurred on November 24, 1982, and were seen in the same region of the winter hemisphere predicted by the NCAR-TIGCM. They are partially the result of the depletion of N 2 and, as electron loss is dependent on dissociative recombination at F(sub 2) altitudes, they have implications for electron densities in this area. Parcel trajectories, which have been followed through the NCAR-TIGCM history file for this event, show that large O/N 2 enhancements occur in this limited region in the winter hemisphere for two reasons. First, these parcels of air are decelerated by the antisunward edge of the ion convection pattern; individual parcels converge and subsidence occurs. Thus molecular-nitrogen-poor air is brought from higher to lower heights. Because neutral parcels that are found a little poleward of the equatorial edge of the eveningside convection pattern are swept inward {{toward the center of the}} auroral oval, the enhancements occur only in a very limited range of latitudes. Second, nitrogen-poor air is transported from regions close to the magnetic pole in the winter hemisphere. During geomagnetic storms, enhanced meridional winds are driven by the increased pressure-gradient force that is associated with intensified Joule heating in the auroral oval. These pressure-driven winds decrease rapidly on the dayside beyond the auroral oval where the <b>parcels</b> originate, <b>limiting</b> the region into which the parcels can be transported. Thus these two processes drive values of O/N 2 in a limited region of the winter hemisphere, and reinforce only in the evening sector, causing large changes in this region...|$|R
2500|$|Before 1912 the {{delivery}} of parcels was controlled and handled by private companies, most of whom operated in cities and urban areas where there was more business to be had. Consequently, delivery of parcels to rural areas was inadequate and frequently hindered farmers who needed various supplies, parts and equipment delivered to their remote locations. To meet this demand Congress approved a law on August 24, 1912 creating postal rates for fourth class mail and providing for parcel post service. The Congressional law authorized the U.S. Post Office to produce the various special purpose postage stamps to pay the parcel fees, which became effective on January 1, 1913, the first day the U.S. Parcel Post began service. The 12 stamps were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the flat plate printing press on soft yellowish wove paper made with a single-line watermark bearing the letters 'U S P S' and were perforated with 12 gauge [...] The stamps were designed by Clair Aubrey Houston {{who at the time}} had worked at the Bureau for ten years, while the dies for the individual stamps were produced by several different engravers, with up to four engravers working on each die. The Post Office initially planned to place all dozen stamps on sale before parcel post service began, but Frank Hitchcock, the Postmaster General, deemed the original designs for the 3-cent, 50-cent and 75-cent denominations unsatisfactory, delaying the issue of those values until {{after the first of the}} year. The twelve stamps each bore their own distinctive subject in the vignette and were issued in a single color, [...] "carmine-rose". It was Hitchcock who came up with the idea of printing all the denominations of these stamps in one uniform color. However, because of the common color and similarity in border design Parcel Post stamps during the first six months of use were met with mixed reaction from postal personnel who had difficulty distinguishing the stamps at a glance and often confused the denominations, especially during busy hours. [...] "In an effort to help the stamp clerks an inscription of value in large plain capital letters was added to the [...] margin, next to each plate number. These were first added to plates on January 27, 1913." [...] An example of these large red spelled-out numbers, which appeared on two margins of each pane, can be seen on the illustration of the ten-cent plate block in the section [...] "Other configurations" [...] further down this page. [...] To compound the situation the stamps were larger than ordinary definitive stamps of the period, making it difficult to situate them on smaller <b>parcels</b> with <b>limited</b> space around the address and return address. They were also issued in sheets of 180, with four panes of 45 stamps per sheet, which was an inconvenient number for accounting purposes. By March the Postmaster General was considering using different colors for the individual stamps and a smaller, definitive-sized design [...] (for which plates of the 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent denominations were even engraved). Production of the Parcel Post sheets cut into 45 stamps each resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of stamps with straight edges (see image below) than other stamp productions, much to the disappointment of collectors at the time. Some philatelic publishers like Stanley Gibbons were rather unforgiving in their estimation of these new issues, referring to them as [...] "very useless stamps" [...] having an [...] "ugliness" [...] about them.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Presentation date: 1975 - 05 - 02 The {{navigability}} of the Columbia river permits Portland, located {{more than}} 100 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, {{to function as}} the major port {{of the state of}} Oregon. It could be expected that the waterfront spanning the greatest share of the distance between Portland and the ocean should reflect a multitude of riverine functions associated with a major water route. However, in spite of such expectation, even a cursory examination of the lower Columbia shoreline reveals little specialized riverine use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to synthesize and analyze the information and data relating to the lower Columbia riverfront. Such analysis helps clarify the interrelationship which exists between the sinuous strip of land fronting on the water an driver use or nonuse. The study is empirical and employs three basic geographic concepts: resource utilization, spatial distribution and functional interaction. Analysis explains the spatial distribution of riverfront land. Distributive patterns of riverfront parcels according to physical and economic characteristics are analyzed. The physical characteristics of 1) size, 2) front footage, 3) slope, 4) mean water depth offshore and 5) distance to the navigation channel; together with the economic characteristics of value and demand are described. Systematic interpretation of the data helps provide a realistic perspective of riverfront resources which portend importance, but which have lacked analysis. Utilization of the economic and physical characteristics, identified above, provide a means of explaining some of the interactions which exists between the waterfront parcels and the river, between adjoining parcels and between the riverfront and its hinterland. Four hypotheses are tested. These are: 1) less than 20 percent of the riverfront parcels make direct use of the river, 2) land owners are rational managers and utilize their land for their greatest benefit, 3) municipalities have the greatest share of direct river use, and 4) land value is not contingent upon direct river use. Each hypothesis is tested by analyzing seven Columbia County zones and three Clatsop County zones. Analysis includes interrelating parcel utility with the physical-dimensional variables and the monetary values of land value per acre and total value per acre. The physical variables are correlated and analyzed. Eight variables are arrayed by sequential data plots that depict their distribution by quintiles for the 10 study zones. The data plots also depict parcel utility according to four major uses: 1) direct intensive river use, 2) direct extensive river use, 3) nonriver use and, 4) nonuse. Study findings reveal that the mix of the physical-dimensional variables do restrict parcel utility. Depth 100 yards offshore from the parcels, coupled with slope and parcel size, are factors which limit river use. For the 572 shoreline study parcels in the two county region the utility percentages for the 24, 774. 65 acres are: direct intensive river use, 28 percent; direct extensive river use, 9 percent and nonriver use, 63 percent. The hypothesis stating less than 20 percent of the parcels make direct use of the river was rejected while all other hypotheses were accepted. Research indicated that while over 60 percent of the study acreage was not used for direct river use, nonriver use and often nonuse were viable alternatives for land owners to pursue. A limited portion of the riverfront is used for, or has the potential of being used for, deep draft navigation and related industrial uses. In the aggregate the study parcels encompass an overabundance of land not suited for riverine functions related to waterborne commerce or industrial uses dependent upon the river. The lower Columbia River region has not succeeded in establishing a powerful sphere of influence, at least in part, because it is situated too close to the Portland metropolitan area. The majority of the study <b>parcels</b> have <b>limited</b> riverine potential due to restrictive qualities and due to competition from the Portland area. Although the riverfront was once the dynamic hub of the two county region, it no longer is and likely will not become so in the future...|$|R
