He pioneered {{a new model}} of development that included more innovation and engagement with the private sector, all focused on ending extreme poverty around the world. As co-chair of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), a comprehensive evaluation led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to redefine diplomacy and development, Shah worked to incorporate development as a part of an integrated, values-driven national security strategy. He earned bipartisan support for his efforts which included increasing his Agency’s budget growth during a time of sequestration.Internally, Shah launched USAID Forward, a set of reforms that touched nearly every part of the Agency, including contractor and procurement policies. He returned budget and policy oversight back to USAID from the State Department, recruited top talent from other fields, increased the number of foreign service officers, established the Administrator’s Leadership Council, similar to Alan Mulally's Business <b>Process</b> <b>Review</b> at Ford Motor Company, which included all senior officials across USAID and established USAID Staff Care Center that provided 24/7 global support for Agency staff around the world.|$|E

40|$|Software reviews, {{including}} design reviews, {{are conducted}} on most software-intensive Defence projects and {{are an important}} component of the software acquisition <b>process.</b> However, software <b>reviews</b> are often conducted in an ad hoc manner, and many are inefficient.

The SAAM <b>review</b> <b>process</b> is driven by the identification of scenarios that capture how the system might be used or modified. This report describes a case study of the SAAM <b>review</b> <b>process.</b> According to the results of the study, the SAAM <b>review</b> <b>process</b> offers potential benefits over the traditional design <b>review</b> <b>process</b> in the identification and clarification of requirements, but was less effective at identifying conflicts and trade-offs.

40|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the UK, child care and {{protection}} practice in Scotland has undergone unprecedented change over the last ten years, including a wide-ranging three-year Child Protection Reform Programme. In 2006, The University of Dundee's Centre for Child Care and Protection and Barnardo's Scotland Research and Development team were commissioned by the then Scottish Executive to undertake a <b>process</b> <b>review</b> of the Child Protection Reform Programme (Daniel et al., 2007). Drawing on findings from the <b>process</b> <b>review,</b> this article considers the impact of the Child Protection Reform Programme. The <b>process</b> <b>review</b> concluded that, in the view of the respondents, the Child Protection Reform Programme made a substantive contribution towards the improvement and delivery of child protection services in Scotland, particularly in terms of raising awareness and increased multi-agency working. It was beyond the scope of the review to measure outcomes for children as a result of the reforms. Since the completion of the Child Protection Reform Programme, national policy emphasis has broadened from ‘child protection' towards integrated support for children under the Getting it Right for Every Child reforms of children's services. The paper concludes with a discussion around where ‘child protection' now fits within this context of universal support for children and argues that there is a need to ensure that the valuable work which was done to improve child protection services in Scotland under the Child Protection Reform Programme is not lost...|$|E
