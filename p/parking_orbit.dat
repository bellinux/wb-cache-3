25|$|Apollo {{missions}} {{minimized the}} performance penalty of the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> by keeping its altitude {{as low as}} possible. For example, Apollo 15 used an unusually low <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> (even for Apollo) of 92.5 nmi by 91.5 nmi (171km by 169km) where there was significant atmospheric drag. But it was partially overcome by continuous venting of hydrogen from the third stage of the Saturn V, and was in any event tolerable for the short stay.|$|E
25|$|Achieving {{a closed}} orbit is not {{essential}} to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. This costs additional propellant because the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because {{it will never be}} reached.|$|E
25|$|This <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> {{was quite}} low by Earth orbit standards, {{and it would}} have been {{short-lived}} due to aerodynamic drag. This was not a problem on a lunar mission because of the short stay in the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit.</b> The S-IVB also continued to thrust at a low level by venting gaseous hydrogen, to keep propellants settled in their tanks and prevent gaseous cavities from forming in propellant feed lines. This venting also maintained safe pressures as liquid hydrogen boiled off in the fuel tank. This venting thrust easily exceeded aerodynamic drag.|$|E
50|$|The Ariane 5 {{does not}} use <b>parking</b> <b>orbits.</b> This {{simplifies}} the launcher since multiple restart is not needed, and the penalty is small for their typical GTO mission, as their launch site {{is close to the}} equator. An upgrade to the second stage (ESC-B) will have multiple restart capability, so future missions may use <b>parking</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} which finds Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> which allow tangential periapsis burns at both arrival and departure. This method {{accounts for the}} actual geometry at both arrival and departure between the hyperbolic asymptotes and the orbital plane, along with the precession effects caused by the oblateness of Mars. Thus, realistic Delta-V values (and hence initial low-earth orbit masses) are obtained for these orbits. The results obtained from the present method compare very well with a trajectory integration program while only requiring CPU times of about one minute. Therefore, due to the computational efficiency and accuracy, the present method would be an ideal tool to use in preliminary mission design, since it provides the opportunity to incorporate realistic Mars <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> effects...|$|R
25|$|Second stage engine cutoff was {{commanded}} by the IU at a pre-determined fuel level, {{and the stage}} was separated. By this time, the vehicle had reached its approximate orbital altitude, and the third stage burn was {{just long enough to}} reach a circular <b>parking</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
25|$|An average mission {{used the}} rocket {{for a total}} of just 20 minutes. Although Apollo 6 {{experienced}} three engine failures, and Apollo 13 one engine shutdown, the onboard computers were able to compensate by burning the remaining engines longer to achieve <b>parking</b> <b>orbit.</b> None of the Saturn V launches resulted in a payload loss.|$|E

2500|$|Robotic {{missions}} do {{not require}} an abort capability or radiation minimization, and because modern launchers routinely meet [...] "instantaneous" [...] launch windows, space probes to the Moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Apollo Lunar Program utilized efficient, i. e., Earth-return, transearth trajectories which employed <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> {{in order to}} minimize energy requirements. This thesis concentrates on a different type of transearth trajectory. These are direct-ascent hyperbolic trajectories which omit the <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> in order to achieve short flight times to and from a lunar base. The object of this thesis is the development of a three-dimensional transearth trajectory model and associated computer program for exploring trade-offs between flight-time and energy, given various mission constraints. The program also targets the Moon with a hyperbolic trajectory, which can with a time-reversed trajectory, be used for targeting Earth impact points. The first-order model is based on an Earth-centered conic and a massless spherical Moon, using Mathcad version 3. 0 This model is intended as the basis for future patched-conic formulation for the design of fast Earth-return trajectories. Applications include placing nuclear-deterrent arsenals on the Moon, various space support related activities and finally protection against Earth-threatening asteroids and comets using lunar bases.

25|$|The Mars 1M {{programs}} (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was {{the first}} Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as Korabl 4 and Korabl 5 respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so Earth <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120km before reentry.|$|E

5000|$|The {{failure was}} {{described}} as [...] "especially disappointing" [...] since it was the final launch in the Able probe series as its successor, the Ranger program, was in the works.

40|$|A simple {{strategy}} is identified to generate ballistic transfers between the Earth and Moon, i. e., transfers that perform two maneuvers: a trans-lunar injection maneuver to depart the Earth and a Lunar Orbit Insertion maneuver to insert into orbit at the Moon. This {{strategy is}} used to survey the performance of numerous transfers between varying Earth <b>parking</b> <b>orbits</b> and varying low lunar target orbits.

25|$|The S-IVB-500 {{model used}} on the Saturn V {{differed}} from the S-IVB-200 used as {{the second stage of}} the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the <b>parking</b> <b>orbit</b> and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.|$|E

The Mars Express and Fregat booster were initially {{put into a}} 200km Earth <b>parking</b> <b>orbit,</b> then the Fregat was fired again at 19:14 UT to put the spacecraft into a Mars transfer orbit. The Fregat and Mars Express separated at approximately 19:17 UT. The solar panels were then deployed and a trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on June 4 to aim Mars Express towards Mars and allow the Fregat booster to coast into interplanetary space. The Mars Express was the first Russian-launched probe to successfully {{make it out of}} LEO since the Soviet Union fell.|$|E

In addition, this torque, coupled with the spacecraft gyro-dynamics and orbit rate, results in a natural alignment of the momentum wheel bias vector with the orbit plane normal.
