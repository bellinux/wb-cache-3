500|$|Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, {{thanks to}} a sex manual {{discovered}} by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this {{by going to the}} cinema and <b>picking-up</b> a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, [...] "giving" [...] Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to [...] "put the moves" [...] on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1967, Garrison {{appeared}} on a Dallas television program and claimed that a photograph taken in Dealy Plaza immediately after the assassination depicted a federal agent in plain clothes <b>picking-up</b> and walking away with a [...]45 caliber bullet. He said that the bullet was not entered into evidence for the Warren Commission and was proof that another gunman {{was involved in the}} assassination. The photograph also showed Dallas Deputy Sheriff Buddy Walthers looking on with a uniformed Dallas policeman. Walthers stated the following week that the photograph was taken approximately 10 minutes after the assassination, and that the finding was [...] "nothing significant". He said that it appeared to be blood on the grass or possibly a piece of skull. Walthers added: [...] "If it had been a bullet, it would have been significant." ...|$|E
60|$|Clearly the cable-man was right, for, {{while the}} <b>picking-up</b> {{apparatus}} was being got ready, the cable {{was cut in}} no fewer than three places, {{in order to test}} the coils that lay in the tanks. These being found all right, the <b>picking-up</b> was begun with anxious care. The moment of greatest danger was when the big ship was swinging round. For a few, but apparently endless, moments the cable had to bear the strain, and became rigid like a bar of steel. Then it was got in over the bows, where all was bustle, and noise, and smoke, as the <b>picking-up</b> machinery panted and rattled.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have been}} much touched by your solicitude, but till now {{absolutely}} too [...] "bad" [...] to write--to do anything but helplessly, yearningly languish and suffer and surrender. I have had a perfect Hell of a Time--since just after Xmas--nearly 15 long weeks of dismal, dreary, interminable illness (with occasional slight <b>pickings-up</b> followed by black relapses.) But the tide, thank the Powers, has at last definitely turned and I am {{on the way to}} getting not only better, but, as I believe, creepily and abjectly well. I sent my Nurse (my second) flying the other day, after ten deadly weeks of her, and her predecessor's, aggressive presence and policy, and the mere relief from that overdone discipline has done wonders for me. I must have patience, much, yet--but my face is toward the light, which shows, beautifully, that I look ten years older, with my bonny tresses ten degrees whiter (like Marie Antoinette's in the Conciergerie.) However if I've lost all my beauty and (by my expenses) most of my money, I rejoice I've kept my friends, and I shall come and show you that appreciation yet. I am so delighted that you and the Daughterling had your go at Italy--even though I was feeling so pre-eminently un-Italian. The worst of that Paradise is indeed that one returns but to Purgatories at the best. Have a little patience yet with your still struggling but all clinging ...|$|R
60|$|Two men-of-war, the Terrible and the Sphinx, {{had been}} {{appointed}} to accompany and aid the Great Eastern on her important mission. A gun was fired, and signals were made, to acquaint these with what had occurred while the fires were being {{got up in the}} boilers of the <b>picking-up</b> machinery.|$|E
60|$|After {{testing the}} cable {{for some time}} by {{signalling}} to the shore, Monsieur de Sauty concluded that the fault was of a serious character, and orders were at once given to prepare the <b>picking-up</b> apparatus at the bow {{for the purpose of}} drawing the cable back into the ship until the defective portion should be reached and cut out.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} rope was let run, {{to ease the}} strain while the ship swung round; then it was brought in over the pulley at the bow, the paddles moved, and the return towards Ireland was begun. The strain, {{although}} great, {{was far from the}} breaking-point, but the speed was very slow--not more than a mile an hour being considered safe in the process of <b>picking-up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{think of}} these men, and of the {{formation}} of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Applause), and the successful laying of the 1866 cable, and the <b>picking-up</b> and completion of the old cable," [...] (Loud cheers),--("Hm! a decanter gone this time. Will you take your foot out of the soup tureen, sir," [...] from the lugubrious man, and an impatient [...] "hush!" [...] from Robin.) ...|$|E
60|$|Ebenezer Smith and his confreres {{worked in}} the testing-room like Trojans. They {{connected}} and disconnected; they put in stops and took them out; they intensified currents {{to the extent of}} their anxieties they reduced them to the measure of their despair--nothing would do. The cable was apparently dead. In these circumstances <b>picking-up</b> was the only resource, and the apparatus for that purpose was again rigged up in the bows.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} big ship went merrily on her way, {{and the great}} cable went down to its ocean-bed so {{smoothly}} and regularly, that men began to talk of speedy arrival at Heart's Content--their destination in Newfoundland--which was now only about 600 miles distant; but their greatest troubles still lay before them. About eight {{o'clock in the morning}} of 2nd August another bad fault was reported, and they had once again to resort to the wearisome process of <b>picking-up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] he said again; [...] "take care of yourself." [...] And he went out, {{not looking}} towards {{the figure on}} the bench. He drove home by way of Hammersmith; that he might stop at a place he knew of {{and tell them to}} send her in two dozen of their best Burgundy. She must want <b>picking-up</b> sometimes! Only in Richmond Park did he {{remember}} that he had gone up to order himself some boots, and was surprised that he could have had so paltry an idea.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{difficulty}} {{and the great}} danger was to pass the cable from the stern to the bow, and to turn the ship round, so as {{to enable them to}} steam up to the cable while hauling it in. Iron chains were lashed firmly to the cable at the stern, and secured to a wire-rope carried round the outside of the ship to the <b>picking-up</b> apparatus at the bows. The cable was down in 400 fathoms of water when the paying-out ceased, and nice management was required to keep the ship steady, as she had now no steerage-way; and oh! with what intense interest and curiosity and wonder did Robin Wright regard the varied and wonderful mechanical appliances, with which the whole affair was accomplished! ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{discovery}} of the [...] "fault" [...] and the cutting out of the injured part of the cable, twenty-six hours were lost. During all the time Captain Anderson was obliged to remain on deck, while the minds and bodies of the engineers and electricians were subjected to a severe strain for the same period. They had scarcely begun to breathe freely again, and to congratulate each other on being able to continue the voyage, when they received another shock of alarm by the cable suddenly flying off the drum, while it was being transferred from the <b>picking-up</b> machinery in the bow to the paying-out arrangements in the stern. Before the machinery could be stopped, some fathoms of cable had become entangled among the wheels and destroyed. This part having been cut out, however, and new splices made, the paying-out process was resumed.|$|E
6000|$|It may perhaps {{seem strange}} that the soil {{should have been}} watered by such an {{incident}} as Mr. Lazarus Fox's reply, in the earliest rich dusk, to my inquiry as to whither, while I occupied his rooms, I had best betake myself most regularly for my dinner: [...] "Well, there is the Bath Hotel, sir, a very short walk away, where I should think you would be very comfortable indeed. Mr. So-and-So dines at his club, sir--but {{there is also the}} Albany in Piccadilly, to which I believe many gentlemen go." [...] I think I measured on the spot [...] "all that it took" [...] to make my friend most advisedly--for it was clearly what he did--see me seated in lone state, for my evening meal, at the heavy mahogany of the stodgy little hotel that in those days and for long after occupied the north-west corner of Arlington Street and to which, in common with many compatriots, I repeatedly resorted during the years immediately following. We suffered, however, on those occasions, the unmitigated coffee-room of Mr. Fox's prescription--it was part of a strange inevitability, a concomitant of necessary shelter and we hadn't at least gone forth to invoke its austere charm. I tried it, in that singular way, at the hour I speak of--and I well remember forecasting the interest of a social and moral order in which it could be supposed of me that, having tried it once, I should sublimely try it again. My success in doing so would indeed have been sublime, but a finer shade of the quality still attached somehow to my landlord's confidence in it; and {{this was one of the}} threads that, as I have called them, I was to tuck away for future <b>picking-up</b> again and unrolling. I fell back on the Albany, which long ago passed away and which I seem to have brushed with a touch of reminiscence in some anticipation of the present indulgence that is itself quite ancient history. It was a small eating-house of the very old English tradition, as I then supposed at least, just opposite the much greater establishment of the same name, which latter it had borrowed, and I remember wondering whether the tenants of the classic chambers, the beadle-guarded cluster of which was impressive even to the deprecated approach, found their conception of the [...] "restaurant"--we still pronounced it in the French manner--met by the small compartments, narrow as horse-stalls, formed by the high straight backs of hard wooden benches and accommodating respectively two pairs of feeders, who were thus so closely face to face as fairly to threaten with knife and fork each others' more forward features.|$|E
