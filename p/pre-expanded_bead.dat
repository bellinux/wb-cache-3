2500|$|If {{the volume}} is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced {{by a process}} similar to {{injection}} molding. <b>Pre-expanded</b> <b>beads</b> of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene.|$|R
40|$|Heating of {{polystyrene}} beads containing pentane isomers as the blowing agent traditionally produces polystyrene foam. Undesirable emissions of the blowing agent and its high flammability are {{the complications of}} this process. A new process {{for the production of}} expandable polystyrene has been developed, using wafer as the agent. Water is trapped inside the polystyrene matrix through the use of starch that is introduced as a separate phase during the suspension polymerization. The problems created by the incompatibility of starch with the organic phase can be partially overcome by "compatibilization" with maleic anhydride, The type of starch can influence the foam morphology of the <b>pre-expanded</b> <b>beads,</b> while the density is changed only in the range of the experimental error. The density of the <b>pre-expanded</b> <b>beads</b> is influenced by the blowing technique used (hot air or high frequency electric field). The use of these different blowing techniques does not influence significantly the foam morphology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In the study, a pre-expansion station, {{designed}} by authors, was presented. It {{consists of a}} batch pre-expander with a 90 liters capacity foaming chamber, equipped with fluidized-solid dryer of <b>pre-expanded</b> <b>beads</b> and a pneumatic transport system of granules to the silo. Steam is delivered to the pre-expander from the electric vapor generator type LW 40. 1. In the study, work principle of the pre-expansion station and pre-expansion tests carried out on this position were presented...|$|R
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. <b>Pre-expanded</b> <b>beads</b> of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|R
25|$|Before 1949, {{chemical}} engineer Fritz Stastny (1908–1985) developed <b>pre-expanded</b> PS <b>beads</b> by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane. These beads are {{the raw material}} for moulding parts or extruding sheets. BASF and Stastny applied for a patent that was issued in 1949. The moulding process was demonstrated at the Kunststoff Messe 1952 in Düsseldorf. Products were named Styropor.|$|R
2500|$|Expanded {{polystyrene}} (EPS) is a {{rigid and}} tough, closed-cell foam. It is usually white {{and made of}} <b>pre-expanded</b> polystyrene <b>beads.</b> EPS is used for many applications e.g. trays, plates, bowls and fish boxes. Other uses include molded sheets for building insulation and packing material ("peanuts") for cushioning fragile items inside boxes. Sheets are commonly packaged as rigid panels (size 4 by 8 or 2 by 8 feet in the United States), which are also known as [...] "bead-board".|$|R
