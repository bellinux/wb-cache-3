40|$|Mutations in Prophet of <b>PIT</b> 1 (<b>Prop</b> 1), one {{of several}} {{homeodomain}} transcription factors that are required {{for the development of}} the anterior pituitary gland, are the predominant cause of MPHD (multiple pituitary hor-mone deficiency) in humans. We show that deletion of Prop 1 in mice causes severe pituitary hypoplasia with failure of the entire Pit 1 lineage and delayed gonadotrope development. The pituitary hormone deficiencies cause secondary endocrine problems and a high rate of perinatal mortality due to respiratory distress. Lung atelectasis in mutants correlates with reduced levels of NKX 2. 1 and surfactant. Lethality of mice homozygous for either the null allele or a spontaneous hypomorphic allele is strongly influenced by genetic background. Prop 1 -null mice are an excellent model for MPHD and may be useful for testing the efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for neonatal respiratory distress...|$|R
40|$|Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiency (CPHD) is a {{prevalent}} {{disease in}} Neuroen-docrinology services. The genetic form of CPHD may originate from mutations in pituitary transcription factor (PTF) genes and the pituitary image {{in these cases}} may give a clue of what PTF is most probably mutated: defects in LHX 4 are usually associated with ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP); defects in LHX 3, <b>PIT</b> 1, and <b>PROP</b> 1, with normally placed posteri-or pituitary (NPPP); HESX 1 mutations are associated with both. Objective: To identify mutations in PTF genes in patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism followed in our ser-vice, based on {{the presence or absence}} of EPP on sellar MRI. Methods: Forty patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism (36 families, 9 consanguineous), followed in the Neu-roendocrinology Outpatient Clinic of UNIFESP, Brazil, were submitted to sequencing analyses of PTF genes as follows: LHX 3, HESX 1, <b>PIT</b> 1, and <b>PROP</b> 1 were sequenced in patients with NPPP (26 / 40) and HESX 1 and LHX 4 in patients with EPP (14 / 40). Results: We identified only PROP 1 mutations in 9 out of 26 patients with CPHD and NPPP (35 %). Since eight of them came from 4 consanguineous families, the prevalence of PROP 1 mutations was higher when only consanguineous families were considered (44 %, 4 / 9). At the end of the study, we decided to sequence PROP 1 in patients with EPP, just to confirm that they were not candidates for PROP 1 mutations. No patients with EPP had PROP 1 or other PTF mutations. Conclusions: Patients with idiopathic CPHD and NPPP, born from consanguineous parents, are the strong candidates for PROP 1 mutations. Other develop-mental gene(s) may be involved in the genesis of idiopathic hypopituitarism associate...|$|R

500|$|The AO went {{bankrupt}} {{a few years}} later and was bought by another startup railroad, the Kansas City & Memphis Railroad (KC) in early 1911. It would build from Cave Springs, a few miles west of Rogers, through Fayetteville and towards Memphis, Tennessee. In 1912 the Ozark Land and Lumber Company began construction of a 5-mile extension east of Monte Ne from the White River to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC [...] The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2,152foot steel spans, making it the longest railroad bridge in Benton County. This extension was used to haul out forestry products. The KC entered receivership in 1914, and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, many railroads were seized by the United States government. The KC was not seized, and due to unfavorable rulings by the United States Railroad Administration and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate. In January 1918 Roscoe Hobbs, one of the court-appointed receivers of the KC, went to Washington, D.C. to provide testimony to the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the effects of these decisions on small railroads. As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> and railroad ties being hauled on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917. Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed, and most portions of the KC were abandoned by October 1918. The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919. The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe. The steel spans were scrapped during World War II.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a systems biology approach for the genetic dissection of complex traits based on applying gene network theory {{to the results}} from genome-wide associations. The associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that were individually associated with a primary phenotype of interest, age at puberty in our study, were explored across 22 related traits. Genomic regions were surveyed for genes harboring the selected SNP. As a result, an association weight matrix (AWM) was constructed with as many rows as genes and as many columns as traits. Each { i, j } cell value in the AWM corresponds to the z -score normalized additive effect of the i th gene (via its neighboring SNP) on the j th trait. Columnwise, the AWM recovered the genetic correlations estimated via pedigree-based restricted maximum-likelihood methods. Rowwise, a combination of hierarchical clustering, gene network, and pathway analyses identified genetic drivers {{that would have been}} missed by standard genome-wide association studies. Finally, the promoter regions of the AWM-predicted targets of three key transcription factors (TFs), estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG), Pal 3 motif, bound by a PPAR-gamma homodimer, IR 3 sites (PPARG), and Prophet of <b>Pit</b> 1, <b>PROP</b> paired-like homeobox 1 (PROP 1), were surveyed to identify binding sites corresponding to those TFs.

40|$|As life {{expectancy}} in the United States increases each year, {{the percentage of}} the population that is comprised of aged individuals rises also. Researchers expect the largest increase in population to occur in the segment consisting of individuals 85 and older. Thus, investigations of the aging process, with the goals of further extending average {{life expectancy}} and improving {{the quality of life for}} aged individuals, have become increasingly important to our society. To better understand the genetics of aging, we elected to utilize another model organism, the domestic dog. The benefit to this work is that breeds exhibit extreme, natural variation in life expectancies. Here I report my contributions towards establishing the dog as another model organism for investigations of the aging process. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between life spans and breed size in the dog, based upon data derived from the American pet population. A negative correlation was observed between both height and longevity and between weight and longevity with weight being the significant predictor of life span. Fifty-four genes implicated in the aging process were mapped to the canine genome. These genes were selected because of their demonstrated contribution to longevity in other organisms or based upon their proximity to a marker, D 4 S 1564, on human chromosome 4. Four genes that are associated with dwarf mice and extended life span were analyzed in nine dog breeds of varying sizes and life expectancies. Fifty-three polymorphisms were discovered in Ghr, Ghrhr, <b>Pit</b> 1, and <b>Prop</b> 1. Thirteen ancestral SNPs were discovered in which both alleles were found in every breed. In Ghrhr, a transition mutation was found that changes the amino acid sequence as well as the function of the protein and is statistically significant (p= 4. 8 x 10 - 6) when large dogs are compared to medium-sized breeds, but not when they are compared to small breeds (p= 0. 001). This SNP warrants further investigation in additional dogs and breeds...|$|R
