60|$|All the {{buildings}} were exactly alike, and stood about {{as high as a}} tall man. In shape they were square, with a flat roof, but around each roof was a stout railing. There were no windows at all, and each house had but one door, which was placed in the center, halfway between the floor and the roof. Even this was more a doorway than a door, being nothing but a square hole, with a broad shelf <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> and inside the bottom of the opening.|$|E
60|$|We {{now come}} to the {{certainly}} honest evidence of the Pere Lejeune, the Jesuit missionary. In the Relations de la Nouvelle France (1634), Lejeune discusses the sorcerers, who, as rival priests, gave him great trouble. He describes the Medicine Lodge just as Kohl does. The fire is put out, of course, the sorcerer enters, the lodge shakes, voices are heard in Montagnais and Algonkin, and the Father thought it all a clumsy imposture. The sorcerer, in a very sportsmanlike way, asked him to go in himself and try what he could make of it. 'You'll find that your body remains below and your soul mounts aloft.' The cautious Father, reflecting {{that there were no}} white witnesses, declined to make the experiment. This lodge was larger than those which Kohl saw, and would have held half a dozen men. This was in 1634; by 1637 Pere Lejeune began to doubt whether his theory that the lodge was shaken by the juggler would hold water. Two Indians--one of them a sorcerer, Pigarouich, 'me descouvrant avec grande sincerite toutes ses malices'--'making a clean breast of his tricks'--vowed that they did not shake the lodge--that a great wind entered fort promptement et rudement, and they added that the 'tabernacle' (as Lejeune very injudiciously calls the Medicine Lodge), 'is sometimes so strong that a single man can hardly stir it.' The sorcerer was a small weak man. Lejeune himself noted the strength of the structure, and saw it move with a violence which he did not think a man could have communicated to it, especially not for such a length of time. He was assured by many (Indian) witnesses that the tabernacle was sometimes laid level with the ground, and again that the sorcerer's arm and legs might be seen <b>projecting</b> <b>outside,</b> while the lodge staggered about--nay, more, the lodge would rock and sway after the juggler had left it. As usual, there was a savage, Auiskuouaskousit, who had seen a juggler rise in air out of the structure, while others, looking in, saw that he was absent. St. Theresa had done equal marvels, but this does not occur to the good Father.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of the mosque is almost a square, 59 m in length and 58 m in width, forming a single vast space. The dome is flanked by semi-domes, and {{to the north and}} south arches with tympana-filled windows, supported by enormous porphyry monoliths. Sinan decided to make a radical architectural innovation to mask the huge north-south buttresses needed to support these central piers. He incorporated the buttresses into the walls of the building, with half projecting inside and half <b>projecting</b> <b>outside,</b> and then hid the projections by building colonnaded galleries. There is a single gallery inside the structure, and a two-story gallery outside.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 7 mm {{for males and}} 8.2 mm for females. The forewings are bright golden brown, with a dark, rich, velvety brown, broad fascia at one-third from the base, sharply defined on both sides, darkest, nearly black, and somewhat broader at the dorsal edge, where it terminates in slightly raised scales, <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> {{the edge of the}} wing in a dorsal tooth, and forming (at rest) a curious hump on the back. This fascia is still more thickly scaled {{than the rest of the}} wing. A little more than the apical third of wing is densely dusted with black scales, which condense into four, all black, velvety spots, one large costal spot, one-third from apex reaching down to the fold, one smaller apical, one moon shaped at the tornus, and a small round dot between the two latter. The last three are internally edged by light silvery scales forming an indistinct, thin, open V shape, with the point toward the apex. The hindwings are purplish gray with silvery reflections.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{based on}} simple principles, Newcomen's engine was rather complex and {{showed signs of}} {{incremental}} development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than 1 - 2 psi (0.07 - 0.14 bar) - the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking [...] "Great balanced Beam", the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> of the building, the engine being located in-house. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston {{was surrounded by a}} seal {{in the form of a}} leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or header tank) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a stand-pipe for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.|$|E

30|$|Enough {{emphasis}} {{was given in}} our series of patients to direct the wires in the correct direction at the very first attempt. Repeated attempts of wire passage would create false tracts, poor purchase with subsequent backing, and redisplacement in the postoperative period. This happened in two patients in whom the fracture healed in varus {{with an increase in}} the Baumann angle of > 90 °. The Kirschner wires are deliberately not bent before cutting and are left <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> the skin. We believe that the bending would create motion transmission and may weaken the purchase strength of the Kirschner wires. Despite this, no patient had internal wire migration in our series.|$|E

40|$|The {{striatum}} {{forms the}} main input structure to the Basal Ganglia (BG), a subcortical structure {{involved in the}} selec-tion and reinforcement learning of action sequences. It is 90 % composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which inhibit each other through collaterals, receive excitatory projections from cortex and are the only cells <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> the striatum. Because of its inhibitory structure the MSN network is often thought to act selectively, trans-mitting the most active cortical inputs downstream in the BG while suppressing others. However studies show that local MSN network connections are too sparse and weak to perform global selection and their function remains puzzling. Here we suggest that rather than generating a static stimulus dependent activity pattern the MSN net-work is optimized to generate stimulus dependent dyna...|$|E

40|$|Utricularia julianae, a {{new species}} from the savannas near the Oyapock River, French Guiana, is here {{described}} and illustrated. The new species is most similar to U. tenuissima, from which it can be easily distinguished by the leaves and stolons apparently lacking (vs. leaves few and on the stolons, the stolons few or lacking, in U. tenuissima), traps ellipsoid, 0. 3 mm long, with 4 - 5 capilliform appendages (vs. ovoid, 0. 3 - 0. 8 mm long, with 1 dorsal and 2 ventral slender appendages), corolla upper lip limb deeply bilobed (vs. broadly ovate to round), spur saccate, perpendicular to the lower lip (vs. spur narrowly cylindrical, parallel to the lower lip), among other characters. In addition, the capsules of U. julianae and U. tenuissima are unique within the genus, by being very narrowly ovoid, dehiscing by a single longitudinal slit, and with a placenta <b>projecting</b> <b>outside</b> the dehisced capsule.
