The European Values Survey carried out in 1999 shows clearly the priorities of Europeans in this matter.

The consensus on this hierarchy is not altered by national, demographical, social, economic or political divisions. These different divisions do indeed influence opinions on each criterion, but, with very few exceptions, they are not sufficient to upset this order of priorities.

40|$|Abstract: This {{essay will}} {{evaluate}} democracy‟s success both by democracy {{in its own}} right- according to its minimum definition- and, given India‟s particular context, by democracy as instrumental for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and for holding the country together. When evaluated by democracy‟s minimum definition and <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> Indian democracy is successful. However, fulfilling these <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> {{is not enough for}} measuring the general success of Indian democracy. Given India‟s particular context as a country with many languages, cultures, religions and social structures with tensions between them, an evaluation of democracy as an instrument for conflict prevention and resolution is a must. In this respect, democracy, as a system of rights that protects, incorporates and respects minorities, allows expression and is responsive to citizen‟s demands, is effectively instrumental, and thus successful, for the peaceful resolution of conflicts. However, Indian democracy still has many challenges. When democracy stops listening and responding to people‟s demands, starts going against freedoms and rights, and doesn‟t respect minorities, conflicts arise. Therefore, for preventing these conflicts and avoid „a million mutinies ‟ (Naipaul, 1990), democracy has to work. It is in the combination of these two features (democracy measured by its definition and as instrumental) where Indian democracy‟s success lies...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that only a small {{percentage}} of patents actually appear on the market as a new technology and / or product (AUTM US Licensing Activity Survey [2010]). Moreover, where the protection of IP remains partial, the possibilities of corporate interest in university knowledge are drastically reduced. Here we can identify the telling necessity for more comprehensive, in-depth studies to get a better handle on the issues facing a researcher’s decision not to patent. It is possibly the bureaucratic measures and the time taken to grant a patent that affect a researcher’s incentive, or maybe it is the general lack of disclosure on patenting procedures, which cause a researcher’s discouragement. The role of TTO (Technological Transfer Offices) is therefore essential to elucidating the matter.

40|$|Abstract. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) {{is widely}} used in {{diagnostic}} practice and research, but it is limited due to its subjective nature and weakness in reproducibility. For successful interpretation, IHC requires an internal reference system that controls for procedural variables and provides a staining intensity reference.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse (BALB/c) spleen tissue was stained with variable <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> including primary antibody (Ab) types, antigen retrieval methods, chromogen exposure times, and secondary Ab concentrations. Mouse spleen tissue showed identical staining intensity regardless of primary Ab types, even without primary Ab, and showed minimal differences according to retrieval methods. However, it showed various staining intensities according to chromogen exposure time and secondary Ab concentration. When mouse spleen was included in tissue microarrays and compared with the c-erbB 2 IHC scoring system, splenic B cells showed weak membrane staining compatible with score 1 +, whereas splenic plasma cells showed strong staining intensity compatible with score 3 +.

40|$|Norman Daniels’ {{theory of}} justice and health faces a serious {{practical}} problem: his theory can ground the special moral importance of health and allows distinguishing just from unjust health inequalities, but it provides little practical guidance for allocating resources when they are especially scarce. Daniels’ {{solution to this problem}} is a fair process that he specifies as “accountability for reasonableness”. Daniels claims that accountability for reasonableness makes limit-setting decisions in healthcare not only legitimate, but also fair. This paper assesses the latter claim. Does accountability for reasonableness result in fair limit-setting decisions? It is argued that {{the answer to this question}} is not a clear yes. Daniels is remarkably unclear about the criterion of fairness that accountability for reasonableness satisfies. The paper discusses different options for resolving this lack of clarity and examines how they apply to Daniels’ accountability for reasonableness framework. It is concluded, first, that accountability for reasonableness is not a paradigm case of any of the classic notions of procedural justice; second, that what might be called “constrained pure procedural justice” best reflects how accountability for reasonableness results in fair limit-setting decisions; and third, that the <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> of accountability for reasonableness must be further specified and amended to better achieve a fair process, and hence fair limit-setting decisions...|$|R

The object {{of this research is}} to estimate the extent of convergence of majority choice under different <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions.</b> The paper reports results from a computer simulation of simple-majority decision making by committees. Simulation experiments generate distributions of majority-adopted proposals in two-dimensional space. These represent nondeterministic outcomes of majority choice by committees. The proposal distributions provide data for a quantitative evaluation of committee-choice procedures in respect to outcome convergence. Experiments were run under general conditions, and under conditions that restrict committee choice to several game-theoretic solution sets. The findings are that, compared to distributions of voter ideal points, majority-adopted proposals confined to the solution sets demonstrate different degrees of convergence. Second, endogenous agenda formation is a more important obstacle to convergence than the inherent instability of simple-majority rule. Third, if members maximize preferences in respect to agenda formation, a committee choice that approximates the central tendency of the distribution of voter preferences is unlikely. The conclusion is that {{the most effective way to}} increase the convergence of majority choice is to restrict the role of individual preferences in agenda formation: identification of proposals to be voted up or down by a committee.

40|$|Background: Transradial artery (TRA) left heart {{catheterization}} is {{an increasingly}} used technique for both diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures. This study evaluates {{the incidence of}} access site complications in the current interventional era. Methods and results: A total of 507 procedures were performed under standardized conditions. Each procedure was performed using high levels of anticoagulation, hydrophilic sheaths, and short post-procedural compression times. Vascular complications were assessed one day after TRA catheterization using Duplex sonography and classified according to the necessity of additional medical intervention. A simple questionnaire helped identifying upper extremity neurologic or motor complications. Vascular complications were detected in 12 patients (2. 36 %) : radial artery occlusion was detected in 9 patients (1. 77 %), 1 patient developed an AV-fistula (0. 19 %), and 2 patients had pseudoaneurysms (0. 38 %).

Various S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus strains were exposed to ceftriaxone and cefazolin at concentrations from 0 to 1000 μg/mL under subnormothermic and normothermic conditions in PS. To mimic <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions,</b> the effect of cefazolin was determined after exposure of bacteria to 20 -hr incubation at 28 °C in the presence of cefazolin and subsequent incubation at 37 °C in the absence of cefazolin. The toxicity of cefazolin was assessed by cell viability and caspase activation assays in porcine kidney endothelial cells. Without antibiotics, PS sustained bacterial growth under sub(normothermic) conditions, whereas growth was absent in cold preservation solutions. Cefazolin exhibited greater bactericidal effect on S. epidermidis than ceftriaxone. However, after inoculating PS with 10 colony-forming units/mL, only a cefazolin concentration of 1000 μg/mL was able to exert a complete bactericidal effect on S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains and maintain sterility after removal of cefazolin. Finally, 1000 μg/mL cefazolin showed no adverse effects on porcine kidney endothelial cells. Based on these findings, we recommend that high-dose cefazolin be used for prophylaxis in (sub) normothermic organ preservation with P...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a procedural justice policing intervention on citizens’ feelings of obligation to obey police. It examines whether the efficacy of procedural justice on citizens’ obligation to obey police may be contingent on citizens’ level of trust in police during a police–citizen encounter. Methods: This research draws on survey data from the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET). QCET was a randomized controlled field trial implemented by the Queensland Police Service. The trial exposed citizens to either a procedural justice experience (experimental condition) or standard police practice (control condition) during a random roadside stop. Survey responses were received from 1107 drivers in the experimental condition and 1655 drivers in the control condition. Results: Compared to the control <b>condition,</b> the <b>procedural</b> justice <b>condition</b> yielded higher levels of trust in the police officer conducting the roadside stop. No differences in obligation to obey police were observed between the two conditions. Importantly, citizens’ level of trust in the officer moderated the effect of the intervention on obligation to obey police. Specifically, the <b>procedural</b> justice <b>condition</b> had a negative effect on obligation to obey for those reporting low trust in police. For those high in trust, the procedural justice intervention had a slight but insignificant positive effect on obligation to obey. Conclusions: The findings suggest that procedural justice effects can vary between individuals; specifically, the findings reveal that procedural justice interventions can sometimes be counter-productive, depending on the level of trust a citizen exhibits toward police during an encounter. Police agencies should therefore be aware of potential counter-productive effects when implementing procedural justice in the field.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that public health practice raises ethical issues {{that require a}} different approach than traditional biomedical ethics. Several frameworks for public health ethics have been proposed, however, none of them provides a practice-oriented {{combination of the two}} necessary components: (1) A set of normative criteria based on an explicit ethical justification and (2) a structured methodological approach for applying the resulting normative criteria to concrete public health issues. Building on prior work in the field and integrating valuable elements of other approaches to public health ethics, we present a systematic ethical framework that shall guide professionals in planning, conducting, and evaluating public health interventions. Based on a coherentist model of ethical justification, the proposed framework contains (1) an explicit normative foundation with five substantive criteria and seven <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> to guarantee a fair decision process, and (2) a six-step methodological approach for applying the criteria and conditions to the practice of public health and health policy. The framework explicitly ties together ethical analysis and empirical evidence, thus striving for evidence-based public health ethics. It shall provide normative guidance to those who analyze the ethical implications of public health practice including academic ethicists, health policy makers, health technology assessment bodies, and public health professionals. It will enable those who implement a public health intervention and those affected by it (i. e. the target population) to critically assess whether and how the required ethical considerations have been taken into account. Thereby, the framework can contribute to assuring the quality of ethical analysis in public health.

Remifentanil for maintenance is an ideal choice, but optimal doses are yet to be determined. Materials and Methods: Bronchoscopic procedures were prospectively evaluated for 4 months studying the frequency of complications and anesthesia techniques. Anesthesia was maintained on remifentanil/propofol infusion avoiding neuromuscular blockers. Laryngeal mask airway {{was used for the}} controlled ventilation (with high oxygen concentration) that also served as a conduit for bronchoscope insertions. Anesthesiologists were blinded to the study (avoiding performance bias) and the Pulmonologist was blinded to the anesthesia technique (to document unbiased procedural satisfaction scores). Procedures were divided into 2 groups based on the dose of remifentanil used for maintenance: Group-H (high dose − 0. 26 to 0. 5 μg/kg/min and Group-NH (non-high dose ≤ 0. 25 μg/kg/min). Results: Observed 75 procedures were divided into Group-H (42) and Group-NH (33). Number of statistical difference was found in demography, procedural profile, hemodynamic parameters and total phenylephrine used. Chi-square test showed Group-NH had significantly higher frequency of laryngospasm (P = 0. 047) and coughing (P = 0. 002).

The study observation period ran from November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients admitted to the ICU who underwent a WoWt procedure in compliance with the terms of the French Leonetti’s law governing end-of-life care [14]. The determinants and <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> governing WoWt decisions follow the French Intensive Care Society guidelines [15]. When current or further life-sustaining treatments appear to be of no overall benefit for a patient, physicians must respect a collegial procedure before making any WoWt decision. The procedure takes into account the patient’s wishes spontaneously expressed or written in advance directives, the opinion of the trusted person, {{as well as that of}} the family and close relations. The procedure involves an independent corroboration of the diagnosis and prognosis. In our unit, criteria for withholding or withdrawing treatment are: advanced or terminal stage of a severe and incurable disease, absence of curative strategy, adequate period of time to confirm treatment failure, no additional information needed for decision-making, very high age, limited functional autonomy before hospital admission, limited subsequent functional autonomy, limited subsequent relational quality-of-life, patient’s wish to limit treatment, perception of unreasonable obstinacy voiced by patient’s loved ones [15]. WoWt measures implemented may involve cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilatory support, inotropic drugs, dialysis, antibiotics, transfusion, urgent surgery, nutrition, and hydration. Measures agreed on and arguments ensuing collegial debates are recorded in the patient's chart. Patient’s next-of-kin and staff are fully informed. If the patient is still conscious and able to give assent, his agreement to the WoWt features is thoroughly searched and confirmed.|$|R
40|$|A {{validated}} simple, rapid, {{sensitive and}} specific square-wave voltammetric technique is described for {{the determination of}} acebutolol (AC) following its accumulation onto a hanging mercury drop electrode in a Britton-Robinson universal buffer of pH 7. 5. The optimal <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> were: accumulation potential Eacc = - 0. 8 V versus Ag/AgCl/KCl, accumulation duration tacc = 30 s, pulse-amplitude = 70 mV, scan rate = 100 mV/s, frequency = 30 Hz, surface area of the working electrode = 0. 6 mm 2 and the convection rate = 2000 rpm. Under these optimized conditions, the adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) peak current was proportional over the concentration range 5 × 10 - 7 - 6 × 10 - 6 M (r = 0. 999). Recoveries for acebutolol from human plasma and urine were in the range 97 - 103 % and 96 - 104 % respectively. The method proved to be precise (intra-day precision expressed as %RSD in human plasma ranged from 2. 9 - 3. 2 % and inter-day precision expressed as %RSD ranged from 3. 4 - 3. 8 %) and accurate (intra-day accuracies expressed as % error in human urine ranged from - 3. 3 - 2. 8 % and inter-day accuracies ranged from - 3. 3 - 1. 7 %). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) for acebutolol were 1. 7 × 10 - 7 and 5 × 10 - 7 M, respectively. Possible interferences by substances usually present in the pharmaceutical formulations were investigated with a mean recovery of 101. 6 ± 0. 64 %. Results of the developed square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry (SW-AdSV) method were comparable with those obtained by reference analytical method...|$|R
40|$|Background Priority {{setting in}} {{healthcare}} {{is a key}} determinant of health system performance. However, there is no widely accepted priority setting evaluation framework. We reviewed literature {{with the aim of}} developing and proposing a framework for the evaluation of macro and meso level healthcare priority setting practices. Methods We systematically searched Econlit, PubMed, CINAHL, and EBSCOhost databases and supplemented this with searches in Google Scholar, relevant websites and reference lists of relevant papers. A total of 31 papers on evaluation of priority setting were identified. These were supplemented by broader theoretical literature related to evaluation of priority setting. A conceptual review of selected papers was undertaken. Results Based on a synthesis of the selected literature, we propose an evaluative framework that requires that priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels of the health system meet the following conditions: (1) Priority setting decisions should incorporate both efficiency and equity considerations as well as the following outcomes; (a) Stakeholder satisfaction, (b) Stakeholder understanding, (c) Shifted priorities (reallocation of resources), and (d) Implementation of decisions. (2) Priority setting processes should also meet the <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions</b> of (a) Stakeholder engagement, (b) Stakeholder empowerment, (c) Transparency, (d) Use of evidence, (e) Revisions, (f) Enforcement, and (g) Being grounded on community values. Conclusion Available frameworks for the evaluation of priority setting are mostly grounded on procedural requirements, while few have included outcome requirements. There is, however, increasing recognition of the need to incorporate both consequential and procedural considerations in priority setting practices. In this review, we adapt an integrative approach to develop and propose a framework for the evaluation of priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels that draws from these complementary schools of thought...|$|R
40|$|Background. In 2007, a Dutch {{guideline}} for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) {{was composed}} that advocates the critical view of safety (CVS) to prevent bile duct injury (BDI). Conversion to open cholecystectomy is recommended in complicated cholecystectomy, but young surgeons are hardly trained in this procedure. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the accuracy of dictated operation notes, the use of CVS before and after guideline implementation, and the severity of injury after conversion. Methods. Between 1990 and 2012, 800 patients were referred for treatment of BDL All available operation notes (n = 528; 66 %) were scored for <b>procedural</b> <b>conditions,</b> reasons for conversion, the use of safety measures, and postoperative care in BDI patients. Results. Patient demographics, indication for cholecystectomy, conversion rates, and injury type were comparable to the. total cohort of BDI patients. LC (n = 479; 91 %) was converted in 180 patients (34 %). The CVS technique or dissection of Calot's triangle were reported in 33 patients (6. 3 %) and, 87 patients (16. 5 %), respectively. Guideline implementation increased the reporting of CVS from 4 % (16 / 425) to 17 % (17 / 103; P <. 001), and the consultation of a hepatic-pancreatic-biliary (HPB) colleague from 3 % (14 / 425) to 8 % (8 / 103; P <. 01). Conversion to open surgery leads to more complex injury (Bismuth III V injury rate of 34 % [24 / 64] vs 65 % [46 / 116]; P=. 013). Conclusion. The insufficient use of safety measures to prevent BDI during LC in this selected patient group is of concern. Although guideline implementation significantly improved the use of CVS during LC, further improvement is necessary. Conversion cannot simply be used as an "escape" procedure, because this may lead to more complex injur...|$|R
