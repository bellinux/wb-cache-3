5|$|With the {{delivery}} of Class 93, NSB started to retire or sell the Di 3. In November 2001, five units were sold for NOK 250,000 each—well under market price—to the new private operator Ofotbanen. The purchase raised controversy, because the potential operator Banetransport had offered full market <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the trains. One year after delivery, six of eleven Class 93-locomotives were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di 3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the short-term rental back.|$|E

40|$|The {{reference}} price system in Slovenia is {{used with the}} aim of managing and reducing public expenditures for medicinal products.

We present the reference <b>price</b> regulation system <b>for</b> medicinal products and empirically estimate the effect of price regulation on the development of real <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> medicinal products and its economic rationale. The main thesis that the nominal and real <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> medicinal products have declined during price regulation is revealed by the Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test, by confirming the existence of statistically significant differences in <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> medicinal products. Therefore, we adopt the alternative hypothesis that <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> medicinal products have declined during the price regulation system.
