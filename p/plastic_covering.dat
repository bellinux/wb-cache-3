500|$|Construction of {{the outdoor}} rink began on December 24, {{the day after}} the Buffalo Bills played their last home game of the 2007 NFL season. It was built between the 16-yard lines of the {{football}} field, under the supervision of NHL facilities operations manager Dan Craig. Initially, six inches (150mm) [...] of the nine-inch (230mm) crown of the football field had to be leveled using styrofoam insulation. On top of the newly created flat surface, three inches (75mm) of plywood with <b>plastic</b> <b>covering</b> were laid as a base for the necessary piping. At the same time the boards were being put in place, an inch of sand was spread amongst the piping and was then wet by a combination of hoses and timely rain so it could freeze into a rink overnight and be painted four days before the game. Another ¾ of an inch of ice was added to complete the playing surface.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{began in}} Chott el Djerid, while a {{construction}} crew in Tozeur took eight weeks {{to transform the}} desert into the desired setting. Other locations included the sand dunes of the Tunisian desert near Nafta, where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make {{their way across the}} sands was filmed. When actor Anthony Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit {{for the first time in}} Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the <b>plastic</b> <b>covering</b> his left foot, stabbing him. He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion. Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control. Kenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2, said: [...] "I was incredibly grateful each time an [...] would actually work right." [...] After several scenes were filmed against the volcanic canyons outside Tozeur, production moved to Matmata to film Luke's home on Tatooine. Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead. Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at Death Valley in North America.|$|E

40|$|This work used {{different}} types of recycled PVC products including PVC pipes and bottles, as rigid recyclates, and PVC <b>plastic</b> <b>coverings,</b> as soft recyclate. The PVC recyclates were added into virgin PVC foam, ranging from 0 - 100 wt%. The PVC blends were then moulded with different processing temperatures, and their properties were monitored. It {{was found that the}} concentration of the pipe recyclates up to 60 wt% could be used to add into the PVC virgin for production of rigid PVC foam products. The higher the recyclate content led to the higher the blend density and the mechanical properties (flexural and impact strength, and hardness). For bottle recyclates, up to 60 wt% of bottle recyclates could be used for rigid PVC foam production, but the overall properties, except for the impact strength, of the PVC foam did not improve withincreasing the recycled bottles. For recycled <b>coverings,</b> increasing <b>plastic</b> <b>coverings</b> led to an increase in average cell size, but resulted in decreases of impact and hardness resistances. The flexible or soft PVC foam products could be manufactured with use of 0 - 100 wt% recycled coverings. In summary, it could be concludedthat recyclates of pipes, bottles and <b>plastic</b> <b>coverings</b> can be mixed with virgin PVC foam for making foam products...|$|R

40|$|A produção de mudas de café nas regiões sul e sudeste do Brasil é prejudicada por eventuais geadas. A proteção de mudas de café produzidas em tubetes e saquinhos plásticos com camadas simples e duplas de polietileno preto e branco trançado foi avaliada em Londrina, Estado do Paraná, durante o inverno de 2000. As mudas produzidas nos dois tipos de recipientes foram também avaliadas em câmara fria, com a finalidade de verificar a vulnerabilidade do sistema radicular. As temperaturas das folhas próximas ao sistema radicular foram monitoradas com pares termoelétricos conectados a um datalogger. Os resultados mostraram que camadas duplas de coberturas plásticas sobre as mudas são eficientes para reduzir a queda de temperatura noturna das folhas, podendo contribuir para proteção contra geadas. As mudas produzidas em tubetes apresentaram temperaturas menores nas raízes, indicando maior suscetibilidade a danos por geadas. Tais resultados indicam que se deve tomar cuidados extras de proteção de viveiros com mudas em tubetes para se evitar maiores prejuízos com geadasThe {{production}} of coffee seedlings {{in the south}} and southeast regions of Brazil is constrained by eventual frosts. The protection of coffee seedlings, which are grown by the utilization of containers and <b>plastic</b> <b>coverings,</b> was evaluated in Londrina, State of Parana, during the winter of 2000.

The temperatures of leaves and root system were monitored by thermocouples connected to a data logger. The results of this experiment showed that <b>plastic</b> <b>coverings</b> of double layers were efficient to protect the seedlings against low night temperature of leaves. The seedlings produced in containers showed lower temperatures in the roots, which suggests more susceptibility to frost damages.

5000|$|The [...] "brain" [...] {{behind the}} click-wheel is the {{conductive}} membrane behind the <b>plastic</b> <b>covering.</b> This membrane has [...] "channels" [...] that when connected, create {{a set of}} coordinates. These channels are conductors, which when connected to another conductor (a finger in this case), try to send a current through the user's finger, but are blocked by the <b>plastic</b> <b>covering</b> the click-wheel. So instead of passing through the plastic, the current creates a charge at the closest location to the finger, which {{is also known as}} capacitance. The component that detects this change in capacitance is the controller. Whenever the controller senses a change, it sends a signal to the microprocessor, which performs the desired action. The faster a finger moves around the wheel, the more concentrated the stream of signals it sends out. The moment the finger leaves the wheel, however, is when the controller stops detecting change in capacitance, therefore stopping the current process.|$|E
