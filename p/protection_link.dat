This particular link is called the Ring <b>Protection</b> <b>Link</b> (RPL), and under normal conditions this ring link is blocked, i.e. not used for service traffic. One designated Ethernet Ring Node, the RPL Owner Node, is responsible for blocking traffic at one end of the RPL.Under an Ethernet ring failure condition, the RPL Owner Node is responsible for unblocking its end of the RPL (unless the RPL has failed) allowing the RPL to be used for traffic.

40|$|Ethernet {{technologies}} have evolved through enormous standardization efforts {{over the past}} two decades to achieve carrier-grade functionalities, leading to carrier Ethernet. Carrier Ethernet is expected to dominate next generation backbone networks due to its low-cost and simplicity. Ethernet's ability to provide carrier-grade Layer- 2 protection switching with SONET/SDH-like fast restoration time is achieved by a new protection switching protocol, Ethernet Ring Protection (ERP). In this thesis, we address two important design aspects of carrier Ethernet networks, namely, survivable design of ERP-based Ethernet transport networks together with energy efficient network design. For the former, we address the problem of optimal resource allocation while designing logical ERP for deployment and model the combinatorially complex problem of joint Ring <b>Protection</b> <b>Link</b> (RPL) placements and ring hierarchies selection as an optimization problem. We develop several Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to solve the problem optimally considering both single link failure and concurrent dual link failure scenarios. We also present a traffic engineering based ERP design approach and develop corresponding MILP design models for configuring either single or multiple logical ERP instances over one underlying physical ring. For the latter, we propose two novel architectures of energy efficient Ethernet switches using passive optical correlators for optical bypassing as well as using energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) ports for traffic aggregation and forwarding. We develop an optimal frame scheduling model for EEE ports to ensure minimal energy consumption by using packet coalescing and efficient scheduling...|$|E

40|$|Path <b>protection</b> and <b>link</b> <b>protection</b> schemes are {{the main}} means of {{protecting}} wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks from the losses caused by a link failure such as a fiber cut. We propose a new protection scheme, which we term partial path protection (PPP), to select end-to-end backup paths using local information about network failures. PPP designates a different restoration path for every link failure of every primary path. PPP allows the re-use of operational segments of the original primary path in the protection path. A novel approach used in this paper {{is that of a}} dynamic call-by-call model with blocking probability as the performance metric. This is in contrast with traditional approaches to restoration, which consider capacity-efficiency for batch call arrivals. Since optimizing the blocking probability is a large dynamic optimization problem, we present two heuristics for implementing PPP. We show that a simple method based on shortest path routing for which primary paths are selected first is more effective than a greedy approach that minimizes, for each call arrival, the number of wavelengths used by the primary and backup path jointly. Protection Schemes Path <b>protection</b> (PP) and <b>link</b> <b>protection</b> schemes are the current main approaches of protecting wavelengthdivision multiplexed (WDM) networks against the losses caused by a link failure such as a fiber cut [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Basically, PP requires the protection path of a request to be completely link-disjoint from the corresponding primary path, while the <b>link</b> <b>protection</b> scheme reroutes all affected requests over a set of prescheduled paths between the two nodes terminating the failed link. In general, PP is more capacity efficient than <b>link</b> <b>protection</b> [4]. In this paper, we propose a new protection scheme, the partial path protection (PPP) scheme. In PPP, the system specifies a specific end-to-end protection path for each link along the primary path. Thus, just like PP, PPP also assigns “end-to-end ” protection paths to primary paths, however, in PPP, a single protection path protects only one specific link failure on a primar...|$|R

Both naïve and memory CD 4 + T cells initially proliferated exponentially, and the accumulation of memory T cells in the lung correlated with early bacterial control. However, later during infection, memory CD 4 + T cell proliferation was curtailed and no protection was observed. We show that memory CD 4 + T cells are first activated in the LN and their recruitment to the lung attenuates bacterial growth.

40|$|Shared Segment Protection (SSP), {{compared}} with Shared Path Protection (SPP), and Shared <b>Link</b> <b>Protection</b> (SLP), provides an optimal protection configuration {{due to the}} ability of maximizing spare capacity sharing, and reducing the restoration time in cases of a single link failure. This paper provides a thorough study on SSP under the GMPLS-based recovery framework, where an effective survivable routing algorithm for SSP is proposed. The tradeoff between the price (i. e., cost representing the amount of resources, and the blocking probability), and the restoration time is extensively studied by simulations on three networks with highly dynamic traffic. We demonstrate that the proposed survivable routing algorithm can be a powerful solution for meeting stringent delay upper bounds for achieving high restorability of transport services. This can significantly improve the network reliability, and enable more advanced, mission critical services in the networks. The comparison among the three protection types further verifies that the proposed scheme can yield significant advantages over Shared Path <b>Protection,</b> and Shared <b>Link</b> <b>Protection...</b>|$|R

As opposed to the <b>link</b> or path <b>protection</b> schemes, the segment protection scheme has been less studied although it offers an interesting compromise between those two protection schemes, attempting to encompass all their advantages. We investigate two different Shared Segment Protection (SSP) schemes: Basic Shared Segment Protection (BSSP) and Shared Segment Protection with segment Overlap (SSPO), and propose a design of 100 % single segment protections. In SSPO, we study the extra protection capabilities, node failure and dual link failure survivability, offered by the single 100 % single segment protection. For both BSSP and SSPO schemes, we propose two novel efficient ILP formulations, based on a column generation mathematical modeling. While (SSPO) offers the advantage over (BSSP) to ensure both node and <b>link</b> <b>protection,</b> it is not necessarily much more costly. Indeed, depending on the network topology and the traffic instances, it can be shown that none of the two SSP schemes dominates the other one.

40|$|Abstract—Backup paths {{are widely}} used to protect IP links from failures. Existing {{solutions}} such as the commonly used in-dependent and Shared Risk Link Group models do not accurately reflect the correlation between IP link failures, and thus may not choose reliable backup paths. We propose a cross-layer approach for IP <b>link</b> <b>protection.</b> We develop a correlated failure probability (CFP) model to quantify the impact of an IP link failure on the reliability of backup paths. With the CFP model, we propose two algorithms for selecting backup paths. The first algorithm focuses on choosing the backup paths with minimum failure probability. The second algorithm further considers the bandwidth constraint and aims at minimizing the traffic disruption caused by failures. It also ensures that the rerouted traffic load on each IP link does not exceed the usable bandwidth to avoid interfering with the normal traffic. Simulations based on real ISP networks show that our approach can choose backup paths that are more reliable and achieve better <b>protection.</b> Index Terms—IP <b>link,</b> <b>protection,</b> cross-layer, backup path, mode...|$|R
