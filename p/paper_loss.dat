40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the underreaction of investors to information. In order to study the {{adjustment}} of prices to a fundamental value, we implement experimental markets with fluctuating fundamental values. The experimental design employed involves two treatments differentiated according to the information disclosed to the participants. The results show an underreaction to a change in the fundamental value. This underreaction is greatest when most of the subjects are facing a <b>paper</b> <b>loss.</b> This suggests that the disposition effect has a strong impact on price formation. Once most of the subjects are in a paper gain situation, the underreaction is at its lowest level when they receive good news. Thus, underreaction to information is influenced by paper gains and losses...|$|E

In an axis-symmetric swirl generator test rig the screen performance is measured under well-defined swirling conditions.

These balances result in directional loss coefficients. Especially the in-plane coefficients can be accurately determined. In contrast, the normal component can more accurately be determined in a basic wind-tunnel set up. Subsequently, the obtained coefficients {{are used in the}} FLOTHERM volume resistance model. The numerical results are validated against fan measurements. The effect of the screen on the tangential velocity component is very well predicted by the model. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} recent {{movements}} in closed-end emerging markets funds present a strong {{challenge to the}} leading explanations {{of the behavior of}} closed-end country fund prices. In particular, closed-end funds dedicated to Mexico and other Latin American stock markets developed large premia after the December 1994 devaluation of the Mexican peso and the subsequent financial crisis. The so-called “investor sentiment hypothesis” could explain these events only by suggesting that investors became very optimistic about emerging markets stocks, and especially Mexican stocks; this possibility seems unlikely given the facts surrounding the devaluation. We argue instead that a sensible explanation for recent dynamics of closed-end country funds is that investors in these funds are loss-averse, implying that {{they do not want to}} realize <b>paper</b> <b>losses</b> on their closed-end fund shares. This works to put a drag on the downward movement in closed-end fund prices. ...|$|R

The cable {{is meant to}} be used for the outer layer of the magnets. It is a trapezium-shaped (key-stoned) Rutherford cable. The experimental results were obtained in a Twente test facility. Magnetization loss measurements as well as transport current loss measurements were performed. The results are compared with classical loss models. From the magnetization experiments the coupling time constant of the cable at different magnetic fields can be obtained. It is also possible to estimate the critical current density from these measurements. The critical current and the effective transverse resistivity are important for calculations concerning the loss during ramping the magnetic field and the field disturbance due to shielding currents in the filaments and to the coupling currents...|$|E

40|$|The {{coagulation}} of myosin {{that occurs}} when muscle contracts, or when it stiffens in rigor, differs from the coagulation of myosin and other proteins produced by denaturing agents, such as heat, acid, alkali, urea, ultraviolet light, and surface action (Mirsky, 1935 - 36). When proteins become insoluble due to the effect on them {{of any of these}} agents, there is an accompanying change in their sulfhydryl and disulfide groups (Mirsky and Anson, 1935 - 36). Groups that are not detectable in the native state become detectable when the protein is denatured, that is, when after being treated with certain agents it becomes insoluble under conditions under which it was previously soluble. No change in its SH groups takes place, however, when myosin becomes insoluble in rigor. It has recently been found that in fertilization a similar change occurs in the proteins of the egg (Mirsky, 1936); as in muscle a protein becomes insoluble without a change in groups. In muscle and in the egg as much as a third of the total protein may coagulate. It is important for an understanding of the changes that take place in muscle and in the egg to find a type of coagulation that occurs in vitro in which loss of solubility is not accompanied by changes in SH and S-S groups. In the coagulation of myosin caused by dehydration, it will be shown in this <b>paper,</b> <b>loss</b> of solubility occurs without a change in groups; and in this respect coagulation by dehydration is, of all the many ways of coagulating a protein in vitro, the only change in protein known to resemble that which has been observed to occur in the cell. Water is removed from the protein by both freezing and drying, that is, by subjecting the protein to a low temperature in a vacuum desiccator which is continually evacuated. The kinetics of the coagulation process have not been studied. There are in the literature a few scattered references to the effect o...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} effect {{describes the}} tendency to sell winners (stocks with a paper gain) and hold losers (stocks with a <b>paper</b> <b>loss).</b> The disposition effect has been documented in many empirical studies. Given the amount of evidence for the disposition effect, it is natural to ask why investors tend to behave this way. This question is addressed in Chapter 1. I review existing explanations and argue {{that none of them}} is satisfactory because they either fail to capture the disposition effect or because they are not supported by empirical evidence. I point out that there is a large psychological literature on entrapment, escalation of commitment, and sunk cost, that studies phenomena that are very similar to the disposition effect. This literature suggests an explanation of the disposition effect based on cognitive dissonance theory. Chapter 2 deals with the question how market prices are affected by the disposition effect. I study the time series of equilibrium returns in a model with a representative investor. The main result is that the disposition effect implies trend continuation: Prior gains are on average followed by high returns, prior losses are on average followed by low returns. This general conclusion stems from the negative feedback nature of the disposition effect. If investors like to hold losers and do not like to hold winners, then - in equilibrium - {{there has to be a}} reward (a higher expected return) for holding winners and selling losers In Chapter 3 I study trading volume under the assumption of the disposition effect. By linking current asset demand to prior gains or losses the disposition effect motivates trade and brings about patterns in equilibrium returns. I argue that the patterns in trade and returns generated by the disposition effect are broadly consistent with the evidence on momentum and trading volume. Chapter 4 studies the influence of prior gains or losses on risk taking in an experiment...|$|E
