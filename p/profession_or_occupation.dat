"But {{whatever}} {{claims to}} eminence Dr. Franklin may {{have as a}} politician or a scholar, {{there is no point}} of light in which his character shines with more lustre than when we view him as a man or a citizen.

Nothing ever passed through his hands without receiving improvement, and no person ever went into his company without gaining wisdom. His sagacity was so sharp and his science so various, that, whatever might be the <b>profession</b> <b>or</b> <b>occupation</b> of those with whom he conversed, he could meet every one upon his own ground.

The analysis of the traditional occupational impact requested the application of a sociological research, effected on the field, in order to gain statistic decision support, adjusted to the specific of animals breeding activities and especially to sheep. The most important risk is that traditional sheep breeders tend to become mere historic references and are not replaced by other <b>professions</b> <b>or</b> <b>occupations</b> in rural areas, which seem to disintegrate due to lack of support, to much too high burdens [...] .
