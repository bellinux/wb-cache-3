Indeed, the von Neumann computing architecture, that physically and temporally separates processing and memory, was born more of pragmatism based on available technology.

40|$|Reservoir {{computing}} is a bioinspired computing {{paradigm for}} processing time-dependent signals. Its hardware implementations have received much attention {{because of their}} simplicity and remarkable performance {{on a series of}} benchmark tasks. In previous experiments, the output was uncoupled from the system and, in most cases, simply computed off-line on a postprocessing computer. However, numerical investigations have shown that feeding the output back into the reservoir opens the possibility of long-horizon time-series forecasting. Here, we present a <b>photonic</b> reservoir <b>computer</b> with output feedback, and we demonstrate its capacity to generate periodic time series and to emulate chaotic systems.

Our work significantly enlarges the range of tasks that can be solved by hardware reservoir computers and, therefore, the range of applications they could potentially tackle.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the power of photonic resources, as viewed from several different but related perspectives. They range from quantum computation, precision parameter estimation to the thermodynamics of relativistic quantum systems, as applied to cosmology in particular. The use of photonic states allows us to address several important questions about the resources required in quantum mechanical processes. In chapter 1, we propose a new quantum computational model, called the `power of one qumode', that relies mainly on a single-mode photonic squeezed state. In particular, we show the amount of squeezing can quantitatively relate the resource requirements of factoring to the problem of finding the trace of large unitary matrices, a result with consequences for understanding how powerful quantum computation really is. Furthermore, we can connect squeezing to other known resources like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality and qubit number, which is a useful stepping stone to finding the resources that enable quantum computation. In chapter 2, we exploit the quantum mechanical properties of photonic states for use in precision parameter estimation of general linear optical processes, which is useful for a diverse number of applications, from characterising an unknown process in a <b>photonic</b> quantum <b>computer</b> to biological imaging. We introduce a formalism that quantifies this improvement in precision. We also provide conditions under which one can easily check for photonic states that are optimal to use in this context, which is a potentially important result for future experimental efforts. In chapter 3, we explore the connection between two-mode squeezed states, commonly used in quantum optics, and relativistic quantum processes, in particular in cosmology. Using this connection, we apply recently developed tools from the thermodynamics of quantum systems perturbed far from equilibrium to address an old question of entropy production in cosmology from a surprising new angle. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} realisation of a <b>photonic</b> quantum <b>computer</b> {{requires a}} reliable, fast, ondemand source of single indistinguishable photons. A promising candidate {{for one of}} these sources is a single dye molecule in a solid state matrix placed within the evanescent field of a photonic waveguide. This thesis explores the possibility of coupling of single dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules in an anthracene matrix to a silicon nitride waveguide at room temperature. I first discuss the theory by which photons from a DBT molecule can be evanescently coupled to a ridge waveguide. I present a novel growth method to form DBT-doped anthracene crystals which is very promising for applications to photonic devices. I discuss the methodology and the theory of such growth. I describe the confocal microscope I developed and used to image and characterise the emission of the single DBT molecules embedded in these crystals. My measurements show that the molecules are extremely stable single quantum emitters with a well-de ned polarization relative to the crystal axes. Measurements of the saturation intensity at room temperature allow me to estimate that a single DBT molecule could deliver at least 1012 photons before bleaching. This method of growth was used to deposit DBT molecules on top of a silicon nitride ridge waveguide. The results of the coupling experiment are shown. These include confocal images, saturation and lifetime measurements. The coupling efficiency is calculated and compared to what was simulated. The challenges of such structures are then presented. To tackle these challenges I deposited the molecules on top of lithium niobate and in silicon nitride slots. I conclude with a proposal for constructing the best photonic structure which would guarantee an easy deposition of the molecules and high coupling efficiencies. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Speculative {{transmission}} {{has been}} proposed to overcome the high latency of setting up end-to-end paths through <b>photonic</b> networks for <b>computer</b> systems. However, speculative transmission has implications for the energy efficiency of the network, in particular, control circuits are more complex and power hungry and failed speculative transmissions must be repeated. Moreover, in future chip multiprocessors (CMPs) with integrated photonic network end points, {{a large proportion of}} the additional energy will be dissipated on the CMP. This paper compares the energy characteristics of scheduled and speculative chip-to-chip networks for shared memory computer systems on the scale of a rack. For this comparison, we use a novel speculative control plane which reduces energy consumption by eliminating duplicate packets from the allocation process. In addition, we consider photonic power gating to reduce processor chip energy dissipation and the energy impact of the choice between semiconductor optical amplifier and ring resonator switching technologies. We model photonic network elements using values from the published literature as well as determine the power consumption of the allocator and network adapter circuits, implemented in a commercial low leakage 45 nm CMOS process. The power dissipated on the CMP using speculative networks is shown to be roughly double that of scheduled networks at saturation load and an order of magnitude higher at low loads.
