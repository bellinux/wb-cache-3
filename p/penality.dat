40|$|The {{thesis is}} a socio-legal account of Italian <b>penality</b> between 1970 and 2000. It {{analyses}} the Italian {{experience as a}} critical case study with which to test David Garland, Alessandro De Giorgi and Nicola Lacey’s theories of punishment in contemporary Western polities. It argues that Italian <b>penality</b> is not sufficiently explained by reference to Garland or De Giorgi’s meta theories of ‘late modern’ and ‘post-Fordist’ punishment. Lacey’s institutional analysis provides a better framework, if modified {{to allow for the}} centrality of political dynamics in Italy. The thesis argues that Italian <b>penality</b> is a ‘volatile penal equilibrium’, whose ‘differential punitiveness’ is marked by oscillations between repression and leniency. The thesis provides an institutional analysis of Italian punishment, investigating in turn the Italian political economy, political culture and state-citizen relations, judicial contributions to penal trends, and the punishment of non-EU migrants. The thesis argues that Italian <b>penality</b> can be systematised by reference to political dynamics, in particular political conflict and political dualisms. Political conflict can broadly be defined as conflict between political interests, ranging from parties through to broader political groups such as families; dualisms are tensions produced by opposing institutional dynamics. The thesis analyses these conflicts and dualisms in terms of penal pressures, either in favour of penal exclusion or moderation. Italy’s institutional structure incorporates political conflict, and fosters structural tensions. The result is that Italy’s volatile political equilibrium is conveyed through its institutions to the penal realm, producing a volatile penal equilibrium. Ultimately, the Italian case study demonstrates that contemporary theories of <b>penality</b> should explicitly incorporate political dynamics and their institutional anchorage. Italian <b>penality</b> can be analysed in terms {{of the nature of the}} state and its institutions and inclusion and exclusion from political belonging. Contemporary theories would profit from incorporating this analysis...|$|E

In this lecture, I address recent attempts {{to understand the}} relevance of political forces and institutions in shaping the practice and the social meaning of punishment. I focus on one argument about {{the relevance of the}} political which has been especially influential during the last decade. This is the ‘neoliberal <b>penality</b> thesis’: the argument that politics can usefully be characterised as broadly neoliberal, or as social democratic: and that the decline or attenuation of social democracy, and the concomitant rise of neoliberalism have been associated with an intensification of <b>penality.</b> I sketch what I take to be the key arguments for that thesis, before presenting a critique of both its method and its substantive conclusions. Though exponents of the neoliberal <b>penality</b> thesis often present it as an ambitious, general theory, I argue that it fails the key test to be applied to any such account: viz, does it have the capacity to shed explanatory light on the relationship between punishment and society? The shortcomings of the neoliberal <b>penality</b> thesis at an explanatory level derive, I argue, from a failure to explicate just which political, economic and social institutions constitute neoliberalism; how, systematically, they relate to one another; and precisely how they are implicated in producing neoliberal <b>penality.</b> These problems may best be illuminated by asking not only what neoliberalism ‘is’ but also analytic, historical and comparative questions about how it has emerged and what sorts of institutional structures are needed to sustain the policies, practices and arrangements which have come to be associated with neoliberalism; when they emerged; and where they hold sway. In conclusion, and in consequence, I make the case for a more differentiated and specifically institutional account of the defining features of political systems integrated within a broad comparative political economy of punishment...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the nature of contemporary youth <b>penality</b> in England and Wales. Some international comparative analysis suggests that over the last 40 years or so there has been a convergence towards a number of interrelated global trends in youth justice law, policy and practice leading to increased punitiveness, intolerance, control and imprisonment of children and young people in conflict with the law across the West. Yet other comparative evidence suggests that the picture is more complicated and that youth <b>penality</b> significantly varies over time and is spatially differentiated at the local, national and international levels. For example in England and Wales youth imprisonment rates significantly vary between Youth Offending Team (YOT) areas and since 2008 there have been significant reductions in the numbers of first time entrants into the youth justice system and young prisoners. Within this context - and even when socio-economic factors and crime rates are controlled for - similar YOT areas still appear to produce quite different sentencing outcomes or differential justice. This thesis explores the spatial and temporal nature of youth justice policy and practice and the cultural, political, social and economic contexts and conditions that give rise to increased rates of youth custody – penal expansion – or decreased rates of youth custody – penal reduction – at a local and a national level. It {{is concerned with}} unpicking the proximate influences on, or causes of, differential justice and/or justice by geography in England and Wales. Semi-structured interviews with youth justice practitioners across three pairs of matched YOTs with higher and lower rates of penal custody in England and Wales, together with a further series of interviews with national policy “experts” were conducted. The thesis builds upon and extends the argument that, at a national level, the direction of youth <b>penality</b> is subject to the vagaries of social, political and economic influences. At a local level it is argued that youth <b>penality</b> and the use of custody is influenced by differences in: local organisational and practice cultures; practitioner values; perceptions of the nature of youth crime; discretionary practices; and individual leadership and management. Ultimately, it is argued that in order to understand youth <b>penality</b> analysis needs to move beyond the national and focus on the influences and effects of the international, national and local that shapes youth <b>penality</b> at all levels...|$|E

What changes have there been in <b>penality</b> and use of the prison over the past 40 years that have led to the re-valorization of the prison? Using penal culture as a conceptual and theoretical vehicle, and Australia as a case study, this book analyses international developments in <b>penality</b> and imprisonment. Authored by some of Australia’s leading penal theorists, the book examines the historical and contemporary influences {{on the use of the}} prison, with analyses of colonialism, post colonialism, race, and what they term the ‘penal/colonial complex,’ in the construction of imprisonment rates and on the development of the phenomenon of hyperincarceration. The authors develop penal culture as an explanatory framework for continuity, change and difference in prisons and the nature of contested penal expansionism. The influence of transformative concepts such as ‘risk management’, ‘the therapeutic prison’, and ‘preventative detention’ are explored as aspects of penal culture.

40|$|Rising prison {{populations and}} the return of punitively orientated ‘ostentatious ’ forms of {{punishment}} (Pratt, 2000) have led a number of theorists to consider whether key defining characteristics of western penal modernity have been abandoned and replaced with something entirely different. The question has been raised: Are we witnessing the rise of a postmodern <b>penality</b> qualitatively different in form than that which prevailed in the modern era? While this question has tentatively been answered in the affirmative by Simon (1995) and, more recently, Pratt (2000), a number of criminologists have argued a contrary case (see Garland, 1995; Lucken, 1998; O’Malley, 1999). There is, they suggest, {{no such thing as a}} postmodern <b>penality,</b> or if there is, evidence for it is very slight.

The thesis constructs a picture of isolation and resistance through these individual narratives that illustrate how a state policy to control the communication of individual RAF prisoners was translated into techniques of immobilization -solitary confinement- and surveillance -searches, censorship and monitoring-. The narratives recount how these techniques, though central to security and order in prison, were applied and adapted in order to disable the group both within prison and on the outside, and to diminish the (political) resolve of the individual prisoner. The narratives also give insight into individual and collective resistance to isolation, namely the rationales of individual survival and striving for community in the pursuit of collective detention of RAF prisoners. The thesis contributes to the literature on RAF imprisonment by framing the lived experiences of former women and men RAF prisoners and the meanings they attach to isolation and resistance within a power and gendered dimensions of prison life and <b>penality.</b> The study also hopes to contribute wider discussions on imprisonment and <b>penality</b> in Gennany, in particular the governance of women and men prisoners who are constructed as dangerous...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} code {{has been developed}} which is capable of computing propeller performance for clean, glaze, or rime iced propeller configurations, thereby providing a mechanism for determining the degree of performance degradation which results from a given icing encounter. The inviscid, incompressible flow field at each specified propeller radial location is first computed using the Theodorsen transformation method of conformal mapping. A droplet trajectory computation then calculates droplet impingement points and airfoil collection efficiency for each radial location, at which point several user-selectable empirical correlations are available for determining the aerodynamic <b>penalities</b> which arise due to the ice accretion. Propeller performance is finally computed using strip analysis for either the clean or iced propeller. In the iced mode, the differential thrust and torque coefficient equations are modified by the drag and lift coefficient increments due to ice to obtain the appropriate iced values. Comparison with available experimental propeller icing data shows good agreement in several cases. The code's capability to properly predict iced thrust coefficient, power coefficient, and propeller efficiency is shown {{to be dependent on}} the choice of empirical correlation employed as well as proper specification of radial icing extent...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} nonparametric method for {{identifying}} parsimony and for producing a statistically efficient estimator {{of a large}} covariance matrix. We reparameterise a covariance matrix through the modified Cholesky decomposition of its inverse or the one-step-ahead predictive representation of the vector of responses and reduce the nonintuitive task of modelling covariance matrices to the familiar task of model selection and estimation for a sequence of regression models. The Cholesky factor containing these regression coefficients {{is likely to have}} many off-diagonal elements that are zero or close to zero. Penalised normal likelihoods in this situation with L-sub- 1 and L-sub- 2 <b>penalities</b> are shown to be closely related to Tibshirani's (1996) LASSO approach and to ridge regression. Adding either penalty to the likelihood helps to produce more stable estimators by introducing shrinkage to the elements in the Cholesky factor, while, because of its singularity, the L-sub- 1 penalty will set some elements to zero and produce interpretable models. An algorithm is developed for computing the estimator and selecting the tuning parameter. The proposed maximum penalised likelihood estimator is illustrated using simulation and a real dataset involving estimation of a 102 � 102 covariance matrix.

As the planner attempts to meet one objective another variable (or ratio of variables) becomes unacceptable {{and he is}} faced with the familiar 'balloon squeezing' effect. The problem is one of multiple conflicting objectives (goals) hence lends itself very well to a goal programming method of solution. This approach provides a powerful 'what-if' device for the financial planner and allows him {{to arrive at a}} satisfactory solution by examining the various trade-offs among the conflicting goals. To be an effective and usable tool, the individual goals are not assigned a priority coefficient as is typical of most goal programming applications. Rather, the planner can reflect his priorities {{in the manner in which}} he performs the subsequent what-if analyses. Also, a more flexible penalty function is introduced allowing the planner to assign a more realistic set of <b>penalities</b> which vary in severity over a specified range. Methods of implementing this concept are discussed which overcome the problems created by the immense storage requirements and the necessity of assigning the various penalties. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, there is very little prison sociological research into how prisoners themselves communicate online. Using Russia as a case study, this paper reports findings from new research on how prisoners are engaging with the internet and the effects of this on prisoner agency and prison structure. Our main finding is that Russian <b>penality</b> sits at the nexus of two processes. First, it is de-institutionalised in that the prison, discursively speaking, is no longer fixed to a built form. Second, it is reflexively re-territorialised in that it places prisoner agency onto a third space.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{trajectory}} of prison reform in post-Soviet Georgia and Russia. It attempts to understand recent developments through {{an analysis of the}} resilient legacies of the culture of punishment born out of the Soviet period. To do this, the article fleshes out the concept of carceral collectivism, which refers to the practices and beliefs that made up prison life in Soviet and now post-Soviet countries. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 revealed a penal culture in notable need of reform. Less obvious, in retrospect, was how {{over the course of a}} century this predominantly ‘collectivist’ culture of punishment was instantiated in routine penal practices that stand in opposition to western <b>penalities.</b> The article shows how the social and physical structuring of collectivism and penal self-governance have remained resilient in the post-Soviet period despite diverging attempts at reform in Russia and Georgia. The article argues that persistent architectural forms and cultural attachment to collectivism constitute this resilience. Finally, the article asks how studies of collectivist punishment in the post-Soviet region might inform emerging debates about the reform and restructuring of individualizing, cell-based prisons in western jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|The antithesis {{between a}} {{criminalisation}} and {{a human rights}} approach {{in the context of}} trafficking in women has been considered a highly contested issue. On the one hand, it is argued that a criminalisation approach would be better, because security measures will be fortified, the number of convictions will inevitably increase, and states’ interests will be safeguarded against security threats. On the other hand, it is maintained that a human rights approach would bring more effective results, as this will mobilise a more ‘holistic’ approach, bringing together prevention, prosecution, protection of victims and partnerships in delivering gendered victim services. This antithesis, discursively constructed at an international level, cuts across a decentralised reliance on the national competent authorities. To investigate this powerful discursive domain, I set these approaches within the larger framework of a tripartite ‘anti-trafficking promise’ that aims to eliminate trafficking through criminalisation, security and human rights. I ask how clearly and distinctively each term has been articulated, by the official anti-trafficking actors (police and service providers), and what the nature of their interaction is within the larger whole. In grappling with these questions, I undertake both empirical and theoretical enquiry. The empirical part is based on research I conducted at the Greek anti-trafficking mechanisms in 2008 - 2009. The theoretical discussion draws, in particular, on the concept of ‘imaginary penalities’ introduced in the criminological work of Pat Carlen. I consider what it might mean to bring this concept to bear in the context of anti-trafficking. In my analysis, criminalisation is linked to a ‘toughness’ rhetoric, an ever-encroaching and totalising demand for criminal governance. Security is shown to express the contemporary grammar of criminalisation, crafting a global language of risks and threats as core elements of the post 9 / 11 ideological conditions in the area of crime control. Finally, human rights are figured as tempering or correcting the criminal law for the sake of victims’ protection. Together, these three elements constitute a promise that, once they are balanced and stabilised, trafficking can be abolished. Yet it is not only trafficking that is at stake. My study shows how anti-trafficking discursive formations also produce particular forms of subjectivity and conceptions of class, sex, ethnicity and race. The upshot is to bring into focus the imaginary <b>penalities</b> at the centre of anti-trafficking discourses and technologies, while also suggesting the possibilities for contesting and transforming their subjects and fields of operation. The thesis opens up the conceptual map of future critical engagement with the relation of structural inequalities and imaginary <b>penalities...</b>|$|R
