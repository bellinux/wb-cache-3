5000|$|Primary polycythemias are due {{to factors}} {{intrinsic}} to red cell precursors. Polycythemia vera (PCV), <b>polycythemia</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>vera</b> (PRV), or erythremia, occurs when excess red blood cells are produced {{as a result of}} an abnormality of the bone marrow. [...] Often, excess white blood cells and platelets are also produced. Polycythemia vera is classified as a myeloproliferative disease. Symptoms include headaches and vertigo, and signs on physical examination include an abnormally enlarged spleen and/or liver. In some cases, affected individuals may have associated conditions including high blood pressure or formation of blood clots. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment. A hallmark of polycythemia is an elevated hematocrit, with Hct > 55% seen in 83% of cases.

The recent identification of an association between the JAK 2 V 617 F mutation and MPD enables the convenient early diagnosis in these patients using a molecular approach.

40|$|JAK 2 V 617 F causes {{intrinsic}} {{changes in}} the process of platelet formation from megakaryocytes. JAK 2 V 617 F platelets are prothrombotic and demonstrate increased reactivity to different agonists. The principal morbidity andmortality in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and <b>polycythemia</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>vera</b> (PV) stems from thrombotic events. Most patients with ET/PV harbor a JAK 2 V 617 F mutation, but its role in the thrombotic diathesis remains obscure. Platelet function studies in patients are difficult to interpret because of interindividual heterogeneity, reflectingvariations in theproportionofplateletsderived fromthemalignant clone, differences in the presence of additional mutations, and the effects of medical treatments. To circumvent these issues, we have studied a JAK 2 V 617 F knock-in mouse model of ET in which all megakaryocytes and platelets express JAK 2 V 617 F at a phys-iological level, equivalent to that present in humanETpatients. Weshow that, in addition to increased differentiation, JAK 2 V 617 F-positive megakaryocytes display greater migratory ability and proplatelet formation. We demonstrate in a range of assays that platelet re-activity toagonists is enhanced,witha concomitant increase inplatelet aggregation invitro and a reduced duration of bleeding in vivo. These data suggest that JAK 2 V 617 F leads to intrinsic changes in both megakaryocyte and platelet biology beyond an increase in cell number. In support of this hypothesis, we identify multiple differentially expressed genes in JAK 2 V 617 F megakaryocytes that may underlie the observed biological differences.

Mechanisms of this association are unclear but may be partially related to impaired left ventricular (LV) function and increased central blood pressure (BP) during light activity. This study aimed to test these hypotheses. Twenty patients (14 men; aged 61 +/- 12 years) with <b>polycythemia</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>vera</b> (n = 16) or hemochromatosis (n = 4) were studied at rest and during exercise at approximate to 50 % of maximal heart rate before and after venesection (500 mL; volume replaced with saline) to elicit an acute decrease in plasma viscosity at stable BP. Controls (n = 20) underwent the same protocol with 25 -mL venesection. Central BP and augmentation index were determined by tonometry. Resting LV systolic (peak longitudinal systolic strain rate and strain) and diastolic functions were determined by tissue-Doppler echocardiography. Venesection with blood volume replacement decreased viscosity (1. 46 +/- 0. 10 to 1. 41 +/- 0. 11 centipoise), protein, and hemoglobin (P 0. 12 for all). Exercise augmentation index in patients was reduced after venesection (24 +/- 12 % to 17 +/- 9 %; P= 0. 001) despite no significant change in other BP variables. Hemodynamics (resting or exercise) were not significantly changed in controls. Exercise central systolic BP correlated with triglycerides (r= 0. 59; P 0. 05).
