40|$|Incorporation of {{neomycin}} to {{the culture}} medium {{was found to be}} effective in inhibiting Escherichia coli contaminants without interfering with the growth of serotype L. autumnalis. The growth of 12 other Leptospira serotypes was unaffected by the addition of 300 μg of neomycin per ml to Ellinghausen medium or 5 μg/ml to Fletcher medium. Neomycin-containing medium was found to be of value in the isolation of leptospiras from cultures of blood from infected laboratory animals. A higher percentage of isolates was obtained in swine kidneys from an abattoir in medium containing neomycin than resulted from the same medium without antibiotic or with 5 -fluorouracil.

All exhibited gliding motility and swarm colonies on cultivation plates and they were <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> <b>subculturing</b> and micromanipulator techniques. Their 16 S rRNA genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the represented isolates can be separated into six different clads (gr 1 - gr 6) within the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteriodes (CFB) group. Group 1 formed a remote linear, with only 90 % sequence similarity, from Flavobacteriaceae bacterium which indicated a potentially novel taxonomic group. Groups 2 and 3 were identified as the recently proposed Tenacibaculum mesophilum and Fulvivirga kasyanovii respectively. Groups 4, 5 and 6, consisting of {{the largest number of}} the members, were identified as Rapidithrix thailandica, Aureispira marina and Aureispira maritima respectively. The isolates were cultivated in four different cultivation media (Vy/ 2, RL 1, CY and SK) and the crude extracts were submitted to screen cytotoxicity using a sulphorodamine B (SRB) assay. The results from cytotoxic screening showed that groups 2, 4 and 6 were capable of producing the cytotoxic metabolites against selected human cell lines (breast adenocarcinoma (MCF- 7), colon cancer (HT- 29), cervical cancer (HeLa) and oral cancer (KB)). However, groups 1, 3 and 5 did not produce metabolites with cytotoxicity when cultivated in the same cultivation media as the previous groups.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in certain area at Khartoum State from (May/ 2006 - April/ 2008) to determine the causative agent of bovine mastitis and the susceptibility of different isolates to different antibiotics use for treatment of bovine mastitis. The total number of dairy cows, which were examined in 34 investigated farms, equals about 500. The thirty-four dairy farms were examined at the University, Eltebna, Elhalfaia, Elsamrab, Shambat, Hilat kuku and Falasteen farms. Samples were taken according to owner′s complain from apparent clinical cases of mastitis. Hundred milk samples were collected a septically from 41 cows suffering from mastitis. All these cows were examined by visual inspection and palpation of mammarygland and supramammary lymph nodes. The result as follows: 55 % acute mastitis, 44 % chronic mastitis and 1 % gangrenous mastitis. First test was applied in field for pH detection by using indicator paper, in positive reaction the spot was changed from yellow to green or bluish green that means the pH increased dueto decrease of casein and lactose and increase chloride and carbonate. The samples were taken from apparent clinical cases in sterilebottles for culture, isolation and identification of the causative agentsin all cases. The samples were cultured on MacConkey′s agar and Blood agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours and then <b>purified</b> <b>by</b> further <b>subculturing.</b> Smears were prepared and stained with Gram´s stain to detect colour, shape and spores if the later was present. The tests were applied as follows: Primary tests: These classified into: 1 - Stained smear. 2 - Motility. 3 - Oxidase. 4 - Catalase. 5 - Oxidation Fermentation. 6 - Glucose fermentation. The isolated genera were as follows: 74 % Bacillusspp., 24 % Staphylococcusspp., 1 % Corynebacteriumspp. and 1 % Klebsiellaspp. After that the secondary tests were applied for isolated genera to identify the species, the results were as follows: 31 % Bacillus coagulans, 11 % B. cereus, 9 % B. subtilis, 9 % B. licheniformis, 4 % B. circulans, 2 % B. lentus, 3 % B. mycoides, 3 %B. amyloliquefaciens, 2 % B. megaterium, 16 % Staphylococcus aureus, 8 % Staphylococcus hyicus, 1 % Corynebacterium spp. and 1 % Klebsiellaspp. Lastly, the sensitivity test was applied using different antibiotics were as follows: Chloramphenicol, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamycin, Tetracycline, Piperacillin/ Tazobactam, Pefloxacin, Amikacin, Ofloxacin, Co-Trimoxazole, Ceftizoxime, Cefotaxime and Ampicillin/ Sulbactam. The effectiveness of different antibiotics in different isolates were as follows: Hundred percent of isolates were sensitive for Chloramphenicol and Ciprofloxacin, 91. 6 % for Gentamycin and Piperacillin/ Tazobactam, 83. 3 % for Pefloxacin and Tetracycline, 75 % for Amikacin and Ofloxacin, 66. 6 % for Ceftizoxime, 33. 3 % for Co-Trimoxazole and Cefotaxime and 16. 6 % for Ampicillin/ Sulbactam...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn osteoarthritic cartilage, chondrocytes {{are able}} to present {{heterogeneous}} cellular reactions with expression and synthesis of the (pro) collagen types characteristic of prechondrocytes (type IIA), hypertrophic chondrocytes (type X), as well as differentiated (types IIB, IX, XI, VI) and dedifferentiated (types I, III) chondrocytes. The expression of type IIA procollagen in human osteoarthritic cartilage support the assumption that OA chondrocytes reverse their phenotype towards a chondroprogenitor phenotype. Recently, we have shown that dedifferentiation of mouse chondrocytes induced <b>by</b> <b>subculture</b> {{was associated with the}} alternative splicing of type II procollagen pre-mRNA with a switch from the IIB to the IIA form.
