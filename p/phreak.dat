50|$|Into {{the turn}} of the 21st century, <b>phreaks</b> began to focus on the {{exploration}} and playing with the network, and the concept of toll fraud became widely frowned on among serious phreakers, primarily {{under the influence of the}} website Phone Trips, put up by second generation <b>phreaks</b> Mark Bernay and Evan Doorbell.|$|R

The title alludes to Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.|$|E

2500|$|TAP was the {{original}} hacker and phone <b>phreak</b> publication which predated [...] by decades (at {{the time of the}} last TAP meetings, 2600 magazine was just starting to publish its first issues). Kroupa met many people there who would become part of his life in the years to come. Three of the main characters would be his future partner and lifelong friend, Bruce Fancher; Yippie/Medical Marijuana activist Dana Beal (The Theoretician), who was part of the John Draper (Cap'n Crunch) /Abbie Hoffman, technologically inclined branch of the counter-culture and perhaps most important: Herbert Huncke, who introduced Kroupa to heroin at age 14.|$|E

50|$|They all {{end up in}} {{a special}} section called Potpourri, which mixes {{elements}} of various other sections. Baal is able to track the approximate locations of Walter and <b>Phreak.</b> Walter and Baal decide they are in love and want to marry if they manage to survive their current ordeal and meet in the real world. They chase <b>Phreak</b> across Potpourri, evading various obstacles he places in their path. Baal goes into insulin shock and her game body becomes still. Walter finally corners <b>Phreak</b> on a train and threatens to encase him in a box with snakes. <b>Phreak</b> finally relents.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, {{the phone}} {{companies}} in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the <b>phreaks,</b> but simply {{as a matter of}} course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which <b>phreaks</b> could not access. This system is known as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling. Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Thus, the System 4 {{blue box}} was used {{primarily}} {{as a way of}} setting up calls to hard-to-reach operator-only destinations, in order to impress other <b>phreaks,</b> rather than as a way of making free or cheap calls.|$|R
50|$|Phreaking is a slang term coined to {{describe}} the activity of a culture of people who study, experiment with, or explore telecommunication systems, such as equipment and systems connected to public telephone networks. The term <b>phreak</b> is a sensational spelling of the word freak with the ph- from phone, and may also refer {{to the use of}} various audio frequencies to manipulate a phone system. <b>Phreak,</b> phreaker, or phone <b>phreak</b> are names used for and by individuals who participate in phreaking.|$|E
50|$|Baal reenters {{the game}} world. Unfortunately, {{the next section}} is {{especially}} violent and unpredictable, modelled after Beirut. She poses as an Israeli spy, he as a Druze, and after several dangerous adventures they find each other, but not before <b>Phreak</b> catches up with them. Baal successfully sets the patch on <b>Phreak,</b> locking him in the game, though he has now locked her inside as well. They all {{end up in a}} prison together, and Walter tries to force the information out of <b>Phreak,</b> while Baal makes motions to seduce him, but he resists their methods.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the late}} 80s, {{it looks like}} Kroupa and LOD had exactly one use left for the Apple II: to utilize the entire {{computer}} as a host for the Apple-Cat modem.

5000|$|The second {{generation}} of <b>phreaks</b> arose at this time, including the New Yorkers [...] "Evan Doorbell", [...] "Ben Decibel" [...] and Neil R. Bell and Californians Mark Bernay, Chris Bernay, and [...] "Alan from Canada". Each conducted their own independent exploration and experimentation of the telephone network, initially on an individual basis, and later within groups as they discovered {{each other in their}} travels. [...] "Evan Doorbell," [...] "Ben" [...] and [...] "Neil" [...] formed a group of <b>phreaks,</b> known as Group Bell. Mark Bernay initiated a similar group named the Mark Bernay Society. Both Mark and Evan received fame amongst today's phone phreakers for Internet publication of their collection of telephone exploration recordings. These recordings, conducted in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s are available at Mark's website Phone Trips.|$|R
