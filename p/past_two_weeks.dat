This led to a match between Devitt and Tanahashi on March 3 at NJPW's 41st anniversary event.

The following weeks, Devitt began portraying a more cocky and villainous persona, regularly disrespecting both partners and opponents, with the exception of Ryusuke Taguchi, whom he tried to get to go along with his new attitude. However, this changed on April 7 at the Invasion Attack pay-per-view, when Devitt turned on Taguchi, after the two had failed to recapture the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from the Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida). During the attack, Devitt was helped by the returning King Fale, who attacked not only Taguchi, but also Shelley, Kushida and Captain New Japan, whom Devitt then proceeded to unmask. Following the attack, Devitt took a microphone, introduced Fale as his new [...] "bouncer", giving him the new name [...] "The Underboss" [...] Bad Luck Fale and dubbed himself the [...] "Real Rock 'n' Rolla".

40|$|Glucose {{molecules}} {{are joined}} to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base inter-mediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus {{owing to the}} abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes {{over a period of}} several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. 01 the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosa-mine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the aver-age blood sugar concentration over the past six to eight weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar con-centration over the <b>past</b> <b>two</b> to three <b>weeks.</b> Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control.
