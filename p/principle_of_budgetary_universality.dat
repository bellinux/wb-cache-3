One of the reasons is the deficit of financial resources, necessary at developing and implementing space technologies and their commercialization.

In Romania, in the highly complex framework in which the economic activity takes place, in the attempt to show the place held by the budget deficit, a special role is assigned to determine the share of public financial deficit in the consolidated budget revenue and expenditure.

40|$|The aim is {{to analyse}} the current {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control to develop its areas of improvement at the local level. The subject of the research is theoretical and methodological <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control at the local level. The methodological basis of the study comprises research approaches, general theoretical <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> scientific knowledge, system of methods and techniques. The paper clarifies the nature <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control at the local level. The main bodies that implement budget control, namely the State Audit Office, the Accounting Chamber, the State Treasury, the State Fiscal Service, financial and management departments are singled out. It is found that the leading part among all <b>of</b> the special <b>budgetary</b> control bodies in the rational and efficient use of local financial resources is performed by the State Audit Office. Analysis of the State Audit Office in three regions of Ukraine for the period 2013 - 2015 has been carried out. We distinguish two main types of violations that the State Audit Service reveals during its work at the local level: 1) shortfall in the financial resources of public enterprises, institutions and organizations; 2) violations that lead to illegal, non-target costs and shortages. It is proved that the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control is low. The paper states basic problems of budget control at the local level, namely, low income funds and reimbursements from violations revealed by regulatory agencies; insufficient work with the public to explain the problems of budget control and eliminate violations in the public sector; lack of a consolidated legal act, which would have regulated all the major components <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control; insufficient use of controlling and auditing methods aimed at determining the effectiveness of budget funds; low preventive function {{on the part of}} budget control bodies. We offer ways to improve budget control at the local level through: standardization system <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control in accordance with international standards in connection with the integration of Ukraine into the EU and the transition to international accounting standards and reporting system to form unified control procedures; create a system of unified procedures of developing a clear concept <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control, which should be both scientific and political document to enforce, as determined by the law; creating for all budgetary control bodies an integrated database related to the certification of audit results; developing cooperation strategy with <b>budgetary</b> control bodies <b>of</b> foreign countries and specialized international organizations, including participation in joint training sessions and parallel control expert and analytical measures. As a result, the proposed measures will make it possible not only to eliminate these shortcomings but also to increase efficiency, effectiveness and efficacy <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> control at the local level...|$|R

In this paper, the public financial activity is treated, for each region, through different public revenue and expenditure ratios per capita. This situation leads to consider a multicriteria Promethee method as the apropriate one to obtain a global ranking for all of them. In the opinion of Al-Shemmeri, Al-Kloub and Rearman (1997), this method is the most adequate one because of the following advantages: public authorities, as decision takers, can understand easily the results, regardless the knowledge they may have about it; the method uses understandable economic parameters; the method avoids distorting scale effects among different alternatives and, as well, makes possible the deviation evaluation between alternatives and, finally, allows for sensibility analysis. ...|$|R

The modalities used are subject to an analysis by direct or indirect influence on the mechanisms that generate economic stability and economic development effort. � � For example, on the short-term, the budget deficit reduces the national saving, leads to decreased supply of market funds, which increases the interest rates. In this context, the volume of investment decreases, the consumption is reduced, affecting the volume of economic activities and employment. � � The psychological influences combined with the economic boost caused by budget deficits act directly on financial markets, leading to falling down the values of capital markets and the depreciation of the currencies sometimes sudden for the national currency.

40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the <b>budgetary</b> systems <b>of</b> the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|R
