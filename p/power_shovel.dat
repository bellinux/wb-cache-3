During World War II, the plant produced 1,655 Sherman tanks. Employment grew from 150 in the 1890s to 1,100 in 1912 and 2,000 in 1915, peaking at 4,300 in 1944. Over the course of its history, the Locomotive Works was a microcosm of the community, a place where each successive wave of newcomers took its place in turn. First the Germans and Italians, later African-Americans and ultimately women joining the work force during World War II. Labor organizing efforts were under way at the plant at least by the 1890s.|$|E

50|$|The term shovel {{also applies}} to larger {{excavating}} machines called <b>power</b> <b>shovels,</b> which serve the same purpose—digging, lifting, and moving material.

In 1925, Lima Locomotive Works, Inc. built the [...] "Lima A-1", a 2-8-4 model that became the prototype for the modern steam locomotive. The Locomotive Works also created a new division, the Ohio <b>Power</b> <b>Shovel</b> Company. In 1927, local industrialist John E. Galvin helped found Superior Coach Company. It became the world's largest producer of school buses and funeral coaches within two decades. In 1930, eight railroad companies served Lima.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than [...] of material {{over and above the}} [...] excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. About 102 new large, railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased from the Marion <b>Power</b> <b>Shovel</b> Company and brought from the United States. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake's waterline.|$|E

After assembly was completed, the entire stack was moved from the VAB to the launch pad using the Crawler Transporter (CT). Built by the Marion <b>Power</b> <b>Shovel</b> company (and later used for transporting the smaller and lighter Space Shuttle), the CT ran on four double-tracked treads, each with 57 'shoes'. Each shoe weighed [...] This transporter was also required to keep the rocket level as it traveled the [...] to the launch site, especially at the 3 percent grade encountered at the launch pad.

A single dry-land dredge worked the ground in 1942, after which operations shut down for the duration of World War II.|$|R
30|$|As {{the first}} step of {{obstacle}} surmount operation a simple step-like structure was chosen as the obstacle.
