50|$|Burt Munro from New Zealand, {{featured}} in the film The World's Fastest Indian raced a heavily modified 1936 Velocette MSS. Racing preparation included making special <b>pistons,</b> changing the <b>frame</b> and increasing engine capacity to 650 cc. His top speed record on this motorcycle was 138 mph with a 1/4 mile time of 12.31 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Laser ponderomotive {{force at}} super-high intensities {{provides}} an efficient ion acceleration {{not only in}} thin foils but also in bulk dense targets, thereby evacuating a channel which enables further laser beam propagation. A quasistationary model of a laser piston – a double layer structure supported by the radiation pressure – predicts the general parameters of the acceleration process in homogeneous and inhomogeneous overdense plasmas. Particle-in-cell simulations confirm the estimated characteristics {{in a wide range}} of laser intensities and ion densities and show advantages of circularly polarized laser pulses. Figure 1 displays the double layer structure in the rest <b>frame</b> of the <b>piston</b> (R <b>frame)</b> moving with the velocity vf = βfc. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, had bar <b>frames,</b> <b>piston</b> {{valves and}} used Walschaerts valve gear. The Class GF {{was the only}} Double Pacific type Garratt to see service on the SAR and, until {{the arrival of the}} Class GMA, was the most numerous Garratt locomotive class in SAR service. It was designed as a mixed traffic locomotive for use on branch lines and secondary mainlines throughout the country.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, the Dodge Viper updated to lighter {{hypereutectic}} <b>pistons</b> {{and factory}} <b>frame</b> improvements. [...] While the hypereutectic pistons provided less expansion, the forged pistons are preferred for the supercharging and turbo aftermarkets. [...] TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) recalls (998 and 999) were done at local dealerships {{to repair the}} 1996 to 1999 Viper frames by adding gussets with rivets near the steering box. 2001 saw the addition of ABS.|$|R
50|$|Recoil and counter-recoil were {{controlled}} hydraulically {{by means of}} a piston and spring combination connected to the recoiling mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and <b>piston</b> rod, lock <b>frame</b> assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{traffic and}} heavier loads {{led to the}} {{decision}} by the NCCR in 1922 to place an order with Beyer, Peacock and Company for two Garratt 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type locomotives. The locomotives were built to the design of the Class GB of the SAR and were also superheated, with Belpaire fireboxes, plate <b>frames,</b> <b>piston</b> valves and Walschaerts valve gear, but they were heavier and had larger cylinders. They were delivered in 1923 and were initially numbered 12 and 13, but were later renumbered G1 and G2. The Garratts were the last new locomotives to be acquired by the company.|$|R
40|$|Corn plants (Zea mays) {{is one of}} the world's most {{important}} pagan crops other than wheat and rice. Corn also has potential as a raw material of food industry, pharmaceutical chemicals and other industries yanng have a high value, such as corn starch, corn Gritz, corn oil, dextrin, sugar, ethanol, organic acids and other materials. With a view to the high content in corn oil content of about 30 % then the oil {{has the potential to be}} exploited. Method of extracting the oil from seeds consist of several ways, namely by rendering (wet and dry rendering rendering), extraction with solvents and the method mechanical pressing. The purpose of this thesis is to create a hydraulic press used for pressing the kernels so that the oil can be obtained from the pressing results. Hydraulic press machine has the main components of hydraulic jack with accompanying pengepressan tube, a pressure <b>piston,</b> handle, <b>frame,</b> and shelters oil. Grains which have undergone pre-treatment includes preheating and milling is divided into 4 sections. Each part is inserted first into the filter cloth is then inserted into the tube pengepress, after the material has been prepared, the screw began to be revealed and operated hydraulic began to pressing materials. Pressure readings done in the time before the oil started coming out of the material. Keywords : corn seeds, hydraulic press, corn seeds oil...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic Press {{is one of}} {{the methods}} that are used in extracting the oil from grains other than by using Solvent Extraction. The main {{component}} of the Hydraulic Press is Jack Hydraulic, and supported by other components, namely Tubes Pengepressan, a pressure plate (<b>Piston</b> Pengepress), Handle, <b>Frame</b> and place a container of oil. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L) is a plant whose fruit is used as a source of oil. Palm fruit oil contains quite a lot that is 34. 7 grams per 100 grams of oil. Coconut oil including oil group does not dry (non-drying oils). Fats and oils can be obtained from the extraction of animal or plant tissue in three ways, namely rendering, pressing, or with solvent. Two common ways in which the pressing mechanical pressing hydraulic (hydraulic pressing) and pressing threaded (screw pressing). How hydraulic presses require pre-treatment consists of the cooking process or tempering. The object of this research is to study the effects of time and the pressure on palm oil yield. The analysis will be conducted on the products are yield, viscosity, density, acid number and saponification. Keyword : oil, oil coconut, Hydraulic pressin...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Manufacturing Systems EngineeringThe scope {{of this study is}} to design a simple & low cost solar tracking system, which make uses downward movement of a piston cause by controlled discharge of water from water filled cylinder. The solar panels are mounted on the lever and when the lever rotates, the panels also rotate by the same angle, which is required. Rotation is done by connecting two <b>pistons</b> to the <b>frame</b> of panel via two links. In the method describe here. PV panel is mounted on a frame that pivot on an axis running from South to north with a slight inclination towards the north. As the sun moves from the morning to afternoon, the PV panel is rotated around the axis to make it normal to the Sun's rays as far as possible. The rotation is not done continuously since it will drain some of the solar energy collected with great difficulty. Instead, the rotation is done intermittently. / The tracking is activated by the controlled discharge of water from water filled cylinder. When water is discharged by a controlled rate, the piston on top of water column moves down. The downward motion of piston is then converted to a rotary motion of the frame around the pivot axis by means of two links. The discharge of water is controlled by an electronic circuit, which gets signals from two sensors mounted on the lever. There is an opaque screen normal to the PV panel and between the light sensors. When the incident solar rays are normal to the lever, the two sensor readings arc equal. When it is not so. The difference of the two signals from the sensors is fed to an electronic circuit which opens the discharge valve of the water cylinder causing the piston to go dow n and rotate the frame w ith solar panel. When the solar panel is rotated in the correct direction by the required amount, the sensors generate the same readings and the electronic circuit stops the water discharge. / Test on this tracking system shows that the total power output of the solar panel can be increase by about 25 % on a sunny day. On a cloud} day. because of the diffused radiation the tracking is not that much advantage, and this is true for other tracking systems as well. It is expected that this low cost one axis tracking system would pave the w ay for future research to increase of solar energy output in a sunny day by employing reflectors fixed to the frame and rotating together.
