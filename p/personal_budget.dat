40|$|In a long-run social experiment, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> {{have been}} tested as an {{alternative}} home care program of the German long-term care insurance (LTCI). By granting the monetary value of in-kind services in cash, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> are considered to enable customized home care arrangements, thereby avoiding costly nursing home care and thus saving LTCI spending. However, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> also compete with the already existing and less generous cash option of the LTCI. Any transition from the receipt of cash benefits to <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> thus challenges the view of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> as a cost savings device, unless <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> sufficiently reduce the use of costly nursing home care to balance these extra costs. This paper therefore contrasts the short-term costs of implementing <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> with potential cost savings if <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> enhance the stability of home care and avoid costly nursing home care. For this purpose, the paper investigates the effects of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> on the duration of home care until moving {{to a nursing home}} as well as the perceived stability of home care. Despite a positive effect of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> on the stability of home care, LTCI spending is likely to increase in the short to medium run.

40|$|In a long-run social experiment, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> {{have been}} tested as an {{alternative}} to the home care programs of the German long-term care insurance (LTCI). Due to extending the coverage beyond LTCI approved services and agencies, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> may improve care outcomes compared to the provision of agency care at a constant benefit level, a highly desirable result in light of the ongoing demographic challenge. However, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> also compete with the less generous cash option of the LTCI. Any transition from cash recipients to <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> increases LTCI spending, while care outcomes may remain unchanged if informal caregivers are crowded out by formal care. This paper compares care outcomes of the different home care programs and provides a rough cost analysis from the perspective of the LTCI. While <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> improve care outcomes compared to agency services, the nationwide introduction of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> increases LTCI spending for former cash recipients without any traceable effect on their care outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effects of a professionally {{assisted}} consumer-directed program (<b>Personal</b> <b>Budgets)</b> compared to the standard home care programs of the German long-term care insurance. The evaluation makes use of a long-run social experiment at seven different sites with a random assignment into a treatment group receiving <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> and a control group in standard home care programs, i. e. an in-kind benefit (agency care) and cash payments. Compared to agency care <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> yield better care outcomes with regard to the overall support of formal and informal caregivers. In contrast, <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> do not improve care outcomes compared to the much less generous cash payments due to a strong crowding out of informal by formal care.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Personal</b> <b>budgets</b> {{are a key}} policy {{priority}} in adult social care in England {{and are expected to}} become increasingly important in the care of adults with mental health problems. AIMS: This article systematically reviews evidence for the effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> for people with mental health problems across diverse outcomes. METHODS: The review, conducted in 2013, used the EPPI-Centre methodology for conducting a systematic review informed by Social Care Institute for Excellence guidelines. Data were extracted from studies and combined using meta-synthesis. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review which found mostly positive outcomes in terms of choice and control, quality of life, service use and cost-effectiveness. However, methodological limitations make these findings rather unreliable and insufficient to inform <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> policy and practice for mental health service users. CONCLUSIONS: Further high quality studies are required to inform policy and practice for mental health service users, which lags behind other adult social care groups in the use of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of adult social care in England is underway, {{with the aim}} of promoting greater control and choice among people eligible for publicly funded social care services.

A pilot programme of the predecessors of <b>personal</b> <b>budgets,</b> individual budgets, took place 2005 – 2008 and was evaluated by an independent research team.

2500|$|The ustadar (from the Arabic ustadh al-dar, [...] "master of the house") was {{the chief}} of staff of the sultan, {{responsible}} for organizing the royal court's daily activities, managing the <b>personal</b> <b>budget</b> of the sultan and supervising all of the buildings of the Cairo Citadel and its staff. The ustadar was often referred to as the ustadar al-aliyah (grand master of the house) to distinguish from ustadar saghirs (lesser majordomos) whose authority was subordinate to the ustadar al-aliyah and who oversaw specific aspects of the court and citadel, such as the sultan's treasury, private property and the kitchens of the citadel. Mamluk emirs also had their own ustadars. The office of ustadar al-aliyah became a powerful post beginning in the late 14th century, particularly so under sultans Barquq and an-Nasir Faraj, who transferred the responsibilities of the special bureau for their mamluks to the authority of the ustadar, thus turning the latter into the sultanate's chief financial official.|$|E

40|$|The Westminster Government in the UK has {{implemented}} {{a series of}} significant changes to the way social care is organised and provided in England, {{including the use of}} <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> and direct payments. Advocates of this approach claim it will deliver more personalised care to budget holders. This paper examines key English policies underpinning these changes, reviewing social policy analysis and research evidence of their impact to consider implications for older social care users. It suggests that <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> and direct payments have partly been a response to demands for greater control over care from younger adults with disabilities and that policies and guidance often reflect the interests of this constituency rather than older people. Current research evidence tends to suggest that older people achieve less satisfactory outcomes from <b>personal</b> <b>budgets</b> than younger people. The paper argues for the re-discovery of person-centred care, rather than personalisation, as a way of addressing this important policy issue...|$|R
