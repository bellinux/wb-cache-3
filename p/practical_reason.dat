5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason</b> and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason</b> {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{prospects}} for an interpretivist account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> The proposed account identifies <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> with sets of propositional attitudes from which certain actions follow, given the constraints of interpretable functioning. Following Davidson, these constraints are taken to be enumerated by formal decision theory and formal semantics. Thus the account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> is framed {{in terms of what}} rationally follows from agents' beliefs and desires. The hope is that an account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> of this kind can explain the existence of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> without invoking irreducible normative properties or relations. This outcome depends upon the availability of a theory of (radical) interpretation which is free from prior normative commitments. It is argued that a non-normative reading of Davidson's theory of radical interpretation is available, such that the account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> can meet this requirement. Although the proposed account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> does not admit of the possibility of categorical reasons for action, the ensuing objection that it fails to allow for the possibility of moral reasons for action is resisted. It is suggested that a plausible account on which moral reasons are hypothetical in kind can be provided. In particular, an account of moral reasons which is framed in terms of the motivations associated with a capacity for empathic affect is advanced. More generally, the aspiration of the thesis is to provide an account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> framed in terms of the requirements of interpretable functioning which will be regarded as an interesting and credible naturalistic option.

40|$|In this essay, I {{argue that}} {{positive}} and negative <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> have asymmetrical normative force. In other words, the negative reasons for one action, and the positive reasons for another action that they correspond to, do not have equivalent normative force. This asymmetry is defended by appealing to Dancy's holism about <b>practical</b> <b>reasons,</b> and Greenspan's critical conception of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> It is also vindicated by appealing to an analogous asymmetry among {{positive and negative}} theoretical reasons. If this is right, then {{we are able to}} avoid problems arising for the standard account of practical deliberation, whereby we weigh positive and negative reasons to determine an overall verdict of what to do...|$|R

25|$|The Groundwork {{is broken}} into a preface, {{followed}} by three sections. Kant's argument works from common reason {{up to the}} supreme unconditional law, {{in order to identify}} its existence. He then works backwards from there to prove the relevance and weight of the moral law. The third and final section of the book is famously obscure, and it is partly because of this that Kant later, in 1788, decided to publish the Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{develop a}} theory of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> as such, and then I extend that theory to specifically moral reasons. According {{to the theory of}} <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> that I develop in Part I, the existence and weight of an agent's reason to act in a particular way depends on an agent's motivational states [...] specifically those motivational states issuing from practical orientations that play some role in structuring the agent's practical identity. I then argue that this account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> is a well-motivated reductive account of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> that is extensionally adequate. In Part II, I turn to questions of specifically moral reasons, which putatively have the properties of being categorical and of having practical priority. I argue that the theory of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> that I develop in Part I doesn't {{rule out the possibility that}} moral reasons would have these two properties, and I suggest (following Peter Strawson) that such properties could be grounded in our orientation towards others as participants in certain forms of meaningful interpersonal relationships [...] an orientation that is perhaps internal to our practical identity as relational agents. I argue that if this is correct, then moral reasons will be categorical and have practical priority...|$|R

25|$|Kant {{published}} a second {{edition of the}} Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason</b> (known as the second Critique) and 1797's Metaphysics of Morals. The 1790 Critique of Judgment (the third Critique) applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} oil {{depletion}} by the UK Energy Research Centre {{pointed out that}} there is no theoretical and no robust <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither {{is there any reason to}} assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post-peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.|$|E
25|$|In the Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason,</b> {{at the end}} of {{the second}} Main Part of the Analytics, Kant {{introduces}} the categories of freedom, in analogy with the categories of understanding their practical counterparts. Kant's categories of freedom apparently function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated. For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom. Only in this way can actions, as phenomena, be a consequence of freedom, and be understood and evaluated as such.|$|E

40|$|In ethical theory one {{deals with}} {{questions}} about what is good or rational to do by referring to <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> Bernard Williams's Internalism is such a theory of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> His main claim is that <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> are conditionally normative -they must rest on a psychological foundation. If we say of someone that they have reason to do something, we can only do that if the person himself could, by some sort of sound reasoning, concur with such a judgement. Externalism of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> does not have such a requirement. What people have reasons to do is provided by truth independently of any person's psychological make up. In this thesis I argue that internalism is right in forcing a psychological demand on ethical theories. In essence this means that ethical theory needs pedagogy, and that internalism is that which meets such a demand best. However, internalism might be basing itself on a wrong picture of psychology. McDowell accepts the psychological demand on ethical theories, but he offers a different account of psychology that is more congenial to the externalist interpretation of reasons...|$|R
25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason</b> (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
25|$|The Rome branch {{was always}} busy. The Papal court was {{attended}} by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such {{that there was a}} measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred to wherever the Court was residing. A more <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they were not supposed to) or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor him so much or even turned over to a replacement. Accounts with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, {{especially in the case of}} discretionary deposits.|$|E
40|$|Internalism about <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> {{claims that}} there is a {{necessary}} connection between what an agent has reason to do and what he would be motivated to do if he were in privileged or optimal conditions. Internalism is traditionally supported by the claim that it alone can capture two (supposed) conditions of adequacy for any theory of <b>practical</b> <b>reasons,</b> that reasons must be capable of justifying actions, and that reasons must be capable of explaining intentional acts. Robert Johnson (The Philosophical Quarterly, 49 (1999), pp. 53 – 71) has argued that versions of internalism which avoid obvious problems nevertheless fail to capture both conditions. I argue that Johnson's criticisms rest upon a misinterpretation of the 'explanatory condition', and I proceed to formulate a version of internalism which will allow <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> to have both justificatory and explanatory force...|$|R

25|$|Both {{iron and}} bronze cannons had their {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Forged iron cannons were far cheaper, {{up to ten}} times so, than bronze cannons, but more unstable due to their piece built nature. Iron cannons tended to burst apart, sometimes killing or severely maiming their operators. Successive firings took their toll on iron cannons as individual pieces were shook loose. Bronze cannons simply cracked. Even without use, iron cannons were liable to rust away. Bronze cannons did not rust. Another less <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> for the dominance of bronze cannons was their aesthetic appeal. Because cannons were so important as displays of power and prestige, rulers liked to commission bronze cannons, which could be sculpted into fanciful designs such as flute columns, lions' and serpents' mouths, containing artistic motifs or symbols. It was for these reasons that the cast-bronze cannon became the preferred type by the late 1400s. By the late 1500s only small breech-loading pieces were made of wrought iron. Iron cannons would regain ground in the late 1500s as improved casting techniques allowed cast-iron cannons to become more reliable, although still inferior to the safer bronze cannons.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
