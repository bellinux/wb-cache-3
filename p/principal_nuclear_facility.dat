Due {{to the fact that the}} Czech Republic is bound by the international commitments and its membership in the EU, the master thesis also covers the international and European regulations. The master thesis is composed of four parts, which are subdivided into chapters and subchapters. The first part is devoted to the concept of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>facilities,</b> its kinds, position in the legal system and the relevant legal instruments. The second part deals with a particular legal framework of the nuclear law, which governs the issue, including the international, European and Czech regulations. A separate chapter discusses the principles, which are common to the all relevant branch of law. The third part is concerned with the life cycle of the operation of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>facility</b> and the conditions for execution of its particular stages.

The Orders are closely-related and contain some requirements that are either identical, similar, or logically-related. Consequently, WHC has developed a strategy calling for an integrated implementation of the three Orders. The strategy is comprised of three primary objectives, namely: Obtain DOE approval of a single list of DOE-owned and WHC-managed <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Facilities,</b> Establish and/or upgrade the ``Safety Basis`` for each <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Facility,</b> and Establish a functional Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) process to govern the management and preservation of the Safety Basis for each <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Facility.</b> WHC has developed policy-revision and facility-specific implementation plans to accomplish near-term tasks associated with the above strategic objectives.
