The IoT is based on a group of connected objects, using embedded electronic, software, sensors and communication protocols able to collect and exchange information with different types of applications through networks connected to the internet. Within the different communications technologies that exists for the IoT, the LPWAN has emerged where the technologies that have triumphed and have been deployed successfully are the ones based on the LoRa/LoRaWAN protocol. The main feature and the reason why this technology has all the attention is that achieves long range transmissions in exchange of a very low energy consumption. To reach these aims, all the sensors on the network have to be well configured.

This becomes more prominent with their wider use which means that these disturbances {{have a tendency to}} aggravate in future. One of the results will be that additional losses will occur and end-users will also be penalised for it by paying more. There is a need to revert this tendency also in an effort to help lower pollution.

A power quality disturbance can be measured with a <b>power</b> quality <b>analyser</b> to help the technician find its cause. This is the first step to finding a solution to resolve the disturbance. The objective of this project was to implement digital signal processing algorithms on a FPGA for the analysis of power quality disturbances.

This thesis focuses on the problems due to voltage collapses in a transmission system. The ability to foresee an upcoming collapse is vital to maintain stable {{operation of}} the grid. The grid operator at Svenska Kraftnät (SvK) uses the computer program SPICA to predict the maximum transfer limit at specified transfer sections. SPICA uses actual states from the grid to predict the transfer limitation, and a quarter later a renewed estimate is produced and so on. This means that the operator can se his transfer limits vary every fifteen minutes. Our task in this project is to validate the accuracy of the limitations obtained by SPICA. The validation process was carried out as a comparison with another <b>power</b> system <b>analyser,</b> ARISTO. The latter program simulates transient stability as a function of time, and is a versatile tool in many aspects. Another objective of this project is to develop the two programs as we discover disparity. Our investigations carried out in the CIGRÉ Nordic 32 test system show that, the method of repeatedly updated load flows can in some extent be used to predict the limit of stable operation, in a transfer limiting point of view. Repeatedly investigations show that the prediction seems to be more accurate, the closer the actual point of operation, is to the physical transfer limit. Further investigations with ARISTO as a guide, we discovered that this behaviour depended on the way to express the reactance in the generator model, which in case of a net failure causes SPICA to produce a value some few percent too high. During the process we also discovered a couple of improvements of the software involved, which were immediately implemented by the system administrator. The continuous upgrades have led to an iterative process of the analysis.

40|$|The current {{international}} standards on power quality and harmonics provide {{the definition of}} a set of power quantities as a common base for energy billing, evaluating electrical energy quality, detecting the sources of distortion, and designing mitigation equipments, such as power filters. However, they do not define or suggest any measurement methods for power quantities and detection of harmonic sources to quantify the flow of electrical energy and also determine the attribution of responsibility between customers and utilities. This work proposes a time-domain method for on-line precise calculation of power quantities and detection of the harmonic sources upstream or downstream the metering section. The distinctive property of the proposed method is its lower delay and higher accuracy compared to the others as it utilizes a recursive implementation of the Clarke-Park transformations in order to calculate the fundamental components of voltage and current waveforms that in turn avoids the low-pass filtering stage. This stage, required for the Direct Clarke-Park transformation-based method to obtain the fundamental components in synchronous rotating frame, results in uncertainty and delay. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed time-domain method for single-phase and three-phase systems under various operating conditions. On the other side, hybrid power filter is assumed the most effective equipment for harmonic elimination, reactive power compensation, and load balancing when required. However, several factors affect the tuning frequency of the passive parts of the filter over time; hence the current harmonics cannot be utterly eliminated. This work proposes a rotary variable reactor which is able to change the resonance frequencies of such passive parts, as required, in order to mitigate dominant harmonics. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid power filter, including variable passive parts, is verified through the simulation for single-phase and three-phase applications. The results from this study reveal the integration of the functions of a <b>power</b> quality <b>analyser</b> and a smart metering system into a single box that will provide more intelligence about the customer interface with the utility grid as well as achieving the best performance of hybrid power filters over a wide range of cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{monitoring of the}} power grid voltage parameters, namely amplitude, frequency and phase {{is essential for the}} implementation of key power system functions such as control and protection, load shedding and restoration, assessment of power quality and impact of distributed generation to mention just few. Such monitoring requires modern digital signal processing (DSP) techniques which should be computationally efficient, accurate, fast and robust against any grid disturbances irrespective of their nature and type. Efficient low bandwidth DSP techniques for voltage monitoring will contribute to an economical realization of the smart grid vision for smart meters, phasor measurement units, and <b>power</b> quality <b>analyser.</b> The thesis contributes to the previously mentioned topic. First, it offers a comprehensive overview of the grid voltage parameters estimation techniques reported thus far in the technical literature. These techniques are the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Kalman filter (KF), least-squares (LS) and phase-locked loop (PLL). There are however limitations associated with these techniques. For instance, the DFT one requires periodic waveforms being sampled. While the KF and the LS offer better performance under grid disturbances, they are computationally demanding techniques for real-time implementation. The PLL is a simple technique to implement in real-time but requires a trade-off between good dynamic performance and estimation accuracy under distorted grid conditions. The thesis attempts to overcome the above mentioned limitations and proposes and documents the mathematical basis, simulation and experimental implementation of a number of DSP techniques for single-phase grid voltage fundamental frequency and/or amplitude estimation. First, the grid voltage fundamental frequency is tracked by four proposed techniques which are based on a Teager energy operator, a Newton-type algorithm and a differentiation filter, a voltage modulation, and a demodulation and a differentiation filter. In addition, the thesis reports five techniques to estimate both fundamental voltage amplitude and frequency based on a modified demodulation, the DFT and a second-order generalized integrator (DFT-SOGI), a SOGI and a differentiation filter (SOGI-DF), a cascaded delayed signal cancellation (CDSC), and a linear KF. The performance of the above nine techniques has been evaluated through simulation and experimentally. A comparison with selected competing techniques reported in the technical literature is also included for a number of cases. These cases cover at all times harmonics being present in the grid voltage under steady-state and in combination with frequency sweep, frequency step, voltage sag and voltage flicker. The results presented in the thesis confirm that the proposed techniques provide improved performance with respect to the existing techniques for the cases studied as mentioned above. All the proposed techniques can reject the negative effects caused by harmonics and can also meet the accuracy and dynamics as specified by the standard requirements. The techniques based on the voltage modulation, demodulation and differentiation filter, modified demodulation, DFT-SOGI, and SOGI-DF provide improved stability, since they do not include an interdependent loop for the feedback of the estimated fundamental frequency. On the other hand, the techniques relying on the Teager energy operator, Newton-type algorithm and differentiation filter, modified demodulation, SOGI-DF, and CDSC are relatively computationally efficient for being implemented in real-time digital signal processors. The thesis concludes with a benchmark comparison of all the proposed techniques in terms of a number of key criteria such as accuracy, dynamic performance, stability, simplicity and computational efficiency. The comparison provides a proven way for choosing a suitable technique for single-phase grid voltage fundamental amplitude and/or frequency estimation. Finally, research directions for conducting future research are discussed...|$|R
