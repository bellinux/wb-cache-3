2500|$|March 26, 2005. Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, {{but says}} [...] "the key public-health {{findings}} of this study are robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, making it the main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths.... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as the main cause of death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by <b>passive</b> <b>surveillance</b> methods or in press accounts." ...|$|E

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a tick-borne disease, {{transmitted}} to humans via the bite of an Ixodes scapularis tick infected with the spirochetal bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. This disease is endemic in Connecticut and has been increasing in prevalence throughout New England for the past 30 years. Data collected from I. scapularis ticks submitted by the public to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station and the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory for B. burgdorferi testing from 2002 to 2012 were compared with Lyme disease case data from the Connecticut Department of Public Health to determine the capacity at which <b>passive</b> tick <b>surveillance</b> {{can be used to}} assess the risk of acquiring Lyme disease. The cumulative number of passively submitted ticks was moderately correlated with the number of reported Lyme disease cases among all Connecticut towns (r = 0. 488, p 3 ̆e 0. 0001, n= 169 towns). Passive tick submissions and Lyme disease cases were also correlated using data within the same surveillance year as well as the following surveillance year (r= 0. 473, p 3 ̆e 0. 0001 and r= 0. 250, p 3 ̆e 0. 001, respectively). The results of this project suggest that <b>passive</b> tick <b>surveillance,</b> using ticks submitted by the public for B. burgdorferi testing, may be used to evaluate the spatial and temporal impacts on Lyme disease incidence in Connecticut. However, {{the results of this study}} further imply that <b>passive</b> tick <b>surveillance</b> was more strongly correlated to the temporal measures examined in comparison to the spatial predictors examined.

40|$|International audienceVector-borne {{diseases}} pose {{a special}} challenge to veterinary authorities due to complex and time-consuming surveillance programs {{taking into account}} vector habitat. Using stochastic scenario tree modelling, each possible surveillance activity of a future surveillance system can be evaluated with regard to its sensitivity and the expected cost. The overall sensitivity of various potential surveillance systems, composed of different combinations of surveillance activities, is calculated and the proposed surveillance system is optimized {{with respect to the}} considered surveillance activities, the sensitivity and the cost. The objective of this project was to use stochastic scenario tree modelling in combination with a simple cost analysis in order to develop the national surveillance system for Bluetongue in Switzerland. This surveillance system was established due to the emerging outbreak of Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) in Northern Europe in 2006. Based on the modelling results, it was decided to implement an improved <b>passive</b> clinical <b>surveillance</b> in cattle and sheep through campaigns in order to increase disease awareness alongside a targeted bulk milk testing strategy in 200 dairy cattle herds located in high-risk areas. The estimated median probability of detection of cases (i. e. sensitivity) of the surveillance system in this combined approach was 96. 4 %. The evaluation of the prospective national surveillance system predicted that <b>passive</b> clinical <b>surveillance</b> in cattle would provide the highest probability to detect BTV- 8 infected animals, followed by <b>passive</b> clinical <b>surveillance</b> in sheep and bulk milk testing of 200 dairy cattle farms in high-risk areas.

40|$|Background: Prevention {{and control}} of {{wildlife}} disease invasions relies {{on the ability to}} predict spatio-temporal dynamics and understand the role of factors driving spread rates, such as seasonality and transmission distance. <b>Passive</b> disease <b>surveillance</b> (i. e., case reports by public) is a common method of monitoring emergence of wildlife diseases, but can be challenging to interpret due to spatial biases and limitations in data quantity and quality. Methodology/Principal findings: We obtained <b>passive</b> rabies <b>surveillance</b> data from dead striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in an epizootic in northern Colorado, USA. We developed a dynamic patch-occupancy model which predicts spatio-temporal spreading while accounting for heterogeneous sampling. We estimated the distance travelled per transmission event, direction of invasion, rate of spatial spread, and effects of infection density and season. We also estimated mean transmission distance and rates of spatial spread using a phylogeographic approach on a subsample of viral sequences from the same epizootic. Both the occupancy and phylogeographic approaches predicted similar rates of spatio-temporal spread. Estimated mean transmission distances were 2. 3 km (95...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{variety and}} {{richness}} of what users browse on the Internet {{has made the}} communications of web-browsing hosts an attractive target for surveillance. We show that <b>passive</b> external <b>surveillance</b> of webbrowsing hosts in private networks is possible despite the anonymizing effects of NATs and HTTP proxies at the gateway. These devices effectively anonymize the origin of communication streams, and remove many identifying features, {{making it difficult to}} group web traffic into mutually disjoint same-host sets called user sessions. User sessions offer a complete picture of each user’s web browsing experience. Without them, <b>passive</b> external <b>surveillance</b> is of little use. This paper offers a content analysis technique called Link Chaining that aids the sessionization process by recovering large pieces of user sessions called session fragments. The technique is based on the knowledge that the majority of downloaded web resources are clicked-to from other web pages. By following hyperlinks in the bodies of HTTP messages in passively collected trace data, web traffic can be be coalesced into session fragments and used by human analysts to isolate individual user sessions. The technique gives the human analyst a significant advantage over manual methods. The implementation presented here has been tested on accumulated local data and demonstrates the feasibility of the scheme. 1...|$|R

40|$|Aim: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} forecasting model for predicting bluetongue outbreaks in North-west agroclimatic zone of Tamil Nadu, India. Materials and Methods: Eleven bluetongue outbreaks were characterised by active and <b>passive</b> <b>surveillances</b> {{for a period of}} twelve years and used in this study. Meteorological data comprising of maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed were collected and used as the multiple predictor variables in the multiple liner regression model. Results: A multiple liner regression model was developed for the North-west zone of Tamil Nadu. Values of the dependant variables were less than or greater than one, and indicated remote or greater chances of bluetongue outbreaks respectively. The monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity at 8. 30 h and at 17. 00 h IST, wind speed, and monthly total rainfall of 29. 1 - 31. 0 &# 176;C, 20. 1 - 22. 0 &# 176;C, 80. 1 &# 150; 85. 0 %, 65. 1 &# 150; 70. 0 %, 3. 1 &# 150; 5. 0 km/h and < 200 mm respectively, were identified as the ideal climatic conditions for increased numbers of bluetongue outbreaks in this zone.
