The {{goal is to}} havestudents develop a fully functional autonomous aerial vehicle over time as part of projects <b>and</b> <b>master</b> <b>s</b> theses. A range of projects were carried out fall 2010, among others the report General Platform for Unmanned Autonomous Systems was written {{on the topic of}} hardware, operating systems and peripheral interfacing. This <b>master</b> <b>s</b> thesis continues where the previous report left suggestions for further work, and covers the topics of a software framework, sensor error detection, actuator and sensor interfacing, that is now part of the autonomous flight system. A highly modular software framework has been constructed, applicable far beyond theunmanned vehicle domain. Due to the high level of encapsulation and modularity it isespecially valuable in projects where there is a high mobility of the workforce, such as student projects and theses. It acts as a middleware layer, with language independent, separately compilable modules, communicating with one another to achieve the desired functionality. To prevent unrealistic or erroneous sensor readings from spreading through the system, a software detection unit catches signal anomalies based on statistics and alerts subscribing modules. The algorithm has been interfaced into the software framework, and is applicable to numerous sensors. Hardware was designed, constructed and tested to handle sensor interfacing, power supply demands and real-time critical actions such as actuator control. The design is performed from an aerial vehicle application point of view, but general {{to such an extent that}} is usable in a wide range of autonomous crafts. The framework, filter and hardware are merged together and tested on an embedded system, verifying the system functionality with a feedback loop from measurements to actuators. Utilizing the previous work along with all three elements of this thesis, a fully functional system for vehicle control is achieved...|$|R

But the theoretical debate has slowed down worryingly during the last decades, with only a few, although important, exceptions confined to particular schools. Both the methodologies and the form of expression of the ethnographic report have developed and then crystallized around actual protocols. Ethnography is now reduced to a Protokollaufnahme. But maybe the implicit and explicit anthropological critique to the dichotomy Subject/Object, i. e. the key discussion about the notion of das Fremde and about the relations between Wissenschaftler and Irrationale, speak for an immanent non “protocolarity” of anthropology. Anthropology, which has at least become an Existenzial in its historicisation (Heidegger), can finally disappear as a positivist science, in order to rise again...|$|R

40|$|The book {{presents}} the lectures delivered during a short course held at Urbino University in summer 2015 on qualitative theory of dynamical systems, {{included in the}} activities of the COST Action IS 1104 “The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation”. It provides a basic introduction to dynamical systems and optimal control both in continuous and discrete time, as well as some numerical methods and applications in economic modelling. Economic and social systems are intrinsically dynamic, characterized by interdependence, nonlinearity and complexity, and these features can only be approached using a qualitative analysis based on the study of invariant sets (equilibrium points, limit cycles and more complex attractors, together with the boundaries of their basins of attraction), which requires a trade-off between analytical, geometrical and numerical methods. Even though the early steps of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems have been in continuous time models, in economic and social modelling discrete time is often used to describe event-driven (often decision-driven) evolving systems. The book is written for <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>and</b> <b>master’s</b> students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers in economics or sociology, and it only assumes a basic knowledge of calculus.

Although the climatic global warming process continues, in some years, the climatic evolutions are atypical in Oltenia {{as well as in the}} entire country, and, consequently, the spring of 2011 was cold and droughty. Compared to the last 12 springs, the thermal regime indicates that the spring of 2011 was unique, and the pluviometric regime that it was droughty, although the agricultural crops were not affected due to the lower thermal regime that maintained a satisfactory degree of the soil humidity. The late spring hoarfrosts on 7 and 8 May have also had damaging effects in Oltenia. In consequence, there were some stagnation periods for the agricultural crops, and some important delays for the vegetables crops, and there were significant damages in the places where the seedlings were removed in the field. As a consequence of the thermal variations, there have been some diseases and pests, especially Monilinia laxa in stone fruits. Although the periods of weather cooling are considered beneficial to the climate general evolution on the planet, if they appear in the late spring, they represent an important climatic risk factor. Thus, their forecast is welcome especially for the agriculture.
