This paper examines the viability of analogous <b>principles</b> in ethics, which I call ought-ought <b>principles</b> (OO <b>principles</b> for short). Several epistemologists have recently offered new defenses of KK <b>principles</b> and of other related <b>principles</b> and there has recently been an increased interest in examining analogies between ethics and epistemology and so it seem natural to examine whether defenses of KK and related <b>principles</b> carry over to OO <b>principles.</b> In this paper I introduce two OO <b>principles</b> and I show how some arguments in favor of KK carry over to them.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The {{article is}} devoted to the {{definition}} of the content of interaction between attractiveness producer and its recipients through the prism of general and derived management <b>principles.</b> Actuality of this article is caused by the formation of long-term relationships between business subjects. The main aim of these relationships is attracting and using of resources to further joint production and benefits distribution from these activities. Formation of such long-term relationships in condition of high competitiveness is one of the urgent problems of modern enterprises. In this regard, the traditional management <b>principles</b> are supplemented by the <b>principles</b> of the interaction and attractiveness managing. The purpose of the article is further improving of management <b>principles</b> through the establishment of specific management <b>principles</b> of the interaction between market attractiveness producer and its recipients. The results of the analysis. Management <b>principles</b> are the statements of fundamental truth based on logic which provides guidelines for managerial decision making and actions. The research of classic, general and structural management <b>principles</b> is conducted in the article. The possibility and necessity of ascertainment of the derivative management <b>principles</b> of interaction between subjects of market environment is noted. Derivative management <b>principles</b> reflect the content of the specialized management activity on forming of enterprise attractiveness. The analysis of existing management <b>principles</b> of different objects is conducted. It is established that as a basis for systematization of management <b>principles</b> scientists use different management features, such as socio-political <b>principles,</b> <b>principles</b> of management culture and state-administrative activity, socio-political, structural, scientific, legal, personnel and organizational basis. Results of research of management <b>principles</b> and management interaction proved the similarities between the majorities of the considered <b>principles.</b> This fact gives an opportunity to formulate the basic management <b>principles</b> of interaction between attractiveness producer and its recipients. Such <b>principles</b> are proposed to subdivide into two large mega groups:principles of cognitive activity or general science, which have their own peculiarities, but generally not differ from the <b>principles</b> of knowledge in any other sphere of science;principles of the implementation of practical management activities. <b>Principles</b> that are essentially different from <b>principles</b> in other areas. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Proposed <b>principles</b> are comprehensive and cover a lot of aspects of enterprises management interaction. Specific management <b>principles</b> of interaction between attractiveness producer and its recipients should not contradict classical, general and structural <b>principles,</b> but on the contrary, they should contribute to the strengthening of management unity...|$|R
