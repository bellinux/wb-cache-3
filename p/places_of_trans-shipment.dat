40|$|The city of Dordrecht {{has always}} had a strong {{connection}} to the rivers surrounding it. In the early days the city was the centre <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>of</b> goods on the north-south and east-west trade routes across Europe. In these days, the rivers formed the only entrance to the city. In the last two centuries the city was connected to land infrastructure (railway and roads), which led to a shift of the city centre. With the coming of the railway and its station south of Dordrecht in 1872 the main entrance to the city was shifted from the rivers to the land. This led to a shift of the location of the city centre, it used to be parallel to the river, now it shifted more to the south, leading to regression in the old city centre and to a diminished connection with the other cities on the river banks (Zwijndrecht and Papendrecht).

They have the desir- 2 able property of bounding the difference in payoffs obtained by starting from one state or another. All constructions are described as the special case of a unique one, which we call the Hutchinson hemi-metric on various spaces of continuous previsions. We show a directed form of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem, stating that the Hutchinson hemi-metric on spaces of continuous probability valuations coincides with a notion <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> hemi-metric. We also identify the class of so-called sym-compact spaces as the right class of topological spaces, where the theory works out as nicely as possible. ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1820s, Norwich {{was served}} by vessels using the River Yare, which flows through Breydon Water {{before joining the}} River Bure and then the North Sea near Great Yarmouth. Breydon Water is a wide expanse of shallow water, and {{therefore}} required cargo arriving at Yarmouth to be trans-shipped into smaller vessels which could then reach Norwich. There was discontent among the merchants of Norwich at the cost <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment,</b> and allegations <b>of</b> systematic theft of cargo, {{which resulted in a}} court case in 1820, when 18 men were convicted of taking the goods and another of receiving it. Against this background, William Cubitt was asked to investigate possible solutions in 1814.|$|R
50|$|Economy of MontrealIn the 17th century, Montreal {{acted as}} a point <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> and a {{stopover}} on the passage to the interior. Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post. Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until {{the construction of a}} road in 1735. Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect.|$|R

40|$|This paper derives the {{mathematical}} expressions for the transit time of cargo through a liner shipping network. Main efforts {{are devoted to}} deriving the calculation expressions of the connection time <b>of</b> cargo during <b>trans-shipment.</b> For the forward and many-to-one trans-shipment policies, we conduct a minor correction towards the expressions in existing studies to improve the completeness. Meanwhile, we propose an alternative but more straightforward calculation method for connection time which bypasses the complicated inductive argument in existing studies. Then we introduce two new trans-shipment policies: backward trans-shipment and one-to-many trans-shipment, and mathematically calculate the corresponding connection times. Numerical experiments also deliver some managerial insights into the effectiveness <b>of</b> backward <b>trans-shipment</b> in transit time control. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

500|$|The {{terminal}} {{was very}} successful {{for the first five}} years of operation, but then events began to move against it. The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated. Shipping goods in the form of infrequent but very large loads involves engaging more idle capital in the form of stock than the alternatives. Also, the process <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> is costly. The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the [...] "just-in-time" [...] approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late 1970s had a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the use of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned. Thus, by the late 1970s, the local Gulf operating company (Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd) was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company was forced to undertake a number of cost-saving measures.|$|R

40|$|Darwin, {{the capital}} of the Northern Territory, is a port city located in Australia’s Top End and facing Southeast Asia. The {{distance}} from Darwin to Australia’s main economic centres of Sydney and Melbourne is almost the same as to Singapore. This central geographical location has inspired the development of the Port and the City of Darwin from time to time while being held back by its remoteness, and especially the lack of an efficient railway link to Australia’s major southern centres. The Port of Darwin has been redeveloped with the vision of repositioning the City of Darwin as Australia’s gateway to Asia which it was expected to achieve with the completion of the transcontinental railwaylink from Adelaide to Darwin. This paper analyses trade and cargo movements for the Port of Darwin between 2000 and 2009 - 5 years for each period before and after the availability of intermodal transport - and examines the processes by which transformation of the gateway is actually occurring. The evidence to date, however, suggests that the landbridge development has had little material effect in terms <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipments</b> and throughputs for the Port of Darwin. The volume of container trade and interstate export and import cargo that passes through the port has in fact declined since the availability of the transcontinental railway in 2005...|$|R

The eastern ship channel is populated with patch and fringing coral reefs. In 2002, approximately 20 % of an originally sloping face of Rackham’s Cay, on the southern edge of the channel, was cut vertically to 18 m and dredged to widen the channel. The successional changes on the newly created vertical limestone wall was assessed between 2009 and 2012 at 5 m, 10 m and 15 m depths using bi-annual photographs of fixed 1 m² quadrats. Photographs were analyzed using Coral Point Count. No colonization of either algal or coralline species was observed at 15 m. Initially calcareous and fleshy algae dominated at 5 m but showed a gradual decrease over time. Calcareous algae dominated at 10 m and increaseed gradually over the 4 years. Stony corals at both 5 m and 10 m had overall low cover and slow colonization; the shallower depth had more coverage (4. 1 % maximum in 2011). Siderastrea sidera -which dominated Rackham’s Cay before dredging- was consistently present in low coverage. Colonization by species of Acropora and Scolymia indicate slower but better succession at 10 m. Ten years following dredging activities, colonization and recruitment have been slow but successful at 5 m and 10 m; species previously described as abundant lead the colonization. We recommend limiting coral relocation activities to depths not exceeding 10 m...|$|R
