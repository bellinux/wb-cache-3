5|$|The Italian painter Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) {{was fascinated}} by perspective, as shown in his <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Battle of San Romano (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie {{conveniently}} along perspective lines.|$|E
5|$|Another {{memorial}} to the destroyed school appears {{in the form of}} a mural in the Mahane Yehuda Market parking lot to the west. This mural depicts <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main building and garden, and pictures of teachers and students.|$|E
50|$|Between 1945 and 1949, the American painter Paul Cadmus {{created a}} series of vivid, powerful, and gruesome <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven deadly sins.|$|R

5|$|Contemporary {{painters}} {{are also}} inspired by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework {{for some of}} her works, and the master's anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.|$|E
5|$|The Dining Room {{walls are}} painted faux jasper and hold <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house's patron—Sir Francis Dashwood—and his fellow {{members of the}} Divan Club (a society {{for those who had}} visited the Ottoman Empire). The room also has a painted ceiling from Wood's Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The English painter J. M. W. Turner visited Wells in 1795, making {{sketches}} of the precinct and a water colour {{of the west}} front, now in the Tate gallery. Other artists whose <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral are in national collections are Albert Goodwin, John Syer and Ken Howard.|$|E

5|$|Badal Mahal (The weather palace) {{is part of}} the Anup Mahal extensions. It has {{paintings}} of Shekhawati Dundlod chiefs paying respects to the Maharaja of Bikaner in different types of turbans. Photos of people standing on nails, wood, swords and saws are also depicted here – a display of faith and endurance. The walls in this palace depict fresco <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu god Krishna and his consort Radha amidst the rain clouds.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Jahangir first {{mentions}} his alterations to {{the fort}} in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana. Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling. British {{visitors to the}} fort noted Christian iconography during the Jahangir period, with <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madonna and Jesus found in the fort complex. In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, {{to be brought to}} Indianapolis. The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of Statuary, attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 visitors. A 1937 exhibition, Dutch <b>Paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
50|$|He was {{especially}} noted for his <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> moonlit landscapes. <b>The</b> Museum at Haarlem has works by him.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Venus, <b>the</b> Roman goddess <b>of</b> {{love and}} fertility, {{included}} a scallop shell {{in the painting}} to identify her. This is evident in Botticelli's classically inspired 15th century painting <b>The</b> Birth <b>of</b> Venus.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Pieter Brueghel <b>the</b> Elder show {{many other}} {{circulating}} folk tales, such as <b>the</b> legend <b>of</b> Dulle Griet (Mad Meg), 1562.|$|R
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, French art of {{the period}} often {{depicted}} women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same subject, show that nudity could be controversial in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.|$|E
5|$|On the way back, {{they stayed}} again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawing and <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monuments there. Here, at the Valley of the Kings the {{expedition}} {{moved into the}} tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th dynasty), where the air was cooler. They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments. He received this news {{only a few days}} after Young's death in London.|$|E

5|$|The Indianapolis Museum of Art is {{the ninth}} oldest and eighth largest encyclopedic art {{museum in the}} United States. The {{permanent}} collection comprises over 54,000 works, including African, American, Asian, and European pieces. Significant areas of the collection include: Neo-Impressionist paintings; Japanese <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Edo period; Chinese ceramics and bronzes; paintings, sculptures, and prints by Paul Gauguin and the Pont-Aven School; {{a large number of}} works by J. M. W. Turner; and a growing contemporary art collection. Other areas of emphasis include textiles and fashion arts as well as a recent focus on modern design.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{refitted}} Saien in 1898, partly replacing her existing Hotchkiss guns {{with eight}} quick-firing 6 pounders. While supporting the Imperial Japanese Army following the Battle of Port Arthur {{during the opening}} stages of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Saien struck a submerged Russian mine on 30 November 1904. Eight crewmen in the engine room were killed immediately by the explosion, with the cruiser sinking rapidly over the following two minutes. During this time only two boats could be launched, saving 70 of the crew, along {{with a collection of}} various items entrusted to them by the officers such as the signal book and some <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imperial family.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
50|$|His <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> history follow <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time: theatricality {{combined}} with bright colors, contrast {{of lights and}} precision of detail. He died in Paris.|$|R
50|$|A Byzantine spangenhelm; a Madonna made of ivory; {{a relief}} cycle of Prince Electors; a cycle <b>of</b> nine <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Mary by <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Housebook.|$|R
50|$|He {{is likely}} {{best known for}} his <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Ferrara and <b>the</b> one {{entitled}} Capri. In the late 1880s, he made the painting The Eton Boy.|$|R
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} same vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} Santa Cruz, the town's patron, {{was located in}} a small shrine {{on top of another}} {{containing}} the wooden statue of San Vicente Ferrer, the town's secondary patron, on the central niche of the retablo-mayor. Above the central niche was the image of the Holy Trinity. On both sides, above the two other niches on the main altar, were <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegories of the Finding and Veneration of the True Cross. The rest of the retablos in the transept contained images of saints.|$|E
5|$|The <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised {{by the use of}} symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E

50|$|He also {{exhibited}} his work, at the Royal Academy and a {{solo show}} <b>of</b> <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Cyprus at <b>the</b> Beaux Arts Gallery at Bruton Place in London.|$|R
50|$|He {{still remains}} a popular public figure even after retirement. In November 2008, {{he was invited}} to release a {{portfolio}} <b>of</b> <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> Shrinathji by <b>the</b> Archer foundation.|$|R
