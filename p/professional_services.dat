40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to better {{understand}} service supply chain management by analysing the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain in <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms (PSFs) and exploring how the high performance work systems (HPWS) influence <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance. In addition, this study seeks to examine the relationship between <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance and the overall organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach – Analysis of PSF suggests a three-step of <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain as the clients' requests, partners forming working teams or so-called team formation and utilization, and delivering of solutions or services to clients. Based on extensive literature review, the authors hypothesize that HPWS have a positive impact on the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance and the team formation and utilization mediates the link. They also hypothesize the positive link between the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance and the overall organisational firm performance. Employing survey method, data was collected from 93 accounting firms at two time points. In May 2010 (Time 1), a survey including questions on HPWS, team formation and utilization and <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance were sent out to the managing partners and HR directors in accounting firms based in Ireland. Around one year later (Time 2), another survey measuring firm performance was sent out. This data allowed the authors to establish causal pattern in their results. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyse data to test hypotheses. Findings – The results indicate the positive link between HPWS and the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance. The team formation and utilization mediates the above relationship. In addition, <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance was found to be positively linked to the firm performance. Research limitations/implications – The present study is limited in terms of sample size, single industry and self-report data. Future research also needs to examine more mediators or moderators – the mechanisms through which HPWS work on the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain. Practical implications – Firms using higher level of HPWS experience better <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance. Human resource management practices that promote employees' ability, motivation and opportunities which allow teams to be formed more effectively to work with clients enhance organizational performance and higher profit levels. Managers able to effectively adopt and implement these teamwork-based HR practices and encourage and support employees' collaboration through such practices enhance the firm's <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain effectiveness and its organisational performance. Social implications – The authors' study focuses on the service supply chain management operations within the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms. In doing so, their research answers the call by Ellram et al. for more supply chain management research with respect to the service sector. It addresses a significant research gap identified by Rahman and Wu, namely, “relatively little attention has been given to the service suppliers' perspective”. By linking service supply chain management and human resource management, this study also answers a few calls for more research on the interaction of human resource management and supply chain management, service supply chain and human resource management in <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms. Originality/value – This is one of the few studies to analyse the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain management and assess the human resource management and supply chain management link. Moreover, it is the first study which empirically establishes the link between human resource management and <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> supply chain performance in PSFs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> provider’s {{role in the}} {{customer}} resource integration process for value creation, by drawing on research {{in the areas of}} resource integration, service experience, and role theory. Roles are flexible, in that behaviors associated with a role may vary according to the situation, expectations, and learned behaviors of the actors involved. In the context of <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers who support a customer’s resource integration, these role variations accordingly can be termed resource integration styles. Grounded in managerial practice, the current study relies on in-depth interviews to determine the styles that <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers use to support customer resource integration in a financial planning setting. The proposed typology of five styles (delegate, mentor, partner, coach, and validator), termed <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers’ resource integration styles (PRO-RIS), can be described by eight resource integration activity dimensions: participation ratio, frequency of interaction, deliberation, decision-making, updating, educating, connecting, and motivating. This research thus provides rich qualitative insights into how <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers can support customers’ resource integration processes, through the provision of appropriate resources. Notably, <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers can offer distinct benefits by varying the combination of resources provided to facilitate value creation. No single, best style exists; <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> providers should leverage the various styles described by PRO-RIS and adapt the eight resource integration activities as needed to support their customers.

5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture {{and the role of}} the state. Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. The sheer volume of work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of globalization, {{two thirds of the}} world’s {{business}} takes place nowadays in the service sector. In line, <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms are growing their share of the global service production. However, saturation of the <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> sector has forced <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms to search for more heuristic ways to conduct business in the international markets. By leveraging effectively the firm’s <b>professionals,</b> a <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firm can lower its costs to clients and simultaneously generate additional value for the company and thus gain competitive advantage. Even though the academic field has shown growing interest towards services for decades, the fields of service productization and service internationalization are heavily understudied even today. Hence, the objective {{of this study was to}} contribute to the research on <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> internationalization and productization. The study concentrated on examining the impact that productization has on knowledge sharing and leveraging in <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms operating internationally. The research question focused on examining what implications productization has on knowledge transfer and leveraging during <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> internationalization by leaning on the existing research and on an empirical research. The empirical research was conducted as a single case study within a <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firm operating in debt-related administrative service business. The case company is one of the leading operators in its field of business and therefore offered a fruitful environment to observe and analyze the topics in question. Additionally, the case company has a strong international presence and a large scale of operations in the selected markets, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on the previous literature and on the empirical research, this study found that for <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> firms to efficiently utilize individual, tacit knowledge, in its internationalization processes, it must be shared with the whole organization. By exploiting productization as a knowledge leveraging mechanism, a PSF can apply and transfer knowledge profoundly during its internationalization processes that would otherwise be difficult to tap into. Productization might not be sufficient alone, but by complementing it with a favorable organizational structure and culture, and by encouraging open communication, a PSF may take advantage of the whole potential that productization has to offer...|$|R
