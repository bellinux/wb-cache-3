50|$|Protein energy {{malnutrition}} and {{micronutrient deficiency}} {{are two reasons}} for stunted growth in children under five years old in the least developed countries. Malnutrition leads to diarrhea and dehydration, and ultimately death. Millions of women in developing countries are stunted due to a history of childhood malnutrition. Women's bodies are thus underdeveloped, and their chances of surviving childbirth decrease. Due to underdeveloped bodies, the probability of an obstructed pregnancy increases. <b>Protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency</b> results in low-quality breastmilk that provides less energy and other nutrition.|$|E
50|$|Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a {{parasitic}} disease {{caused by the}} parasitic flatworm trematodes. Moreover, more than 80 percent of the 200 million people worldwide who have schistosomiasis live in sub-Saharan Africa. Infections often occur in contaminated water where freshwater snails release larval forms of the parasite. After penetrating the skin and eventually traveling to the intestines or the urinary tract, the parasite lays eggs and infects those organs. It damages the intestines, bladder, and other organs {{and can lead to}} anemia and <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Along with malaria, schistosomiasis {{is one of the most}} important parasitic co-factors aiding in HIV transmission. Epidemiological data shows schistosome-endemic areas coincide with areas of high HIV prevalence, suggesting that parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis increase risk of HIV transmission.|$|E

25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary <b>deficiencies.</b> <b>Protein-energy</b> malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|R

30|$|Malnutrition {{is defined}} by the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) as any “any {{nutritional}} imbalance” (White et al. 2012, p. 730). More specifically, malnutrition can refer to a state of under-nutrition (from insufficient intake or impaired utilisation), or over-nutrition (from excessive calorie intake and/or inadequate physical activity) (Escott-Stump 2012). Either state leads to altered body composition and function (Saunder et al. 2010). It is important however, that the term ‘under-nutrition’ is not confused with being underweight (e.g. often represented by Body Mass Index [BMI] < 18.5  kg/m 2). Under-nutrition is a term used synonymously with <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency,</b> where there is a loss of body cell mass with signs of subcutaneous fat loss and skeletal muscle wasting and therefore (Escott-Stump 2012; Saunder et al. 2010); under-nutrition can occur irrespective of individuals’ BMI (Saunder et al. 2010). Malnutrition, in this study protocol, refers to ‘under-nutrition’, meaning protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) (Escott-Stump 2012).|$|E
40|$|In South Africa {{few studies}} have {{examined}} the effects of the overlap of HIV and helminth infections on nutritional status. This cross-sectional study investigated the interaction between HIV and intestinal helminths coinfection with nutritional status among KwaZulu-Natal adults. Participants were recruited from a comprehensive primary health care clinic and stratified based on their HIV, stool parasitology, IgE, and IgG 4 results into four groups: the uninfected, HIV infected, helminth infected, and HIV-helminth coinfected groups. The nutritional status was assessed using body mass index, 24 -hour food recall, micro-, and macronutrient biochemical markers. Univariate and multivariate multinomial probit regression models were used to assess nutritional factors associated with singly and dually infected groups using the uninfected group as a reference category. Biochemically, the HIV-helminth coinfected group was associated with a significantly higher total protein, higher percentage of transferrin saturation, and significantly lower ferritin. There was no significant association between single or dual infections with HIV and helminths with micro- and macronutrient deficiency; however general obesity and low micronutrient intake patterns, which may indicate a general predisposition to micronutrient and <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency,</b> were observed and may need further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Sarcopenia is a {{condition}} of multifaceted etiology arising in many elderly people. In patients with chronic kidney, the loss of muscle mass is much more intensive and {{the first signs of}} sarcopenia are observed in younger patients than it is expected.

40|$|Objective: Malnutrition in Africa has not {{improved}} {{compared with other}} regions in the world. Investment in the build-up of a strong African research workforce is essential to provide contextual solutions to the nutritional problems of Africa. To orientate this process, we reviewed nutrition research carried out in Africa and published during the last decade. Design: We assessed nutrition research from Africa published between 2000 and 2010 from MEDLINE and EMBASE and analysed the study design and type of intervention for studies indexed with major MeSH terms for vitamin A <b>deficiency,</b> <b>protein–energy</b> malnutrition, obesity, breast-feeding, nutritional status and food security. Affiliations of first authors were visualised as a network and power of affiliations was assessed using centrality metrics. Setting: Africa. Subjects: Africans, all age groups. Results: Most research on the topics was conducted in Southern (36 %) and Western Africa (34 %). The intervention studies (9 %; n 95) mainly tested technological and curative approaches to the nutritional problems. Only for papers on protein–energy malnutrition and obesity did lead authorship from Africa exceed that from non-African affiliations. The 10 % most powerfully connected affiliations were situated mainly outside Africa for publications on vitamin A deficiency, breast-feeding, nutritional status and food security. Conclusions: The development of the evidence base for nutrition research in Africa is focused on treatment {{and the potential for}} cross-African networks to publish nutrition research from Africa remains grossly underutilised. Efforts to build capacity for effective nutrition action in Africa will require forging a true academic partnership between African and non-African research institutions...|$|R
40|$|Despite great {{development}} in socioeconomic status throughout 50 years of independence, Malaysia is still plagued with soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH). STH {{continue to have}} a significant impact on public health particularly in rural communities. In order to determine the prevalence of STH among rural Orang Asli children and to investigate the possible risk factors affecting the pattern of this prevalence, fecal samples were collected from 292 Orang Asli primary schoolchildren (145 males and 147 females) age 7 - 12 years, from Pos Betau, Kuala Lipis, Pahang. The samples were examined by Kato-Katz and Harada Mori techniques. Socioeconomic data were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. The overall prevalence of ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infections were 67. 8, 95. 5 and 13. 4, respectively. Twenty-nine point eight percent of the children had heavy trichuriasis, while 22. 3 had heavy ascariasis. Sixty-seven point seven percent of the children had mixed infections. Age > 10 years (p = 0. 016), no toilet in the house (p = 0. 012), working mother (p = 0. 040), low household income (p = 0. 033), and large family size (p = 0. 028) were identified as risk factors for ascariasis. Logistic regression confirmed low income, no toilet in the house and working mother as significant risk factors for ascariasis. The prevalence of STH is still very high in rural Malaysian communities. STH may also contribute to other health problems such as micronutrient <b>deficiencies,</b> <b>protein-energy</b> malnutrition and poor educational achievement. Public health personnel need to reassess current control measures and identify innovative and integrated ways in order to reduce STH significantly in rural communities...|$|R

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA) {{is considered}} to be the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world. Estimates indicate that 1. 2 billion people suffer mild to severe forms of anemia and that up to 46 % of schoolchildren in developing countries are affected. In 2003, ENDSA, the national demographic and health survey of Bolivia showed that 60 % of children under five and 72 % of children under 2 years old were anemic. Micronutrient deficiency has been suggested to impair cell-mediated immunity. In particular, iron, zinc and vitamin A deficiencies {{have an impact on the}} immune system. In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies indicate a link between iron deficiency and impaired T-lymphocyte proliferation. The exact effects or mechanisms of iron deficiency on maturation and proliferation of T-lymphocytes in vivo are, however, not yet known. This study investigated the effects of iron on the maturation of T-lymphocytes in anemic but otherwise healthy schoolchildren (no apparent <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency</b> or other morbidity). Anemic children of a poor peri-urban school of Cochabamba city, Bolivia, were given iron treatment for three consecutive months. We chose to look at CD 1 a+ lymphocytes, which are immature thymocytes. The proportions of CD 1 a+ lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation measured at baseline and after treatment were compared with a reference group of age-matched non-anemic children controls from the same school. The immunologic parameters, although improved, did not reach the proportions of the control group. Overall, the proportion of circulating immature T-lymphocytes decreased from 18. 3 % to 9. 2 % in the treated following iron supplementation in anemic children, compared with 3. 4 % in non-anemic children...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{worldwide}} ageing {{demographic trend}} {{has resulted in}} a growing number of frail elderly who are in the last stages of autonomous living. Oral nutritional interventions for the frail elderly address the body’s natural weight loss, sometimes reversing weight loss, though the literature is not of one accord. No review of nutritional interventions has been conducted for community-dwelling frail elderly, {{who are most likely to}} benefit from these interventions and delay adverse outcomes. Objective: (i) This systematic review analyzes results from randomized controlled trials of oral nutrition interventions for the community-dwelling frail elderly to determine their efficacy in making gains in nutritional and functional status. (ii) The secondary objective is to analyze the quality of the studies in this review and draw conclusions for further areas of development in the field of nutrition in elderly care. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of oral nutritional supplements were searched in The Cochrane Library and PubMed, and hand searched in reference lists of systematic reviews. These interventions targeted <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency</b> and included oral supplementation or supplementation paired with exercise compared to a placebo or usual practice. Community-dwelling frail elderly not institutionalized or hospitalized were eligible. Studies targeting disease-specific elderly were excluded. Results: Out of 120 search results, six trials were included in this review. A small weight gain from oral nutritional interventions among frail community-dwelling elderly was reported in five out of six studies. Functional status did not improve significantly with the interventions. Studies used unstandardized definitions and different ways to measure outcomes, resulting in heterogeneity. Conclusions: The few and poor quality of studies demonstrates the need for more studies of better quality and homogeneity assessing oral nutritional interventions for nutritional and functional gain in frail elderly who are not yet suffering from adverse outcomes. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} {{of total}} N-tau-methylhistidine {{by the growing}} rat was measured to evaluate the effects of dietary protein and energy restriction on muscle protein turnover in vivo. 2. Young male rats (about 100 g initial wt.) were fed on one of three diets. Group I (controls) received an adequate 18 % lactalbumin diet for 28 days, on which they sustained maximum growth. Group II (protein-depleted) was fed for 14 days on 0. 5 lactalbumin diet, which caused loss of weight; {{this was followed by}} repletion for 14 days with the control diet. Group III (protein-energy restricted) received a 1 % lactalbumin diet at one-half the food intake of group II for 14 days, and this was also followed by 14 days of repletion with the control diet. 3. The controls showed a progressive rise in the daily urinary output of N-tau-methylhistidine, which was proportionally slightly less rapid than the body-weight increase. 4. The protein-depleted group II showed a marked and progressive decrease in N-tau-methylhistidine excretion, which was proportionally greater than the fall in body weight; during repletion, N-tau-methylhistidine output rose in parallel with body-weight increase, but it did not reach the value attained by the control group. 5. Group III, restricted in both dietary protein and energy, showed an initial small increase in daily N-tau-methylhistidine output, which contrasted with the sharp loss of body weight during this period. After 11 days on this restricted diet, group III then underwent a decrease in N-tau-methylhistidine output, which persisted into the first 4 days of the repletion period, after which output of the methylated amino acid became the same as for group II. 6. Creatinine output, used as an additional metabolic measure of muscle metabolism, showed a fairly constant relationship to body weight in groups I and II during depletion and repletion. However, rats with <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency</b> (group III) underwent a marked increase in output of creatinine per unit of body weight, which also persisited into the repletion period before it fell to more normal values relative to body weight. 7. Analysis of the N-tau-methylhistidine content of actin isolated from a group of protein-depleted rats revealed a small (5 %) but significance (P less than 0. 02) decrease relative to well-nourished controls. 8. Hence, the rate of muscle protein degradation, as indicated by changes in urinary N-tau-methylhistidine output, appears to respond sensitively and in opposite directions to insufficiency of protein of energy in the diet...|$|E
40|$|While originally, <b>protein-energy</b> <b>deficiency</b> was {{considered}} the main factor of malnutrition, it is now understood that micronutrient deficiencies play {{a fundamental role in}} a variety of health and disease outcomes. Zinc and iron deficiencies are still highly prevalent in low-income countries, whereas insufficient intakes and diets with low mineral absorption are the major causes. Sustainable and feasible dietary strategies are needed to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. The present research was designed to evaluate the nutritional status of adults and children from a rural tropical area in Bolivia. The evaluation was made taking into account: nutrient intakes assessed by our new developed and validated dietary assessment method, anthropometric measurements and biochemical indicators of trace element status. With a focus on elucidating the causes of existing deficiencies of zinc and iron, the content of the mineral absorption inhibitor phytate was evaluated in the main foods and in the dietary intake of the studied populations; the presence of parasitic diseases and their effect on the trace element status was also evaluated. Furthermore, the inclusion of a fermented food in the basal tropical diet was carried out in order to improve the absorption of zinc in the diet, it was evaluated in Wistar rats and compared with zinc-supplemented diets. The developed method for dietary assessment is based on digital photographs and it was satisfactorily validated against a reference method. Results of the dietary intake of children and adults showed the dietary patterns, mainly based on plant-foods: the main source of energy was carbohydrates 63 - 71 %E from starchy tubers, cereals, and legumes, fat 16 - 23 %E from oil or tallow, and protein 13 - 14 %E from plant-foods and a small contribution of animal-food sources. In adults, 7 % (women) were underweight. Zinc deficiency was found in 15 % of controls and 29 % of patients with leishmaniasis. The nutritional status of children was more diminished, indicating 37 % as being stunted, 17 % wasted and 17 % underweight, 87 % zinc deficient and 66 % iron deficient. The zinc deficiencies were negatively associated to the high levels of phytate in the diet, indicated by the correlations between serum zinc and phytate:zinc molar ratios; for adults - 0. 410 and children - 0. 458 (P< 0. 01). Parasitic infections; leishmaniasis and intestinal parasites have also been shown to {{have a negative effect on}} zinc and iron status. Finally, the inclusion of fermented cassava, in the basal plant-based diet was shown to have a positive effect increasing the zinc apparent absorption of the diet from 16. 5 to 40. 2 %, which is comparable to results obtained when the diet was supplemented with zinc. In conclusion, this research presents a suitable and reliable method for assessing the dietary intake in rural populations in developing countries. The dietary patterns of a rural population from Bolivia are presented, shedding light on the existence of zinc and iron deficiencies indicated to be caused by high levels of phytates in their diet and by the presence of parasitic diseases. Additionally, fermentation is presented as an efficient dietary strategy for the improvement of zinc absorption in the plant-based diet of the studied population; it may represent a better nutritional and economical alternative than the use of supplements, adequate for rural areas in developing countries, where the diets are limited in animal-food sources...|$|E
