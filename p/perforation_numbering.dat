The effects of <b>perforation</b> <b>number</b> (0 - 6), perforation diameter (0 - 3 mm), and perforation length (1. 5 - 6 mm), and orientations angle (0 - 180 degrees) on the thermal performance were investigated.

Upwardly oriented radial heat sinks have the best thermal performance while sideward oriented radial heat sinks yield worst thermal performance. The geometric parameters of perforation is shown to affect the thermal performance of heat sink significantly at relatively higher heat transfer rate, especially for upward and sideward orientations. The thermal resistance of the radial heat sink with optimized perforated ring was shown {{to be less than}} that of imperforated ring by 17 %, while reducing the mass of ring by up to 37 %.

In the present study, a cylindrical hydrogen storage device with an embedded annular heat exchanger tube with radial circular copper fins, is considered. A 3 -D mathematical model of the storage device is developed to investigate the sorption performance of metal hydride (MH). A prototype of the device is fabricated for 1 kg of MH alloy, LaNi 5, and tested at constant supply pressure of hydrogen, validating the simulation results. Absorption characteristics of storage device have been examined by varying different operating parameters such as hydrogen supply pressure and cooling fluid temperature and velocity. Absorption process is completed in 18 min when these parameters are 15 bar, 298 K and 1 m/s respectively.

50|$|Rotary viscous {{couplings}} with interleaved, perforated {{plates and}} filled with viscous fluids are used in automotive systems to transmit torque. The device consists {{of a number of}} circular plates with tabs or perforations, fitted very close to each other in a sealed drum. Alternate plates are connected to a driving shaft {{at one end of the}} assembly and a driven shaft at the other end. The drum is filled with a dilatant fluid, often silicone-based, to about 80% by volume. When the two sets of plates are rotating in unison, the fluid stays cool and remains liquid. When the plates start rotating at different speeds, the shear effect of the tabs or perforations on the fluid will cause it to heat and become nearly solid because the viscosity of dilatant fluids rapidly increases with shear. The fluid in this state will effectively glue the plates together and transmit power from one set of plates to the other. The size of the tabs or <b>perforations,</b> the <b>number</b> of plates, and the fluid used will determine the strength and onset of this mechanical transfer.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} lower {{body mass index}} (BMI) on {{appendicitis}} has never been addressed. We investigated whether different BMIs affect the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} appendicitis in children. The correlation between BMI and diagnosis accuracy and treatment quality was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 457 children diagnosed with appendicitis. Based on BMI percentiles, patients were classified as either underweight (n = 36), normal weight (n = 346), overweight (n = 59), or obese (n = 16). Diagnosis accuracy was measured by negative appendectomy rate, <b>perforation</b> rate, and <b>number</b> of consultations. Treatment quality was measured by complication rate and length of hospital stay. Underweight patients had the highest negative appendectomy (OR 3. 00, P = 0. 008) and complication (OR 2. 75, P = 0. 041) rate. BMI did not influence <b>perforation</b> rate or <b>number</b> of consultations. Both underweight and obese patients stayed in the hospital longer than normal weight patients (regression coefficient 2. 34, P = 0. 001, and regression coefficient 9. 40, P < 0. 001, respectively). Furthermore, in obese patients, the hospital stay after open appendectomy was prolonged compared to laparoscopic appendectomy (P < 0. 001). No such differences were observed in patients with lower BMI. Underweight children are misdiagnosed more often, stay in hospital longer, and experience more postoperative complications than children of normal weight. Obesity is associated with longer hospital stays. Laparoscopic appendectomy might shorten the length of hospital stays in these patients. We conclude that in addition to obesity, underweight should also be considered a risk factor for children with appendicitis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The best {{policy to}} prevent the {{potential}} hazard of bile and stones spilled at laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is to avoid inadvertent gallbladder (GB) perforations. No study so far has investigated the mechanisms of GB rupture and its predictive risk factors. To address these issues and help define the best strategies to reduce undesirable long-term sequelae, we did a retrospective review of the first 350 consecutive LC performed by a single surgeon at our institution. METHODS: The clinical and surgical records of our first 350 consecutive LC were reviewed. The significant variables identified on univariate analysis were eventually validated through Spearman's correlation for ordered data and finally correlated {{to the risk of}} GB perforation by means of a casewise deletion multiple regression. The equation of the linear regression thus obtained was used to predict the probability of GB <b>perforation</b> by <b>number</b> of risk factors. RESULTS: Three risk factors predictive of GB perforation were identified: chronic cholecystitis with thickened walls > 7 mm on preoperative ultrasound (US), GB hydrops (GB > 8 x 4 x 4 cm on US), and previous laparotomies.

40|$|In recent years, a {{critical}} mass of information has accumulated, which has made it possible to equate platelets to the cells of innate immunity, which ensures the initiation of inflammation and the reactions of innate immunity. In the presented review platelets were examined {{from the point of view}} of antibacterial immune reactions. Mechanisms that allow platelets to recognize bacteria and their soluble products as characteristic of immune cells (via TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 7 and TLR 9, FcγRIIa and receptors for complement components), as well as the mechanisms involved in the hemostasis process (GPIb, GPIIb-IIIa). The consequence of the recognition of bacteria is the activation of platelets, the initiation of hemocoagulation and the innate immune response. The ability of platelets to phagocyte bacteriae and stop their growth due to the pronounced microbicidal potential (thrombocidins or microbicidal proteins of platelets and human β-defensins hBD- 1, - 2 and- 3), which these anucleate cells possess, is shown.

This is especially important for bacterial infections, which monocytes / macrophages or only platelets cannot control, but, combining, they create the necessary conditions for the clearance of pathogenic bacteria from circulation...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{infusion}} is {{now being}} considered as {{a viable alternative to}} more traditional hand lay-up. Main reason in favor of the more costly technique is the cleaner and friendlier work environment. However, vacuum infusion potentially offers another important benefit over hand lay-up in that prepreg levels of resin may be achieved, resulting in stronger and lighter laminates. The present paper compares the two manufacturing techniques {{on the basis of the}} response to repeated impact loading. The laminate is a non-symmetric glass fiber reinforced plastics intended for nautical application. Four impact velocities (1. 5 m/s, 2. 2 m/s, 3. 1 m/s and 3. 8 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). Results point out that for impact velocities for which no perforation occurs within test duration, the experimental data of the two series essentially overlap. On the contrary, for <b>perforation</b> tests, the <b>number</b> of impacts to perforation is smaller for vacuum infusion specimens...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the tissue ablation capacity of the UltraPulseTM Surgitouch TM CO 2 laser at the stapes footplate. Materials and Methods: Isolated human stapes and bovine compact-bone platelets (90 µm thick) were used to determine the effective laser parameters for achieving a perforation measuring approximately 0. 6 mm in diameter. Of particular interest besides the attainable perforation diameters was the shape and quality of the perforation,the reproducibility of the perforation diameter and thermically altered marginal zones. Results:Perforations created by UltraPulse TMSurgiTouchTM CO 2 laser had more pronounced carbonization margins than the cw laser 40 c with the SurgiTouchTM scanner. In this study the obtained data with UltraPulse TM SurgiTouchTM CO 2 laser seem to be worse because the mode of laser application with a scanner diameter of 0. 6 mm (14 juxtapositioned pulses) could not arise smooth edges and perfectly round <b>perforations.</b> The increased <b>number</b> of ultrapulses with 0. 7 mm rotation diameter (24 juxtapositioned pulses) resulted in markedly rounder perforations. However higher repetition rates lead to thermal impact on the non-ablated tissue and to bigger thermal damage. Above all the resulting higher total energy in the UltraPulseTM mode at 1. 7 J (scanner diameter of 0. 6 mm) or 3. 4 J (scanner diameter of 0. 7 mm) significantly exceeds the maximum energy of 1 J which in previous studies of the CO 2 cw laser and the SurgiTouchTM scanner has been determined as effective and safe.

40|$|Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} condition that afflicts children and adults, and causes oesophageal narrowing and fibrosis, with the resultant clinical sequelae of dysphagia and food bolus obstruction events (FBOE), the latter often resulting is hospitalisation, emergency endoscopic removal and rarely but catastrophically oesophageal <b>perforation.</b> An increasing <b>number</b> of patients are {{being diagnosed with}} EoE, and this is independent of a growing awareness of this recently defined condition, but rather represents a true increase {{in the context of}} a global rise (in Western first-world countries) of allergic conditions per se. The mainstays of medical treatment for EoE are indefinite PPI therapy or swallowed topical corticosteroids. These therapeutic assets are highly effective but they do not ultimately target the etiologic cause of EoE. A role for aeroallergens (pollens) and dietary allergens (food) in precipitating or causing EoE has been suggested in a number of studies, albeit limited by their retrospective nature and lack of control group (in the case of aeroallergens), the predominance of paediatric literature and variable use of adjunctive treatment such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (in the case of food allergens). Highly restrictive elimination diets show promise in treating EoE. Unfortunately, the role of allergy tests in directing dietary therapy remains debatable and studies are again of a retrospective nature or utilise a small range of available tests. This means that even if dietary therapy works, that patients are required to undergo many gastroscopies during their treatment course, which is both inconvenient, expensive and has the associated risk of an anaesthetic. Thus, the need both to better understand the role of food and aeroallergens (with more comprehensive prospective studies), and to offer less invasive and thereby safer endoscopic surveillance is readily apparent...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a technique}} frequently used to stimulate the production of an oil or gas well by creating a fracture in the porous rock around the wellbore. The success of a hydraulic fracture treatment depends heavily on the created fracture geometry. The optimum situation arises when a single, smooth-walled fracture propagates into the reservoir. The communication and production will reduce when a fracture is very tortuous, when multiple fractures propagate at small distance from each other, or when the intersection area between the fracture and borehole is small, e. g. when the fracture makes an angle with the borehole. When a cased perforated completion is treated, fractures may initiate from each perforation. These fractures propagate {{close to each other}} and compete for width when they fail to link. The perforations tend to attract fractures initiating from neighbouring perforations, which may link in this way. Linking reduces the number of multiples, and forces the fracture to propagate over the perforated interval along the borehole, increasing the intersection area. This attraction increases with decreasing <b>perforation</b> spacing. The <b>number</b> of <b>perforations</b> that can be created in a single run is limited. The perforation spacing will be minimised when all perforations are shot in a single row. This maximises the probability of link-up but introduces the risk of fracture initiation from the micro annulus. In that case the fracturing fluid will follow a very tortuous flow path to enter the fracture, which frequently results in failure of the fracturing operation. The perforations will therefore often be shot with a small phasing angle, so fractures will initiate at least from some perforations. This is the choice for a safe but sub-optimum solution. These considerations lead to the main questions requiring an answer: What is the critical spacing above which fracture initiation does not take place?; What is the possible gain in fracture geometry when perforations do link-up?; and, What is the risk of fracture initiation from the micro-annulus? One of the results form Van de Ketterij's research is the quantification of the fractures during the first stages of fracture propagation. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The average number of patients admitted with a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease in precimetidine years [...] 1974, 1975, and 1976 [...] {{and in recent years}} [...] 1982, 1983, and 1984 [...] shows a decline of 39. 3 % in admissions. In the same periods, the average number of operations per year has declined from 92 in precimetidine years to an average of 71 (16. 5 %) recently. The decline has been greatest in patients operated on electively for duodenal ulcer. Operations for massive hemorrhage and acute <b>perforations</b> and the <b>number</b> of deaths have remained nearly constant. The overall mortality rate was 10. 3 %. The mortality following elective operations for pain was 0. 5 %; for urgent operations, including those for obstruction, 4. 5 %, and for bleeding other than massive, 7. 5 %; and for emergency operations, including those for acute perforation, 20. 9 %, and for massive hemorrhage, 22. 1 %. The main causes of death were organ failure (most commonly of the lungs) and sepsis. Early complications were documented 345 times and were followed by reoperation in 84 cases, or 7. 4 % of the total. Delayed stomal function was noted in 63 cases and required reoperation in 14. It was most common after Roux anastomoses and required operative intervention most commonly after gastric resection, Billroth I (GRBI). Delay was three times as common when vagotomy (V) was added to GR. Early postoperative hemorrhage was a serious complication when it occurred after operations for acute perforations or massive hemorrhage. The incidence was 3. 7 % after suture of a perforation; after operations for acute massive hemorrhage, it was 4. 3 % after pyloroplasty and vagotomy, with or without arterial ligation [PV(L) ], and 0. 3 % after GR, with or without arterial ligation [GR(L) ]. Late complications led to reoperation in 66 cases (6. 2 %). The most important were recurrent ulceration and alkaline gastritis. Recurrence rates after a minimum follow-up of 5 years (based on survivors of initial procedures and a second operation, both in the MGH) were 20. 5 % after suture of a perforation, 6. 2 % after PV, 2. 3 % after GRBII, and 0. 4 % after GRVBII.

40|$|Currently, every {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} operator’s motivation is aimed toward attaining optimized, low-cost horizontal well completions. The goal is typically to generate uniform, simultaneously-growing hydraulic fractures from 3 - 6 initiation/entry sites that are spacingd within a certain interval of the wellbore comprising a so-called “stage”. Due to the stress interaction among growing hydraulic fractures, however, it is hard to stimulate all hydraulic fractures to grow simultaneously in the array. This phenomenon, referred to as a stress shadow, inhibits the growth of inner fractures and favors the growth of outer fractures in the array. Recently, we created a new hydraulic fracture simulator, C 2 Frac,which very rapidly simulates the growth of an array of hydraulic fractures. The simulation helps reduce the negative effects of stress shadow by determining an optimal perforation spacing. In this model, the fractures created from all perforation clusters were restricted to radial, planar growth. This coupled mathematical model uses the power estimate, asymptotic solutions, and local integration to develop a relationship between the fluid flow entering the well bore and friction pressure drop that approximately accounts for the stress interaction between fractures. Utilizing this relationship, C 2 Frac can determine how the radius, width, pressure, and total fracture area evolve with time and compare them with a fully coupled benchmark model. The solution is found to be sufficiently accurate for practical purposes and C 2 Frac completes the calculation in less than 2 seconds compared with the benchmark model that took approximately 1 week to solve the same problem. Perforation loss, that is, the pressure drop of fluid through the perforation tunnel on the casing, is another important but sometimes neglected effect on fracture growth. So we add the perforation loss into C 2 Frac to simulate how perforation loss influence the total fracture surface area obtained from a growing array of hydraulic fractures that are impacted by the stress shadow effect. Our results show the potential of proper <b>perforation</b> diameter and <b>number</b> to double the fracture surface area generated by a given injected fluid volume though minimizing the negative effect of interaction. This approach is known as “limited entry design”. The investigation concludes with devising limited entry design and optimal spacing for different numbers of entry points. In summary, C 2 Frac is shown to provide useful approximation to the growth of arrays of hydraulic fractures under the influence of stress shadow and limited entry. By using a novel energetic approach to account for the coupling among the hydraulic fractures and through judicious use of asymptotic, approximate solutions, C 2 Frac computes in 10 - 6 - 10 - 5 of the computation time required by the most efficient existing model that fully solves the coupled problem. This enables completion optimization because over a thousand trial cases can be run in a single hour of computation in order to search for the best completion configuration, whereas existing models would require tens of years of processor time to perform the same task...|$|R
40|$|Interactions of free-surface {{waves and}} {{submerged}} perforated structures {{are far less}} understood than the interactions of waves and conventional impermeable structures. This motivates the present research to investigate major hydrodynamic properties of submerged perforated structures, especially horizontally submerged perforated plates. Studies carried out in present thesis are mainly {{in the framework of}} potential flow theory. However, the local detailed viscous caused flow around each single perforation on the plate influences the global wave forces on the plate. The viscous effects of plate perforations are represented by applying a quadratic pressure-loss condition. The effect of perforation on the global wave forces, as well as the resulting amplitude or the Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number characteristic added mass and damping coefficients are examined numerically and experimentally. We show in theory that the amplitude or KC number dependent hydrodynamic coefficients come from the quadratic pressureloss condition. The quadratic pressure-loss condition relates the pressure loss between the two plate sides to the square of relative velocity between the water particle through perforation and the plate. Further, the non-dimensional flow quantities’ dependence on plate perforation ratio and KC number can be combined and expressed with one single parameter, namely the perforation-effect KC number. Numerical works are carried out in both two and three dimensions. In two-dimensional semi-analytical studies, the existence of a horizontally submerged perforated plate is represented by a vortex distribution. The quadratic pressure-loss condition is equivalently linearized on the mean plate position in the frequency domain studies. The wave excitation loads, added mass and damping coefficients when the plate is forced to heave or roll, as well as the far-field wave transmission and reflection coefficients are extensively discussed by varying the incident wave parameters and the plate lengths, submergence, perforation ratios and motion amplitudes. In addition, new experiments are performed in three dimensions to examine the added mass and damping coefficients of heaving perforated plates, as well as the free-surface effects. The same scenarios are numerically studied by a three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM) in the frequency domain. In the BEM, a cylindrical control surface is introduced, which divides the water domain into inner and outer sub-domains. On the control surface, the velocity potential is formulated analytically and is matched with the inner domain BEM. In the inner domain BEM the linear free-surface conditions, as well as the equivalent linearized pressure-loss condition on an arbitrarily shaped plate are taken into account. Further, the satisfaction of the pressure-loss condition requires the iterations of solving boundary integral equations in inner domain for both velocity potential and flow velocities on the plate. Total forces on the plate are obtained after the convergence of BEM. The plate perforation will affect the vortex shedding at the plate edges. The associated cross flow drag forces are empirically calculated by a drag term as in the Morison equation, with a reasonable modification of cross flow velocity in order to take plate perforation into account. The empirical drag forces influence both the added mass and damping coefficients. Linear free-surface effects, KC <b>numbers,</b> <b>perforation</b> ratios, submergence, as well as the sensitivity studies of empirical drag forces are discussed. Reasonable agreement between numerical results and experiments are presented. We emphasize that for the smaller KC numbers, damping effects from plate perforations play an important role. For larger KC numbers, the empirical drag forces, which depend on plate edges and free-surface effects, need to be correctly adjusted. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, a two-dimensional fully nonlinear time-domain numerical wave tank with a submerged plate is formulated without flow separation from the plate edges. Nonlinear effects from free-surface conditions, as well as the quadratic pressureloss condition on the instantaneous plate positions are examined. Numerical results are only successful for submerged solid plate cases. Wave decompositions due to small plate submergence are shown. When the plate is perforated, the quadratic pressure-loss condition is used to update the velocity potential drop between the two plate sides as an evolutionary equation. The numerical difficulties are believed to come from the singularities at the two plate ends for a non-separated flow condition. No converged results are obtained in a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping process and a linear BEM. Possible solutions and extensions of present work for submerged perforated plates are discussed in a time domain perspective. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|R
