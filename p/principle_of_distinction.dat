60|$|Some {{centuries before}} the Christian era, a Jew merchant, largely engaged in {{business}} on the Gold Coast, and reported to have made {{one of the largest}} fortunes of his time (held also in repute for much practical sagacity), left among his ledgers some general maxims concerning wealth, which have been preserved, strangely enough, even to our own days. They were held in considerable respect by the most active traders of the middle ages, especially by the Venetians, who even went so far in their admiration as to place a statue of the old Jew on the angle of one of their principal public buildings. Of late years these writings have fallen into disrepute, being opposed in every particular to the spirit of modern commerce. Nevertheless, I shall reproduce a passage or two from them here, partly because they may interest the reader by their novelty; and chiefly because they will show him that it is possible for a very practical and acquisitive tradesman to hold, through a not unsuccessful career, that <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> between well-gotten and ill-gotten wealth, which, partially insisted on in my last paper, it must be our work more completely to examine in this.|$|E
60|$|A silent anarchy {{is eating}} out our society. I must pause upon the expression; because {{the true nature}} of anarchy is mostly misapprehended. It is not in the least {{necessary}} that anarchy should be violent; nor is it necessary that it should come from below. A government may grow anarchic as much as a people. The more sentimental sort of Tory uses the word anarchy as a mere term of abuse for rebellion; but he misses a most important intellectual distinction. Rebellion may be wrong and disastrous; but even when rebellion is wrong, it is never anarchy. When it is not self-defence, it is usurpation. It aims at setting up a new rule in place of the old rule. And while it cannot be anarchic in essence (because it has an aim), it certainly cannot be anarchic in method; for men must be organised when they fight; and the discipline in a rebel army has {{to be as good as}} the discipline in the royal army. This deep <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> must be clearly kept in mind. Take for the sake of symbolism those two great spiritual stories which, whether we count them myths or mysteries, have so long been the two hinges of all European morals. The Christian who is inclined to sympathise generally with constituted authority will think of rebellion under the image of Satan, the rebel against God. But Satan, though a traitor, was not an anarchist. He claimed the crown of the cosmos; and had he prevailed, would have expected his rebel angels to give up rebelling. On the other hand, the Christian whose sympathies are more generally with just self-defence among the oppressed will think rather of Christ Himself defying the High Priests and scourging the rich traders. But whether or no Christ was (as some say) a Socialist, He most certainly was not an Anarchist. Christ, like Satan, claimed the throne. He set up a new authority against an old authority; but He set it up with positive commandments and a comprehensible scheme. In this light all mediæval people--indeed, all people until a little while ago--would have judged questions involving revolt. John Ball would have offered to pull down the government because it was a bad government, not because it was a government. Richard II. would have blamed Bolingbroke not as a disturber of the peace, but as a usurper. Anarchy, then, in the useful sense of the word, is a thing utterly distinct from any rebellion, right or wrong. It is not necessarily angry; it is not, in its first stages, at least, even necessarily painful. And, as I said before, it is often entirely silent.|$|E

50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> protects {{civilian}} population and civilian {{objects from the}} effects of military operations. It requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times, and under all circumstances, between combatants and military objectives on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other; and only to target the former. It also provides that civilians lose such protection should they take a direct part in hostilities. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> has also been found by the ICRC to be reflected in state practice; it is therefore an established norm of customary international law in both international and non-international armed conflicts.|$|E

40|$|In the future, {{a growing}} number of combat {{operations}} will be carried out by autonomous weapon systems (AWS). At the operational level, AWS would not rely on direct human input. Taking humans out of the loop will raise questions of the compatibility of AWS with the fundamental requirements of international humanitarian law (IHL), such as the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> and proportionality, as well as complicate allocation of responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. This Article addresses the development toward greater autonomy in military technology along three dimensions: legal, ethical, and political concerns. First, it analyzes the potential dehumanizing effect of AWS with respect to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> and proportionality and criminal responsibility. Second, this Article explores, from an ethical perspective, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the deployment of AWS independent of legal considerations. Authors from various fields have weighed in on this debate, but oftentimes without linking their discourse to legal questions. This Article fills this gap by bridging these disparate discourses and suggests that there are important ethical reasons that militate against the use of AWS. Third, this Article argues that the introduction of AWS alters the risk calculus of whether to engage in or prolong an armed conflict. This alteration is likely to make that decision politically more palatable and less risky for the political decision makers...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the law which applies during armed {{conflicts}} to aerial bombardments or missiles launched from warships.

Issues raised by recent bombing campaigns, such as the bombing of electricity grids and television studios, are also discussed. The author concludes that the lessons of previous conflicts must be learned in order to reduce civilian casualties, but that war is destructive and closer adherence to international humanitarian law can not remove civilian casualties altogether...|$|R
5000|$|There {{is concern}} (e.g. Sharkey 2012) about whether LAWs would violate International Humanitarian Law, {{especially}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction,</b> which requires {{the ability to}} discriminate combatants from non-combatants, and the principle of proportionality, which requires that damage to civilians {{is proportional to the}} military aim. This concern is often invoked as a reason to ban [...] "killer robots" [...] altogether - but it is doubtful that this concern can be an argument against LAWs that do not violate International Humanitarian Law.|$|E
50|$|Distinction: Just war conduct {{should be}} governed by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction.</b> The acts of war should be {{directed}} towards enemy combatants, and not towards non-combatants caught in circumstances they did not create. The prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no legitimate military targets, committing acts of terrorism and reprisal against civilians, and attacking neutral targets (e.g., the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor). Moreover, combatants {{are not permitted to}} attack enemy combatants who have surrendered or who have been captured or who are injured and not presenting an immediate lethal threat or who are parachuting from disabled aircraft (except airborne forces) or who are shipwrecked.|$|E
5000|$|As {{stated by}} several sources, {{including}} the UN official and Human Rights Watch report published in August 2009, deliberate and systematic targeting of civilians and civilian objects in southern Israel since 2001 by Palestinian armed groups' rocket attacks violates International Humanitarian Law and amount to war crimes. Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) note that such attacks contravene the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Distinction,</b> as encapsulated by Article 48 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949: [...] "it {{is strictly prohibited}} to direct attacks at civilian objects or civilians not taking a direct part in hostilities". Furthermore, former Canadian justice minister and McGill University law professor, Irwin Cotler, and the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center point out that violation of this prohibition also amounts to a war crime as defined in the Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.|$|E

The two additional protocols adopted in 1977 extend and strengthen civilian protection in international (AP I) and non-international (AP II) armed conflict: for example, by introducing the prohibition of direct attacks against civilians. A [...] "civilian" [...] is defined as [...] "any person not belonging to the armed forces," [...] including non-nationals and refugees. However, it is accepted that operations may cause civilian casualties. Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, wrote in 2006: [...] "International humanitarian law and the Rome statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, {{even when it is}} known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur.

The NGO also contested the IDF figures, saying that it regarded them as a [...] "deliberate manipulative attempt" [...] to distort the reality of the attacks, and to [...] "disguise Israeli illegal actions". The PCHR civilian count included Hamas members killed in what the PCHR assessed were non-combat situations. The PCHR's representative reaffirmed further its own figures, saying that extensive investigation and cross-checking was done in researching the numbers and identities of Palestinians killed; he assured that the fatalities list does not include deaths caused by [...] "internal events" [...] or natural causes, countering allegations from some Israeli security sources. The Israeli International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) compiled a report on their research of the casualties figures published by the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, supplemented by Hamas and Fatah websites and official Palestinian government online sources. The ICT said that many of those listed by PCHR as civilians, including civil policemen, were in fact hailed as militant martyrs by Hamas. The report {{went on to say that}} some of the civilians were Fatah members killed by Hamas and that among the youngsters counted as children by the PCHR, 18 combatants were identified. Based on their examination of age distribution of the casualties listed by PCHR, the ICT estimated that 63% to 75% of the Palestinians killed in Gaza War appear to have been specifically targeted, combat-aged males, and stated that PCHR’s own data refutes the claim that Israel’s attacks were indiscriminate.|$|E
5000|$|Amnesty International {{called on}} both Hezbollah and Israel to end attacks on {{civilian}} areas during the conflict, and criticized attacks against civilian villages and infrastructure by Israel. They also highlighted IDF use of white phosphorus shells in Lebanon. Human Rights Watch accused both parties {{of failing to}} distinguish between civilians and combatants, violating the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction,</b> and committing war crimes. Peter Bouckaert, a senior emergencies researcher for Human Rights Watch, stated that Hezbollah was [...] "directly targeting civilians ... their aim is to kill Israeli civilians" [...] and that Israel had not taken [...] "the necessary precautions to distinguish between civilian and military targets." [...] They criticized Hezbollah's use of unguided Katyusha rockets, and Israel's use of unreliable cluster bombs - both too close to civilians areas - suggesting {{that they may have}} deliberately targeted civilians. UN humanitarian chief Jan Egeland said Israel's response violated international humanitarian law, and criticized Hezbollah for [...] "cowardly blending... among women and children." [...] He also called Israel's use of over 100,000 cluster bombs [...] "immoral". According to Egeland, 90% of such bombs were launched by Israel in the last 3 days of combat, when it was known that a UN resolution was on its way.Israel said that it tried to avoid civilians, and had distributed leaflets calling on civilian residents to evacuate, but that Hezbollah stored weapons in and fired from civilian areas, making those areas legitimate targets, and used civilians as human shields. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch found cases where Hezbollah did fire rockets from, and store weapons in, populated areas and deploy its forces among the civilian population; however, both say that is not conclusive evidence of the intent to use civilians as human shields. HRW stated that [...] "the IDF struck a large number of private homes of civilian Hezbollah members during the war, as well as various civilian Hezbollah-run institutions such as schools, welfare agencies, banks, shops and political offices." [...] Although Israel maintained that the civilian infrastructure was [...] "hijacked" [...] by Hezbollah and used for military purposes, but Amnesty International identified the destruction of entire civilian neighbourhoods and villages by Israeli forces, attacks on bridges with no apparent strategic value, and attacks on infrastructure indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, and questioned whether the [...] "military advantage anticipated from destroying" [...] civilian infrastructure had been [...] "measured against the likely effect on civilians."

40|$|This thesis interrogates the {{applicability}} of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> in modern armed conflicts. The distinction between combatants and civilians and between civilian objects and military objectives has become blurred {{as a result of the}} changes that have taken place in modern armed conflicts. While the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> was tailor made to regulate traditional, conventional armed conflicts, an evolution in the nature, means and methods of warfare has made the application of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> challenging. One of the challenges that arise as a result of the changes that have taken place in modern armed conflicts include the difficulty of distinguishing civilians and civilian objects, which are entitled to protection under international humanitarian law from combatants and military objectives which are legitimate targets. This has compromised the protection that the law seeks to offer during armed conflicts since civilians and civilian objects have become constant targets. Another challenge is that the involvement of civilian persons in armed conflicts has made it difficult to determine the responsibility of these individuals as well as the states that hire them for violations of international law during armed conflicts. Furthermore, the emergence of new methods of warfare has resulted in many objects and facilities that are traditionally regarded as civilian objects becoming military objectives, thus losing their protection under international humanitarian law. This thesis will use the examples of the involvement of private military and security companies in armed conflicts as well as the emergence of drone and cyber warfare to illustrate these challenges. The study will examine the application of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> to the growing practice of outsourcing of military services to Private Military and Security Companies. Firstly, the study will examine the status of PMSC personnel under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction,</b> that is whether they qualify as combatants or civilians. The study will then examine the consequences of PMSC personnel’s participation in armed conflicts. Importantly, the study will explore responsibilities of states that hire private military and security personnel, PMSC companies as well as superiors in charge of PMSC personnel for any violation of international law committed by contractors during armed conflicts. The study will also examine the application of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> to drone and cyber warfare. The study will examine the status of drone and cyber operators under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> as well as {{the applicability}} of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> between civilian objects and military objectives in drone and cyber warfare. The study will discuss some of the problems that arise as result of the introduction of these new methods of warfare, which makes the application of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> to modern armed conflicts challenging. The thesis concludes by arguing that while the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> remains an indispensable concept of international humanitarian law, it needs to be adapted for it to be applicable to modern armed conflicts. Therefore, suggestions shall be made on how the principle can be adapted to ensure that it remains relevant to modern armed conflicts...|$|E

40|$|The intermixing of combatants with civilians while {{engaging}} in hostilities violates {{one of the}} most fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction.</b> This bedrock principle of the law of war requires those involved in conflict to mark themselves so they can be distinguished from those who are not involved in combat. The most common method of compliance is for combatants to wear a uniform. By requiring distinction, both combatants and civilians know who is involved in the combat and who is not. Derogation from the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> is among the most serious issues facing the law of war today. As fighters on the battlefield relax the requirement to mark themselves, erosion of this principle will lead to greater intermixing of combatants with civilians during combat. Increased civilian casualties will inevitably result because of the inability to discern who is targetable and who is not. Unfortunately, the current trend {{in the development of the}} law of war seriously undermines the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>distinction</b> by allowing, or even encouraging, would-be fighters to evade distinguishing themselves. Two recent cases from the International Court of Justice, the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), promote this trend, giving official incentive for nations to use non-uniformed insurgents rather than official militaries who would be expected to comply with the law of armed conflict. These decisions pose a significant danger to the law of war in the age of asymmetrical lawfare.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the consequences of these cyber operations that cause major disruption or interruption effects, and to argue that they might still constitute “acts of violence,” as the term “attacks” is defined under international humanitarian law.
