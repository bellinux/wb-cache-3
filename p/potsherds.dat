5|$|In October 2002, a salvage {{excavation}} {{was conducted}} at the site {{on behalf of the}} Israel Antiquities Authority. Finds include a large building, numerous <b>potsherds</b> from the Late Roman period, a bronze coin from the first or second century CE, remains of an ancient olive press, glass vessels such as a wine goblet and bottles dated to the Late Byzantine and Umayyad periods (seventh and first half of eighth centuries CE) and an underground water reservoir. A few <b>potsherds</b> from the Crusader and Mamluk periods were also found.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The <b>potsherds</b> {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few <b>potsherds</b> from diverse periods were found. The <b>potsherds</b> could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|Pots and vessels {{were also}} recovered. Pots {{were used for}} cooking, while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia. Artifacts found there {{indicates}} the location. These include a cuneiform inscription and hematite, both of which link to Mesopotamia; steatite bowls to Oman; and carnelian beads, a stone weight and a few <b>potsherds</b> to the Indus Civilization.|$|E
5|$|A {{terracotta}} Nandi (the bull {{of the god}} Shiva – {{father of}} Murugan), head of a woman, terracotta lamps, <b>potsherds</b> and a shivalinga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) made of green stone {{are some of the}} important artefacts found at the site. The Nandi is the first one made of terracotta to be found. While most of the items unearthed belong to the Sangam period, artefacts of a later period including a Chola copper coin have also been found.|$|E

5|$|Neolithic people {{experienced}} {{an economy that}} included hunting, gathering, fishing and animal rearing. Paddy husk impressions in some <b>potsherds</b> indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and cereals such as wheat, moong, masoor, and barley. Both cultivated and wild rice was harvested during summer and again during winter. The wild forms of rice are Oryza rifipogon and Oryza perennis, from which Oryza sativa (Asian rice) originated.|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s <b>potsherds</b> dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and <b>potsherds.</b> Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval <b>potsherds</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon <b>potsherds</b> and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E
5|$|Shepton Mallet is {{approximately}} {{halfway between the}} Roman towns of Bath and Ilchester on the Fosse Way, and {{although there are no}} visible remains (apart from the line of the Roman road), there is archaeological evidence for early military and later civilian settlement lasting into the 5th century. Domed pottery kilns, with pottery still in situ, were identified {{on the site of the}} Anglo-Bavarian Brewery in the mid-19th century, suggesting military activity in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Several hoards of Roman coins ranging from the 1st to 4th centuries have been found and more than 300 fibula brooches, <b>potsherds</b> and other artefacts. A few isolated burials near the route of the Fosse Way were found during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} <b>potsherds</b> of Arikamedu site {{displayed}} in the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
5|$|Arikamedu, {{the ancient}} {{port city of}} the Cholas, and Urayur and Puhar, their early capitals, have yielded several fragmentary pottery inscriptions, all dated to the Sangam age. Kodumanal, a major {{industrial}} center known for the manufacture of gems during this period, had remains of pottery with inscriptions in Tamil, Prakrit and Sinhala-Prakrit. Alagankulam, a thriving sea port of the early Pandyas, has yielded pottery inscriptions that mention several personal names including {{the name of a}} Chera prince. One of the pottery sherds contained the depiction of a large Roman ship. Many other ancient sites such as Kanchipuram, Karur, Korkai and Puhar have all yielded pottery with inscriptions on them. Outside of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found in Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, Jaffna in modern Sri Lanka, ancient Roman ports of Qusier al-Qadim and Berenike in Egypt. The 2nd century BCE <b>potsherds</b> found in excavations in Poonagari, Jaffna, bear Tamil inscriptions of a clan name – vēḷāṉ, related to velirs of the ancient Tamil country. The inscriptions at Berenike refer to a Tamil chieftain Korran.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as <b>potsherds.</b> It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E

5|$|Jeita I (sometimes {{referred}} to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep {{to the east of}} the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive <b>potsherds,</b> burned bones and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.|$|E
5|$|More Neanderthal remains {{have been}} found {{elsewhere}} on the Rock at Devil's Tower and in Ibex, Vanguard and Gorham's Caves {{on the east side}} of Gibraltar. Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000–24,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by Homo sapiens after the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Stone tools, ancient hearths and animal bones dating from around 40,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago {{have been found}} in deposits left in Gorham's Cave. Numerous <b>potsherds</b> dating from the Neolithic period have been found in Gibraltar's caves, mostly of types typical of the Almerian culture found elsewhere in Andalusia, especially around the town of Almería, from which it takes its name. There is little evidence of habitation in the Bronze Age, when people had largely abandoned the tradition of living in caves.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were present}} in lower Florida 10,000years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was {{comparatively}} empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just {{to the west of}} the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded <b>potsherds,</b> worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.|$|E
