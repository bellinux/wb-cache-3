50|$|Organocatalysis is a {{subfield}} of catalysis that {{explores the}} potential of organic small molecules as catalysts, particularly for the enantioselective creation of chiral molecules. One strategy in this subfield {{is the use of}} chiral secondary amines to activate carbonyl compounds. In this case, amine condensation with the carbonyl compound generates a nucleophilic enamine. The chiral amine is designed so that one face of the enamine is sterically shielded and so that only the unshielded face is free to react. Despite the power of this approach to catalyze the enantioselective functionalization of carbonyl compounds, certain valuable transformations, such as the catalytic enantioselective α-alkylation of aldehydes, remained elusive. The combination of organocatalysis and photoredox methods provides a catalytic solution to this problem. In this approach for the α-alkylation of aldehydes, Ru(bipy)32+ reductively fragments an activated alkyl halide, such as bromomalonate or phenacyl bromide, which can then add to catalytically-generated enamine in an enantioselective manner. The oxidized photocatalyst then oxidatively quenches the resulting α-amino radical to form an iminium ion, which hydrolyzes to give the functionalized carbonyl compound. This photoredox transformation was shown to be mechanistically distinct from another organocatalytic radical process termed singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) catalysis. SOMO catalysis employs superstoichiometric ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) to oxidize the catalytically-generated enamine to the corresponding radical cation, which can then add to a suitable coupling partner such as allyl silane. This type of mechanism is excluded for the photocatalytic alkylation reaction because whereas enamine radical cation was observed to cyclize onto pendant olefins and open cyclopropane radical clocks in SOMO catalysis, these structures were unreactive in the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

In acetonitrile, 2 -HEAQ underwent efficient intersystem crossing to the triplet excited state ((2 -HEAQ) (3)). A typical photoreduction reaction for aromatic ketones took place via {{production of a}} ketyl radical intermediate for 2 -HEAQ in isopropanol. In water-containing solutions with pH values between 2 and 10, an unusual <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> reported by Wan and co-workers was detected and characterized. Observation of the protonated species in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions by fs-TA spectra indicated the carbonyl oxygen of (2 -HEAQ) (3) was protonated initially and acted as a precursor of the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction.</b> The preference of the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> to occur under moderate acidic conditions compared to neutral condition observed using ns-TR(3) spectroscopy was consistent with results from DFT calculations, which suggested protonation of the carbonyl group was the rate-determining step. Under stronger acidic conditions (pH 0), although the protonated (2 -HEAQ) (3) was formed, the predominant reaction was the photohydration reaction instead of the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction.</b> In stronger basic solutions (pH 12), (2 -HEAQ) (3) decayed with no obvious photochemical reactions detected by time-resolved spectroscopic experiments.

A particular focus of this work was to study the unusual meta methyl activation reactions of these compounds in water-containing solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to help make assignments of the observed experimental transient species and {{to better understand the}} reaction mechanisms. First, the photophysical and photochemical reactions of m-BPOH were investigated in selected solvents. In acetonitrile (MeCN) the formation of the triplet state of m-BPOH, (denoted as (m-BPOH) 3), was detected via an intersystem crossing (ISC). In 2 -propanol (IPA), (m-BPOH) 3 abstracted a hydrogen atom from the solvent molecule to form an aryl ketyl radical. In an acidic mixed aqueous solution at pH 2, the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> appeared to be the predominant reaction. In a more acidic aqueous solution with [H+] = 1. 0 M, the <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> faced some competition from the overall photohydration reaction. Second, the photophysical and photochemical reactions of 2 -HEAQ in MeCN, IPA, and neutral, acid and basic aqueous solutions were studied. The ISC process of 2 -HEAQ took place in MeCN with generation of the triplet excited state species of 2 -HEAQ, (2 -HEAQ) 3. In IPA solvent, (2 -HEAQ) 3 underwent a hydrogen abstraction with the solvent. A <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> takes place via an initial protonation process of the AQ group that is followed by deprotonation of the methylene C-H bond in aqueous solutions within a pH range from 2 to 10. Under a stronger acidic aqueous condition with [H+] = 1. 0 M, the photohydration reaction becomes the major reaction. In strong basic solutions (pH= 12) only ISC was observed to take place. The unusual <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> takes place via protonation of the carbonyl oxygen first followed by deprotonation of the C-H bond in the side chain for both m-BPOH and 2 -HEAQ. The protonation of the excited carbonyl oxygen group has been widely studied. On the other hand, the deprotonation of methylene C-H bond is unusual. Therefore, this <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> for m-BPOH and 2 -HEAQ is termed as a meta methyl activation reaction. Third, the photophysical and photochemical reactions of 3 -MeBP were explored and compared to those of 4 -methylbenzophenone (4 -MeBP). This work found that 3 -MeBP and 4 -MeBP exhibit similar behaviors with m-BPOH and 2 -HEAQ in MeCN and IPA. In MeCN, both 3 -MeBP and 4 -MeBP undergo an efficient ISC process producing triplet excited state species, (3 -MeBP) 3 and (4 -MeBP) 3, respectively. In IPA, the (3 -MeBP) 3 and (4 -MeBP) 3 intermediates were quenched by the hydrogen abstraction reaction with the solvent. In acidic aqueous solutions (pH  2), the protonated carbonyl oxygen species (3 -MeBPH+) 3 and (4 -(MeBPH+) 3 are directly observed by fs-TA spectra. In the case of 4 -MeBP, a photohydration is detected and the m-(4 -MeBPH 2 O) 3 and o-(4 -MeBPH 2 O) 1 species are observed. In contrast, an unusual meta methyl activation reaction is observed for 3 -MeBP. In a stronger acid aqueous solution ([H+] = 1. 0 M) the meta methyl activation reaction becomes the predominant reaction. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Deviating from the chloride ion, acetate coordinating to the metal center hinders the formation of bisporphyrin complex. In these lanthanum(III) complexes, the metal center, due to its large ionic radius (103. 2 pm), is located out of the ligand plane, distorting it. Accordingly, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of these coordination compounds display special properties characteristic of the so-called sitting-atop (SAT) or out-of-plane (OOP) porphyrin complexes. Metalation significantly decreases the quantum yield of the fluorescence from the S 1 excited state. Quantum chemical calculations (DFT) confirm the considerable OOP displacement of the La(III) center (about 120 pm in the monoporphyrin complexes). The monoporphyrins display efficient fluorescence ( 0. 03), while the bisporphyrin does not emit. Differing from the normal (in-plane) metalloporphyrins, excitation of these lanthanum(III) porphyrins leads to an irreversible ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) followed by the opening of the porphyrin ring, which is also typical of OOP complexes.

The same tetramer, with non-methylated bipyridium units, is able to form a supramolecular architecture upon complexation with four ruthenium porphyrins: the resulting multichromophoric system features a shape-persistent arrangement of the chromophores. During my PhD, I spent four months at the ETH, in Zurich, working in the group of Prof. Schlüter. Throughout my stay, I worked on the design, synthesis and characterization of a 2 D polymer obtained at the air-water interface with Langmuir-Blodgett technique.

Instead, carboxylic acid photoredox reactions resulted in carbon-carbon bond forming processes. High yields of radical homodimers were obtained from TiO₂ treatment of carboxylic acids alone. “Benzyl-type” radicals in particular performed very well in this system. Attempts at carrying out hetero-dimerisations were unsuccessful as {{it is thought that}} the differing rates of formation of radicals at the titania surface precludes the formation of cross-coupled products. A straightforward reaction mechanism involving hole- capture by the carboxylate at the catalyst surface has been put forward and is supported by literature precedent. Intramolecular dimerisations of di-carboxylic acids have been applied to the preparation of macrocycles but with disappointing yields being recorded. Photoredox reactions employing TiO₂ and carboxylic acids, under dry {{anaerobic conditions}}, led to several types of C-C bond forming processes with electron deficient alkenes. The efficiency of alkylation varied appreciably with substituents in the carboxylic acids. The reactions of aryloxyacetic acids with maleimides resulted in a cascade process in which a pyrrolo-chromene derivative accompanied the alkylated succinimide. Selectivity for one or other of these products could be tuned to some extent by employing the photoredox catalyst in different conditions. An array of different catalyst forms was trialed for efficiency and ease of use. The proposed mechanism, involving hole capture at the TiO₂ surface by the carboxylates followed by CO₂ loss, was supported by EPR spectroscopic evidence of the intermediates. Deuterium labelling indicated the titania likely donates protons from surface hydroxyl groups as well as supplying electrons and holes thus acting as both a catalyst and a reaction partner.

In aqueous solution the complexes exist inequilibrium. The distribution between the species can bealtered by varying the molar ratio Pt/Tl, cyanide concentrationand pH. Stability constants of the compounds weredetermined. A new compound (NC) 5 PtTl was also prepared in solid and its crystalstructure solved {{by a combination of}} X-ray powder diffractionand EXAFS. Altogether the values of 195 Pt- 205 Tl spin-spin coupling constants (25 - 71 kHz),interatomic Pt-Tl distances (2. 598 - 2. 638 Å), and vibrationstretching frequencies v (Pt-Tl) (159 - 164 cm- 1) are fully indicative of a direct and unsupportedPt-Tl bond. The calculated values of Pt-Tl force constants(1. 56 - 1. 74 N· cm- 1) are characteristic for single metal-metal bond. The oxidation status in the compounds can be viewed asintermediate between II and IV for platinum, and between I andIII for thallium, as reflected by the chemical shifts of 195 Pt and 205 Tl nuclei, C≡ N stretching frequencies andelectron binding energies. The compounds are capable to undergo a photoinducedtwo-electron transfer between the coupled hetero-metal ions. Upon irradiation into the metal-to-metal charge transferabsorption band, effective <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> takes place. Itresults in scission of the Pt-Tl bond and formation of variouscomplexes of oxidised platinum (Pt(III, IV)) and reducedthallium (Tl(I)). The values of photodecomposition quantumyields were determined from a stationary photolysis study ofthe heterometallic complexes. Nanosecond laser flash photolysisof the heteronuclear Pt-Tl cyano compounds was performed in thetimescale range 1 · 10 - 6 - 5 · 10 - 2 s and several intermediate species were detectedand characterised by optical spectroscopy. The heteronuclear Pt-Tl cyano compounds can be furthermodified in terms of their stability, solubility, and lightabsorption characteristics. It has been found that the platinumpentacyano unit of the [(NC) 5 Pt-Tl(CN) n(aq) ]n-species is inert towards the tested ligands,whereas the thallium "part" of the complexes can be tunedsignificantly. A number of complexes [(NC) 5 Pt-Tl(L) m]x-(L-ligand) were prepared and characterised insolution.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of polar regions {{due to the}} global distribution of anthropogenic pollutants is of great concern because it leads to the bioaccumulation of toxic substances, methylmercury among them, in Arctic food chains. Here we present the first evidence that microbes in the high Arctic possess and express diverse merA genes, which specify the reduction of ionic mercury [Hg(II) ] to the volatile elemental form [Hg(0) ]. The sampled microbial biomass, collected from microbial mats in a coastal lagoon and {{from the surface of}} marine macroalgae, was comprised of bacteria that were most closely related to psychrophiles that had previously been described in polar environments. We used a kinetic redox model, taking into consideration <b>photoredox</b> <b>reactions</b> as well as mer-mediated reduction, to assess if the potential for Hg(II) reduction by Arctic microbes can affect the toxicity and environmental mobility of mercury in the high Arctic. Results suggested that mer-mediated Hg(II) reduction could account for most of the Hg(0) that is produced in high Arctic waters. At the surface, with only 5 % metabolically active cells, up to 68 % of the mercury pool was resolved by the model as biogenic Hg(0). At a greater depth, because of incident light attenuation, the significance of photoredox transformations declined and merA-mediated activity could account for up to 90 % of Hg(0) production. These findings highlight the importance of microbial redox transformations in the biogeochemical cycling, and thus the toxicity and mobility, of mercury in polar regions...|$|R

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D+PAF:CGE:EPUInternational audienceIntroductionThe {{modification}} of TiO 2 with noble-metal cocatalyst {{can enhance the}} overall photocatalytic efficiency by acting like an electron sink to separate the electrons and holes, resulting in increasing the overall <b>photoredox</b> <b>reaction</b> [1]. Therefore, the metal photodeposition is considered for preparing the heterogeneous catalyst. Metal-ions are reduced by photogenerated electrons on the semiconductor. This method can be enhanced by adding aqueous alcohol as sacrificial electron donor. Most of research have {{been focused on the}} net photoefficiency or the effect of physical properties for the photoactivity [2, 3]. However, the metal behavior for H 2 formation on alcohol photooxidation is not well understood. Here, a metal-photodeposition method was proposed to access the effective noble-metal nanoparticles through monitoring the amount of evolved H 2. Metal precursors including Ag, Au, Cu, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru and Rh were applied on TiO 2 anatase to study photocatalytic H 2 generation under UV irradiation with 2 -propanol as sacrificial agent. The generation of carbon products, such as propane and propene was also evaluated to categorize the role of metals. ExperimentalPhotodeposition of metal on TiO 2 anatase was performed on a photoreactor. H 2 Cl 6 Pt. 6 H 2 O, PdCl 2, RhCl 3, IrCl 3, HAuCl 4, Cu(NO 3) 2. 3 H 2 O, and Ni(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O were used as metal precursor of Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Au, Cu and Ni, respectively. 200 mg TiO 2 was dispersed in 50 mL of aqueous 2 -propanol solution (50 vol%) in the reactor and purged with Ar. Addition of metal solution was gradually injected into catalyst suspension. Subsequently, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out by illuminating the suspension with a 125 -W mercury lamp while continuous stirring. Analysis of the H 2 and oxidized products evolution were analyzed by Gas Chromatography with Thermal Conductivity Detector. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with distilled water and then dried at 110 °C overnight under air. Results and DiscussionsEffect of metallic type-TiO 2 on photooxidation of 2 -propanolFig. 1 shows the products, including H 2, propane and propene produced from the photoreaction. Fig. 1 The metallic behavior on photo-oxidation of 2 -propanol for H 2 generationThe results exhibit that Pt/TiO 2 produced the highest amount of H 2 rate following by Pd, Rh and Ir, respectively. Propane was produced only with Pt at about 1. 0 µmol hr- 1. On the other hand, propene was mainly generated over Au, Cu and Ag. However, propane and propene were also observed in other metals with very small quantity. As Norskov principal, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir have a thermal-neutral of H 2 chemisorption energy (ΔEH), resulting in produce high amount of H 2 as shown in Fig. 2. The Classification of metal behavior was demonstrated in Table 1. Propene was produced over Ni with strong M-H bonding and Cu, Ag, Au as unreactive metals with weakness of M-H bonding [4]. Fig. 2 H 2 rate over different metals plotted as a function of ΔEH. Table 1 : Classification of metal behavior on photooxidation of 2 -propanol for H 2 photogeneration Relation between metal workfunction and photocatalytic activity for H 2 productionFig. 3 shows the variation of H 2 production rate {{as a function of the}} workfunction of the metal photodeposited onto three different TiO 2. Fig. 3 : rate of H 2 production as a function of workfunction of metal cocatalyst. Considering minimum and maximum workfunction of the different metals, the trend seems to obey to a threshold function ie below a value, the metals have a low activity and above this value the activity increases rapidly with the increase of the work function. Considering the following reaction mechanism we assume that the electron transfer to metal (step 3) is the limiting step. By using Fermi-Dirac statistics, it was possible to predict that the fraction of photogenerated electrons from TiO 2 to metal nanoparticles is governed by the difference between Fermi level of TiO 2 and workfunction of the metal. This observation has been confirm by UV photoemission spectroscopy allowing to characterize electronic structure at metal/TiO 2 interface. ConclusionsThe H 2 chemisorption energy (ΔEH) has influence in H 2 production and propene hydrogenation reaction. The metals with balancing of ΔEH (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir) reveal high amount of H 2. The photooxidation of 2 -propanol for H 2 evolution over different metallic types can be classified for three proposed mechanism pathway. Propene generation was mainly found in less reactive metals, Au, Cu, Ag. But moreover we demonstrate that the photocatalytic activity of M/TiO 2 is governed by the difference between Fermi level of TiO 2 and metal workfunction. This fundamental can be applied to be effective for metal with low work function such as Ni or Sn, by using semiconductor with sufficient higher Fermi level. Acknowledgements.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the multicatalytic combination of visible light photoredox catalysis and organocatalytic activation modes. Special focus lies {{on the development of}} metal free approaches for C-C bond formations in purely organophotoredox processes. In this regard five manuscripts are presented studying different aspects of organophotoredox chemistry. The principles of multicatalytic visible light photoredox chemistry are summarized in a concept article (chapter 1. 1) introducing the field by covering {{the state of the art}} and discussing challenges and opportunities accompanied. Typically, photoredox catalysts are transition metal polypyridine complexes, mainly based on ruthenium and iridium. The limited future availability of these rare metals, high costs and potential toxicity curtails their attractiveness. The identification of inexpensive and broadly applicable surrogates to standard organometallic photocatalysts is the content of the first two chapters. Herein organic dyes (chapter 1. 2) and inorganic semiconductors (chapter 1. 3) are studied in the context of synergistic <b>photoredox</b> alkylation <b>reactions</b> covering both reductive halogen bond cleavage in synergistic aldehyde alkylations by Eosin Y as well as oxidative amine activation in nitro-Mannich alkylations of amines with inorganic semiconductor CdS. For an efficient photoredox conversion high light intensity as well as light distribution within the reaction mixture is crucial. Due to the exponential decrease of light intensity along the path length through the absorbing media only the outer sphere of a reaction flask enjoys sufficient light intensity limiting the scalability of such processes. A possible approach to overcome this drawback is presented in chapter 1. 4, where the beneficial effects of microflow conditions for <b>photoredox</b> <b>reactions</b> are studied with regard to rate acceleration, the feasibility of challenging batch transformations and scale up processes. In this context it was shown that for instance the reaction time of aza-Henry reactions can significantly be reduced from 20 hours to 40 min if performed under microflow conditions; furthermore, the possibility to convert substrates, that only scarcely or even do not react at all under batch conditions, was demonstrated. By construction of a simple tube reactor from FEP-polymer tubing, a glass beaker and a household fluorescent bulb the scale up of enantioselective α-alkylations of aldehydes was examined resulting in an increase of productivity (mmol/h) of two orders of magnitude. The third major aspect of this dissertation {{deals with the}} development of a new multicatalytic organophotoredox transformation. In chapter 1. 5 the first combination of Lewis acid like organocatalytic carbonyl activation with H-bond donors and metal-free photoredox catalysis is presented in the context of a cooperative diastereoselective cyclization reaction. A series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical bisenone systems as well as other Michael-type acceptor moieties are shown to undergo reductive intramolecular cyclizations triggered by Eosin Y photoredox catalysis. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} synthetic {{method was}} developed for symmetric ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes with the form L 2 Ru(diphen) RuL 2. The scope of the reaction was investigated {{in regards to the}} ligands, bridging ligands, and starting materials. Several ligands were successful in the synthesis, including 2, 2 ’-bipyridine (bpy), 4, 4 ’-dimethyl- 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl (dmb), 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (dpphen), and 3, 4, 7, 8 -tetramethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (tmphen). Ligands that did not react to form symmetric dimeric complexes were 2, 2 ’-bipyrazine, bpz, and 2, 2 ’-bipyrimidine, bpm. Dpp, 2, 3 -bis(2 -pyridyl) -pyrazine, effectively replaced diphen as the bridging ligand to produce (phen) 2 Ru(dpp) Ru(phen) 24 +. However, replacing the [Ru(CO) 2 Cl 2]n with Ru(DMSO) 4 Cl 2 did not prove successful. The newly developed synthesis was also applied to the synthesis of monomeric complexes with the form Ru(phen) L 2 for comparison. The spectroscopic and electrochemical data collected for the dimeric complexes was similar to the data for the monomeric complexes indicating that the dimers are weakly coupled. The photochemistry of the complexes was then studied to confirm that the dimers were weakly coupled. UV-vis tracking of the reaction of (phen) 2 Ru(diphen) Ru(phen) 24 + implied a photosubstitution reaction took place in which a phen ligand was replaced by bromines. Several failed attempts were made to replace the bromines with a ligand that would allow the complex to be analyzed via ESI-MS. The photosubstitution products were never identified. The <b>photoredox</b> <b>reactions</b> for the complexes were investigated as well. The effect of the oxidative quencher Fe 3 + on the excited lifetimes of the complexes was analyzed. The kq values found for Ru(bpy) 32 +, Ru(phen) (bpy) 22 +, and (bpy) 2 Ru(diphen) Ru(bpy) 24 + were all comparable. This supports the classification of the dimeric complexes used in this study as weakly coupled. The back reaction that follows the quenching reaction and the yield of the oxidized ruthenium complexes were studied. The determined kback values for both quenchers, Fe 3 + and Cu 2 +, were in the expected range and similar among both the monomers and dimers. This suggests that the dimeric complexes are weakly coupled...|$|R

Reduction and oxidation reactions {{are some of the most}} common chemical transformations occurring both in nature and chemical laboratories. The vast majority of redox reaction systems utilized by synthetic chemists require stoichiometric quantities of redox reagents and generate a corresponding amount of chemical waste. Furthermore, the utilization of visible light irradiation to promote organic transformations has long been recognized as an attractive means to make synthetic chemistry more sustainable and environmentally benign. This work describes our efforts to merge the fields of visiblelight mediated <b>photoredox</b> <b>reactions</b> of metal complexes with synthetic organic chemistry to enable the synthesis of valuable reactive organic intermediates under mild reaction conditions using substoichiometric quantities of redox catalysts. The majority of the work presented utilizes the single electron reducing abilities of photoredox catalysts to mediate the reductive displacement of activated organohalides to generate carbon-centered free radical intermediates. A variety of transformations, including reductive hydrodehalogenation, heterocycle functionalization, radical cyclizations and intermolecular atom transfer radical addition, were developed. Mechanistic experiments and observations lead to a better understanding of the operative pathway for the reactions studied. In addition to the synthesis of reactive free radical intermediates, photoredox methodology was employed for the net carbon-hydrogen bond oxidation of electron rich benzylic ethers to form oxocarbenium ions. This led to the development a novel protocol for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl ethers to afford the corresponding deprotected alcohols. Observation of the crude reaction mixture showed the sole redox by-product of this transformation was chloroform. As a result, this method is an attractive alternative to the use of other oxidants, as the production of a stoichiometric quantity of persistent by-product is avoided. Finally, the overall efficiency of a number of transformations which are mediated by photoredox catalysis was enhanced by the use of a photochemical flow reactor designed in our laboratories as part of a collaboration with Prof. Timothy Jamison of MIT. The reactor designed was inexpensive and could easily be implemented in any laboratory without specialized equipment. Furthermore, the flow reactor allowed for efficient and convenient scale-up of photochemical transformations, a process that persistently proved difficult using traditional batch reactors...|$|R
