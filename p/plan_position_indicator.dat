5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the <b>Plan</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E

40|$|Several {{remarkable}} convective systems {{associated with}} the Mei-yu frontal rainband were approaching the southern Taiwan area on 9 - 10 June 2006 during Southwesterly Flow Experiment (SoWFEX 2006). These systems brought torrential rainfall over the southwestern plain of Taiwan. The <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> of CWB Chiku Doppler weather radar illustrate that the intense echoes had developed into convective lines with bulge, which are often referred to quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS). The constant altitude <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> of Chiku radar show that there existed a significant weak echo channel in rear of the apex, splitting intense echoes (> 40 dBZ) into two parts. The radial velocity reveals that a cyclonic shear was located on {{the northern part of}} the linear system between 2 to 5 km levels in altitude. One of the QLCS was observed by both Kenting and Chiku Doppler weather radars. Due to the good quality of collecting dataset, it is useful for Dual-Doppler wind synthesis. The synthesized wind fields delineate the existence of peak updraft in 8 m s- 1 and affirm the shearing circulation with maximum vertical vorticity over 3 × 10 - 3 s- 1 within the northern intense echo on the 3 km level. It also demonstrates an anticyclonic circulation embedded within the southern intense echo. The downdraft, which had a maximum of 5 m s- 1, was collocated with the weak echo channel. It suggests that the formation of weak echo channel was related to the existence of the descending air...|$|R

Philo Taylor Farnsworth refined a version of his picture tube (cathode ray tube, or CRT) and called it an [...] "Iatron". It could store an image for milliseconds to minutes (even hours).

2500|$|Alvarez was not {{convinced}} of {{one part of}} the argument – the need for the system to be accurate in elevation. He considered it to be an advantage if the system scanned a wide angle vertically, receiving a signal from a long [...] "strip" [...] of the ground all at once. Since the radar returns from ground closer to the aircraft would be received first, a display being drawn outward from the center, the classic <b>Plan</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indicator,</b> would naturally decode the signal back into a 2D display.|$|E
2500|$|Some clutter {{may also}} {{be caused by a}} long radar {{waveguide}} between the radar transceiver and the antenna. In a typical <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a [...] "sun" [...] or [...] "sunburst" [...] in the centre of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range, since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive interference source, since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.|$|E

50|$|Radar video {{presents}} {{the echoes of}} electromagnetic waves a radar system has emitted and received as reflections afterwards. These echoes are typically presented {{on a computer screen}} with a color-coding scheme depicting the reflection strength.Two problems have to be solved during such a visualization process. The first problem arises from the fact that typically the radar antenna turns around its position and measures the reflection echo distances from its position in one direction. This effectively means that the radar video data are present in polar coordinates. In older systems the polar oriented picture has been displayed in so called <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> (PPI). The PPI-scope uses a radial sweep pivoting about the center of the presentation. This results in a map-like picture of the area covered by the radar beam. A long-persistence screen is used so that the display remains visible until the sweep passes again.|$|R
40|$|In 2007, IRCTR (Delft University of Technology) {{installed}} a new polarimetric X-band LFMCW radar (IDRA) at the meteorological observation site of Cabauw, The Netherlands. It provides <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> (PPI) {{at a fixed}} elevation with a high range resolution of either 3 m or 30 m at a maximum observation range of 1. 5 km and 15 km, respectively. IDRA aims to monitor precipitation events for the long-term analysis of the hydrological cycle. Due to the specifications of IDRA, the spatial and temporal variability of a large range of rainfall intensities (from drizzle to heavy convective rain) can be studied. Even though the usual observation range of IDRA is limited to 15 km, attenuation due to precipitation can {{be large enough to}} seriously affect the measurements. In this contribution we evaluate the application of a combined method to correct for the specific and the differential attenuation, and in the same vein estimate the parameters of the raindrop-size distribution. The estimated attenuations are compared to a phase constraint attenuation correction method. TelecommunicationsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

In the case of very heavy rainfall which arose along Baiu front on the 21 July in 1986, from RRHI we can find a convective echo consists of several echo cells in variouslife stages. This means that the convective echo is from a multi-cell storm. This fact can bealso verified from RHTI (Range Height Time Indicator) ~ which can visually represent thetime series of echo pattern in arbitrary vertical section, by setting the vertical section alongthe storm moving direction.

40|$|Hailstorms {{are by far}} the costliest insured {{natural hazard}} in Australia. Major {{metropolitan}} areas such as Sydney and Brisbane, located in mid-latitude coastal Eastern Australia, are especially vulnerable due to building exposure and geographical location. Results are presented using data from metropolitan Sydney and Brisbane for seven recent severe storms, including the April 1999 Sydney hailstorm. The focus of this study is on comparisons between the radar-derived pattern of hail kinetic energy and damage to residential buildings in the form of insurance claims. CAPPI (Constant Altitude <b>Plan</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indicators)</b> reflectivities were generated from S-band radar at low storm levels (1. 5 km) and the hail kinetic energy was calculated. High reflectivity hail cells (≥ 55 dBZ) were investigated during the time they passed over occupied urban areas causing damage on the ground to insured assets. The preferred area for hail damage was found to be located to the left side and towards the rear left flank with respect to the storm movement. Higher claim costs were identified within storms that produced "follow up cells. " Two damage variables were derived from insurance claims on a 2 × 2 km grid: average cost and spatial average loss ratio. The radar fields were shifted horizontally in order to maximise correlations between the damage on the ground and the radar signal aloft. Correlation coefficients improved on average from 0. 09 before shift to 0. 47 after optimal shift for average cost; corresponding values for spatial average loss ratio improved from 0. 06 to 0. 43. These improvements in correlation are gratifying, especially considering the limitations of the data. Nonetheless, our general conclusion, when looking at all storms, is that hail kinetic energy as calculated in this study cannot by itself provide a robust, consistent and reliable predictor of insured losses. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by a {{real world}} problem, this study {{develops}} a neural network approach {{to identify and}} evaluate the relationship between atmospheric radar reflectivity and ground level rainfall intensity. Rainfall {{is one of the}} most difficult elements of hydrologic cycle to measure and forecast. This is due to the tremendous range of variability it displays over a wide range of scales both in space and time. Weather radar constitutes an attractive possibility for improving the description of rainfall fields as it can provide high resolution images in space and time of the atmospheric reflectivity over large areas. Radars emit short pulses of energy in the radio-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which are focused by the antenna into a narrow beam. From the backscattering energy of the hydrometeors that returns to the transmitter it is possible to obtain estimates of the rainfall field. Radar data are displayed on constant altitude <b>plan</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> (CAPPIs) levels. The empirical Marshall–Palmer (MP) relationship is normally used in operational hydrology to link together the reflectivity factor Z at the lowest CAPPI level and rainfall intensity R at the ground level. The coefficients reflect the dependence of Z from the number and size distribution of meteors present in the volumes scanned by radar beam. The MP relationship needs a careful preprocessing phase to remove known anomalies in the data, which are due to several factors such as, for example, the distribution of water particles, low level precipitation and low level evaporation. In addition, much noise may affect radar data, owing to radar calibration, signal attenuation, and electromagnetic signal propagation path. The preprocessing stage may limit the many applications which require a real time estimation of the rainfall field. Furthermore, the MP relationship exploits the radar image at the lowest CAPPI level, while the importance of incorporating the entire vertical profile of Z to improve the estimates of R has been recognised in several works. These considerations raise the following statistical problem: perform a fast multivariate analysis of the Z-R relationship with a view to making real time predictions and filtering the effect of noise and bias and the presence of outliers in the data. The aim of the neural network analysis performed in this work is to stress the differences between the univariate and the multivariate approach to the Z-R relationship and to compare neural networks with the classical MP relationship, in the univariate analysis, and with other flexible non linear statistical methods, in the multivariate analyisis. Performances are evaluated by means of an empirical study...|$|R
40|$|The present work aims {{to analyze}} the {{correspondence}} between the rainfall radar estimates and the rain gauges measurements collected at different distances from radar. The radar data utilized in this work have been collected by the Polar 55 C weather radar, located in Roma Tor Vergata research area, from 2008 to 2009. The scanning strategy adopted by Polar 55 C prefigured the cyclical repetition of eight sweeps in all directions with constant elevation. Each 5 minutes 8 <b>Plan</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indicators</b> are acquired, each one with a different elevation angle, ranging from 0. 5 to 7. 5 _. This study considers measurements collected at 1. 5 _ elevation. The noise level is determined by supposing that at great distance the sampling volume is likely situated in an atmospheric region above the precipitation. In this way the modal value {{in the last two}} range-bins has been chosen as a reference to determine the noise level at the receiver. The range-bins whose reflectivity doesn’t exceed noise level were considered affected by noise. The modality developed for the ground clutter removal is based on the existence of typical values for the standard deviations of the differential reflectivity and of the differential phase when the radar return is caused by precipitation. In fact in the presence of meteorological echoes at the receiver, these standard deviations can be expressed by the width of the Doppler spectrum and the co-polar correlation coefficient, about which is well-known the variation range characteristic of rainfall. Only the radar reflectivity which corresponds to meteorological signal was converted into rainfall intensity by using a parametric algorithm. Finally, the radar rainfall intensity values were remapped onto a 1 square kilometre Cartesian grid, by assigning to each pixel the mean of the rainfall values estimated in the radar range-bins belonging to the pixel. Rain gauges located at different distances from Polar 55 C were selected so that most of ranges in the scanning circle are covered. Moreover only rain gauges not placed in areas where the radar beam is blocked were considered. The rain gauges data were compared with rainfall radar estimates in the pixels where are located the rain gauges considered. The ratio G/R between rainfall amounts rain gauges measurements and rainfall amounts radar estimates was calculated against the distance from radar, by considering all the events utilized in this work. A trend was found; the greater the distance from the radar, the higher the ratio G/R. Once the trend has been found, a best fitting line was used to find the radar error at a given range and the radar rainfall estimates were consequently corrected...|$|R
