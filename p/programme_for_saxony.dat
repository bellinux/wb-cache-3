5000|$|The more {{intuitive}} abbreviations [...] "DE-NS" [...] <b>for</b> Lower <b>Saxony</b> and [...] "DE-SA" [...] (or [...] "DE-SS") <b>for</b> <b>Saxony</b> or Saxony-Anhalt were avoided on purpose, {{because of}} nazi connotations ("Nationalsozialismus", [...] "Sturmabteilung", [...] "Schutzstaffel"), but [...] "HH", {{which is also}} associated with [...] "Heil Hitler", had already long been used for car license plates in Hamburg.|$|R

50|$|In late 1303 Eckhart {{returned}} to Erfurt, and was made Provincial <b>for</b> <b>Saxony,</b> a province which reached {{at that time}} from the Netherlands to Livonia. He therefore had responsibility for forty-seven convents in this region. Complaints made against him and the provincial of Teutonia at the general chapter held in Paris in 1306, concerning irregularities among the ternaries, must have been trivial, because the general, Aymeric of Piacenza, appointed him {{in the following year}} his vicar-general for Bohemia with full power to set the demoralized monasteries there in order. Eckhart was Provincial <b>for</b> <b>Saxony</b> until 1311, during which time he founded three convents for women there.|$|R
50|$|When Germany {{lost the}} war, the monarchies in Germany collapsed. Georgs father abdicated on 13 November 1918. This marked a {{fundamental}} {{turning point in}} his career planning. In 1919, he decided to renounce his rights on the Saxon throne, and become a Catholic priest instead. This decision was very controversial among people who hoped that the monarchy might one day be restored, and also met with significant concerns {{from the side of}} the Catholic Church. For example, Franz Löbman, the Apostolic Vicar <b>for</b> <b>Saxony</b> and Lusatia, and Archbishop Adolf Bertram of Breslau initially held that Georg should continue to hold political responsibility <b>for</b> <b>Saxony.</b> Nevertheless, Georg entered the Franciscan Order.|$|R

In 1926 he became vice-president of the evangelical-Lutheran regional synod <b>for</b> <b>Saxony.</b> {{a position he}} would retain till 1933. [...] By this time he had already also served as the organisation's chairman, the Regional Church Credit Co-operative <b>for</b> <b>Saxony</b> (LKG) was established in Dresden {{in order to encourage}} self-help among church members in response to the high level of financial distress that had followed the war, the impact of the national reparations bill and the ensuing hyperinflation. Church funds should [...] "once more be used only for genuinely church related purposes". The LKG was the first evangelical-church credit institute in Germany. The institution's objective was not to be maximize profits, but rather to use any revenue surpluses to protect favourable terms for LKG members in the front-line of business activity in the region.|$|R
