40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{effective}} {{technique to}} improve the stop-band frequency response of direct-coupled resonators in substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is introduced. Regular inductive-iris filters in SIW technology are supplemented with H-plane frequency-dependent inverters which not only create transmission zeros but also serve as the proper impedance inverter. A synthesis technique is introduced to prescribe transmission zeros at finite frequen-cies {{on either side of}} the pass band, symmetrically or asymmetrically. Two different topologies of frequency-dependent inverters for X-band SIW band pass filters demonstrate that attenua-tion poles can be created on both side of the passband and significantly improve the filters’ stop-band <b>performences.</b> Measurements confirm the validity of the presented desig...|$|R
