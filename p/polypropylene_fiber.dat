By the dopamine modification, the hydrophobic <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fibers</b> {{have been changed}} into hydrophilic.

The hydrophilic dopamine-modified <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fibers</b> can rapidly and effectively remove copper and lead ions in water. Moreover, the performance of removing heavy metals is prominently improved as the polydopamine amount increases. This is because the polydopamine introduction can supply many available sites for adsorbing heavy metal ions, as revealed by theoretical simulation results.
