5|$|As a {{publicity}} stunt {{for the opening of}} The Simpsons Movie on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was outlined in water-based biodegradable <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> the left of the Cerne Abbas giant. This act displeased local neopagans, who pledged to perform rain magic to wash the figure away.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided {{as to whether it}} was a 17th-century studio work or a van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis of the <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> show that it contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as {{he also did}} in his paintings of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures. The series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> which he was more accustomed.|$|E

5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|Devitt played {{association}} {{football and}} Gaelic football {{when he was}} younger, before deciding to become a professional wrestler. He is a past pupil of St. Cronan's School in Bray. He holds a first degree black belt in IBF submission wrestling. Growing up, Devitt was a fan of World of Sport as well as The British Bulldogs, Shawn Michaels, Rick Rude, Mr. Perfect, Koko B. Ware, and Savio Vega. Devitt is good friends with fellow professional wrestler Dru Onyx. Devitt is an avid collector of Lego and a comic book reader, and has worn face and body <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> the ring inspired by comic book characters. He is a supporter of English football team Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 a rock {{coloured}} red, {{orange and}} yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments {{have been found}} previously at sites such as Skara Brae, {{this was the first}} discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag chevron pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, Bismarck {{received}} {{the order to}} steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters {{and a pair of}} armed merchant vessels, along with an icebreaker. At 08:45 on 8 March, Bismarck briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of dazzle <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an icebreaker, escorted Bismarck through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E

5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E

25|$|Sculptures {{are often}} painted, but {{commonly}} lose their <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> time, or restorers. Many different painting techniques {{have been used}} in making sculpture, including tempera, oil painting, gilding, house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting.|$|E
25|$|More {{modification}} of the technique occurred in the 18th century, perhaps because {{it was no longer}} done only by the indigenous. Feather work was supplemented with the use of oil <b>paint</b> <b>to</b> depict people (especially faces and hands), landscapes and animals and tiny strips of paper were dropped along with the outer borders.|$|E
