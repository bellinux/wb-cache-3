40|$|Closed access. Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the moderating effect of dispositional reinvestment upon ‘choking’ in motor and cognitive tasks. Method: Sixty-three university students (40 males, 23 females) completed low-complexity (<b>peg-board)</b> and high-complexity (golf putting) tests of motor skill, card sorting and working memory (modular arithmetic) under low-pressure and high-pressure conditions. Results: Pressure had a deleterious effect on performance in the <b>peg-board</b> motor task, led to faster but more error-prone performance in the high-complexity card-sorting task, and led to more errors in the highcomplexity modular arithmetic task. High reinvestment scale scores were significantly correlated with performance decrements from low to high-pressure conditions in both the <b>peg-board</b> and golf-putting tasks, and in both modular arithmetic tasks. Conversely, in the card-sorting tasks, higher reinvestment scores were associated with a speeding of performance from the low to high-pressure conditions. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the association between reinvestment and choking extends beyond the motor skill domain to cognitive tasks, particularly those that place significant demands on working memory, and that this relationship is moderated by task complexity. The nature of the relationships between skill failure and sub-scales of the Reinvestment Scale, together with the extent to which these tap into explicit monitoring/conscious processing and distraction-based accounts of choking, is discussed...|$|E

PVC resins and high-impact, UV light-resistant polyethylene make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and {{tend to be more}} stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and powder-coated metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, <b>peg-boards,</b> shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later, if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} ataxia {{rating scales}} in children for reliability {{and the effect}} of age and sex. METHOD: Three independent neuropaediatric observers cross-sectionally scored a set of paediatric ataxia rating scales in a group of 52 healthy children (26 males, 26 females) aged 4 to 16 years (mean age 10 y 5 mo SD 3 y 11 mo). The investigated scales involved the commonly applied International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), and <b>PEG-board</b> tests. We investigated the interrelatedness between individual ataxia scales, the influence of age and sex, inter- and intra-observer agreement, and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Spearman's rank correlations revealed strong correlations between ICARS, SARA BARS, and <b>PEG-board</b> test (all p< 0. 001). ICARS, SARA, BARS and <b>PEG-board</b> test outcomes were age-dependent until 12. 5, 10, 11, and 11. 5 years of age respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) varied between moderate and almost perfect (interobserver agreement: 0. 85, 0. 72, and 0. 69; intraobserver agreement: 0. 92, 0. 94, and 0. 70; and test-retest reliability: 0. 95, 0. 50, and 0. 71; for ICARS, SARA, and BARS respectively). Interobserver variability decreased after the sixth year of life. INTERPRETATION: In healthy children, ataxia rating scales are reliable, but should include age-dependent interpretation in children up to 12 years of age. To enable longitudinal interpretation of quantitative ataxia rating scales in children, European paediatric normative values are necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} for this thesis {{was to examine}} the {{significance}} of binocular vision during the performance of complex manipulation tasks in visually-normal children and adults. The goal of study 1 {{was to examine the}} age-related contribution of binocular vision to the performance of manipulation skills. Healthy children (n= 58, age: 5 - 13 years) and adults (n= 19, age: 17 - 38 years) performed two manipulation tasks: <b>peg-board</b> and bead-threading, under randomized viewing conditions (binocular, right and left-eye monocular). The main outcome measure was movement time to complete the task. Results showed that the contribution of binocular vision differs based on age (i. e., greater in children) and on the task (i. e., greater in the bead-threading task). In study 2, the goal was to examine the significance of binocular vision during the performance of complex manipulation tasks in children with learning difficulties. Thus, the performance of fine motor skills was compared among children with learning difficulties (n= 19, age: 5 - 12 years) and their age-matched peers tested in study 1. Results showed that children with learning difficulties were significantly slower than their peers on the bead-threading task, but performed similarly to their peers on the <b>peg-board</b> task. The aim of study 3 was to characterize the role of binocular vision in the performance of manipulation tasks involving tool use in visually-normal adults. Healthy adults (n= 36, age: 17 - 38 years) performed five manipulation tasks (bead-threading, <b>peg-board</b> with fingers, and with tweezers, precision pointing with a tool, and picking up a target using a hook-tool) during binocular and monocular viewing. Results showed that binocular vision provides critical sensory input when the task involves precise manipulation of small objects, either when using hands directly or when using a tool to pick up the object. This thesis has two main conclusions. First, the importance of binocular vision for the performance of manipulation skills is highly dependent on the task. An important implication of this work is that a binocular visual screening is recommended for persons whose occupation requires manipulation of small object. Second, the ability to perform skilful manipulations improves significantly during development and our results indicate that normal binocular vision {{plays an important role in}} this process. Furthermore, the performance of fine motor skills differentiates between children with and without learning difficulties. Based on these results, including an assessment of fine motor skills in children with abnormal binocular vision and children with learning difficulties is highly recommende...|$|E
40|$|In {{its early}} stages, free vascularized fibular {{grafting}} of the femoral head required two teams of surgeons and an operative time of six hours or more. Today, {{thanks in large}} part to the development of tech-nical shortcuts, customized instrumentation, and an operative sup-port staff familiar with the nuances of the surgery, free vascularized fibular grafting of the femoral head can easily be performed in be-tween two and one-half and three hours, with two surgeons and one scrub nurse. The procedure is performed with the patient under general anes-thesia, with the adjunct of an epidural block, which remains in place for twenty-four to forty-eight hours postoperatively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study hand {{impairments}} {{and their relationship}} with manual ability in children with cerebral palsy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PATIENTS: A total of 101 children with cerebral palsy (mean age 10 years, age range 6 - 15 years) were assessed. METHODS: Three motor and 3 sensory impairments were measured on both hands. Motor impairments included grip strength (Jamar dynamometer), gross manual dexterity(Box and Block Test) and fine finger dexterity (Purdue <b>Peg-board</b> Test). Sensory impairments included tactile pressure detection (Semmes-Weinstein aesthesiometer), stereognosis(Manual Form Perception Test) and proprioception (passive mobilization of the metacarpophalangeal joints). Manual ability was measured with the ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire. The relationship between hand {{impairments and}} manual ability was studied through correlation coefficients and a multiple linear forward stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: Motor impairments were markedly more prevalent than sensory ones. Gross manual dexterity on the dominant hand and grip strength on the non-dominant hand were the best independent predictors of the children's manual ability,predicting 58 % of its variance. CONCLUSION: Hand impairments and manual ability are not related in a predictable straightforward relationship. It is important that, besides hand impairments, manual ability is also measured and treated, as {{it is not simply}} the integration of hand functions in daily activities...|$|E
40|$|Individuals have a {{preferred}} pace {{at which they}} perform voluntary repetitive movements. Previous studies have reported that greater activation of the prefrontal cortex was observed during self-initiated movements than during externally triggered movements. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to compare the activation of the prefrontal cortex induced when the subjects performed a <b>peg-board</b> task at their preferred slow pace (PSP, the self-initiated condition) with that induced when they performed the same task at metronome slow pace (MSP, the externally triggered condition) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Healthy subjects performed the task while sitting in a chair. By assessing the activated channels individually, we confirmed that all of the prefrontal regions of interest were activated by both tasks. In the second-level analyses, we found that the activation detected in the frontopolar cortex (FPPFC; Brodmann area 10) was higher during the PSP task than during the MSP task. The FPPFC is known to be at the top of prefrontal hierarchy, and specifically involved in evaluating self-generated information. In addition, the FPPFC plays a role in coordinating lateral prefrontal cortex. In the present study, the subjects evaluated and managed the internally generated PSP by coordinating the activity of other lower level prefrontal regions...|$|E
40|$|Production Managers and Industrial Engineers {{have relied}} upon {{learning}} (progress) curves for over fifty years. However, until recently only {{the impacts of}} extended breaks on performance time predictions were considered. This study examined the effect of breaks on two typical simulated industrial tasks. Fifty-eight subjects performed either the traditional <b>peg-board,</b> a low cognitive task, or a spreadsheet graphic, a moderately-high cognitive task, for 2 8 iterations. Upon completion of the assigned task, a break period that ranged from 2 to 83 days was randomly assigned to each subject. After the break, subjects replicated their assigned task. Regression {{analysis was used to}} select the best model to predict the per-formance time for the first iteration after a break. An exponential model was selected for the low cognitive task and a multiple linear model for the moderately-high cognitive task. Both models selected were no-intercept models and had multiple correlation coefficients of 0. 729 and 0. 897 respectively. The ability to accurately predict the first iteration time after a break is a key element in calculating time lost to forgetting and determining the forgetting function. These models may be useful in assist-ing production managers and industrial engineers in establishing more realistic progress curves and accurate standard times, thus reducing excessive idle time...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effects of}} {{nitrogen}} gas narcosis on cognitive and psychomotor performance were examined with respect to gender. Six male and six female participants were each tested at surface pressures breathing air, in a hyperbaric chamber simulating either a depth of 60 ft and or a depth of 165 fsw. In a second study participants were tested at a surface pressure of 1 ATmosphere Absolute (ATA) breathing a 30 % normoxic nitrous oxide mixture. In study 1 cognition was evaluated using a simple arithmetic test, a modified Stroop test and a number comparison test. These 3 tests of cognition plus a recognition memory test were employed in study 2. Psychomotor performance was evaluated in both studies using a matrices drawing test and a modified Purdue <b>peg-board</b> test. The results illustrated the effects of nitrogen narcosis were not evident for all cognitive tests employed. In both studies, {{with the exception of}} the recognition memory test, females performed as well or better than males for these cognitive and psychomotor tests. Females at 1 ATA breathing a 30 % normoxic nitrous oxide had significantly lower (p= 0. 001) memory scores than males but this may have been due to a pre-existing difference in the sample. In conclusion, during actual or simulated nitrogen narcosis, the evidence collected supported little effect of gender on cognitive and psychomotor performance during narcosis...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{can often}} recover good motor {{function}} in muscles below an incomplete spinal cord injury. Within {{a few days}} of injury natural processes lead to down-regulation of inhibitory pathways within the motor cortex than can be demonstrated electrophysiologically. We believe that this natural change might encourage motor recovery by allowing an increased excitability of surviving descending corticospinal neurones. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can produce similar changes in corticospinal inhibition in normal uninjured individuals, albeit rather short-lasting. In this preliminary study we have delivered a sham rTMS over one week followed by another week of real treatment to four stable incomplete spinal cord injury patients who already showed reduced inhibition compared with controls. Intracortical inhibition was further reduced during the week of treatment but recovered basal levels within the three-week follow-up period. Longer-term improvements were seen in the clinical scores for both motor and sensory function, perceptual threshold to electrical stimulation of the skin and the time taken to complete a standard <b>peg-board</b> test. Although the measurable electrophysiological effects of rTMS are short-lived it would appear that functional recovery persists for at least three weeks after the treatment. Spinal cord injury patients might be more susceptible to the plastic cortical changes evoked by rTMS than non-injured individuals. This preliminary study provides promising data on which to base a larger investigation with the aim of substantiating the use of rTMS as a tool for routine use in rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that during unimanual motor tasks, aging adults show {{bilateral}} recruitment of primary motor cortex (M 1), while younger adults show a suppression of the ipsilateral motor cortex. Additional work has indicated that increased bilateral M 1 recruitment in older adults may be deleterious when performing some motor tasks. However, higher levels of physical fitness are associated with improved dexterity and fitness may mitigate the loss of both inhibitory and excitatory communication in aging adults. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess dexterity and interhemispheric motor communication in physically fit and sedentary middle-age (40 – 60 years) right handed participants using tests of hand deftness and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To behaviorally assess the influence of interhemispheric communication on motor performance, participants also perform the coin rotation deftness task while maintaining pinch force with the opposite hand (bimanual condition). We correlated these behavioral measures with the ipsilateral silent period using TMS to assess interhemispheric inhibition. Our results show that the middle-aged adults who were physically fit had better dexterity of their right hand (finger tapping and <b>peg-board).</b> When performing the coin rotation task the fit group had no between hand differences, but the sedentary group’s left hand performance was inferior to the their right hand. We found that better dexterity correlated with ipsilateral silent period duration (greater inhibition) thereby supporting the postulate that fitness improves interhemispheric motor communication...|$|E
40|$|Background: Developmental {{testing in}} {{children}} is concerned mainly with a {{pass or fail}} on tasks such as grasping, manipulating and inserting. Knowledge about the qualitative development of hand movements in young children is scarce. Aim: We studied the qualitative development of manipulative hand movements in 14 -, 18 - and 25 -month-olds. Study design and subjects: Twenty-six children were videoed during grasping, manipulating and inserting cubes into a cup or box and pegs into a <b>peg-board.</b> Results: We found clear-cut, object-related results. The right hand was used mainly to grasp, manipulate and insert the pegs, while no hand preference was found for the cube. Generally, the quality of grasping and inserting did not change with age. At 18 months, the performance was more optimal if the children used pegs rather than cubes. The adjustment of hand opening became more adapted with increasing age when grasping the cubes; this was not observed for the pegs. Associated movements occurred less during pegging than while playing with the cubes. A variety of patterns were used for pegging. Besides a difference in band preference between girls and boys, some patterns became more prominent with increasing age. The success rate increased with age but was independent of the pattern used. Conclusion: This study stresses the need of {{a clear understanding of}} the entire spectrum of normal motor development. This knowledge forms the basis on which abnormalities, even of such common movement patterns as grasping, manipulating and inserting, can be reliably diagnosed in neurologically impaired infants and children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{quantify}} the sensory and functional effects resulting from a short-duration (30 min) exposure to hand-arm vibration. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nine subjects went through nine laboratory experiments. For 32 min they grasped a handle vibrating at three different amplitudes (5, 20, and 80 ms- 2) and at three frequencies (31. 5, 125, and 500 Hz). Additionally, a reference experiment was conducted in which the handle did not vibrate. Three sensory tests [vibration perception threshold (VPT), pressure perception threshold (PPT), and distal sensory latency time (DSL) ], two functional tests [Purdue <b>peg-board</b> (PPB) and maximal voluntary force (MVF) ], and a questionnaire concerning the perceived paresthesia and numbness were completed before, during, and after exposure. RESULTS: A 32 -min period of exposure to vibration leads to a temporary threshold shift (TTS) of the VPT and to the development of paresthesia and numbness. The VPT appears to vary with the exposure duration according to a first-order model with a time constant about equal to 3 min. The TTS increases with the vibration acceleration amplitude and is greater for an exposure frequency of 125 Hz than for that of 31. 5 or 500 Hz. It is also greater at the test frequency 125 Hz than at 31. 5 Hz. The other tests do not demonstrate any significant variation. In particular, the PPB test does not demonstrate any loss of dexterity. CONCLUSION: After some 30 min of exposure to vibration the VPTs are increased and paresthesia and numbness develop. However, these do not appear to influence significantly the capacity or performance at work...|$|E
