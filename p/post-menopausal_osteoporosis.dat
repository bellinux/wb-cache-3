All patients attended 2 visits: at baseline and at 6 months. In addition, the subgroup of outpatients attended another visit a month after the baseline to assess the test-retest reliability. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated in terms of feasibility, validity (content validity and construct validity) and internal consistency in baseline, and in terms of test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change in visit at month and visit at 6 months, respectively. In all visits, ECOS- 16, EUROQoL- 5 D (EQ- 5 D) and four 7 -point items about health status (general health status, back pain, limitation in daily activities and emotional status) were administered, whereas only outpatients were given MINI-OQLQ (Mini Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire), besides all clinical variables; and sociodemographic variables at baseline. Results 316 women were consecutively included, 212 from primary care centres and 104 from hospital outpatient clinics. Feasibility : 94. 3 % of patients answered all items of the questionnaire. The mean administration time was 12. 3 minutes. Validity : factor analysis suggested that the questionnaire was unidimensional. In the multivariate analysis, patients with vertebral fractures, co-morbidity and a lower education level showed to have worse HRQoL. Moderate to high correlations were found between the ECOS- 16 score and the other health status questionnaires (0. 47 – 0. 82). Reliability : internal consistency (Cronbach's α) was 0. 92 and test-retest reliability (ICC) was 0. 80. Responsiveness to change : ECOS- 16 scores increased according to change perceived by the patient, as well as the effect size (ranges between 1. 35 to 0. 43), the greater the perception of change in patients' general health status, the greater the changes in patients' scores.

Reciprocally, SIRT 1 whole-body knockout (KO) mice, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast specific KOs, show a low bone mass phenotype; though double knockout mice (containing SIRT 1 deleted in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts) do not show a more severe phenotype.

40|$|Background : from a {{radiological}} {{point of}} view, the periodontium consists of anatomical structures of various densities: the gum andthe periodontal ligament (radiolucent), {{as well as}} cementum and alveolar bone (radiopaque). The panoramic mandibular index (PMI) is a morphometricmethod which uses ortopantomography (OPT) {{in order to determine}} the width of the mandibular cortex. It can also be used to determinethe degree of bone loss. The aim of this study was to research the possible correlations between: PMI and the presence or absence of osteoporosisin post-menopausal women; Bone mineral density (BMD) at levels L 1 -L 4, femoral head, hip, mandible and PMI in post-menopausalwomen, with or without osteoporosis. Materials and methods: the present study included a total of 97 postmenopausal patients. The diagnosisof osteoporosis was made based on the WHO definition. The results were expressed as absolute BMD values in g/cm 2 and as T score form. Weused dual x-ray absortiometry (DXA) measurements in assessing the lumbar column, proximal femur and mandible and we calculated the Tscores.

The {{aim of this study}} was to review the cost effectiveness of treating <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> with bisphosphonates and identify the key factors that influence the cost effectiveness of such treatment in the Swiss setting. A systematic search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) was conducted to identify published literature on the cost effectiveness of bisphosphonates in <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> in the Swiss setting. Outcomes were compared with similar studies in Western European countries. Three cost-effectiveness studies of bisphosphonates in this patient population were identified; all were from a healthcare payer perspective. Outcomes showed that, relative to no treatment, treatment with oral bisphosphonates was predicted to be cost saving for most women aged ≥ 70 years with osteoporosis or at least one risk factor for fracture, and cost effective for women aged ≥ 75 years without prior fracture when used as a component of a population-based screen-and-treat programme. Results were most sensitive to changes in fracture risk, cost of fractures, cost of treatment, nursing home admissions and adherence with treatment. Swiss results were generally comparable to those in other European settings. Assuming similar clinical efficacy, lowering treatment cost (through the use of price-reduced brand-name or generic drugs) and/or improving adherence should both contribute to further improving the cost effectiveness of bisphosphonates in women with <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> Published evidence indicates that bisphosphonates are estimated to be similarly cost effective or cost saving in most treatment scenarios of <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> in Switzerland and in neighbouring European countries...|$|E
40|$|Current drug {{treatments}} for <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> cannot eliminate bone fractures, possibly because the mechanisms responsible for bone loss {{are not fully}} understood. Although research within various disciplines has significantly advanced the state of knowledge, fundamental findings are not widely understood between different disciplines. For that reason, this paper presents noteworthy experimental findings from discrete disciplines focusing on <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> These studies have established that, in addition to bone loss, significant changes in bone micro-architecture, tissue composition and micro-damage occur.

It emerges that, because of the discrete nature of previous research studies, the sequence of events that lead to bone fracture is not fully understood.

40|$|PURPOSE: to {{evaluate}} changes in mammographic breast density in postmenopausal women using raloxifene. METHODS: in this clinical trial, 80 women (mean age= 61. 1 years) were studied prospectively. Forty patients received 60 mg/day raloxifene, and 40 women comprised the non-treated group (control), paired {{by age and}} time of menopause. The treated group was composed of patients with osteoporosis of the lumbar spine. Those with history of breast surgery and users of hormone therapy {{up to six months}} prior to the study were excluded. The breast density was assessed qualitatively (subjective) and quantitatively (objective) in two moments, initial and final, after a 6 -month follow-up. The 320 mammograms (craniocaudal and oblique) were interpreted qualitatively by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification and quantitatively by digital scanning and computer-assisted segmentation. For statistical analysis t-test, Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation and the kappa index were used. RESULTS: on the initial statistical comparison, the groups were considered homogenous for the variables: analyzed age, time of menopause, parity, breast feeding, previous hormonal therapy and body mass index. Baseline breast density, by qualitative and quantitative methods, correlated negatively with the age in both groups (p 0. 05).

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and knee muscle strength, postural balance and functional mobility among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 63 osteoporotic older women (aged 60. 6 ± 3. 1 years). The subjects completed the Timed Up and Go Test to measure functional mobility, and postural balance was assessed on the AccuSway Plus portable force platform. Maximal strength was tested using an isokinetic dynamometer for knee flexion and extension. The subjects were assessed as a group and were divided into quartiles according to their vitamin D levels. Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 02771834.
