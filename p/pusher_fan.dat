In both, the turboprop engine drives a <b>pusher</b> <b>fan.</b> The wings are swept 6° forward to keep {{the center of gravity}} balanced and the four 96-litre capacity fuel cells are integral with the wing structure.|$|E
50|$|Early {{experimentation}} with pull-through systems began by removing sources of high-pressure drop, such as tower dryers. This not only allowed for much higher air volumes, but it eliminated {{the need for}} the <b>push</b> <b>fans,</b> making use of more efficient and more powerful fans on the pull side only.|$|R
5000|$|The export version GT-Four / All-Trac Turbo and GT-S {{retained}} automatic air conditioner, but the <b>push</b> button <b>fan</b> switch {{was replaced}} by the more conventional rotary type.|$|R
25|$|By 5 May 1961, {{the term}} Forces Armées Neutralistes came into use to {{describe}} Kong Le's military. Kong Le recruited enough new soldiers to split BP 2 into six companies.

By October 1961, FAN was {{in conflict with the}} Royalist guerrillas surrounding the Plain; the effect was to <b>push</b> <b>FAN</b> into cooperation with the communists. After a 23 December 1961 battle between FAN and the guerrillas, a FAN defector and a Vietnamese prisoner verified Vietnamese communist backing for FAN.|$|R

5000|$|Iizuka's career {{would make}} a radical change in April 2008. During a tag team match with Hiroyoshi Tenzan against then-IWGP Tag Team Champions, Togi Makabe and Toru Yano, Iizuka turned on Tenzan with his {{trademark}} sleeper hold, turning heel and joining G.B.H. as their newest member and their insider in the New Japan Seikigun. Upon his heel turn, Iizuka changed his look and wrestling style, shaving his head bald, growing a sinister beard, and adapting a hardcore wrestling style. He was also given the gimmick of an uncontrollable madman, often making his entrances through crowds, violently <b>pushing</b> <b>fans</b> and announcers around. He also began frequently using an iron glove on opponents as his main weapon of choice. For a brief period, Iizuka was also given the nickname: [...] "The Great Traitor" [...] for his betrayal of the New Japan Seikigun.|$|R
500|$|Frustration {{became a}} public outcry {{when many of}} Ticketmaster online customers, upon being {{informed}} shows were sold out, were directed to TicketsNow, a Ticketmaster-owned site, where tickets were sold on the secondary market at extremely inflated prices. Ticketmaster even <b>pushed</b> <b>fans</b> to TicketsNow even when there were still tickets available for a given show. [...] Bill Pascrell, the member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey's 8th congressional district, asked the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the relationship between Ticketmaster and TicketsNow, saying, [...] "I am concerned that the business affiliation between Ticketmaster and TicketsNow may represent {{a conflict of interest}} that is detrimental to the average fan. [...] There is a significant potential for abuse when one company is able to monopolize the primary market for a product and also directly manipulate, and profit from, the secondary market." ...|$|R

25|$|President Jimmy Carter {{nominated}} Truesdale to be a Member of the NLRB on September 26, 1977, to {{fill the}} unexpired term of Peter D. Walther (who had resigned). The AFL-CIO was pushing Daniel Pollitt for the seat. Pollitt had been special counsel to Frank McCulloch, chair of the NLRB during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and employer groups (such as the Business Roundtable and United States Chamber of Commerce) were adamantly opposed to him. Walther and NLRB chair John H. Fanning were advocates of Truesdale, however. Employer groups felt Truesdale was somewhat liberal but would help <b>push</b> <b>Fanning</b> to adopt a more moderate course. Carter, not wishing to begin a political fight over {{what was perceived as}} a minor appointment, nominated Truesdale. The United States Senate confirmed him, and he served on the board from October 25, 1977, to August 27, 1980. Truesdale was succeeded as executive secretary by William Lubbers in 1979.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2012, Blythe {{was arrested}} in the Czech Republic and was indicted on {{manslaughter}} charges related to the 2010 death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old fan, after a Lamb of God concert. The Czech court found that Blythe had <b>pushed</b> the <b>fan</b> off the stage and was [...] "morally responsible" [...] for the killing, but held that liability for Nosek's death also lay with promoters and security members, and ultimately acquitted Blythe of the criminal charges specifically.|$|R

50|$|A water {{block is}} better at dissipating heat than an {{air-cooled}} heatsink due to water's higher {{specific heat capacity}} and thermal conductivity. The water is usually pumped through to a radiator which allows a <b>fan</b> <b>pushing</b> air through it to take the heat created from the device and expel it into the air. A radiator is more efficient than a standard CPU or GPU heatsink/air cooler at removing heat {{because it has a}} much larger surface area.|$|R
