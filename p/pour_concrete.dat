5|$|In October 2012, Turner Construction {{was awarded}} the $105 million {{construction}} contract to build and finish Capitol Hill station's interior and entrances. Turner began interior construction in March 2013, using an unusual steel truss support system to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for station elements. Construction on the west entrance and its {{cut and cover tunnel}} under Broadway began in November 2013 and required lane shifts on Broadway throughout 2014. By the summer of 2015, work on Capitol Hill station was declared 90 percent complete, and the construction wall was gradually removed.|$|E

Workers discover a crack about 20cm (8inches) wide in the maintenance pit, which lies between the reactor 2 and the sea, and holds cables used to power seawater pumps. Workers were preparing to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> into the crack to stop the water, which was emitting radiation at 1Sv/h.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, a letting for {{the section}} of NY214 was finally held, but no bids were {{received}} on the project, requiring a second set to begin on June 7. However, Governor Harriman noted {{that the cost of}} the project had gone up to $815,000 instead of the original $700,000 estimated in 1952. The bid was won by Rock Construction Company of Sunset Park on June 25 at the cost of $757,886.60, who noted that official construction began on July 16. By August, trees had been removed and the flooded out would be moved away from the creek to avoid future issues. By early September, the company noted that they were about to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for one of the new bridges and that construction was progressing at a steady rate.|$|E

2500|$|Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd. was the {{contractor}} for the project, with A. T. Seymour as project manager. [...] Virgil Earp and L. G. Shaw, Byrne's project superintendents, designed forms with a cycloid shape {{that were made}} from hinged plywood and lined with an oily coating {{so they could be}} reused to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for multiple sections of the vaults, helping to ensure consistency. [...] The long, straight channels at the bottoms of the shells were cast first so they could be used as platforms to support the workmen pouring concrete for the cycloid curves. [...] After all the concrete had been poured and strengthened with internal post-tensioning cables, however, the curved parts of the shells carried the weight of their lower straight edges instead of the other way around.|$|E

5000|$|As Castellano {{became more}} {{powerful}} in the Gambino family, he started to make {{large amounts of money}} from construction concrete. Castellano's son Philip was the president of Scara-Mix Concrete Corporation, which exercised a near monopoly on Staten Island on construction concrete. Castellano also handled the Gambino interests in the [...] "Concrete Club," [...] a consortium of mob families that divided revenue from New York developers. No one could <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for a project worth more than $2 million without the approval from the Concrete Club. Finally, Castellano supervised Gambino control of Teamsters Union Local Chapter 282, which provided workers to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> at all major building projects in New York and Long Island.|$|E
50|$|ICF decking is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular addition to general ICF wall construction. ICF decking weighs up to 40% less than standard concrete flooring and provides superior insulation. ICF decking can also be designed in conjunction with ICF walls to form a continuous monolithic structure joined together by rebar. ICF deck roofs are less common, as {{it is difficult to}} <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> on an angled surface.|$|E

In August 1971, Bethel Community Heights, an 84-unit low-rent housing project for blacks and whites of low and middle income, was established on 15th St. South under Davis’s leadership, a decision that he described as “a decision of serious proportions” and one that he made after he dreamed of standing over a hole and seeing {{a man with a}} wheelbarrow <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> into it before he jumped into it.|$|E

50|$|Concrete is a fluid {{that offers}} the {{opportunity}} to economically create structures of almost any geometry - we can <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> into a mould of almost any shape. This fluidity is seldom utilise, with concrete instead being poured into rigid moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. The ubiquitous use of orthogonal moulds as concrete formwork {{has resulted in a}} well-established vocabulary of prismatic forms for concrete structures, yet such rigid formwork systems must resist considerable pressures and consume significant amounts of material. Moreover, the resulting member requires more material and has a greater self-weight than one cast with a variable cross section.|$|E
50|$|Construction tubes: Dobson {{replaced}} the traditional aluminum or fiberglass telescope tube with the thick compressed paper tubes used in construction to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> columns. Sonotubes, the leading brand employed by Dobson, are {{less expensive than}} commercially available telescope tubes and are available in comparatively large sizes. Dobsonian scopes are intended to be transported out to dark sky locations, and Sonotubes are claimed to be more rugged than aluminum or fiberglass tubes which can dent or shatter from impacts. Sonotubes have the added advantage of being thermally stable and non-conductive which minimizes unwanted convection currents in the light path caused by handling of the tube assembly.|$|E

Meanwhile, Chuck reluctantly lets Howard into the house. Howard says the bar hearing was a success and tries to dissuade Chuck from further {{pursuing}} Jimmy, saying Jimmy is not worth any more of his time or effort. Chuck seemingly agrees and toasts with Howard to new beginnings. After Howard leaves, Chuck removes the battery from his tape recorder and clutches it.|$|E
50|$|Compared to sealed roads, {{which require}} large {{machinery}} {{to work and}} <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> or to lay and smooth a bitumen-based surface, gravel roads are easy and cheap to build. However, compared to dirt roads, all-weather gravel highways are quite expensive to build, as they require front loaders, dump trucks, graders, and roadrollers to provide a base course of compacted earth or other material, sometimes macadamised, covered {{with one or more}} different layers of gravel. Graders are also used to produce a more extreme camber compared to a paved road to aid drainage, as well as to construct drainage ditches and embankments in low-lying areas. Cellular confinement systems can be used to prevent the washboarding effect.|$|E
50|$|Constructing {{the units}} in two stages {{balanced}} affordability and quality. The new Polish immigrants, {{as soon as}} they could afford to do so, would purchase a small one-story or story-and-a-half cottage, or sometimes build one on a vacant lot with minimum cost, with modest Victorian Gothic or Queen Anne façade. When they saved again, they would then raise the frame up on jacks creating a partially sunken basement, excavate the area underneath, <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> floor, build foundation walls with masonry (usually concrete blocks), then set the old frame back down over the new apartment. While highly unorthodox, it was an ingenious technique of building new accommodations without disrupting family life, in line with their growing wealth.|$|E

According to the Braves {{vice president of business}} operations Mike Plant, phase one of construction for both the stadium and mixed-use development began in November 2014 and included infrastructure for the site, such as sewer, water and electrical systems. The retention walls for the underground service level of the stadium were also built. The underground level will have a few hundred parking spaces for players, team doctors, clubhouse staff and management staff. By May 2015, crews had installed all the caissons to stabilize the foundation. With the caissons complete the crews are beginning to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for the decks.|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{construction}} is prevalent among {{the homes and}} buildings in Scales Mound. Adam Rittweger constructed numerous distinctive concrete porches, garages, and foundations between 1908 and his death in 1933. There are several surviving examples of <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> constructed buildings in Scales Mound including the 1923 one story electrical generating plant, and Lewis Richard's 1911 restaurant. There is one surviving example in Scales Mound of a stucco clad and <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> construction combination, Louis Durrstein's implement dealership. It is presumed that Rittweger also introduced stucco finishes to Scales Mound between the late 1900s and early 1910s.|$|R
