5|$|Bolt's <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> of 9.58 {{seconds in}} the 100 metres is the fastest ever run. Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds, the current Olympic record, and set two {{previous}} world records in the event. Bolt's <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> of 19.19 s in the 200 metres is the world record. This was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin against a headwind of −0.3m/s. This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 {{athletics}} season saw Gay {{rise to the}} top of {{the rankings}} for the first time and become a genuine contender in the 100m. He became the 2006 US Outdoor Champion in unfortunate circumstances: Gay originally finished second in 10.07s with a strong headwind, but Justin Gatlin's first-place finish was later rescinded for use of a banned substance. Gay significantly improved upon his previous 200m <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> by over two-tenths of a second at the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne. However, his time of 19.70s was not enough to beat newcomer Xavier Carter who ran the second fastest time ever with 19.63s. Improvements in the 100m followed, as he won the Rethymno track meet and set another <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> with 9.88s. Gay scored another sub-10 second 100m at the Stockholm Grand Prix, finishing second to Asafa Powell with a 9.97s, and beating Michael Johnson's British all-comers 200m record with a 19.84s win in London. Gay continued to improve at the 100m, revising his <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> to 9.84s at the Zürich Golden League meet, but it was not enough to beat Powell, who equaled his own world record of 9.77s.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's rise {{continued}} {{when the}} Australians arrived in Kuala Lumpur during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe's first event was the 200m freestyle, where he led throughout {{to record a}} time just one hundredth of a second outside Giorgio Lamberti's world record. He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and Matt Dunn in the 4×200m freestyle relay to break the world record of the Unified Team set in 1992 by 0.09s. Thorpe's run ended when a <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> of 50.21s in the 100m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4×100m freestyle relay team. He claimed a fourth gold in the 400m freestyle, setting another <b>personal</b> <b>best,</b> just 0.55s slower than Kieren Perkins' 1994 mark.|$|E

5|$|In Gay's {{final year}} as an amateur athlete he started well, setting a <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> and school record of 6.55s in the 60m at the 2005 Championship Series. He helped the {{university}} team to another NCAA outdoor victory, setting a new <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> of 19.93s in the 200m qualifiers and placing third in the finals. Training partner and friend Wallace Spearmon took first place with 19.91s—his time and Gay's 19.93s were the second and third-fastest 200m times {{in the world that}} year. The pair teamed up for the 4 x 100m relay, along with Michael Grant and Omar Brown, and won with an Arkansas-record-breaking time of 38.49s. With the NCAA Championships behind him, in June 2005 Gay decided to become a professional athlete, setting his sights on a place in the US 200m team for the Helsinki World Championships.|$|E

5|$|Next year he {{finished}} eleventh at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, {{his first major}} international final. His performance and throw of 77.75metres was slightly disappointing as he had thrown 79.44metres in the qualifying round, having travelled to Paris with a <b>personal</b> <b>best</b> of 85.72 metres, established in June in Ventspils. On the lighter side he took his second national title, consolidating his spot as Norway's leading javelin thrower.|$|E
