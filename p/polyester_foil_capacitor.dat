40|$|In {{this work}} {{photonic}} energy {{from a high}} power xenon flash lamp is used for soldering thin chips on polyimide and <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> substrates using standard Sn-Ag-Cu lead free alloys. The absorption of the xenon light pulse leads to rapid heating of components and tracks up to temperatures above the solder melting temperature, while {{the temperature in the}} organic foil substrates remains low. Due to its high transparency the temperature in the delicate <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> remains low enough to avoid damage and allows fast soldering with standard lead-free alloys. The technology is fast and could be applied in-line in roll-to-roll fabrication of flexible electronics. In situ temperature measurements were performed and compared to finite element model predictions of the temperature in the chip during and after application of the photonic pulse. The accuracy of the model is within 10 °C for the tested samples, which allows it to be used in developing photonic flash soldering compatible circuit designs.

Simple method (i. e. polymerization of anilinium sulfate in the presence of MMT) has been used for the preparation and following four conditions were varied: preparation temperature (T = 10 or 20 °C), preparation time (t = 4 or 6 h), size fraction of MMT (p < 1 or 5 µm), and type of substrate (microscope glass slides, silica glass slides, <b>polyester</b> <b>foils).</b> Therefore, 24 samples were prepared, characterized and their electrical conductivity was compared. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used for the characterization of the structure of samples. Thickness of layers was measured using atomic force microscopy. Based on the comparison of samples and with respect to the aim of obtaining high electrical conductivity, {{it was found that the}} most suitable substrate is <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> and preparation conditions are T = 20 °C, t = 6 h, p < 5 µm.

Reissues of vintage instruments often use reproductions of vintage paper capacitors, which are also popular aftermarket replacements. Finally, audiophile-grade polypropylene film and <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> are sometimes used in custom instruments, although their size can prove problematic as they're designed for use in audio amplifiers and consequently have working voltages in excess of 500 V, far higher than anything encountered inside an electric guitar.|$|R
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|R

25|$|However, metal <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> do {{not have}} {{self-healing}} properties. A breakdown in the dielectric film of a film/foil capacitor leads to an irreversible short circuit. To avoid breakdowns caused by weak spots in the dielectric, the insulating film chosen is always thicker than theoretically required by the specific breakdown voltage of the material. Films of less than 4µm generally are not used for film/foil capacitors because of their excessively high numbers of point defects. Also. the metallic foils only can be produced down to about 25µm in thickness. These tradeoffs make the film/foil capacitor the most robust but also the most expensive method for increasing surge current handling.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{seeks to}} put forward an {{approach}} to enhance the voltage generated by an acoustic based piezoelectric energy harvester. When a flexible triangular foil is attached perpendicular to the PVDF cantilever beam there {{is an increase in}} strain in the beam, also there is an increment in the acoustic pressure amplification rate of the Helmholtz resonator due to the dimensional modification of its neck. The integrated effects of these modifications of the harvester on the output voltage have been investigated. When sound incident {{on the surface of the}} neck of the resonator, an oscillatory pressure is produced in the cavity, which in turns vibrates the PVDF cantilever beam and voltage generates. By amending the structure of the PVDF cantilever with a <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> attached perpendicular to it, the cantilever is driven into concurrent bending and twisting by the cavity pressure and therefore makes a noteworthy increase in the output voltag...|$|R

Early capacitors were two pieces of metal foil wrapped between wax paper or any other type of suitable insulation material. The type of insulating material determined the capacitor's storage capacity (measured in Farads) and the voltage tolerated.

25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and <b>foil</b> <b>capacitors</b> were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|R

The utility and performance of the method proposed were tested by examination of five different paints sprayed on plastic (<b>polyester)</b> <b>foil</b> and on fabric materials (cotton).

The approach allows the physical separation of a paint from a base to be avoided, hence a time and work-load of analysis to be considerably reduced. The results obtained prove that the method can be considered as a useful tool which can be applied to forensic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-thin chips of {{less than}} 20 µm become flexible, {{allowing}} integration of silicon IC technology with highly flexible electronics. This combination allows for highly intelligent products of unprecedented thinness, flexibility and cost. Examples include sensor systems integrated into food packaging or healthcare and sport monitoring tags as wearable patches or even directly in clothing textile. During use the ultra-thin chips in these products can be bent to a very high curvature, which puts a large strain on the chips. In this paper the strength of ultra-thin chips at very high curvatures is evaluated, using a modified four-point bending method. Stand-alone ultra-thin chips are evaluated which achieve a minimum bending radius below 1 mm, as well as assemblies containing integrated ultra-thin chips. The effect of chip thickness, bending direction and backside finish on strength and minimum bending radius is investigated using the developed method. The difference between blank ultra-thin silicon dies and daisy chain ultra-thin chips with bond pads and bumps is highlighted. Finally the high curvature behaviour is investigated of ultra-thin chips that were integrated on low-cost <b>polyester</b> <b>foil</b> substrates using several different low-temperature integration techniques. The excellent suitability of these ultra-thin chips on low-cost foil assemblies for highly flexible large area devices is shown...|$|R

For those people it is extremely important to wear well-fitting shoes to avoid additional stress to their feet, and successive ulcers and amputation. The piezoelectric sensor presented here could be worn constantly and help to monitor changes in the patients feet and to adapt their footwear. We have produced a flexible piezoelectric sensor, completely based on polymers. The piezoactive material is poly[(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene] [P(VDF-TrFE) ].
