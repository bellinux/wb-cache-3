5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. <b>Procedures</b> <b>were</b> often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Despite making {{landfall}} on the Yucatán Peninsula on August27 as a Category2hurricane, {{no damage}} was reported there. As the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico towards the Texas Gulf Coast, evacuation <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> conducted across the region. In the storm-warning area of Galveston, Texas, roughly 50,000people evacuated inland; {{the high number}} of evacuees was likely due in part to another hurricane which struck the coast a week prior. Camp Hulen, located near Palacios, Texas, was also evacuated. Other coastal locations were evacuated via trucks, buses, and trains with the guidance of warnings published by the United States Weather Bureau. Schools in the region were prepared as emergency shelters in advance of the storm's landfall.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of the {{structure}} of <b>procedures</b> <b>is</b> central to the foundations of problem soling. In this paper we explore three principle means for teaching procedures: telling, canned loops, and procedural abstraction. The most straightforward way to teach a <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> by telling how to accomplish it in a high level goal-oriented language. In the method of canned loops the control structure that is needed for the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> supposed and the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> deduced. In the method of procedural abstraction the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> abstracted from protocols of the procedure on examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{mathematical}} logic behind a hierarchical planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> used to derive production volumes of consumer products. The {{essence of the}} planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> that first a commitment is made concerning the production volume {{for a family of}} similar products and in a second stage the committed production volume is allocated among the products within the product family. A computationally attractive <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> developed to compute the aggregate production volume and the allocated quantities, such that some target customer service level <b>is</b> achieved. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> based on a combination of exact reasoning, approximation schemes and empirical findings. Numerical results showing the excellent performance of the <b>procedure</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R
5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|On October18, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued along the Mexican coastline from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero to Manzanillo, Colima, and {{a tropical}} storm watch extended northward to La Fortuna, Mexico, as Kiko was forecast to make landfall in that region on October21. Above-normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast. Rainfall totals of 4inches (100millimetres) to 7in (180mm) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10in (250mm). As a precaution, port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low-lying areas that might flood. Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors. Emergency <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> on standby in case conditions became more threatening.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} {{converting}} {{the film to}} 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2½ years to complete the visual effects work. A number of complex <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> executed, including cubical transformations and {{the design of the}} faceless form of Ra.One.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway {{rather than at the}} gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts. These elaborate <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E

5|$|In February, both squadrons {{provided}} {{support for}} the liberation of major towns, including Široki Brijeg, Nevesinje and Mostar, and patrolled and attacked targets of opportunity across Bosnia and Dalmatia. Specifically, they supported the Mostar operation of the 8th Corps, {{the work of the}} 11th Corps clearing the enemy from islands in the northern Adriatic, and also 5th Corps operations. Despite the presence of liaison sections with ground forces, <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> not yet streamlined, and several friendly fire incidents occurred during the Mostar operation. In support of 11th Corps operations, Hurricanes attacked German headquarters, defences and naval traffic on and around the islands of Pag and Krk. On 7 February, Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron were supporting 4th and 11th Corps and attacked a column of German trucks and wagons on the road between Gospić and Bihać when two of the aircraft collided, causing minor damage. Both aircraft crash-landed in friendly territory and were written off, but the pilots escaped unharmed. During February, No. 351 Squadron re-deployed to Zemunik on the mainland near Zadar.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> offered, the process of selecting the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some of the delegates came from areas that are now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as from areas that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, political groups, government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E
5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few months, Cranmer and the king worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once the <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E
25|$|Cosmetic {{surgery is}} an {{optional}} or elective surgery that is performed on normal {{parts of the}} body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled {{since the start of the}} century. 92% of cosmetic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001.
