25|$|In {{response}} to developing scientific challenges to its position refusing C-123 veterans' exposure claims, on March 10, 2014 VA began revising their web <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> {{reference to the}} submission of a special C-123 study project for the Institute of Medicine. First promised the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 veterans are brought into the VA health care system.|$|E

The New Baby, {{first published in}} 1948, depicted an expectant mother just days away from birth with no visible signs of pregnancy. For the 1975 reprinting, Wilkin decided to more realistically portray the mother and her pregnant form. The 1954 cover of [...] "The New Baby" [...] shows an infant sleeping on her tummy, which Wilkins changed for the 1975 edition after increasing societal awareness of sudden infant death syndrome.

50|$|To {{be a part}} of the webring, {{each site}} has a common {{navigation}} bar; it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term webring. However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.A webring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a webring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic. Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> in the webring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML or JavaScript to their site.|$|E

5000|$|Lena Posner-Körösi, {{a leader}} of Sweden's Jewish community, criticized Israel's {{official}} response to Boström's article, stating {{in an interview with}} the Israeli army radio that the Israeli reaction and media outrage had provided the claims with much more exposure than they would have had otherwise, and blown the story out of proportion. She noted how initial widespread condemnations of Aftonbladet and its article in the Swedish media quickly turned into united defence for freedom of the press when Israel requested that the government should condemn it too. Posner-Körösi explained that [...] "freedom of expression is sacred" [...] to Swedes and that no one [...] "understands how Israel dares to interfere." [...] Posner-Körösi was nevertheless critical of Aftonbladet, stating in her letter to editor Jan Helin, that [...] "the Jewish Central Council in Sweden insists that the description is akin to classic antisemitism - Jews who kidnap children to slaughter them and steal their blood.

The short-distance form of the two-point function of the scaling field Φ(x), {{was found to be}} N^- 1 〈 Tr Φ(0) ^†Φ(x) 〉=C_ 2 ^ 2 mx, where m is the mass gap, in agreement with the perturbative renormalization group.

40|$|In biorthogonal quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of a quasi-Hermitian {{operator}} {{and those of}} its adjoint are biorthogonal and complete and the probability for a transition from a quantum state {{to any one of}} these eigenvectors is positive definite. We apply this formalism to the long standing problem of the position observable in quantum field theory. The dual bases are positive and negative frequency one-particle states created by the field {{operator and}} its conjugate and biorthogonality is a consequence of their commutation relations. In these biorthogonal bases the position operator is covariant and the Klein-Gordon wave function is localized. We find that the invariant probability for a transition from a one-photon state to a position eigenvector is the first order Glauber correlation function, bridging the gap between photon counting and the sensitivity of light detectors to electromagnetic energy density.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the design and implementation of a web based publications database for the Speech and Hearing Group, a research group based in Sheffield University's Department of Computer Science. The essential requirements for the system are that it should have a clearly presented and highly useable web front-end that fits in stylistically with the group's existing web site. The system should provide a main search page that is accessible to anyone and will give various options to help quickly locate any publications recorded in the database. A restricted access administrators section should also be created and this will provide the means for entering new publications into the database and for altering and deleting existing details. Additional requirements for the system include the need for an automated method for inputting new entries into the database {{to be added to the}} administrators section of the web-site. A mechanism for allowing Speech and Hearing members to post their publication details in free text format to the administration part of the site, such that they can then be entered into the database, is also needed.

40|$|We present NPS, a novel non-intrusive web {{prefetching}} {{system that}} (1) utilizes only spare resources to avoid interference between prefetch and demand requests at the server {{as well as}} in the network, and (2) is deployable without any modifications to servers, browsers, network or the HTTP protocol. NPS’s self-tuning architecture eliminates the need for traditional “thresholds ” or magic numbers typically used to limit interference caused by prefetching, thereby allowing applications to improve benefits and reduce the risk of aggressive prefetching. NPS avoids interference with demand requests by monitoring the responsiveness of the server and accordingly throttling the prefetch aggressiveness, and by using TCP-Nice, a congestion control protocol suitable for low priority transfers. NPS avoids the need to modify existing infrastructure by modifying HTML <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> Javascript TM code that issues prefetch requests and by wrapping the server infrastructure with several simple external modules that require no knowledge of or no modifications to the internals of existing servers. Our measurements of the prototype under a web trace indicate that NPS is both non-interfering and efficient under different network load and server load conditions. For example, in our experiments with a loaded server with little spare capacity, we observe that a threshold-based prefetching scheme causes response times to increase by a factor of 2 due to interference, whereas prefetching using NPS decreases response times by 25 %...|$|E
