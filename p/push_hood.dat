40|$|Pull-push {{ventilation}} system, {{with high}} capture efficiency, is universally used to capture contaminants from containment generation where can’t be enclosed {{and where the}} working area is large. When there are obstacles between the pull hood and the <b>push</b> <b>hood,</b> the air jet will disperse, leaving contaminants out of control, causing atmosphere polluted. This paper aims to discuss flow filed of pull-push ventilation system, located in some tank of some plating workshop, with obstacles between pull hood and <b>push</b> <b>hood.</b> Mathematical model, involving physical model, assumptions, governing equations, boundary conditions and grid separation is established. By CFD code FLUENT, flow field, containing velocity field and concentration field, is achieved. To verify the simulation models, velocity field for simulation results is compared with the theory results, while concentration field for simulation results with experimental results. The comparison {{results show that the}} results matches well and that mathematical model proposed in this paper is reasonable, helpful and realistic significant in designing this kind exhaust ventilation systems where obstacles presence...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, {{as though}} by chance he <b>pushed</b> back the <b>hood</b> that covered his head, {{revealing}} a wrinkled old {{face with a}} mocking mouth which drooped at one corner, a mouth that I knew again, although many {{years had passed since}} I looked upon it as a boy.|$|R

It said McGee claimed that he was punched {{in the head and}} was bleeding. But the police report said that there were no visible wounds and the dampness on his head was from water on the hood of the car.|$|R

In silence Stella stretched out her hand, and in silence Morris took it; for neither of them seemed to find any words. At length she spoke, fixing her sad eyes upon his face, and saying: ...|$|R
50|$|Dodge moved {{upmarket}} {{with the}} Custom Royal in the mid-1950s, which cut into and eroded DeSoto's traditional market segment. The {{introduction of the}} 1957 DeSoto Firesweep, a model that used the Dodge engine, chassis, front fenders, and <b>hood,</b> <b>pushed</b> DeSoto down into Dodge territory competing directly against the Custom Royal. The Firesweep sold well, but {{at the expense of}} the higher priced Firedome and Fireflite models. The DeSoto began looking like a Chrysler with a different grille and taillights, which, in an era of strong make identification, was a recipe for disaster.|$|R

"He's alive, small {{thanks to}} you," [...] responded Ben, who had somehow {{arrived at a}} {{knowledge}} of the facts, while Rusha, who was milking, buried her head in Daisy's side, and would not even look at her. Patience felt in utter despair, and longed to misunderstand Stead's signs to her to open the door. She tried to impress the need of quiet, but Emlyn darted in, her <b>hood</b> <b>pushed</b> back, her hair flying, her dress disordered, looking half wild, and dropping on the floor, she crouched there with clasped hands, crying [...] "Oh! oh! he looks like death. He'll die and I'm the most--" ...|$|R
2500|$|The Lord {{and chief}} Boggin {{are dressed in}} hunting pink (red) coats and top hats {{decorated}} with flowers and badges. The Lord also carries his wand of office. This is a staff made from twelve willow wands with one more upside down in the centre. These are bound thirteen times with willow twigs and a red ribbon at the top. The thirteen willow wands are supposed to represent the twelve apostles and the upside down one represents Judas. The staff is supposed to represent the sword and the blood from when the game was played with a bullock’s head after it had been slaughtered. The Fool has multi-coloured strips of material attached to his trousers and top. He wears a feathered hat decorated with flowers and rags, and his face is smeared with soot and red ochre. He carries a whip and sock filled with bran, with which he belabours anyone who comes within reach. The remaining ten Boggins wear red jumpers. The game is played by locals, although anyone can join in. There are no official teams, but everyone involved tries to <b>push</b> the <b>Hood</b> towards their favoured pub.|$|R
2500|$|In America, {{apart from}} {{regional}} scenes in Detroit, New York City, Chicago, and Orlando [...] interest was limited. Producers from Detroit, {{frustrated by the}} lack of opportunity in their home country, looked to Europe for their future livelihood. This first wave of Detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of up-and-coming artists, the so-called [...] "second wave", including Carl Craig, Octave One, Jay Denham, Kenny Larkin, and Stacey Pullen, with UR's Jeff Mills, Mike Banks, and Robert <b>Hood</b> <b>pushing</b> their own unique sound. A number of New York producers were also making an impression at this time, notably Frankie Bones, Lenny Dee, and Joey Beltram. In the same period, close to Detroit (Windsor, Ontario), Richie Hawtin, with business partner John Acquaviva, launched the influential imprint Plus 8 Records.|$|R

[...] Proceedings start at around 3pm with the throwing of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up to prevent them unrolling. This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt {{to get them off}} the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately throw it in the air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|R
50|$|Dodger rallies Oliver and {{the other}} dogs to rescue Jenny from Sykes, but the animals are confronted by Sykes and his Dobermans after they free her. Fagin saves the group with his scooter and a chase ensues {{throughout}} the streets and into the subway tunnels. Jenny is <b>pushed</b> onto the <b>hood</b> of Sykes's car after it bumped onto the scooter, where she holds onto the hood ornament, and Oliver and Dodger attempt a rescue. Roscoe and DeSoto fall off {{the car in the}} struggle and land on the subway's third rail, electrocuting them. Tito takes control of Fagin's scooter as Fagin manages to retrieve Jenny, and Tito drives the scooter {{up the side of the}} Brooklyn Bridge as Sykes' car drives straight into the path of an oncoming train, killing him and throwing him and his car into the East River. Dodger and Oliver manage to avoid the collision and are reunited with Jenny {{and the other}}s. Later, Jenny celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin and Winston. That same day, Winston receives a phone call from Jenny's parents in Rome saying that they will be back tomorrow. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny but he promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.|$|R
50|$|Silver Cross is {{well known}} for the {{manufacture}} of traditional coach-built prams, characterised by a hard body, C-spring suspension, spoked wheels and folding hood. This method of pram building was pioneered by William Wilson, an engineer and inventor from Leeds, England. Wilson went on to establish Silver Cross in 1877, marketing this type of coach-built baby carriage, and registering numerous patents for perambulator design in order to protect his unique invention. Despite refinements in techniques and manufacturing processes, the method of pram building today remains very similar to early pram building, with body panels being pressed from aluminium, riveted together and then painted to a high gloss finish. The body is then hand upholstered with a pram bed, and also decorated with fine line detail (in kind with fine lines applied to the coachwork of horse-drawn carriages - hence the term coach-built pram). The fine lines are hand painted and require considerable skill to apply. The steel suspension of the pram is hand bent around a specially shaped form in order to create the C-shaped suspension members, which are then attached to the body using leather straps. It is the C-spring suspension and leather straps that create the unique coach-built pram 'bounce'. The spoked wheels (traditionally chromed) are then attached to the suspension to complete the rolling chassis. Traditional pram wheels are large in diameter to further enhance the smooth ride. A folding fabric <b>hood,</b> <b>pushing</b> handle and covering fabric apron are then attached to the pram to complete the build. Silver Cross also manufactures a collection of coach-built dolls prams, which are scaled-down replicas of the full size prams. The dolls prams are made {{in exactly the same way}} as the real prams with the same coachwork, spoked wheels and folding hood. Silver Cross currently manufactures two models of full-size coach-built pram in the UK, the Balmoral and the Kensington, as well as two models of dolls pram, the Oberon and the Chatsworth. Silver Cross is the only pram manufacturer still producing coach-built prams in the UK.|$|R
