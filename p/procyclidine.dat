40|$|Abstract – A simple, {{rapid and}} precise method was {{developed}} for the quantitative estimation of <b>procyclidine</b> hydrochloride in pharmaceutical dosage form. A chromatographic separation of <b>procyclidine</b> hydrochloride was achieved with Chiral-AGP, 100 x 4. 0 mm, 5. 0 µm analytical column using aqueous solution of 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4. 1 with acetic acid-acetonitrile (95 : 5 v/v). The instrumental settings include flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min, column temperature at 30 °C and detector wavelength of 210 nm using a photodiode array detector. Theoretical plates for <b>procyclidine</b> hydrochloride were 8232. Tailing factor for <b>procyclidine</b> hydrochloride was 1. 33.

40|$|AbstractFour medical therapies {{previously}} {{shown to}} exert {{varying degrees of}} protection against a convulsant dose of soman were assessed for potential behavioral side effects in a novelty test. In Experiment 1, HI- 6 (1 -[([4 -(aminocarbonyl) pyridino] methoxy) methyl]- 2 -[(hydroxyimino) methyl]pyridinium) (125 mg/kg), scopolamine (1 mg/kg), physostigmine (0. 1 mg/kg), levetiracetam (50 mg/kg), and <b>procyclidine</b> (20 mg/kg) were tested separately. In Experiment 2, the combination of HI- 6, scopolamine, and physostigmine (termed the physostigmine regimen) or HI- 6, levetiracetam, and <b>procyclidine</b> (termed the <b>procyclidine</b> regimen) were tested. In Experiment 3, the metabotropic glutamate modulators DCG-IV ((2 S, 2 ′R, 3 ′R) - 2 -(2 ′, 3 ′-dicarboxycyclopropyl) glycine) (4 mg/kg) and MPEP (2 -Methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) pyridine hydrochloride) (30 mg/kg) were tested separately or each drug in combination with HI- 6 and <b>procyclidine</b> (termed the DCG-IV regimen and the MPEP regimen, respectively).

The DCG-IV and MPEP regimens caused milder deficits on the same behavioral measures. Some relations were seen between prophylactic capacity and degree of behavioral side effects. Only HI- 6 or levetiracetam had no adverse effects on behavior. DCG-IV or MPEP produced some impairment, whereas the detrimental effects of scopolamine or <b>procyclidine</b> were pronounced. The relatively high dose of <b>procyclidine</b> (anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic) needed for prophylactic efficacy may have played a major role for the side effects of the regimens in which the drug was used.

40|$|Smooth pursuit eye {{movement}} (SPEM) and antisaccade deficits are {{observed in the}} schizophrenia spectrum and {{have been used to}} study the pathophysiology as well as the genetic basis of this condition. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been implicated in a number of cognitive processes thought to underlie SPEM and antisaccade performance. This study investigates effects on {{eye movement}}s of <b>procyclidine,</b> an anticholinergic drug often administered to schizophrenic patients. A total of 13 patients completed a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, receiving 15 mg <b>procyclidine</b> and placebo. Seven participants received <b>procyclidine</b> first and placebo second, six participants were tested in the reverse order. SPEM and antisaccade (as well as fixation and prosaccade) eye movements were recorded using infrared oculography. Results showed that <b>procyclidine</b> overall, relative to placebo, mildly worsened SPEM performance, as indicated by nonsignificantly reduced gain (p 0. 08) and increased frequency of intrusive anticipatory saccades during pursuit (p 0. 06). A significant interaction of group and order of administration indicated that <b>procyclidine</b> increased the rate of antisaccade reflexive errors only when administered first; the opposite pattern was observed when placebo was administered first, likely due to the operation of practice effects at second assessment. These findings indicate that acute administration of a clinically relevant dose of <b>procyclidine</b> leads to mild impairments in eye movement performance in schizophrenic patients, suggesting the need to consider this compound in oculomotor studies in schizophrenia.

Given the lack of effective available drugs against B. mandrillaris encephalitis with a mortality {{rate of more than}} 90 %, here we screened drugs, targeting vital cellular receptors and biochemical pathways, that are already in approved clinical use for their potential clinical usefulness. Amoebicidal assays were performed by incubating B. mandrillaris with drugs (3 × 105 cells/ 0. 5 mL/well) in phosphate buffered saline for 24 h and viability was determined using Trypan blue exclusion staining. For controls, amoebae were incubated with the solvent alone. To determine whether effects are reversible, B. mandrillaris were pre-exposed to drugs for 24 h, washed twice, and incubated with human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which constitute the blood–brain barrier as food source, for up to 48 h. Of the ten drugs tested, amlodipine, apomorphine, demethoxycurcumin, haloperidol, loperamide, prochlorperazine, <b>procyclidine,</b> and resveratrol showed potent amoebicidal effects, while amiodarone and digoxin exhibited minimal effectiveness.

40|$|Granulomatous amoebic {{encephalitis}} (GAE) {{is caused}} by two protist pathogens, Acanthamoeba spp., and Balamuthia mandrillaris. Although rare, it almost always results in death. In the present study, amoebae were treated with various combinations of clinically-approved drugs, targeting vital cellular receptors and biochemical pathways. The results revealed that among the seven different combinations tested, three proved highly effective against both Acanthamoeba castellanii as well as B. mandrillaris at a concentration of 100 μM. These combinations included (i) prochlorperazine plus loperamide; (ii) prochlorperazine plus apomorphine; and (iii) <b>procyclidine</b> plus loperamide. In viability assays, none of the drug-treated amoebae emerged as viable trophozoites, suggesting irreversible amoebicidal effects. Four combinations of drugs tested showed varied potency against A. castellanii and B. mandrillaris at 100 μM. The combination of haloperidol and loperamide was highly effective against A. castellanii at 100 μM, but potent effects against B. mandrillariswere observed only at 250 μM. Digoxin and amlodipine were effective against A. castellanii and B. mandrillaris at 100 μM and 250 μM, respectively. In contrast, the combination of apomorphine and haloperidol was effective against B. mandrillaris and A. castellanii at 100 μM and 250 μM, respectively. At 100 μM, the combination of <b>procyclidine</b> and amiodarone was effective against neither A. castellanii nor B. mandrillaris.

40|$|Objective: Risperidone {{overdose}} {{is generally}} associated with mild and predictable clinical effects, including sedation, tachycardia and dystonia, {{which are usually}} resolved within 24 hours of ingestion. We report the management of a case of risperidone overdose in a 28 year old woman who remained asymptomatic for almost 60 hours post-ingestion before the sudden onset of an acute dystonic reaction of the tongue and throat.   Case report: The patient presented following the sudden onset of extremely distressing spasm and swelling of her tongue, neck and side of face, {{two and a half}} days after an alleged overdose with 90 mg of a friend's risperidone. She was dyspnoeic and could not speak. Examination was unremarkable except for an acute dystonia of her tongue and throat, noisy breathing without true stridor, and sinus tachycardia (HR 150). Neurological examination was normal except for the dystonia. Coagulation, renal and liver function test results were within normal limits. <b>Procyclidine</b> was given as an intravenous bolus of 10 mg. The patient described a reduction in the swelling and spasm of her tongue and throat within 30 minutes of treatment. Serum risperidone concentration at the time of presentation was below the limit of detection for the assay and the concentration of the active metabolite, 9 -OH risperidone, was 31 μg/L, which is within the normal range of 10 - 90 μg/L for patients taking risperidone therapeutically. Her heart rate settled following resolution of the dystonia and she was discharged the same day.   Conclusion:  This case report confirms that dystonic reactions can occur some days after an otherwise asymptomatic overdose of risperidone, {{even in the absence of}} elevated blood concentrations of the parent drug or its metabolite.

40|$|ABSTRACT Anticholinergic {{drugs were}} the first {{pharmacological}} agents used {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease. Although levodopa and other centrally acting dopaminergic agonists have largely supplanted their use, they still have a place in treatment of the disease. As a therapeutic class, there is little pharmacokinetic information available for these drugs, which is inclusive of benztropine, biperiden, diphenhydramine, ethopropazine, orphenadrine, <b>procyclidine</b> and trihexyphenidyl. Pharmacokinetic information is largely restricted to studies involving young health volunteers given single doses. In general, this class of drugs is rapidly absorbed after oral administration to humans. Oral bioavailability is variable between the different drugs, ranging from 30 % to over 70 %. Each of the drugs appears to possess a large Vd in humans and animals, and distribution to tissues is rapid. The drugs are all characterized by relatively low clearance relative to hepatic blood flow, and appear to be extensively metabolized, primarily to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated metabolites. The available information suggests that excretion of parent drug and metabolite is via the urine and bile.

40|$|Nerve {{agents are}} highly toxic {{organophosphate}} compounds that irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme hydrolysing acetylcholine. Accumulation of acetylcholine results in respiratory dysfunction, prolonged seizures, convulsive status epilepticus, and death. The progression of events {{can be divided}} into three phases. An early phase lasting from exposure to about 5 minutes after seizure onset is dominated by excessive cholinergic activity followed by a transitional phase of cholinergic and glutamatergic hyperactivity, and finally a predominantly glutamatergic phase after about 40 minutes. Nerve agent induced seizures that have lasted more than 10 min appears to be difficult to terminate, unless the countermeasures exert cholinergic and glutamatergic antagonism as well as GABAergic agonism. However, even medical therapies assuring such effects become gradually less effective by elapse of time (1 h). It will take at least 30 min for emergency personnel to access individuals unprepared for exposure to nerve agent. Even soldiers properly equipped with a protective mask, gloves, and clothes may need medical help, because bad training, bad discipline or bad luck can lead to intoxication by nerve agent.

40|$|Background: Patients {{with mental}} disorders, such as {{depression}} and anxiety, who seek medical care in private psychiatric clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, have recently expressed concerns to doctors about difficulty in filling psychotropic medications, such as Amitriptyline and Aripiprazole, at retail community pharmacies. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether there is a shortage of some commonly prescribed psychotropic medications in retail community pharmacies in Saudi Arabia, and if so, to explore the possible reasons behind the shortage of these medications. Methods: The availability of 28 commonly prescribed psychotropic medications was checked in multiple retail community pharmacies in 4 different regions of Saudi Arabia. Further, potential reasons behind the shortage of some psychotropic medications in retail community pharmacies were also explored. Results: Amitriptyline, Amoxapine, Aripiprazole, Bupropion, Buspirone, Duloxetine, Haloperidol, Hydroxyzine, Lithium, Prochlorperazine, <b>Procyclidine,</b> Promethazine, Thioridazine, Trazodone, and Trifluoperazine were unavailable in over half of the 248 community pharmacies surveyed. Four possible reasons behind the shortage of these medications were reported by 31 pharmacists working in different retail community pharmacies’ purchasing departments, with a majority (58. 06 %) reporting the primary reason for a shortage of these medications that they are slow-moving items with low profit margins. Conclusions: The findings of this study should expedite the reform process in both the Ministry of Health and the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) to publish and enforce an essential list of medications for retail community pharmacies, which should include the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the antipsychotic prescribing pattern and the prevalence of concurrent anticholinergic prescribing in a psychiatric referral hospital. A retrospective audit of prescriptions issued for outpatients was carried out at the Psychiatric Hospital, the only facility that provides psychiatric services for both inpatients and outpatients in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Antipsychotic monotherapy was prescribed for 89. 2 % patients, whereas polytherapy with two- and three-drugs in 10. 4 and 0. 4 %, respectively. Atypical antipsychotics were prescribed more often (67. 7 %) than typical antipsychotics. Risperidone and haloperidol were the most frequently prescribed antipsychotics. Long-acting risperidone injection was the only depot preparation prescribed. The mean antipsychotic dose expressed as chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZeq; mg/day) was 242 (220 for monotherapy and 414 for polytherapy). The prevalence of high dose antipsychotic (mean CPZeq > 1000 mg/day) was 1. 8 %, prescribed at a mean CPZeq dose of 1531 (1925 for monotherapy and 1137 for polytherapy), mainly attributed to haloperidol. Anticholinergics were co-prescribed for almost two third of patients receiving antipsychotics, particularly for those on polytherapy (monotherapy 57. 3 %; poly-therapy 87. 5 %). Antipsychotic polytherapy, high dose and co-prescription of an oral with a depot antipsychotic preparation were strongly associated with concurrent prescription of anticholinergics. <b>Procyclidine</b> and orphenadrine were the most often prescribed anticholinergics. In Bahrain, antipsychotic monotherapy is a common practice for outpatients with psychotic disorders. Some of the antipsychotic polytherapies, dosage strategies, and high prevalence of anticholinergic use are therapeutic issues that need to be addressed to foster evidence-based prescribing practice...|$|E
40|$|Low {{volatile}} organophosphorous nerve agents such as VX, {{will most}} likely enter the body via the skin. The pharmacokinetics of drugs such as oximes, atropine and diazepam, are not aligned with the variable and persistent toxicokinetics of the agent. Repeated administration of these drugs showed to improve treatment efficacy compared to a single injection treatment. Because {{of the effectiveness of}} continuous treatment, it was investigated to what extent a subchronic pretreatment with carbamate (pyridostigmine or physostigmine combined with either <b>procyclidine</b> or scopolamine) would protect against percutaneous VX exposure. Inclusion of scopolamine in the pretreatment prevented seizures in all animals, but none of the pretreatments affected survival time or the onset time of cholinergic signs. These results indicate that percutaneous poisoning with VX requires additional conventional treatment in addition to the current pretreatment regimen. Decontamination of VX-exposed skin {{is one of the most}} important countermeasures to mitigate the effects of the exposure. To evaluate the window of opportunity for decontamination, the fielded skin decontaminant Reactive Skin Decontaminant Lotion (RSDL) was tested at different times in hairless guinea pigs percutaneously challenged with 4 × LD 50 VX in IPA. The results showed that RSDL decontamination at 15 min after exposure could not prevent progressive blood cholinesterase inhibition and therefore would still require additional treatment. A similar decontamination regimen with RSDL at 90 min showed that it still might effectively increase the time window of opportunity for treatment. In conclusion, the delay in absorption presents a window of opportunity for decontamination and treatment. The continuous release of VX from the skin presents a significant challenge for efficacious therapy, which should ideally consist of thorough decontamination and continuous treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (nAChRs) are {{implicated in}} several {{diseases of the}} central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. They {{play a role in}} modulating release of neurotransmittors and in the development and intervention of brain seizures and neurodegeneration caused by organophosphate poisoning, a major lethal threat in developing countries. A method was developed to screen drugs for effects on nAChR. The method uses the ratiometric Ca 2 +-probe fura- 2 to measure, {{with the aid of a}} plate reader, nicotine induced responses in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY 5 Y. The method was validated using published data for the Alzheimer drug memantine. Drugs that show effects against tremor and brain seizures were characterised, including the Parkinson drugs biperiden, <b>procyclidine,</b> and trihexphenidyl. These drugs all blocked nAChR with an IC 50 in a narrow range from 0. 75 µM to 1. 5 µM. The potencies of the drugs at the nAChR were greater than at the NMDA receptors, implicating a relevance of drug effects on nAChR in the mechanisms of inhibition of seizures. The nAChR block of the drugs were use- and voltage-dependent, features particularly suitable for a drug used to restrain epileptogenic seizures. Caramiphen, a potent antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, also blocks nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM. The novel NMDA-receptor blocker gacyclidine (GK 11) was shown to block the nAChR with an IC 50 of 0. 3 µM for its racemate and 0. 16 µM for the pure (-) -isomer. The novel finding that gacyclidine blocks nAChR makes this receptor a good candidate for the “non-NMDA” binding sites that have been established, but not yet identified, for gacycyclidine. Several novel bis-quarternary pyridine compounds inhibited nAChR with IC 50 values inversely correlated with the length of the carbon chain linker, differing from the relative potencies of the drugs at muscle nAChR. This finding is, because of ganglionic blockade, highly relevant in selecting a suitable candidate to combat organophosphate poisoning...|$|E
