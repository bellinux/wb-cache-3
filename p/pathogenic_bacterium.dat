5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used his {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacterium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the bile and blood samples of patients with obstructive jaundice. MethodsA total of 322 patients with obstructive jaundice who were admitted to Department of Gastroenterology and Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery in The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University from January 2012 to April 2016 were enrolled. Bile samples were obtained from all patients and blood culture was performed for 84 patients. The influence of benign and malignant obstruction and therapies on the detection rate of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in bile was analyzed, and the detection rate of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in bile and blood was compared. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsPathogenic bacteria were detected in 246 patients (246 / 322), resulting in a detection rate of 76. 40 %. A total of 267 strains were detected, which consisted of 208 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, 48 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, and 11 strains of fungi. Among the 256 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), 199 were detected to have <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> resulting in a detection rate of 77. 73 %; among the 66 patients who underwent surgery, 47 were detected to have <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> resulting in a detection rate of 71. 21 %. There {{was no significant difference}} in the detection rate of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> between these two groups (χ 2 = 1. 238, P= 0. 266). Among the 288 patients with benign obstructive jaundice, 215 were detected to have <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> resulting in a detection rate of 74. 65 %; among the 34 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice, 31 were detected to have <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> resulting in a detection rate of 91. 18 %. There was a significant difference in the detection rate of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> between these two groups (χ 2 = 4. 605, P= 0. 032), and there was a significant difference in the distribution of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in bile between these two groups (χ 2 = 0. 159, P= 0. 690). The types of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in bile samples were similar to those in blood samples, and there was a significant difference in the detection of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> between them (χ 2 = 13. 235, P＜ 0. 001). ConclusionThere is no significant difference in the detection rate of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> determined by ERCP or surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice. For patients who cannot undergo ERCP or surgery, blood culture results can be used to guide clinical medication...|$|R

2500|$|TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors (often {{referred}} to as TALEs, but {{not to be confused}} with the three amino acid loop extension homeobox sub-family of proteins) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. [...] These proteins can bind promoter sequences in the host plant and activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection. [...] They recognize plant DNA sequences through a central repeat domain consisting of a variable number of ~34 amino acid repeats. [...] There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [...] These proteins are interesting to researchers both for their role in disease of important crop species and the relative ease of retargeting them to bind new DNA sequences. [...] Similar proteins can be found in the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Ralstonia solanacearum and Burkholderia rhizoxinica., as well as yet unidentified marine microorganisms. The term TALE-likes is used to refer to the putative protein family encompassing the TALEs and these related proteins.|$|E
