The technologies of Grid Computing are evolving with open standards such as Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). In this paper we are considering the adoption of Grid Computing Technology in a “Virtual Organisation “of Higher-Education (HE) institutions. We will concentrate on the resources and knowledge sharing (virtual e-lecture e-learning) among colleges and universities in West Yorkshire, UK, enabled by the Grid. Within this context, it is important to focus on standards that support resource and information sharing, toolkits and middleware solutions that would promote Grid adoption among the HE institutions in the Virtual HE organisation. With the cost of Further Education and Higher Education <b>programmes</b> <b>delivery</b> rising due to hardware and software resources cost, we propose that the Grid technology could deliver benefits to the HE provision on the regional, national or even international level...|$|R

This paper attempts to recover the experiences and views of professionals concerned with the delivery and implementation of a multi-agency programme tackling the social exclusion of these young {{children and their families}} known as Sure Start. The data are based on the analysis of documentation, attendance and observation at meetings, and 32 semi-structured interviews with members of the inter-disciplinary team responsible for the Sure Start <b>programme's</b> <b>delivery.</b> The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using open coding from grounded theorizing. The paper, in reflecting on the problems and dilemmas of multi-agency approaches and reported in other research, considers how the preliminary findings from this study suggest the team have managed to accommodate and overcome these potential difficulties, to facilitate an integrated, holistic and user-centred approach to the programme. The paper concludes by considering the possibility that the team's approach may be conceptually located within an organizational social capital framework as posited by Nahapiet and Ghoshal...|$|R
