50|$|Caution periods {{are also}} done {{differently}} in Formula One and IndyCars. Largely because of IndyCar's oval-racing heritage, incidents that leave a hazard {{on or near}} the track always draw a full-course caution period. Because the entire field of cars gathers behind the leader for each restart, IndyCars that have fallen back in the field can earn a chance to challenge the leaders by making strategic pit stops. IndyCar-style caution periods also force the leader to withstand a possible challenge with every restart. By contrast, caution periods are usually only called in F1 for hazards on the track itself, so F1 drivers are by comparison more likely to be judged by their lap driving ability alone than by their pit strategy or aggression during restarts. However, with a recent change in racing tyre for <b>F1,</b> <b>pit</b> strategies have played a much larger role in more recent races and have contributed to a more varying and unpredictable race.|$|R
25|$|The Parade Commander will {{command the}} Parade contingents {{to prepare for}} the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands {{bringing}} the rear. In the National Day Parade, 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the <b>F1</b> <b>Pit</b> Building. In the National Day Parade, 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the President Tony Tan Keng Yam, had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions with all of them rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to Marina Bay Sands where the march ended. The Onward March made yet another appearance in the 2014 edition alongside the City Marchpast after the parade proper towards the MBS complex. The City Marchpast made its 6th consecutive appearance in the 2015 edition and was carried on in 2016 together with the Onward March from the new National Stadium and again in 2017.|$|R
