40|$|Behavioural and {{morphological}} {{studies were}} made to determine whether feeding niche partitioning occurs in three sympatric coastal mysids, Anisomysis mixta australis, Paramesopodopsis rufa, and Tenagomysis tasmaniae. All three species showed optimal chemoreception as judged from stereotyped food capturing response to mixtures of feeding stimulant (either betaine-HCl or glycine) and suppressant (ammonia). The strongest responses were to 50 : 50 mixtures of both betaine-ammonia and glycine-ammonia solutions. In general, the response curve to the different mixtures tested was bell-shaped. A. mixta australis only showed the normal curve {{in response to the}} glycine-ammonia mixture. The <b>platykurtic</b> <b>curve</b> in T. tasmaniae suggests less optimal response to the betaine-HCl-ammonia solution. P. rufa reacted more strongly to the betaine-ammonia than to the glycine-ammonia solutions, and more of its individuals responded to both solutions than the other two species. These results suggest that sensitivity to betaine-HCl- and glycine-rich fresh and decomposing animal tissue is most sharp in P. rufa. Acuteness, however, may be diminished with duration of decomposition as indicated by reduced responses to mixtures with > 50...|$|E
