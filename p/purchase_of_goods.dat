25|$|Commercial {{bank money}} or demand {{deposits}} are claims against financial institutions {{that can be}} used for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{classify}} {{government expenditures}} into three main types. Government <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{and services for}} current use are classed as government consumption. Government <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services intended to create future benefits - such as infrastructure investment or research spending - are classed as government investment. Government expenditures that are not <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, and instead just represent transfers of money - such as social security payments - are called transfer payments.|$|R

50|$|The European Union {{and most}} {{states in the}} USA employ a tax on Haig-Simons income with a {{consumption}} tax. In the European Union, a value added tax applies to <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services on each level of exchange until it reaches the ultimate consumer. In the US, most states tax <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> with a sales tax.|$|R
25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Plan aid {{was mostly}} {{used for the}} <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> from the United States. The European nations had all but {{exhausted}} their foreign exchange reserves during the war, and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad. At {{the start of the}} plan, these imports were mainly much-needed staples such as food and fuel, but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended. In the latter years, under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the Korean War, an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe. Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid-1951, $3.4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured products; $3.2 billion on food, feed, and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machines, vehicles, and equipment; and $1.6 billion on fuel.|$|E
25|$|Vaitupuan {{tradition}} is that chance favoured their efforts, a ship sent {{to collect the}} last payment sank, as did the second ship the trading schooner Vaitupulemele. By the time a third ship arrived {{most of the money}} had been collected. However, the trading schooner Vaitupulemele appears to have a different role in the history of Vaitupu. The creation of the debt that was repaid to Ruge & Co extended beyond the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> on credit to include the purchase price of the Vaitupulemele by the Vaitupu Company. While T.M. Williams had been the Ruge agent, he later formed the Vaitupu Company with the Vaitupuan community and purchased the Vaitupulemele from Ruge & Co. However the schooner was lost during a voyage from Samoan and soon after Williams died, leaving no accounting for copra that had been shipped from Vaitupu. In any event the Vaitupuans paid the full amount claimed by Ruge & Co, although that company soon after went into liquidation.|$|E

60|$|Upon {{whatever}} reasons or pretences the monopoly of opium was supported, the real motive {{appears to be}} the profit of those who were in hopes to be concerned in it.

60|$|But a more {{intricate}} {{portion of}} the theory of Credit is its influence on prices; the chief cause of most of the mercantile phenomena which perplex observers. In a state of commerce in which much credit is habitually given, general prices at any moment depend much more upon the state of credit than upon the quantity of money. For credit, though it is not productive power, is purchasing power; and a person who, having credit, avails himself of it in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> creates just as much demand for the goods, and tends quite as much to raise their price, as if he made an equal amount of purchases with ready money.|$|E

40|$|This {{empirical}} note {{investigates the}} impact of the federal budget deficit upon the nominal long term rate of interest. The analysis differs from the existing literature on a number of counts. To begin with, the analysis uses the most updated evidence available on the structural deficit, as well as newly available data on inflationary expectations. Next, unlike previous studies, the variable federal <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services is expressly introduced into the model as an explanatory variable. In addition, since the total federal deficit is in this paper broken into its two component parts, the structural deficit (which is exogenous) and the cyclical deficit (which is not exogenous), the model expressly deals with the problem of simultaneity bias involving the cyclical deficit. Finally, the monetary policy measure, government <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, and the two deficit measures are not only expressed in real terms but also are divided by trend real GNP; this is because monetary policy actions, government <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services, and the budget deficit must all be judged relative {{to the size of the}} economy. The 2 SLS estimation reveals that federal budget deficits act to elevate the nominal long term interest rate. ...|$|R

60|$|Therefore it {{was that}} a pirate ship was a very welcome visitor in Charles Town harbor. She was {{generally}} loaded with goods, which, as they were stolen, her captain could afford to sell very cheaply indeed, and as there was always plenty of Spanish gold on board, her crew was not apt to haggle very much {{in regard to the}} price of the spirits, the groceries, or the provisions which they bought from the merchants of the town. This friendly commerce between the pirates and the Carolinians grew to be so extensive that at one time the larger part of the coin in circulation in those colonies consisted of Spanish gold pieces, which had been brought in and used by the pirates for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
60|$|A certain {{portion of}} the {{revenues}} of Bengal has been for many years set apart to be employed in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for exportation to England, and {{this is called the}} Investment. The greatness of this investment has been the standard by which the merit of the Company's principal servants has been too generally estimated; and this main cause of the impoverishment of India has been generally taken as a measure of its wealth and prosperity. Numerous fleets of large ships, loaded with the most valuable commodities of the East, annually arriving in England, in a constant and increasing succession, imposed upon the public eye, and naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing opulence of a country whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space in the commercial world. This export from India seemed to imply also a reciprocal supply, by which the trading capital employed in those productions was continually strengthened and enlarged. But the payment of a tribute, and not a beneficial commerce to that country, wore this specious and delusive appearance.|$|E
60|$|But {{this scheme}} of {{monopoly}} did not subsist long, {{at least in}} that mode and for those purposes. Three of the grand monopolies, those of opium, salt, and saltpetre, were successively by the Company taken into their own hands. The produce of {{the sale of the}} two former articles was applied to the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for their investment; the latter was exported in kind for their sales in Europe. The senior servants had a certain share of emolument allotted to them from a commission on the revenues. The junior servants were rigorously confined to salaries, on which they were unable to subsist according to their rank. They were strictly ordered to abstain from all dealing in objects of internal commerce. Those of export and import were left open to young men without mercantile experience, and wholly unprovided with mercantile capitals, but abundantly furnished with large trusts of the public money, and with all the powers of an absolute government. In this situation, a religious abstinence from all illicit game was prescribed to men at nine thousand miles' distance from the seat of the supreme authority.|$|E

60|$|The robber, {{seeing an}} {{unexpected}} chance of escape from punishment, at {{once said that}} the captain of their band, who was the man Geoffrey had last run through, came out from Seville the evening before, {{and told him that}} one Juan Campos, with whom he had long had intimate relations, and who was clerk to a rich trader, had, upon promise that he should receive one fifth of the booty taken, informed him that his master with two other merchants was starting on the following morning for Cadiz with a very valuable lot of goods, and twenty-five thousand crowns, which they intended to lay out in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> brought by some galleons that had just arrived from the Indies. He had arranged to bribe his master's two servants to ride away when they attacked the gang, and also to settle with the muleteers so that they should take no part in the affair. They had reckoned that the flight of two of the servants would probably affect the others, and had therefore expected the rich booty to fall into their hands without the trouble of striking a blow for it.|$|E
60|$|The phrase, rapidity of circulation, {{requires}} some comment. It {{must not be}} understood to mean the number of purchases made by each piece of money in a given time. Time is not the thing to be considered. The state of society may be such that each piece of money hardly performs more than one purchase in a year; but if this arises from {{the small number of}} transactions—from the small amount of business done, the want of activity in traffic, or because what traffic there is mostly takes place by barter—it constitutes no reason why prices should be lower, or the value of money higher. The essential point is, not how often the same money changes hands in a given time, but how often it changes hands in order to perform a given amount of traffic. We must compare the number of purchases made by the money in a given time, not with the time itself, but with the goods sold in that same time. If each piece of money changes hands on an average ten times while goods are sold to the value of a million sterling, it is evident that the money required to circulate those goods is £100,000. And, conversely, if the money in circulation is £100,000, and each piece changes hands, by the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> ten times in a month, the sales of goods for money which take place every month must amount, on the average, to £1,000,000. [The essential point to be considered is] the average number of purchases made by each piece in order to affect a given pecuniary amount of transactions.|$|E
