2500|$|... main tools {{include a}} pen, an eraser, and a paintbrush. New to Flipnotes Studio 3D are tools that draw shapes, fill {{enclosed}} areas (<b>paint</b> <b>bucket),</b> and insert text. The application features a limited color palette, including black, white, red, blue, green, and yellow. This {{is a slight}} improvement upon Flipnote Studio, which didn't include yellow and green as selectable colors, but were still possible using color mixing. The selection tool is used to copy and manipulate parts of a frame. Users can also use the 3DS system's camera and microphone to add audio and photos to their creations. These animations can either be shared on the application's native online community, or by exporting them as GIF or AVI files.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} PALette, {{a tangible}} color-mixing and drawing interface {{that enables the}} mixing of digital paint through physical actions. We sought to create a system that will allow children to express their collaborative creativity while also facilitating “thinking through doing. ” In addition, we wanted a system that would provide remote collaboration and could be used across language barriers so that children across {{the world would be}} able to interact with each other as visual pen pals. In our system, a child can create a color by physically pouring one or more <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> onto a display, and can consequently draw on a virtual canvas with the mixed color. A single PALette system encourages collaboration through multiple, tangible input devices (the <b>paint</b> <b>buckets).</b> Through two connected systems, two children far apart can draw on a shared canvas, thereby supporting remote, synchronous, and language-independent collaboration...|$|R

40|$|Many {{everyday}} estimation tasks have {{an inherently}} discrete nature, whether {{the task is}} counting objects (e. g., a number of <b>paint</b> <b>buckets)</b> or estimating discretized continuous variables (e. g., the number of <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> needed to <b>paint</b> a room). While Bayesian inference is often used for modeling estimates made along continuous scales, discrete numerical estimates have not received as much attention, despite their common everyday occurrence. Using two tasks, a numerosity task and an area estimation task, we invoke Bayesian decision theory to characterize how people learn discrete numerical distributions and make numerical estimates. Across three experiments with novel stimulus distributions we found that participants fell between two common decision functions for converting their uncertain representation into a response: drawing a sample from their posterior distribution and taking the maximum of their posterior distribution. While this {{was consistent with the}} decision function found in previous work using continuous estimation tasks, surprisingly the prior distributions learned by participants in our experiments were much more adaptive: When making continuous estimates, participants have required thousands of trials to learn bimodal priors, but in our tasks participants learned discrete bimodal and even discrete quadrimodal priors within a few hundred trials. This makes discrete numerical estimation tasks good testbeds for investigating how people learn and make estimates. ...|$|R

50|$|Armstrong {{showed her}} artistic talent {{at an early}} age, {{designing}} attractive uniforms for the Queens softball team, and then branching out into drawing and painting. She owned and operated {{one of the early}} shops in Old Town Scottsdale in the 1950s, The <b>Paint</b> <b>Bucket,</b> in which she sold everything from hand-painted blouses and boxer shorts to wastepaper baskets, handmade cards and invitations. At the time, her shop was a favorite of visiting guests from the Elizabeth Arden spa and Camelback Inn, including singer Peggy Lee, actress Alice Faye and polifacetic entertainer Phil Harris. Her work at the <b>Paint</b> <b>Bucket</b> attracted the owners of O'Brien's Art Emporium in Scottsdale, and with their encouragement, she began a career as a fine artist, creating Trompe-l'œil still life and wildlife images, landscapes and more. Her works were sold in art galleries and shown at the Phoenix Art Museum, being collected by art lovers across the Southwest. Her works appear in numerous corporate collections, including the old Valley National Bank collection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Paint</b> <b>Bucket</b> Bowl is {{the name}} of the rivalry between the Arkansas State Red Wolves and the Memphis Tigers. The name of the rivalry was created when {{officials}} from the two schools decided to create a trophy for the winner of the game out of some buckets of paint and some paint brushes. The losing school also designed a particular area on its campus that the winner could smear with paint, in an attempt to eliminate the defacing of each campus and the “kidnapping” of opposing football players during game week. The tradition evolved into the winning school being given a trophy from the other—a <b>paint</b> <b>bucket</b> decorated in the colors of the two schools and inscribed with the game score. The two teams have met 58 times on the football field, with Memphis currently holding a 30-23-5 edge in the all-time series. 2013 is the last scheduled meeting between the two schools.|$|E
50|$|According to Javed Akhtar, {{in their}} early periods, on the cinema posters, there were no names of script writer, story and screenplay. Realizing that the hard work is done by these duo, and not getting the {{appropriate}} recognisation, Salim and Javed decided to paint their names on all the posters pasted in the city. They hired a rikshaw and put the <b>paint</b> <b>bucket</b> on that and did all the work themselves the entire night. After that, the directors also started to put their name on the posters.|$|E

5000|$|After graduating {{high school}} Pangrazio worked as scenic artist for a {{television}} network, {{which was a}} euphemistic term for [...] "bucket boy", as {{he was charged with}} cleaning <b>paint</b> <b>buckets,</b> dirty brushes and other menial tasks. He subsequently performed these tasks for a small Hollywood effects studio, before he met Joe Johnston of Industrial Light & Magic. It was through him that he was hired in 1978 at ILM. Lacking any experience, conceptual artist and matte painter Ralph McQuarrie taught him the craft of matte painting, a trade he learned in the course of three years.|$|R

Documents were found in a cemetery buried in a plastic jerrycan next to a casket; in a railroad embankment; in a suitcase in the storage room of an apartment building; and in a <b>paint</b> <b>bucket</b> beneath the Berlin Wall.|$|E
50|$|Addressing these related questions, {{scientists}} {{during the}} time of the Enlightenment largely argued for the blending hypothesis, in which parental traits were homogenized in the offspring much like buckets of different colored paint being mixed together. Critics of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, pointed out that under this scheme of inheritance, variation would quickly be swamped by the majority phenotype. In the <b>paint</b> <b>bucket</b> analogy, this would be seen by mixing two colors together and then mixing the resulting color with only one of the parent colors 20 times; the rare variant color would quickly fade.|$|E

The band discovered her playing the drums on <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> in Times Square, and Moz paid her for a time before they signed contracts with recording companies and had pays of their own.|$|R
2500|$|Around 11:20pm, while {{preparations}} for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left, or prompt side of the stage. The fire {{was coming from the}} lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was hanging, partially detached, from its frame and, Thorpe thought, somehow must have slipped past the wire mesh guard of the border lamp and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water in <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> was once kept on hand on the stage and in the rigging loft and though a two and a half inch (...) water pipe still serviced a fire hose backstage, none of these facilities was readily available. Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. He decided that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place. He opted to extinguish the flame by whatever means were readily available. He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame. They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles.|$|R

50|$|In spring 1998, a new limited-edition R/T {{package was}} {{available}} {{as an option}} on the Dakota Sport model. This version is considered a true street/sport truck, only available in RWD. Factory modifications such as a 250 hp 360 cid/5.9-liter V8, heavy duty 46RE four-speed automatic transmission, performance axle, limited-slip differential, sport suspension and steering, upgraded brakes, performance exhaust, special cast aluminum wheels, monotone <b>paint,</b> <b>bucket</b> seats, and many other standard options came with the package. Chrome wheels were available on 2002 models. Some of the last models made in 2003 came with the new stampede lower body cladding package and chromed version of the original cast aluminum wheels at no extra charge.

5000|$|Time Magazine:An {{extremely}} funny 15-minute film, may {{be taken}} as a solemn leg-pull of the recent vogue for dribble-and-splotch painters, those athletic canvas-coverers whose style owes less to Van Gogh's brush technique than to Stan Laurel's custard pie stance. Or it {{may be taken}} as an explicit set of instructions for getting rich.The film, a first-time effort by three ex-admen, begins with a loving shot of wharfs, fishing shacks and sounding sea-the sort of vista once sketched avidly by artists and now appreciated chiefly by retired couples who tour Cape Cod in late September. The artist is a burly fellow (Ezra Reuben Baker), recognizably aesthetic in paint-smeared dungarees, scurrilous red sweater and combat boots. He trundles a cart filled with <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> along a dock, then throws an enormous sheet of wallboard down on a mud flat ten feet below.Soberly, with exquisite skill, using first a vigorous forehand, then a precisely executed backhand, the painter slops color from buckets. Clearly he is a master, for his stroke with the long-handled hoe is sure and strong, his touch with the dribble-stick more than Japanese in its delicacy. And when he fills a flare pistol with paint and fires the last accent of orange at his abstraction, he does not pull the trigger. He squeezes.When the thing dries, he hacks it up in random rectangles with a power saw, then carefully signs each fragment. A seaplane, labeled [...] "Galerie des Abstracts, Paris-New York," [...] touches down. A man debarks whose rich, dark overcoat obviously proclaims him an art dealer. He strokes his jaw as he examines the paintings, eventually selects a small one, shakes hands with the painter and takes off. Pleased with himself, the painter matter-of-factly shoves the remaining works of art into the ocean. This, as the screen truly proclaims, is the end.|$|R
60|$|It {{was soon}} after nine {{that the fire}} on, board the ORIENT broke out. Brueys was dead; he had {{received}} three wounds, yet would not leave his post: a fourth cut him almost in two. He desired not to be carried below, but {{to be left to}} die upon deck. The flames soon mastered his ship. Her sides had just been painted; and the oil-jars and <b>paint</b> <b>buckets</b> were lying on the poop. By the prodigious light of this conflagration, the situation of the two fleets could now be perceived, the colours of both being clearly distinguishable. About ten o'clock the ship blew up, with a shock which was felt to the very bottom of every vessel. Many of her officers and men jumped overboard, some clinging to the spars and pieces of wreck with which the sea was strewn, others swimming to escape from the destruction which they momently dreaded. Some were picked up by our boats; and some even in the heat and fury of the action were dragged into the lower ports of the nearest British ships by the British sailors. The greater part of her crew, however, stood the danger till the last, and continued to fire from the lower deck. This tremendous explosion was followed by a silence not less awful: the firing immediately ceased on both sides; and the first sound which broke the silence, was the dash of her shattered masts and yards, falling into the water from the vast height to which they had been exploded. It is upon record that a battle between two armies was once broken off by an earthquake. Such an event would be felt like a miracle; but no incident in war, produced by human means, has ever equalled the sublimity of this co-instantaneous pause, and all its circumstances.|$|R
25|$|Joan Miró {{was one of}} {{the first}} and most {{successful}} stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró's example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the Color Field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their <b>paint</b> in <b>buckets</b> or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.|$|R
