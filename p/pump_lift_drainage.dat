For the system pumps are set at heat (cold) source and on each branch, {{if the number of}} independent loops is less than the pumps, the equations of the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> have multiple solutions. When considering the constraint conditions, if we determine the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> of the first branch, others can be determined. For the system pumps are set on the main pipes, if we install pumps at heat (cold) source and on each main water supply and backwater pipes, and the pumps of a corresponding pair of main water supply and backwater pipes are the same, when the number of independent loops is equal to the <b>pump</b> <b>lifts,</b> the equations can have solutions. Furthermore, the method can also be applied for other systems where pumps are set on the main pipes, and the equations of the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> have a unique solution...|$|R

Multiple inlet (MI) irrigation represents a water saving alternative to conventional flood irrigation. This study uses simulation to calculate the range of monetary benefits to MI in rice production. Water savings from MI relative to conventional flood irrigation along with rice yields, rice prices, and prices for key production inputs (diesel and fertilizer) are simulated, and stochastic rice net returns above variable and fixed expenses are calculated for different <b>pump</b> <b>lifts</b> with and without MI. Monetary benefits to MI are measured as the difference in net returns with and without MI. The results indicate MI monetary benefits depend greatly on <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> and {{the presence or absence of}} a yield increase.

40|$|Cranberry growers manage {{water on}} bogs to ensure {{sufficient}} moisture and adequate drainage for optimum plant growth. Water management practices on cranberry bogs {{differ from those}} used for other forms of agriculture because {{of the variety of}} ways that water is used in cranberry culture. Water is used for disease and insect control, frost and heat protection, sanding, harvesting, and protection from winter desiccation and cold injury. Because of the periodic need for sizable amounts of water, impoundment of water adjacent to the bogs is a normal farming practice in cranberry production. In addition to storage ponds and sumps, components of a typical water management system for a cranberry bog include irrigation systems, wells, flood gates and flumes, <b>lift</b> <b>pumps,</b> and <b>drainage</b> ditches and pipes. Water can be used and re-used within a cranberry bog because its irrigation system and water storage reservoir are often interconnected. In some instances, water can also be recycled among growers. Therefore, water uses on cranberry bogs are not always consumptive. Newly established bogs, however, do require more irrigation to satisfy the needs of growing vines. Because cranberry culture typically is carried out in moist areas such as wetlands and marshes, irrigation needs are limited and comparatively small (averaging between 0. 4 and 1. 5 inches per week from rainfall and irrigation combined, during the growing season). Important environmental considerations directly related to water management include: 1) conservation of fresh water supplies; 2) prevention of contamination of surface and groundwater by pesticides, fertilizers, or sediments; 3) optimizing plant growth, yield, and resistance to pests and diseases...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary: The basic {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a finite-element {{computer}} model and give an dindependent appraisal of the reliability of the groundwater supply for the proposed Coastal Belt Water Project (CBWP_ Well Fields at Sarir and Tazerbo. There is no doubt that ample quantities of groundwater of acceptable quality occur at the sites selected for these well fields for the estimated 50 -year life of the project and longer. Of major concern is the predicted drawdown of wells and total <b>pumping</b> <b>lifts</b> throughout the 50 -year period. Excessive drawdowns could cause operating costs to become prohibitibely expensive. Average drawdown in wells not including well-field interference and hydraulic friction losses at the CBWP Well Field at Sarir is expected to be only about 30 m at the end of 50 years, but the static water level is relatively deep (56 m) which makes the total <b>pumping</b> <b>lift</b> fairly high when well-field interference and other losses are added. This optimistic estimate of drawdown is based upon computer analysis for almost 7 years of pumping history of the existing Sarir South agricultural well field nearby, where the subsurface geology is believed to be quite similar to that at the propsed CBWP Well Field at Sarir. The average dpumping lift, which includes many other factors besides aquifer drawdown, is estimated to be about 142 m. at the end of the 50 -year pumping period at Sarir and should average about 136 m during the 50 years. Interference from pumpage at the existing agricultural well fields at Sarir may be responsible for about 10 m of this predicted <b>pumping</b> <b>lift.</b> Drawdown at Tazerbo is predicted to be about 90 m. at the end of 50 years, but the static water level is only about 9 m. there. Consequently its average <b>pumping</b> <b>lift</b> should be about 133 m at the end of the 50 -year pumping period and should average about 118 m during the 50 years. no appreciable interference from nearby well fields is expected in the Tazerbo area based upon presently known conditions. Significatn reductions in <b>pumping</b> <b>lifts</b> at Tazerbo and in water-collection network costs at Sarir are possible by improved well field layout and well design.

The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump.</b> The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed air <b>lift</b> <b>pump.</b> Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design air <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer.
