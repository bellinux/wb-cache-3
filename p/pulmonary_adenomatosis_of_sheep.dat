The neoplasms were divided and tabulated into 8 groups according to body systems or tissue types. Out {{of a total of}} 673 neoplasms, 436 (64, 8 %) were cases <b>of</b> jaagsiekte (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis).</b> <b>Of</b> the remaining 237 neoplasms, 41, 3 % involved the skin. Eighty per cent of the cutaneous neoplasms were squamous cell carcinomas which varied from well-differentiated to anaplastic. The majority occurred on the head, in particular on the ears, frontal region and on the eyelids or nictitating membrane. Several factors have been suggested to explain the high incidence of squamous cell carcinomas on the head. Lymphosarcomas were the 3 rd most commonly encountered tumours, whilst a significant number of hepatocellular carcinomas also occurred. A variety of tumours of connective tissue origin were recorded, the most common of which arose from fibrous tissue and cartilage.

To determine the lymphoid target cells of JSRV, CD 4 + T cells, CD 8 + T cells, B lymphocytes, and adherent cell (macrophage/monocyte) populations were isolated from the mediastinal lymph nodes <b>of</b> naturally affected <b>sheep</b> and lambs inoculated with JSRV. Cells were enriched to high purity and then analyzed for JSRV proviral DNA by heminested PCR, and the proviral burden was quantitated by limiting dilution analysis. JSRV proviral DNA was found in all subsets examined but not in appropriate negative controls. In sheep naturally affected with SPA, JSRV proviral burden was greatest in the adherent cell population. In the nonadherent lymphocyte population, surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells contained the greatest proviral burden, while CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells contained the lowest levels of JSRV proviral DNA. In {{most of the cases}} (5 of 8), provirus also could be detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population.

In vivo transfection of three newborn lambs by intratracheal inoculation with pJSRV 21 DNA complexed with cationic lipids showed that pJSRV 21 is an infectious molecular clone. Viral DNA was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the transfected animals by a highly sensitive JSRV-U 3 heminested PCR at various time points ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months posttransfection. In addition, proviral DNA was detected in the PBMCs, lungs, and mediastinal lymph nodes of two lambs sacrificed 9 months posttransfection, but no macroscopic or histological SPA lesion was induced.

The results obtained indicate a thymocyte-dependent rejection of male cells in female recipients {{in contrast to the}} successful transplantation of male cells in male animals and female cells in both sexes. This suggests the presence of a surface antigen determined by the Y-chromosome in the tumour cells. A second mechanism of transmission, dependent on the transformation of the recipient's cells, was demonstrated by 2 cases of heterologous transplantation and confirmed by inoculation of cellular homogenatesThe articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|Erosive <b>adenomatosis</b> <b>of</b> {{the nipple}} {{is a rare}} benign {{neoplasm}} caused by a complex proliferation of the lactiferous ducts that affects primarily middle-aged women. Clinically, the differential diagnosis is breast carcinoma, Paget disease and galactophoric dilatation. A correct diagnosis is fundamental to avoid unnecessary major surgery, which can increase treatment morbidity and harm the patient. </span...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases and}} {{histological}} observations <b>of</b> erosive <b>adenomatosis</b> <b>of</b> the nipple {{are presented in}} detail, and {{the literature on the}} subject is reviewed. Erosive adenomatosis is a rare but clearly delineated pathology of the nipple and seems to be essentially benign. Careful clinical and histological examinations with complete investigation of the breast are required for the diagnosis. Nonmutilating curative surgery can be performed...|$|R
40|$|The main {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} the subacute spongiform encephalo-pathies are outlined; {{it is suggested that}} the group of diseases covered by the term "subacute spongiform encephalopathies " should be considered as distinct in their properties from other slow infections. The early experimental work in scrapie is briefly reviewed. Biochemical changes in brain that are characteristic of scrapie are summarized. Recent physicochemical studies of the properties of the scrapie agent are considered in relation to the biological nature of the scrapie agent. The repli-cation of the scrapie agent is discussed in terms of viral and membrane hypotheses of scrapie and in the light of recent genetic studies of mouse scapie. The concept of slow infections, which was first introduced by Sigurdsson [1], has been fruitful of much interesting research. However, Sigurdsson's concept was based largely on a study of a limited number of diseases prevalent in his native Iceland, and were he alive today it is probable that he would have wished to modify and extend his main criteria for distinguishing slow infections from acute and chronic disorders. He considered the main characteristics of slow infections to be: (1) an initial long period of incubation of many months or years without overt sign of clinical disease; (2) a rather regular, protracted clinical phase of the disease with serious sequelae, often death; and (3) limitation of infection to a single host species and localization of lesions within a single organ or tissue system. Sigurdsson's list of slow infections included <b>pulmonary</b> <b>adenomatosis,</b> maedi, visna, and scrapie (rida) <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> mam-mary carcinoma and leukemia of mice, avian lymphoblastosis, and the Rous sarcoma. Clearly the third criterion could not be applied to all these This paper was presented at the Ninth Annual Meetin...|$|R
40|$|A case {{of primary}} {{adenocarcinoma}} of the urinary bladder occurring {{in a patient}} with type 1 multiple endocrine adenomatosis (MEA) is presented. The patient was a 36 -year-old female who had a past history of type 1 multiple endocrine <b>adenomatosis,</b> namely, <b>adenomatosis</b> <b>of</b> the parathyroid gland, insulin and gastrin-producing <b>adenomatosis</b> <b>of</b> the pancreas, and prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma. She was admitted in January 1981 with the complaints of gross hematuria, pollakisuria and micturition pain lasting for about one year and a half. Cystoscopic examination revealed four solid tumors in the posterior and left lateral walls of the bladder with diffuse mucosal hyperemia. Biopsy of the tumors disclosed that they were adenocarcinoma. Clinical examinations revealed {{that there was no}} extravesical primary malignant neoplasm in this case. Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion by ileal conduit was performed on January 22, 1981. Histological examination revealed that the tumor was adenocarcinoma originating from the vesical mucosa. Follow-up for over three years since the time of surgery has not shown any sign of tumor recurrence or occurrence of extravesical malignant neoplasm. In addition, 28 cases of primary adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder in Japan reported during the last 25 years are reviewed and analyzed...|$|R
