50|$|An {{optical disk}} {{recorder}} encodes (or burns) data onto a recordable CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, or BD-R disc (called a blank) by selectively heating parts of an organic dye layer with a laser. This changes the reflectivity of the dye, thereby creating marks {{that can be}} read like the pits and lands on <b>pressed</b> <b>discs.</b> For recordable discs, the process is permanent and the media can be written to only once. While the reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The higher the writing speed, the less time a laser has to heat a point on the media, thus its power has to increase proportionally. DVD burners' lasers often peak at about 200 mW, either in continuous wave and pulses, although some have been driven up to 400 mW before the diode fails.|$|E
50|$|Portable players, more so {{portable}} CD players {{but also}} some portable DVD players, that invariably include an ASP feature (Anti-Skip-protection), struggle with CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW discs - due to the ASP feature being enabled. This {{is due to the}} limited read capability of such write-yourself media discs over retail <b>pressed</b> <b>discs.</b> It is widely believed that the buffer system of the ASP feature conflicts with the limited read capability of such discs. This conflict affects the re-writable formats more so than the write once formats, but can be prevalent with both. It is therefore advisable that if you use write-yourself media often, to look for a portable player that allows ASP to be enabled/disabled. As such read issues are invariably non-existent when the ASP feature is disabled. Using slow burning speeds and high-quality media also helps.|$|E

50|$|However, {{players who}} were using HD Advance 2.0 retail <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> (CD or DVD) to format a Maxtor hard disk with 80 GB {{capacity}} and subsequently use the disc to play PS2 games from the HDD were reported experiencing a strange problem. HD Loader versions up to 0.7c boot up perfectly via the Independence Exploit but subsequent versions of HD Loader from 0.8 onwards freezes on the splash screen and refuses to start up if formatted with a HD Advance disc. This is possibly due to newer patches {{that are not in}} any HD Advance discs;a solution is to reformat the hard disk with HD Loader version 0.8 or higher, which is recommended for newer PS2 games. However, this is not confirmed to work 100% across the board as certain PS2 models (mainly PAL 7xxx consoles) was reported to still freeze at splash screen; a currently-unfixable problem related to HD Loader version 0.8 or higher on PAL single-port network adapter models was the main problem.|$|E
5000|$|For quality control, {{both the}} stamper and the moulded discs are tested before a {{production}} run. Samples of the disc (test pressings) are taken during long production runs and tested for quality consistency. <b>Pressed</b> <b>discs</b> are analyzed on a signal analysis machine. The metal stamper {{can also be}} tested on a signal analysis machine which has been specially adapted (larger diameter, more fragile, ...). The machine will [...] "play" [...] the disc or stamper and measure various physical and electrical parameters. Errors can be introduced at every step of production, but the moulding process is the least subject to adjustment. Sources of errors are more readily identified and compensated for during mastering. If the errors are too severe then the stamper is rejected and a replacement installed. An experienced machine operator can interpret the report from the analysis system and optimise the moulding process to make a disc that meets the required Rainbow Book specification (e.g. Red Book for Audio from the Rainbow Books series).|$|E
50|$|Instantaneous discs are {{so called}} {{because they can}} be played {{immediately}} after recording without any further processing, unlike the delicate wax master discs which had to be plated and replicated as pressings before they could be played non-destructively. By late 1929, instantaneous recordings were being made by indenting, as opposed to engraving, a groove into the surface of a bare aluminum disc. The sound quality of these discs was inadequate for broadcast purposes, but they were made for sponsors and performers who wanted to have recordings of their broadcasts, a luxury which was impractically expensive to provide by the wax mastering, plating and pressing procedure. Only a very few pre-1930 live broadcasts were deemed important enough to preserve as pressings, and many of the bare aluminum discs perished in the scrap metal drives of World War II, so that these early years of radio are mostly known today by the syndicated programs on <b>pressed</b> <b>discs,</b> typically recorded in a small studio without an audience, rather than by recordings of live network and local broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} “crystal engineering” of the {{solid-state}} behaviour {{of a series}} of alkali metal TCNQ salts. This can exhibit a variety of electronic and magnetic properties, depending on the solid-state architecture. TCNQ is a good one-electron acceptor and the resulting radical anion salt is quite stable. The architectural behaviour of TCNQ salts is very dependent {{on the nature of the}} counter-cation and the stoichiometry of the material. In the present study, the effect of ionophore-encapsulation of the cation (M = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) has been explored using single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR, Raman, EPR and <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> conductivity measurements. In addition, the effect of changing the ionophore:metal cation ratio and the presence of additional TCNQ 0 has been investigated. 25 new crystal structures have been obtained and analysed in detail and this has grown new insight into the impact of the effect of controlling ion pair interactions through ionophore complexation and of steric factors on the nature of TCNQ assemblies adopted. A range of solid-state motifs have been observed including some novel solid-state behaviour. In addition, the solid-state behaviour of two hydrated lanthanide TCNQ salts has been investigated...|$|E

In all the cases, the presence of three surface terminations, O, OH and F, in addition to OH-terminations relatively strongly bonded to H 2 O molecules, was confirmed. From XPS peak fits, {{it was possible to}} establish the average sum of the negative charges of the terminations for the aforementioned MXenes.

40|$|We {{report the}} effect of rank and lithotype on the {{wettability}} of coal in microfluidic experiments in two types of artificial microchannels: (1) reactive ion etched (RIE) channels and (2) die-cast channels prepared by pressing powdered lithotype concentrates. Five coals from the Bowen Basin with ranks in the R% range 0. 98 – 1. 91 % were examined. Contact angles and entry pressures of air and water in the artificial cleats were measured in imbibition experiments performed with a Cleat Flow Cell (CFC). The relative contact angles measured in CFC imbibition experiments were in the range 110 – 140 ° in the RIE channels and 85 °– 115 ° in the <b>pressed</b> <b>discs,</b> which are larger contact angles than measured on the flat bulk surfaces of these samples by the conventional sessile drop technique (58 °– 85 °). The CFC observations also show the surface roughness of coal in inertinite-rich dull bands effects contact angle and the entry pressure of the air-water interface differently to the vitrinite-rich bright bands. Drainage experiments in the CFC revealed a thin residual water film on the inertinite cleat wall, yet not on the smooth vitrinite channel. The experimental observations are used to present a modified Cassie Equation model to predict coal contact angles based on the fractions of dull and bright bands, mineral content, and cleat surface roughness.

Infra-red spectra of pure coals are studied, both as <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> and thin films, and a method for the preparation of these discs and films is given.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Cost-effective capture and storage of solar energy still remains a challenge facing broad-based implementation of this renewable technology. Work at the South African Research Chairs Initiatives (SARChI), Chair in Carbon Materials and Technology at the University of Pretoria is aimed at developing materials from cheap, local carbon sources for solar thermal applications. The focus is split on developing composites for both solar energy capture and thermal energy storage. Preliminary investigations are based on systems designed to provide heating needs like hot water through solar energy. Two different approaches to the capture of solar energy were explored. Firstly the use of carbon black and expanded graphite <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> and secondly the production of mesophase based graphitic foams. The carbon black discs demonstrated the ability to reach a peak collector temperature of around 70 °C whilst providing approximately 4 kW. hr per m 2 per day. The foam with the best capture had an efficiency calculated at around 95 %. This is based on measured incoming radiation converted into sensible heating of the water. Phase change materials present an efficient and innovative {{solution to the problem}} of thermal energy storage. These materials suffer from a major drawback due to their low thermal conductivity. Two alternatives were explored for enhancing this property. Firstly the direct incorporation of phase change material into expanded graphite was tested. A variety of loadings were explored. It was found that at low concentrations of 6 mass % the time required for the sample to undergo the phase transition could be reduced by 70 % for heating and 85 % for cooling. Beyond this point the decrease in phase transition time diminishes. Ongoing work is also being done to explore the use of highly conductive sheets manufactured from roller-pressed expanded graphite. Unfortunately these sheets suffer from structural integrity issues which are being optimized. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on the pressure-less sintering of the ZrC> 2 - Y 2 O 3 system that contains 3 mol% Y 2 O 3, and {{the effect that the}} temperature / time relationship has on the properties of the final product. Experiments were performed on two types of commercially available, nano-sized, ZrC> 2 - 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 (3 Y-TZP) powders. An unstabilised zirconia powder was also investigated for comparison purposes. Particle size analysis of these powder yield particle sizes ranging from 1. 29 |xm to 1. 78 pm, suggesting that the particles are heavily prone to agglomeration in water. BET specific surface area analysis showed the powders to be nano-sized as determined using equivalent spherical diameter theory. The density of the powders was measured using helium gas pycnometry. DTA/TGA analysis indicates that binder burnout occurs on heating in the range 300 - 440 °C. Shrinkage and densification rate characteristics of the powders during sintering was investigated using dilatometry. One of the powders demonstrated full shrinkage during isothermal sintering; the other did not. The point of maximum densification rate differed by approximately 100 °C for these powders. A dramatic expansion associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation on cooling from 1400 °C is observed by dilatometry for unstabilised zirconia powder sample but not for stabilised powder samples. This indicates that the sintered samples retain in tetragonal phase on cooling to room temperature. Pressureless conventional sintering and two-step sintering were used to sinter <b>pressed</b> <b>discs.</b> The density of discs which were sintered across a temperature range of 1350 °C to 1550 °C varies between 5. 72 g/cm 3 and 6. 03 g/cm 3, corresponding to 97. 40 % and 99. 10 % of theoretical density respectively. Density as high as 98. 85 % of theoretical was recorded for twostep sintering applying holding time of 16 h. Vickers hardness values increased with increasing sintering temperature. Fracture toughness measurements were carried out. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that sintered discs were fully tetragonal. Microstructural analysis of sintered samples was conducted to assess microstructural changes with respect to sintering temperature...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in processing technologies {{which can lead}} to more energy efficient sintering of metal powders. The use of microwave sintering in particular leads to reduced energy usage during sintering as the volumetric heating process is considerably more efficient compared with resistance heating. In this study the use of a novel plasma microwave processing technology for the sintering of nickel powder discs is evaluated. The sintering study was carried out on 20 mm diameter by 2 mm thick <b>pressed</b> <b>discs</b> of nickel powder, with mean particle size of 1 μm. The discs were fired in a 5 cm diameter microwave (2. 45 GHz) plasma ball under a hydrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 2 kPa. The same discs were also sintered using both non plasma microwave and tube furnace firing. The microwave plasma sintering is very rapid with full disc strength of approx. 1000 N based on 3 [...] point bend tests being achieved within 10 minutes. In contrast the sintering time in the tube furnace involved treatments of up to 6 hours. The non plasma microwave system involved intermediate treatment periods of 1 to 2 hours. Another advantage of the microwave plasma treatment is that the degree of sintering between the individual nickel powder particles can be precisely controlled by the duration of the treatment time in the plasma. There was a broadly linear increase in fired pellet breaking strength with plasma treatment duration. In addition to breaking load, the mechanical properties of the sintered nickel discs were compared based on Rockwell hardness tests and density measurements. The morphology of the sintered discs was compared using microscopy and SEM. This study demonstrated that the plasma microwave sintered discs produced similar or superior performance (depending on processing conditions) to discs fired using the non-plasma microwave and furnace firing conditions. Accurate control of the sample conditions and structure can easily be controlled with the plasma system compared with the conventional systems. The apparent volumetric heating in the microwave systems give a more uniform heating at lower temperatures and allows for greater control and homogeneity...|$|E
