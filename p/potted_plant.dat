5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, <b>potted</b> <b>plant,</b> but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E

40|$|Flowering or foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are {{ornamental}} items usually {{grown in}} greenhouses under optimal growing conditions. Cultivation in protected environments allows for rapid growth and high quality characteristics. When plants reach the desired commercial size {{they can be}} transferred to hardening greenhouses or directly sent to the distribution chain. The growing and post-production conditions such as storage and transportation can have very deleterious effects on the ornamental quality of plants. The major post-production disorders are bud and flower abscission in flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> or leaf abscission or yellowing in foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, the ornamental quality of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is extremely important and depends on the number and colour of flowers or leaves, flower, leaf and plant longevity. The presence of flowers on flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> depends on flower longevity and turnover. The colour and size of leaves of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> is linked to pre- and post-production environmental conditions. The post-production quality losses of flowering <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> can be mainly ascribed to natural flower senescence. This phenomenon is highly regulated by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid, but the post-production environment can dramatically influence plant hormone equilibrium. Quality losses of foliage <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> are mainly due to leaf senescence usually associated with inadequate acclimatization from the production area to the post-production chain...|$|R

All treatments were applied to one-year-old needles located on the main leader of the <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> There were three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone for each treatment, such that all treatments were replicated three times, with three experimental units per clone (three clones x three <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> of each clone).|$|R
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is {{a common}} snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In {{southern}} parts of Thailand, they are reported {{to hide in the}} thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be certain to be relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even curled up in a <b>potted</b> <b>plant.</b> When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the demand for <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for interior decoration at various points of sale in Poznan. The results were based on questionnaires filled by clients of three retail sale points with pot plants: flower shop, horticultural centre and building material market in Poznan and its surroundings. Collected information was analysed for a frequency of purchases, amount of money spent on <b>pot</b> <b>plants,</b> place of purchases, occasions for which plant was bought, preferences of buyers and pattern of purchases. Customers purchase plants in various points of sale from 7 to 9 <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> per year, mostly in horticultural centres and in spring. Plants are used for interior decoration and are cultivated for many years, however cut flowers are more often chosen for a gift than <b>pot</b> <b>plants.</b> Whereas a significant part of building material market customers cultivate flowers <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a short time, and they buy <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a gift as often as cut flowers. Among plants with flowers Phalaenopsis and Anthurium are selected most frequently, and Zamioculcas and Yucca among plants with decorative foliage. While choosing plants, buyers are guided by the overall appearance and price. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing indoor {{heat gain}} from the roof into the {{building}} means reducing the cooling energy consumption of air conditioning system hence increase indoor comfort. Apart from its high initial installation cost, green roof is proven {{to be the best}} way in dealing with the issue of indoor heat gain in a building thus contributes in reducing urban heat island effect. Green roof also called eco-roof or vegetated roof is described as a roof that is planted with specific vegetation above a waterproofing membrane. A study in Malaysia suggested that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an alternative to more economic green roof and its potential in dealing with indoor heat gain needs further exploration. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> are plants grown in containers or <b>pots</b> instead of <b>planting</b> them in the ground. This study investigated the potential of <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> as an affordable alternative tool to green roof application in reducing indoor temperature in tropical climate regions. Four similar test cells equipped with data acquisition system were built. Each top of the cell is treated with four different design variables; <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> vegetated, non-vegetated 150 mm depth soil layer and a bare top surface. Indoor peak heat value and lowest value were recorded and analyzed. At heat peak hour, <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> managed to reduce a daily average of 8. 7 % indoor heat gain whereas vegetation cell only managed to reduce an average of 7. 9 % indoor heat gain. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> were also found to reduce a daily average of 35. 5 % of total heat transfer amount compared to 28. 5 % in vegetated cell. Based on these results <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> appear to offer an alternative strategy towards reducing indoor temperature. In conclusion, this study suggests that <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> could provide an affordable way especially to urban population in their strategy to deal with the high energy consumption for coolin...|$|R

Cerone and Rosenberg have written two previous episodes each, while this episode marked Cuesta's fifth time returning as director. Guest stars in this episode include Geoff Pierson, C. S. Lee, Mark Pellegrino, Christian Camargo, Judith Scott and Scott Atkinson. Rudy's apartment was set in Miami, Florida, however filming took place in Long Beach, California. The apartment was a brown, triangular apartment condo, so the producers altered its appearance; a false brick wall was {{placed in front of}} the garage entrance and a door was created. The producers also concealed a narrow door of the garage entrance with a <b>potted</b> <b>plant,</b> and added false window panes to the windows, concealing the existing vertical blinds. The shipping yard shown in the episode was set in the Port of Miami, yet filming took place in a port dock at the Port of Los Angeles.

2500|$|The copious seeds store well if kept dry. In climates or seasons that cannot {{provide the}} cold, damp period of {{stratification}} {{required by the}} seeds for germination, growers mimic this condition by placing the seeds in a refrigerator for 2–6 weeks, depending on species. [...] The seeds are sown {{on the surface of}} their substrate and germinate when transferred to warmer, bright conditions. Sarracenia seedlings all look alike for the first two or three years; the plants reach maturity after four or five years. [...] Regular fertilization (twice a month between April and September) with a balanced fertilizer at the rate of 1 teaspoon per gallon (using a 15-16-17 peat-lite or similar fertilizer) will speed their growth and time to maturity. [...] It is advisable to leach regularly with pure water to prevent the buildup of solutes (fertilizer salts) in the soil.

60|$|To {{ascertain}} {{more precisely}} what {{amount of movement}} each internode underwent, I kept a <b>potted</b> <b>plant,</b> during the night and day, in a well-warmed room to which I was confined by illness. A long shoot projected beyond {{the upper end of}} the supporting stick, and was steadily revolving. I then took a longer stick and tied up the shoot, so that only a very young internode, 1.75 of an inch in length, was left free. This was so nearly upright that its revolution could not be easily observed; but it certainly moved, and the side of the internode which was at one time convex became concave, which, as we shall hereafter see, is a sure sign of the revolving movement. I will assume that it made at least one revolution during the first twenty-four hours. Early the next morning its position was marked, and it made a second revolution in 9 hrs.; during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker, and the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over 3 hrs. As on the succeeding morning I found that the shoot revolved in 2 hrs. 45 m., it must have made during the night four revolutions, each at the average rate of a little over 3 hrs. I should add that the temperature of the room varied only a little. The shoot had now grown 3.5 inches in length, and carried at its extremity a young internode 1 inch in length, which showed slight changes in its curvature. The next or ninth revolution was effected in 2 hrs. 30 m. From this time forward, the revolutions were easily observed. The thirty-sixth revolution was performed at the usual rate; so was the last or thirty-seventh, but it was not completed; for the internode suddenly became upright, and after moving to the centre, remained motionless. I tied a weight to its upper end, so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement; but there was none. Some time before the last revolution was half performed, the lower part of the internode ceased to move.|$|E
