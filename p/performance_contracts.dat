25|$|Crespin {{was born}} in Marseille in 1927. She moved to Nîmes with her family {{at the age of}} five and her parents opened a large shoe store in that city which they ran for many years. Crespin's {{childhood}} was not an easy one, being affected both by growing up during World War II and her mother's alcoholism. She initially intended to be a pharmacist but was prevented in pursuing this path after failing to pass her Baccalauréat at the age of 16. Up to this point her father had not allowed her to study singing. However, as her career path was limited by the exam results he finally allowed her to start taking lessons for purely pragmatic reasons. She went on to win first prize in a singing competition a few years later, and, at the age of nineteen, she went to Paris to study at the Conservatoire de Paris in the classes of Suzanne Cesbon-Viseur and Georges Jouatte. Four years later, in 1950, she was awarded first prize in the school's onstage competitions for opera and opéra comique and second prize in the school's singing competition. Traditionally past winners of Conservatoire's competitions were offered <b>performance</b> <b>contracts</b> with the Opéra National de Paris, but Crespin was for some unknown reason not offered one. This created a somewhat tenuous relationship between Crespin and her country's musical establishment which extended into the early portion of her career.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{phenomenon}} {{is the concept}} of combining the benefits of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> with the benefits of green buildings, affectionately described as green <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> The reason the concept makes sense is because for green buildings, the costliest pre-requisites to meet are usually the energy efficiency requirements. The LEED rating system requires buildings to be benchmarked using the EPA EnergyStar system. The minimum score to meet the LEED prerequisites is a score of 75 or greater (meaning the building is in the top 75 percentile of benchmarked buildings).

[...] Government subsidies including agricultural subsidies were eliminated; import regulations were loosened up; the exchange rate was floated; and controls on interest rates, wages, and prices were removed; and personal rates of taxation were reduced. Tight monetary policy and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987. The deregulation of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s reduced government's role in the economy and permitted the retirement of some public debt.|$|E

DATA SOURCES AND COLLECTION: From the Maine Addiction Treatment System (MATS), an admission and discharge data set collected by the Maine Office of Substance Abuse (OSA). The MATS data for this study include information on clients of programs receiving public funding from October 1, 1989 through June 30, 1994. Additional data are drawn from the contracts between the state and providers, and from service delivery reports submitted to OSA. STUDY DESIGN: Client-level performance measures were calculated directly from MATS using OSA's formulas and standards, and then aggregated to the treatment program level. Multivariate regression analysis was done for each performance indicator as a dependent variable with <b>performance</b> <b>contracting,</b> time, extent of state funding, and provider characteristics as independent variables. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Performance</b> <b>contracting</b> is positively related to better performance for effectiveness indicators overall. Individual effectiveness indicators that showed improvement include drug use indicators (abstinence and reduction in use) and social functioning indicators. In addition, <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> is associated with an increase in efficiency performance, defined as delivery of the contracted amount of service, for agencies that depend heavily on OSA for funding. Finally, <b>performance</b> <b>contracting</b> appears unrelated to the special populations indicators that measure services to target populations that OSA considers harder to treat. CONCLUSIONS: There is tentative evidence of a relationship between provider performance and the introduction of <b>performance</b> <b>contracting.</b> More definite conclusions await more detailed analyses of client-level data...|$|R
