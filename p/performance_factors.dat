40|$|Grids [3] {{have emerged}} as {{paradigms}} {{for the next generation}} parallel and distributed computing. Computational Grid can be defined as large-scale high-performance distributed computing environments that provide access to high-end computational resources. Grid scheduling is the process of scheduling jobs over grid resources. Improving overall system performance with a lower turnaround time is an important objective of Local Grid scheduling. In this paper a <b>Performance</b> <b>Factor</b> Based Local Scheduling Algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm priority for each subtask in the Grid is assigned based on two new parameters, Computational Complexity and <b>Performance</b> <b>Factor.</b> The algorithm classifies the subtasks into high, medium and low categories based on their priority. The value for <b>performance</b> <b>factor</b> is assigned based on the value of processing power of each node i. e. Number of operations per cycle per processor and the number of instructions processed per second. The subtasks are then mapped to respective processors based on the assigned priority for execution. A subtask, which requires a very high <b>performance</b> <b>factor</b> and that exhibits high computational complexity, is given a high priority. Prioritizing the subtasks in this way can improve the performance of grid resources that in turn improve the overall efficiency of the computational grid. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated through simulation results. 1...|$|R

Several changes {{were made in the}} operation of the system during the three year period. During 1979 - 1980, the use of on-peak purchased energy was minimized by charging the pebble bin in the off-peak period with a resistance duct heater.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{represents}} the heat transfer optimization of two-dimensional incompressible laminar flow of Al 2 O 3 -water nanofluids in a duct with uniform temperature corrugated walls. A two phase model {{is applied to}} investigate different governing parameters, namely: Reynolds number (100  ≤ Re ≤  1000), nonofluids volume fraction (0 % ≤ ϕ ≤  5 %) and amplitude of the wavy wall (0  ≤ α ≤  0. 04  m). For optimization process, a recent spot-lighted method, called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, is applied, {{and the results are}} shown to be in a good accuracy in comparison with another well-known heuristic method, i. e. particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results indicate that the effect of utilizing nanoparticles and increasing Reynolds number is more intensified on growing the average Nusselt number than variations of the amplitude of the wavy wall. To prevent the worst possible heat transfer, the specific amplitude which leads to a minimum average Nusselt number is detected. The effect of using nanoparticles on thermal-hydraulic <b>performance</b> <b>factor</b> (j/f) is presented which considers both heat transfer and hydrodynamics aspects. The results showed that volume fraction has a direct and the wavy wall's amplitude has a converse effect on the thermal-hydraulic <b>performance</b> <b>factor.</b> Furthermore, an optimum value for Reynolds number is found to maximize the thermal-hydraulic <b>performance</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R
