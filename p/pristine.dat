5|$|The {{interior}} was refurbished in 1955. The exterior had been cleaned {{every year since}} the fire station opened, {{and as a result}} was in <b>pristine</b> condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956.|$|E
5|$|While most {{pesticide}} {{effects are}} likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the Sierra Nevada mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into <b>pristine</b> areas, including Yosemite National Park in California.|$|E
5|$|Alexander S. Lloyd, {{a student}} of Dickinson College, focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas. Lloyd studied in detail the {{variation}} in crystal sizes from the edge <b>pristine</b> pillow lava, which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the Pleistocene period.|$|E
5|$|Censorship {{and musical}} rights issues kept a complete, <b>pristine</b> version of Witchfinder General from being {{released}} on videotape, laserdisc or DVD for many years. Although uncensored theatrical prints {{have been available}} for archival showings in the US for several years, video releases of the title were repeatedly compromised.|$|E
5|$|Gaps between {{lava flows}} were {{sometimes}} {{cut off from}} surrounding vegetation. These literal islands of habitat are called kīpukas, a Hawaiian name used for older land surrounded by younger lava. Carey Kīpuka is one such area in the southernmost part of the monument and {{is used as a}} benchmark to measure how plant cover has changed in less <b>pristine</b> parts of southern Idaho.|$|E
5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in <b>pristine</b> sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 another <b>pristine</b> {{underwater}} wreck {{was located}} during {{a survey by}} the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. Two years later it was conclusively identified as the gundalow Spitfire; this site was listed on the National Register in 2008, and it has been named as part of the U.S. government's Save America's Treasures program.|$|E
5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a <b>pristine</b> target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely <b>pristine,</b> due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, <b>pristine</b> lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and <b>pristine</b> area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy supply {{is some of the}} cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in <b>pristine</b> forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most <b>pristine</b> tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{an almost}} <b>pristine</b> {{ecosystem}} and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} <b>pristine</b> clouds of {{primordial}} gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2, {{which does}} not have a set {{timetable}} for construction, is planned to extend service from 96th Street to 125th Street. During Phase 2, both East Harlem segments, between 99th Street and 105th Street, and between 110th Street and 120th Street will be connected, modified, and used for normal train service. In 2007, the MTA reported that the segments were in <b>pristine</b> condition. Under the approved plan, the MTA estimates to complete Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029, by which the Q and rush-hour N trains will be extended to 125th Street.|$|E
5|$|Sangay {{is one of}} two active volcanoes {{located within}} the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's {{isolation}} has allowed it to maintain a <b>pristine</b> ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a <b>pristine</b> print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of <b>pristine</b> wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E
5|$|The {{only two}} {{houses in the}} United States—from the English colonial period (1607–1776)—that can be {{definitively}} attributed to designs from the Four Books of Architecture are architect William Buckland's Hammond-Harwood House (1774) in Annapolis, Maryland, and Thomas Jefferson's first Monticello. The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at Montagnana (Book II, Chapter XIV), {{and for the first}} Monticello (1770) the design source is Villa Cornaro at Piombino Dese (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and <b>pristine</b> example of direct modeling in America today.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} area {{is dominated by}} mainly conifer forest, with broad-leafed birch and alder woods {{on some of the}} steeper banks and streams. An early 20th century analysis of vegetation cover in Kajaani county recorded 385 different species of vascular plants. Talaskangas Nature Reserve, with nearly <b>pristine</b> natural forest and about 50 different wildlife species, is in the Vieremä and Sonkajärvi local area. Logging was planned in the 1980s, but environmental activists prevented exploitation through lobbying. The reserve was formally established in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{inspired}} by Jacques-Louis David's series of five Napoleon Crossing the Alps paintings (1801–1805). David's works also show Napoleon's journey through the Great St. Bernard Pass, but there are significant stylistic {{differences between the two}} conceptions. Delaroche's Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David's wears a <b>pristine</b> uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to paint a realistic portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.|$|E
5|$|We {{are pleased}} the President recognizes the near <b>pristine</b> {{condition}} of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands waters. We believe the abundance and biodiversity of the area attests to the successful management of the NWHI fisheries by the Council the past 30 years and indicates that properly regulated fisheries can operate in the NWHI without impacting the ecosystem. The small NWHI bottomfish fishery has not and would not jeopardize {{the protection of the}} NWHI that President Bush is pursuing by designating the area a national monument.|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust {{have been found in}} <b>pristine</b> condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park is the {{centerpiece}} of the 20million acre/31,250square-mile (8,093,712ha/80,937km2) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes Grand Teton National Park, adjacent National Forests and expansive wilderness areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped <b>pristine</b> land in the continental United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. With the successful wolf reintroduction program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in <b>pristine</b> condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of <b>pristine</b> basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a <b>pristine</b> {{rainforest}} free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E
5|$|Dugan {{made his}} first sound effects {{recordings}} to augment his theatrical sound designs. As he grew more interested in field recording, he was attracted to the sounds found in <b>pristine</b> natural settings—environments without human noise. A board member and webmaster of Nature Sounds Society, Dugan has conducted equipment training sessions since 1994, and has given talks about his experiences in nature recording. He has traveled to New Zealand in pursuit of recordings, but mainly devotes himself to U.S. National Parks and Monuments such as Yosemite and Muir Woods. Other national parks and monuments at which he has recorded sound include Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Lassen Volcanic, Yellowstone, Haleakala, Olympic, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lava Beds.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique <b>pristine</b> natural beauty. In October 1900 he {{purchased}} 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E
5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring <b>pristine</b> undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, <b>pristine</b> state of the booting medium.|$|E
5|$|Pressed by Franklin's wife, Jane, Lady Franklin, and others, the Admiralty {{launched}} {{a search for}} the missing expedition in 1848. Prompted in part by Franklin's fame and the Admiralty's offer of a finder's reward, many subsequent expeditions joined the hunt, which at one point in 1850 involved eleven British and two American ships. Several of these ships converged off the east coast of Beechey Island, where the first relics of the expedition were found, including the graves of three crewmen. In 1854, explorer John Rae, while surveying near the Canadian Arctic coast southeast of King William Island, acquired relics of and stories about the Franklin party from local Inuit. A search led by Francis Leopold McClintock in 1859 discovered a note left on King William Island with details about the expedition's fate. Searches continued through much of the 19thcentury. In 2014, a Canadian search team led by Parks Canada located the wreck of Erebus west of O'Reilly Island, in the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, in the waters of the Arctic archipelago. Finally, two years later, the wreck of Terror was found south of King William Island in <b>pristine</b> condition by the Arctic Research Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The most known {{weathering}} scale, {{used for}} ordinary chondrites, ranges from W0 (<b>pristine</b> state) to W6 (heavy alteration).|$|E
25|$|The <b>pristine</b> {{volcanic}} mineralogy of komatiites {{is composed}} of forsteritic olivine (Fo90 and upwards), calcic and often chromian pyroxene, anorthite (An85 and upwards) and chromite.|$|E
25|$|Balaclava {{was listed}} {{in a book}} on ghost towns by Ron Brown. Although it makes Balaclava sound like a <b>pristine,</b> deserted ghost town, {{actually}} it still has a few residents.|$|E
