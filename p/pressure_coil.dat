40|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} a dialyzer is {{the volume of the}} extracorporeal circuit and its component parts. Reported coil volumes have often been measured with ultrafilterable aqueous solutions [1, 2]. Descriptions of coil volumes (including those packaged with commercial coils) may not specify whether volumes listed include tubing [1 – 3]. Reported coil volumes have been related to variables such as blood flow rate or outlet pressure [2, 3] rather than to mean intracoil hydrostatic <b>coil</b> <b>pressure</b> (MCP), with which we have found coil volume to be more highly correlated. It is generally not clear whether the volume measurement was made in {{the presence or absence of}} dialysate flow, thus neglecting the effects of dialysate hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> on <b>coil</b> distensibility at any given MCP. As a result of these many differences in technique, there has been no common reference with which to compare the operating extracorporeal blood volumes of available coil types.

The straight channel requires the lowest pressure drop among all cases; whereas the coiled tube designs require more than double the pressure drop of the straight channel.

The report explains the theory of etching and the methods involved. The work beginswith calculations and simulations of the etching processes. The chosen etch techniqueutilizes so called microloading and reactive ion etching lag effects, which essentially arephenomena where the etch rate can be adjusted by breaking up mask features intosubpatterns, and the etch depth for a given recipe and time can be made to differlocally. The subpatterns consisted of very small rectangles and triangles withalternating concentration. Five different recipes for the reactive ion etching weretried, where the coil power, platen power, pressure, temperature and time wasvaried. Etch rates could be made to differ locally depending on the concentration ofsubpatterns within the mask feature. The etch rates were also affected by the recipeparameters such as coil power, platen power, and <b>pressure.</b> High <b>coil</b> and platenpower increased the etch rate, while high pressure reduced the etch rate.

Fabrications of such Microsystems requires the ability to engineer precise three-dimensional structures in the silicon substrate. Fabrication of MEMS faces multiple technological challenges before it can become a commercially viable technology. One key fabrication process required is the deep silicon etching for forming high aspect ratio structures. There is an increasing interest in the use of dry plasma etching for this application because of its anisotropic etching behavior, high etch speed, good uniformity and profile control, high aspect ratio capabilities without having any undesired secondary effects i. e. RIE lags, Loading, microloading, loosing of anisotropic nature of etching as aspect ratio increases, micro-grass and even etch stalling.

50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under <b>pressure</b> through <b>coils</b> or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|R

The complex geometry of finned tube heat exchangers leads to uneven wall and air temperature distribution inside the coil, and causes variations of frost growth rate and densification along the coil. In this study, a general distributed model with frost formation was developed. The equations for finned tube heat exchanger were derived in non-steady-state manner and quasi-steady state in the frost model. In order to make the model more realistic, the variation of frost along fin due to uneven temperature distribution was included. The presented model is able to predict the dynamic behavior of an air cooler both under non-frost and frost condition.

Such developments thus require review and consideration for new and/or improved heat exchanger manufacturing techniques. Experimental and analytical study of a pressure expansion approach {{as compared to the}} more conventional mechanical expansion process was conducted to evaluate the impact of manufacturing method on heat exchanger performance. This included visual inspection and comparison of heat exchangers manufactured using pressure expansion and mechanical expansion, physical testing of heat exchanger strength and construction, measurement of heat exchanger dimensions, and physical testing of heat transfer performance. Â Multiple heat exchangers were constructed and evaluated using both the mechanical and pressure expansion methods. Consistency between coils was maintained in order to isolate the manufacturing method, to the extent possible, for comparison purposes. Visual inspection of compared coils and past research (Lee et al., 2014; Kraft and Jamison, 2012) suggest that pressure expansion improves the contact between the expanded tube and the fin, providing the potential to improve heat transfer performance. Visual inspection also suggests that pressure expansion produces less deformation of any internal tube enhancements, maximizing the potential to improve heat transfer performance from the use of such tubes. Â Physical measurements of the tube expansion diameter throughout the construction of a heat exchanger expanded using the pressure expansion process proved that the pressure expansion method delivers a more consistent tube diameter.
