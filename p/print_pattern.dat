40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 58) Very {{little information}} is available concerning the reception of <b>printed</b> <b>patterns</b> by women who sew. After a brief discussion {{of the importance of}} <b>printed</b> <b>patterns,</b> pattern history, and the scope of the current pattern industry, a questionnaire was analyzed. The hypotheses established for this study were: 1. There are differences in opinions and attitudes among women who sew concerning <b>printed</b> <b>patterns.</b> 2. There are differences among women who sew concerning purchasing and use behavior related to <b>printed</b> <b>patterns.</b> A total of two hundred and thirty-five questionnaires were returned and computed, resulting in acceptance of both hypotheses. Although most women indicated use of <b>printed</b> <b>patterns</b> for the majority of their sewing, other purchase and use behavior, such as the number and type of patterns purchased, length of time kept, pattern features used, and methods of pattern selection and use, varied greatly. The women participating in this survey expressed general satisfaction with <b>printed</b> <b>patterns.</b> Regardless of this approval, however, they had many differing opinions concerning such factors as simplicity of directions, styles currently offered, fit and sizing, and the physical make ??? up of <b>printed</b> <b>patterns.</b> Recommendations made for pattern changes and/or improvements were considered...|$|R
40|$|Papercraft {{models can}} serve as {{inexpensive}} prototypes in shape design applications. However, in making the models some geometric detail is necessarily lost, and artificial creases may be visible, thereby limiting the utility of these models. To compensate for these practical limitations, we introduce the use of <b>printed</b> <b>patterns</b> on papercraft models to enhance {{the perception of the}} shape they are intended to represent. We propose pattern generation schemes that modulate the sizes, directions, and densities of glyphs of patterns based on geometric attributes. We present a psychophysical experiment designed to explore the effect that <b>printed</b> <b>patterns</b> have on the perception of the papercraft model shapes. We find that models with <b>printed</b> <b>patterns</b> are perceived to represent the intended shape more accurately, and, further, that the type of <b>printed</b> <b>pattern</b> has an impact on the perceived shape...|$|R

50|$|A {{main loop}} executes for each {{line of the}} input stream, {{evaluating}} the sed script on each line of the input. Lines of a sed script are each a pattern-action pair, indicating what pattern to match and which action to perform, which can be recast as a conditional statement. Because the main loop, working variables (pattern space and hold space), input and output streams, and default actions (copy line to pattern space, <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> space) are implicit, {{it is possible to}} write terse one-liner programs. For example, the sed program given by: 10qwill print the first 10 lines of input, then stop.|$|E

5000|$|DeMarco’s {{animal studies}} showed a healing {{phenomenon}} he termed [...] "coordinated healing". Observing that animal wounds would heal differently when treated with his formula, {{he tried to}} explain his observations: after excising a square inch of skin from a rabbit’s shaved back, he would allow it to heal normally while documenting its progress with time lapse photography. DeMarco than performed the same experiment while treating the rabbit with his formula. He observed that the untreated wound healed haphazardly; closing in a non-circular pattern with uneven levels and with infiltrating hair growth before wound closure. In contrast, the treated rabbit shows healing in a smooth circular pattern with even levels and only after wound closure would the hair begin to regrow.DeMarco also observed this coordinated healing in humans with his gangrene patients. Despite being diabetic, the treated wound would heal correctly with minimal scar tissue. Even the toe’s <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> would return. Hair growth and scar tissue were suppressed while select de novo protein synthesis appeared to accelerate. He deduced that this coordinated healing pattern was a result of procaine-DNA interaction since procaine has been documented to influence DNA synthesis in simpler life forms (DNA activation in sea urchin eggs) as well as humans (restores silenced gene expression).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Lip print {{patterns}} are individualistic and unique {{and can be}} used for identification of individuals. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the different types of lip patterns, know the most common one and to know whether it has any gender predilection among adults of Sebha city. Materials and Methods: A total of 104 adults aged 18 - 35 years participated in this study. Lip prints were recorded and analyzed for lip print patterns. Statistical analysis was carried out using the computer software Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) 17. 0 (Chicago, Illinos, USA). Results: Type I lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> was seen in 53. 37 % and 60. 07 % of lip quadrants in males and females, respectively. 27 (25. 96 %) subjects had same lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> in all the four quadrants.

40|$|Inkjet printed {{electronics}} {{is one of}} the new promising electronics manufacturing techniques out there. It {{has become}} a widely adopted manufacturing method especially in the field of low-cost electronics. This thesis considers an application of inkjet printed electronics where conductive ink is used for printing the connections between the components on a single unit called a module. The base module is fabricated by molding the components together such that the connection points of the components form a level surface. After this, the wiring is printed on top. Because of the inaccuracies in the fabrication process, there is often a mismatch between the designed <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> and the target module. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce an online <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> generation system that uses computer vision to detect the locations of the module components and then modifies the <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> accordingly. By integrating the <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> generation system {{as a part of the}} manufacturing process, not only is it possible to print functioning modules but also multiple modules can be printed at the same time. This way the capabilities of inkjet printed electronics can be more efficiently harnessed. The experiments prove that the developed <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> correction system together with the proposed imaging setup are able to produce desired results in practice. In addition to successfully printing ten modules at once, it is also shown that the developed system is robust and generalizes well for different types of modules. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} sex from lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern.</b> Sex estimation is important to identify whether the crime has been committed by a male or female or to identify the perpetrator. Cheiloscopy is the study of lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is very useful in forensic identification of a person. Lip prints are actually lines and fissures in the form of wrinkles in the zone of transition of lip i. e. red part of lips. These ridges, grooves or wrinkles are studied for the purpose of positive identification of a person. Lip prints can also prove to be as one of the best method of personal identification. Lip print is unique to individual and thus can be used for identification purpose. Lip prints are important evidence in case like sexual assault, murder, rape and also remain at scene of crime unknowingly on cups, glasses, cigarette butts, clothing’s, skin etc...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cheiloscopy is a {{forensic}} investigation technique {{that deals with}} the identification based on lip traces. Based upon the research, it was established that the arrangement of lines on the red part of human lips is unique for each human being. Objectives:  To analyze and compare quadrant wise and sex wise predilection of lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern.</b> Methods:  A total of  200  (18 - 25 years)   Nepalese undergraduate students of BPKIHS were selected. Thin layer of lip-stick was applied on the lips of these sub-jects. The hinged por-tion of a folded paper was inserted between the lips and the sub-jects were asked to press their lips onto it.  Only middle  10  mm of both upper and lower lips were taken as study area. The lip prints,  thus obtained were stud-ied on the basis of Tsuchihashi’s classification. Chi square {{test was used to}} analyze and compare the lip print patterns in all the quadrants of males and females, with the level of significance p< 0. 05. Results: Type I pattern was predominant in all the four quadrants among males (62 %, 56 %, 54 %, 57 % in first, second, third and fourth quadrants respectively). In female also type I was predominant in 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th quadrant (40 %, 45 %, 51 % respectively) whereas in 1 st (right upper) quadrant type II pattern was predominant (37 %).

40|$|Context (Background) : Lips {{prints are}} unique {{and are a}} tool for {{personal}} identification. Aims: Indian population {{can be divided into}} different ethno-racial groups. In this study, we aimed at finding the most and the least prevalent lip print patterns in these groups and also to observe any similarities or differences that may exist in these groups in terms of lip print patterns. Settings and Design: Lip prints in 755 individuals categorized into different ethno-racial groups were studied. Materials and Methods: Brown- and pink-colored lipsticks, cellophane tape, and magnifying lens were used to record and study the lip prints. Results: Among all the three ethno-racial groups, Type I was the most prevalent lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> observed. The least prevalent lip <b>print</b> <b>pattern</b> in all the three groups was Type IV.
