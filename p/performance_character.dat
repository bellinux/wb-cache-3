40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to understand student perceptions and motivations regarding <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities (i. e., assertiveness, perseverance, resilience, and self-control) at an urban high school. In examining these relationships, students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and motivations towards <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities were identified. The study is important because students 2 ̆ 7 poor academic performance, low test scores, low high school graduation rates, and employers reporting that high school graduates do not possess the necessary performance qualities needed to excel on the job indicate that urban high school students may lack the proper orientation toward performance qualities. Research is needed to understand types of skills that {{students need to be}} prepared for the world of work and beyond, and to determine the best way that high schools can provide instruction in these skills. A descriptive quantitative research design approach was used to collect data on students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and motivations toward <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities. The findings revealed a statistically significant relationship between students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities and their motivations towards these qualities. The findings also indicated that male and female students did not differ in their perceptions of these qualities. In addition, female students possessed a greater motivational orientation towards task and effort than male students. Lastly, it was found that students 2 ̆ 7 self-reported academic grades can be predicted from students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities. Two main conclusions that were drawn from this research are (1) without being aware of students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and motivations regarding <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities, character educators may find it difficult to make learning relevant to students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities; and (2) results of the correlations between students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities and their motivation for <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities can be used to improve student orientations towards a particular <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> quality. It is recommended that urban schools develop and implement comprehensive character education programs that are designed to teach and instill <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> qualities in students...|$|E

40|$|Automatically {{detecting}} the singer by analyzing audio is a challenging task which gains in complexity for poly-phonic material. Related approaches {{in the context}} of Western commercial music use machine learning models which mainly rely on low-level timbre descriptors. Such systems are prone to misclassifications when spectral distortions are present, since the timbre of the singer can-not be accurately modeled. For improvisational styles, where the performance is strongly determined by sponta-neous interpretation characteristic for the singer, a more robust system can be achieved by additionally modeling the singer’s typical performance style. In addition to tim-bre and vibrato descriptors we therefore extract high-level features related to the <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> from the predominant fundamental frequency envelope and automatic symbolic transcriptions. In a case study on flamenco singing, we observe an increase in accuracy for monophonic performances when classifying on this com-bined feature set.

40|$|During {{the late}} few years, {{research}} {{in recognition of}} handwritten Chinese and Japanese characters has matured significantly. However, {{in order to obtain}} high recognition rate, most character recognition systems have paid extremely expensive computational cost. For high <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> recognition systems, how to reduce the expensive computational cost is a very important problem now. Discriminant function is a very important factor for precise pattern recognition. The Mahalanobis distance is considered as an effective function. However, to calculate the Mahalanobis distance precisely, extremely large number of training samples are needed. In this paper, by investigating the relationship of elements of feature vector, a new discriminant function, called vector-divided Mahalanobis distance, is proposed. With the proposed method, high recognition performance can be obtained with less computational cost. Because the proposed method partitions high dimensional feature vector into several small number dimensional vectors, the ratio of the number of training samples to the number of dimensions becomes larger. This method is especially effect in the case of lack of training samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the experimental results with the database ETL 9 B...|$|E
40|$|Retaining {{employees}} {{remains a}} primary concern for many organizations during days of intellectual property, for intellectual capital {{has become a}} critical component of wealth creation. This paper provides a theoretical overview of the different periods of motives and domains or targets of employee retention/turnover and highlights the performing importance from the platform of social capital in research. The objective {{of this study is to}} present literature on the complex relationship between individual performance characters and withdraw tendency based on Social Capital Theory. It is generally revealed that in the traditional attitude turnover model the process of employees' volunteer turnover is the reversed transformation process of employees' retention psychology and behaviours, mainly consisting of four sectors (Lee and Mitchell, 1999) : first is the quit process caused by job dissatisfaction; then, employees' search for substitutable jobs before turnover; is evaluation on such substitutable jobs; and result is occurrence of turnover behaviour. Finally, an integrative model of the relationship is proposed which argues that <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> may lead to withdraw tendency even turnover behavior through four different routes with the introduction of the Job-Coupling variable.

40|$|This {{volume of}} {{original}} essays fills a significant research gap in Chinese film studies by offering an interdisciplinary, comparative examination of ethnic Chinese film stars from the silent period {{to the era}} of globalization. Whereas studies of stars and stardom have developed considerably in the West {{over the past two}} decades, there is no single book in English that critically addresses issues related to stars and stardom in Chinese culture. Chinese Film Stars offers exemplary readings of historically, geographically and aesthetically multifaceted star phenomena. An international lineup of contributors test a variety of approaches in making sense of discourses of stars and stardom in China and the US, explore historical contexts in which Chinese film stars are constructed and transformed in relation to changing sociopolitical conditions, and consider issues of performance and identity specific to individual stars through chapter-by-chapter case studies. The essays explore a wide range of topics such as star <b>performance,</b> <b>character</b> type, media construction, political propaganda, online discourses, autobiographic narration, as well as issues of gender, genre, memory and identity. Including 15 case studies of individual Chinese stars and illustrated with film stills throughout, this book is an essential read for students of Chinese film, media and cultural studies.

In such method, the algorithm method NSGA- is adopted. And the NSGA- method is improved by adopting a new crossover operator. The optimum design result shows that the value variation trend of total pressure recovery is in accordance with drag coefficient.

40|$|This text {{is part of}} a {{research}} conducted under the working title "What do we talk about when we are silent and what are we silent about when we are talking? - premises for the anthropology of silence about the nearest past. " In the first part the author investigates the meaning of silence in the Croatian and Serbian press right before and during Croatia's Operation Storm. The ratio between silence, suppression of information and forgetting, on the one hand, and social memory, on the other, has been elaborated in the final part of the text by following reports about the anniversaries of Operation Storm in both Croatian and Serbian publics. The starting point lies in the belief that the phenomenon of silence (and suppression of information), being an immanent part of each discourse, represents an important factor in the creation of social relationships and system of value models, that it has important communication and cognitive functions and that the <b>performance</b> <b>character</b> lies in its essence. In short, silence makes it possible to form the prevailing image about this event, even if it does not construct it indirectly - through speech. The author has elaborated on the meaning of silence in the context of Operation Storm partly because studies about the breakup of Yugoslavia frequently mention silence as a manipulation strategy employed by some of the sides in the conflict (or analysts dealing with Yugoslav topics), while not a single study systematically investigates the semantic of silence and suppression of information in these conflicts. Most importantly, taking into account the frequency of direct silence in the newspaper discourse and rhetoric strategies that point at silence indirectly from the context and discourse, the author focuses on the relationship between the event (situation) and silence. In order to shed light on the way in which Operation Storm is remembered, i. e. forgotten, in the stakeholders' publics and political imageries, she follows the dailies - Večernje Novosti Politika, Danas (Belgrade) - Večernji List, Jutarnji List, Magazin supplement of the Jutarnji List (Zagreb), as well as texts about Operation Storm in weeklies such as the NIN and Vreme of Belgrade or Globus of Zagreb in the period between August 2, 1995 and mid-August 2006...|$|E
