5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down.

In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
