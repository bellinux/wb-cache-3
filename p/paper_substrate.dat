[...] Currently, plant cellulose is used to produce the bulk of traditional paper, but due to its low purity it must be mixed with other substances such as lignin. [...] However, due to microbial cellulose's higher purity and microfibril structure, it may prove to be an excellent candidate for an electronic <b>paper</b> <b>substrate.</b> [...] Microbial cellulose can be fashioned into sheets approximately 100 micrometers thick, about the thickness of normal paper, by a wet synthesis process. [...] The microbial cellulose produces a sturdy substrate with a microfibril structure that allows the paper to be implanted with dopants. [...] Through the application of solutions to the microbial cellulose paper, conductive dopants and electrochromic dyes can be placed into the microfibril structure. [...] The bistable dyes change from clear to dark upon the application of the appropriate voltages, which when placed in a pixel structure, would allow images to be formed. [...] This technology is still in the research stage and has not yet been scaled to commercial production levels. [...] Further research has been done to apply bacterial cellulose as a substrate in electronic devices with the potential to be used as e-book tablets, e-newspapers, dynamic wall papers, rewritable maps and learning tools. Another possible example of bacterial cellulose use in the electronics industry includes the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{study is}} to demonstrate ultra-low-cost <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> for the realization of inexpensive RFID tags that can be integrated with batteries and sensors for wireless sensing, tracking and monitoring applications. The first step toward achieving this goal is to demonstrate &quot;conductors on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> &quot; from processing standpoint and to characterize the electrical performance of <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> up to 2 GHz form design standpoint. The conductors are achieved by (i) direct-write ink jet printing technology with tailored conductive ink and by (ii) conventional copper etching upon lamination of metal foils on to the <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> There are several issues in optimizing the processes in {{either of the two}} approaches. For example, ink jet printing would require smooth surface finish, good adhesion, less smearing of the ink, fast curing profile, and ultimately copper-like conductivity of the printed ink and rapid prototyping for high volume manufacturing. On the other hand, metallization using copper will require bonding of copper onto paper surface, adhesion, compatibility with copper etch solutions and lithography, and moisture sealing. Both approaches have been successfully demonstrated for printing conductors on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> which can be easily scaled to large-quantity manufacturing. For the electrical characterization of the <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> up to 2 GHz, one microstrip ring resonator was designed and fabricated for extracting dielectric constant and dielectric losses.

50|$|A {{dot blot}} (or slot blot) is a {{technique}} in molecular biology used to detect biomolecules, and for detecting, analyzing, and identifying proteins. It represents a simplification of the northern blot, Southern blot, or western blot methods. In a dot blot the biomolecules to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or <b>paper</b> <b>substrate.</b> This differs from the western blot because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically.

Gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components. When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow electron trap, which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form silver metal speck.|$|E
50|$|A paper {{battery is}} a battery {{engineered}} {{to use a}} paper-thin sheet of cellulose (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned carbon nanotubes. The potential for these devices is great, {{as they may be}} manufactured via a roll-to-roll process, which would make it very low-cost, and they would be lightweight, flexible, and thin. In order to productively use paper electronics (or any thin electronic devices), the power source must be equally thin, thus indicating the need for paper batteries. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} surfaces coated with CNTs can be used to replace heavy metals in batteries. More recently, functional paper batteries have been demonstrated, where a lithium-ion battery is integrated on a single sheet of paper through a lamination process as a composite with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) or LiCoO2 (LCO). The <b>paper</b> <b>substrate</b> would function well as the separator for the battery, where the CNT films function as the current collectors for both the anode and the cathode.

In all of these instances, similar low-temperature mechanical loss peaks are observed in the temperature range from 180 K up to 300 K in both low-frequency resonant and low-frequency sub-resonant mechanical spectrometers.

Various types {{of materials and}} structures {{can be used to}} construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications. Transition metal oxides are a large family of materials possessing various interesting properties in the field of electrochromism. Among them, tungsten oxide (WO3), has been the most extensively studied material, used in the production of electrochromic windows or smart glass and more recently electrochromic displays on <b>paper</b> <b>substrate</b> as anti-counterfeiting systems integrated on packaging. NiO materials have been widely studied as counter electrodes for complementary electrochromic devices, in particular, smart windows. The world leading institutions on NiO efforts include National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Uppsala University. Another example of an electrochromic material is polyaniline which can be formed either by the electrochemical or chemical oxidation of aniline. If an electrode is immersed in hydrochloric acid which contains a small concentration of aniline, then a film of polyaniline can be grown on the electrode. Depending on the oxidation state, polyaniline can either be pale yellow or dark green/black. Other electrochromic materials that have found technological application include the viologens and polyoxotungstates.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{humidity}} on the electrical properties of thermal inkjet-printed copper tetrasulfonated phthalocyanine (CuTsPc) films onto <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> are reported. DC electrical measurements revealed that sample resistance decreases from 10 (12) Omega in moderate vacuum to approximately 10 (7) Omega at highly water-saturated atmosphere. This behavior {{is attributed to}} the creation of water pathways on the cellulose fibers that allow ionic species such as impurities, protons (H+), and dissociated Na+ ions from the CuTsPc molecules, to flow. The contribution of the CuTsPc molecules and their dissociated Na+ ions on the sample resistance was elucidated analyzing the electrical response of bare and printed <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> An increase of relative humidity levels (RH) from 10 % to 40 - 45 % revealed an increase of current of four orders of magnitude for printed samples, whereas less than one order of magnitude was registered for bare <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> Electrical measurements as a function of temperature have shown that moisture can inhibit the semiconducting properties of CuTsPc. Thermal gravimetric studies revealed that approximately 11 % of mass accounting to the presence of water is released above 70 A degrees C, the same temperature in which the sample recovers its dry-state semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting properties of CuTsPc can also be observed upon white light illumination, whereas the charge carrier extraction is governed by the RH level.
