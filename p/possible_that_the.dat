5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability.

5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton.

5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E
5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E

5|$|Eighteen {{of these}} pits {{were found to}} contain the remains of human skeletons, which are now stored in the Weston-super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare.

5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating.

5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti.
