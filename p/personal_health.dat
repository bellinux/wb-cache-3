5|$|There are {{no records}} of {{diseases}} experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness {{dates from the}} time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the Consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel Gorman from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. He was treated with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation over his own <b>personal</b> <b>health.</b> The fistula would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In recent decades, {{diabetes}} {{has contributed}} significantly to the burden of disease in developed and developing countries, due to the considerable prevalence and involvement of various age groups in the communities. Today, a variety of ways to manage and control the disease are used, one of which is the use of <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> records. Recently there has been a remarkable upsurge in activity surrounding the adoption of <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> records systems for patients and consumers. <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> records systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. The present study was conducted with the goal of Health Technology Assessment the impact of <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> records in Patients with Diabetes. Methods: Writing is based on PRISMA standards.   This was a Health Technology Assessment  study. It aimed to evaluate the technology of <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> record. The scoping review was conducted to evaluate 8 dimensions (Health Problem and Current Use of the Technology, Description and technical characteristics of technology, Safety, Costs and economic evaluation, Ethical analysis, Organisational aspects, Patients and Social aspects, Legal aspects) of  <b>Personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> record. This study was based on answering questions which were developed based on Health Diagnostics Technology Assessment Documents Framework and HTA Core Model 3. 0. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the Clinical Effectiveness dimension of <b>personal</b> electronic <b>health</b> record  in controlling diabetes. In order to gather evidences, Ovid databases, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CRD, Trip database and EMBASE, and Randomized Controlled Trial Registries, such as the Clinical Trial and Trial Registry, were searched using specific keywords and strategies.. Articles are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} quality criteria of JADAD. The data is analyzed by the STATA software. Dissemination:The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. Policy makers and healthcare decision-makers can use these results...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that PHRs are not the same as electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs), which are software systems designed for use by health care providers.

There is no legal mandate that compels a consumer or patient to store her <b>personal</b> <b>health</b> information in a PHR.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church {{continues}} to use {{wine in the}} celebration of the Eucharist because {{it is part of the}} tradition passed down through the ages starting with Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, where Catholics believe the consecrated bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as transubstantiation. Wine is used (not grape juice) both due to its strong Scriptural roots, and also to follow the tradition set by the early Christian Church. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt. In some circumstances, a priest may obtain special permission to use grape juice for the consecration; however, this is extremely rare and typically requires sufficient impetus to warrant such a dispensation, such as <b>personal</b> <b>health</b> of the priest.|$|E
