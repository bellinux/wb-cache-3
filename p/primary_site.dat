Adjoining the ghat, {{there are}} raised platforms {{that are used}} for death anniversary rituals. According to a myth {{it is said that}} an earring of Shiva or his wife Sati fell here. Fourth-century Gupta period inscriptions mention this ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the <b>primary</b> <b>site</b> of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the <b>primary</b> <b>site</b> of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
40|$|The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens provided a singu-lar chance to study community assembly. Permanent plots {{were used to}} monitor species richness, cover and even-ness. Structure stabilized quickly on mildly impacted sites, but secondary and <b>primary</b> successional <b>sites</b> con-tinued to develop. Annual DCA score increments changed least on tephra and most on <b>primary</b> <b>sites.</b> Vegetation changed more rapidly soon after impact, more slowly recently. Net plot displacement after 18 seasons was 0. 4 half-change (HC) on tephra, 1. 0 HC on secondary sites and 1. 1 HC on <b>primary</b> <b>sites.</b> Colonization and extinction percentages in 0. 25 -m 2 quadrats were estimated for three intervals. The extinction percentages declined from re-covered to <b>primary</b> <b>sites,</b> while the colonization percent-ages were similar in all. The proportion of extinction events to colonization events declined sharply. These results support the carousel model at an intermediate spatial scale, even during succession. Degree of site isola-tion, stress and impact intensity combined to form a mosaic of recovering vegetation that remains dynamic. Each community had unique structure, developmental sequences and local population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In eastern Nebraska, stream {{straightening}} and dredging efforts {{since the}} 1890 s have disturbed the natural equilibrium of stream channels and {{have led to}} streambed adjustment by degradation and subsequent channel widening. This report describes a study to evaluate the effect these disturbances have had on stream channels in eastern Nebraska. Two sets of survey data were collected approximately 2 years apart during 1996 – 99 at 151 <b>primary</b> <b>sites.</b> Additionally, historical streambed-elevation data (dating back to the 1890 s) were compiled from several sources for the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> and 45 supplemental sites, and relevant disturbances were identified for each of eight basin groupings. Streambed-elevation data sets were used to estimate the amount of change to the streambed at the sites over the time period of the data.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was performed on}} 67 carcinoma of the cervix patients who were subjected to the Okabayashi Operation {{during the period from}} June 1957 to Dec. 1958. These patients consisted of 50 unselected cases, the 2 cases who had the postoperative retroperitoneal suppuration, and 15 cases who were subjected to the preoperative x-ray radiation on one side. The bacteriologic examination with Good-pasture's and methylenblue staining was done on the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> of cancer, the parametrial tissues and the regional lymph nodes after the serial section. The further {{investigation was}} extended to the histological examination concerning the inflammatory reactions. Following results were obtained: 1) The rates of detecting bacteria in the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> of carcinoma, parametrial tissues, and lymph nodes were 54. 0 %, 22. 3 % and 21. 8 % respectively. No relationship with the clinical stage was found. 2) The rate of detecting bacteria from the standpoint of C. P. L. classification (IMAI) was same in each type as far as the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> concerned, but in both the parametrial tissues and lymph nodes the type L was meaningly higher than type C and P. 3) According to Nagase's classification there were present no significant difference regarding the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> and parametria, but in lymph nodes the type II was meaningly higher than the type I in rate. 4) The relationship with growth-type of carcinoma was as follows: Those having the endophytic type in growth were revealed to have the higher incidence of bacteria in both the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> and lymph nodes compared with those of exophytic type. 5) Dividing the parametrial tissue into the superior, middle, and inferior parts, the last was meaningly low in rate compared with the superior and middle parts. This was seemingly due to the anatomical relationship of lymph-vessels. 6) As regard to lymph nodes, the hypogastric nodes were 28 % and the obturator nodes, superior iliac and inferior iliac nodes were around 15 % each in rate. As regard to the relation of the detection rate with the size of lymph nodes, it was revealed that the larger the lymph nodes are, the higher is the incidence. It is, however, noticeable fact that even the bean-sized lymph nodes were not always negative of bacteria. It should be kept in mind, therefore, on the removal of lymph nodes at the time of operation to avoid mashing the lymph nodes as far as possible for protecting the postoperative infection. 7) Those having the metastasized lymph nodes or the parametrial infiltration of cancer were revealed to be higher in rate than those having neither the infiltration nor the metastasis. 8) The lymph nodes and the parametria which were positive of bacteria in the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> of cancer were higher in rate than those having no infection in <b>primary</b> <b>sites.</b> 9) The variety of bacteria investigated mostly consisted of cocci and far less of bacilli. 10) No influence to detection rate was arisen from by X-ray preoperative treatment as far as dosage of 1. 164 r to 1. 392 r concerned. 11) 3 out of 50 cases were complicated with the postoperative retroperitoneal suppuration. 12) It was disclosed that in all three parts, <b>primary</b> <b>sites,</b> parametria, and lymph nodes, those having the servere inflammatory reaction not always showed the high rate of bacteria-detection. It highly seems to us that other factor aside from the bacterial infection, probably anti-carcinoma protecting reaction, could play the important role for the inflammatory reaction of parametrial tissue and stromal tissue of the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> of cancer...|$|R

30|$|Choroidal {{metastasis}} {{is considered}} to occur by hematogenous spread. This seems to be common in cases of lung cancer and breast cancer. In the English language literature, we could not find any previous articles about the risk or morbidity rate limited to only gastric cancer owing to its rarity.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of a complex of methyl-α-D-mannoside with banana lectin from Musa paradisiaca reveals two <b>primary</b> binding <b>sites</b> in the lectin, unlike in other lectins with beta-prism I fold which essentially consists of three Greek key motifs. It {{has been suggested that}} the fold evolved through successive gene duplication and fusion of an ancestral Greek key motif. In other lectins, all from dicots, the <b>primary</b> binding <b>site</b> exists on one of the three motifs in the three-fold symmetric molecule. Banana is a monocot, and the three motifs have not diverged enough to obliterate sequence similarity among them. Two Greek key motifs in it carry one <b>primary</b> binding <b>site</b> each. A common secondary binding site exists on the third Greek key. Modelling shows that both the <b>primary</b> <b>sites</b> can support 1 - 2, 1 - 3, and 1 - 6 linked mannosides with the second residue interacting in each case primarily with the secondary binding site. Modelling also readily leads to a bound branched mannopentose with the nonreducing ends of the two branches anchored at the two <b>primary</b> binding <b>sites,</b> providing a structural explanation for the lectin's specificity for branched α-mannans. A comparison of the dimeric banana lectin with other β-prism I fold lectins, provides interesting insights into the variability in their quaternary structure...|$|R
