Naktuinbouw inspectors perform inspections of production sites, production processes, the propagating material and the documents required to trade and market the products. If all these aspects comply with the standards, the material may be traded. If the material {{does not meet the}} legal requirements, Naktuinbouw will ensure that the material does not enter the trade channels. Naktuinbouw's activities include quality inspections, <b>plant</b> <b>passport</b> inspections and phytosanitary import and export inspections.|$|E
40|$|Phytosanitary {{legislation}} is widely {{thought to be}} the most effective means of limiting the entry of alien pathogens without hindering trade. However, there is increasing evidence of limitations and weaknesses in phytosanitary systems worldwide. One such case is the entry and establishment of Colletotrichum acutatum in the UK in the 1980 s. To investigate this further, data sets of disease incidence gathered by the authorities responsible for plant health between 1984 and 2008 were analysed to determine how and why the pathogen entered the UK and became established on strawberries. Results suggest that the disease entered the UK in 1982 on plants originating from the USA, a year earlier than the first UK record of the disease was reported. At least 54 further cases of infested plant material breached phytosanitary procedures and entered the UK, 75 % of which originated from EU countries. Moreover, internal trade transmission was found to be highly influential in the successful spread of the disease. The effectiveness of phytosanitary procedures is limited when the sector is importing large numbers of plants from nurseries that have a track record of selling infested plant material, even if they are accompanied by a <b>plant</b> <b>passport.</b> By taking greater responsibility in limiting the spread of quarantine diseases, nurseries throughout the EU have an important role to play in limiting the entry of alien pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Eutetranychus orientalis in the European Union (EU) and evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} phytosanitary measures in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Entry through the plants for planting pathway is assessed as very likely, while entry through other pathways is estimated as moderately likely to unlikely owing to the different probability of transfer to a suitable host. Establishment is rated as very likely in Mediterranean areas and from moderately likely to unlikely in non-Mediterranean areas, because of unfavourable environmental conditions. Spread is rated as very likely because of the many ways the pest can spread, its polyphagy and the wide distribution of hosts. Impact is rated as minor, with an expected increase in the damage when populations of natural enemies are severely affected by control measures and/or when environmental conditions are stressful for the host. However, {{the lack of information}} resulted in an overall medium level of uncertainty. The Panel evaluated the effectiveness of current EU phytosanitary measures and concluded that the removal of E. orientalis from Annex IIAII would not affect its probability of entry, because the importation from Third countries of some host plants regulated for this pest (Citrus, Fortunella, Poncirus species and their hybrids) is prohibited in Annex III. However, spread could be affected since there would no longer be a requirement to inspect for this pest before issuing a <b>plant</b> <b>passport</b> (Annex V). However, since the regulated Rutaceae species constitute an extremely small proportion of the potential host plants of E. orientalis, the current phytosanitary measures are mostly ineffective in preventing further introduction and spread of E. orientalis in the EU. The Panel identified surveillance at the production site and treatment of the consignment as the most effective and technically feasible risk reduction options, particularly when applied togethe...|$|E

40|$|The British Government has {{announced}} that the entire body of EU law will be adopted into UK Law through the ‘Great Repeal Bill’ {{at the moment of}} withdrawal from the European Union (EU) with ‘unnecessary legislation’ then gradually repealed. However, many commentators have pointed out the enormity and complexity of this task as well as the political, economic and constitutional hurdles to legislative reform. For plant biosecurity, a crucial issue taken into account when shaping the current EU plant health regime through the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC ('Plant Health Directive') was the need to embrace the single market. Furthermore, the UK was influential in safeguarding plant health in the single market through the adoption of this Directive. The impact of Brexit on protection from invasive species damaging habitats and wildlife (EU Regulation 1143 / 2014) should also be considered. With the Brexit White Paper published and with the Article 50 Bill passing through Parliament, the following questions should be asked: •	Will Directives as well as EU Regulations be included in Great Repeal Bill? •	If so, will Directive 2000 / 29 /EC be regarded as 'unnecessary' given UK’s likely departure from the single market and what might replace it? •	Will existing rulings of the ECJ be taken into account in implementation of laws originating from the EU? •	Will risks of introduction of harmful organisms and invasive species increase or lessen if the UK’s borders retract to her national boundaries? •	What will happen with <b>plant</b> <b>passporting?</b> It will also be necessary {{to take into account the}} impact of Brexit on legislation on plant protection products/pesticides because plant health is a component of the EU Farm-to-Fork food safety strategy. Consequently, another question to be addressed is: •	Will the UK continue to implement the farm-to-fork strategy after Brexit strategy or will it be abandoned in favour of a narrower sectoral approach...|$|R
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Parasaissetia nigra in the European Union (EU) and identified and evaluated the phytosanitary measures listed in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Entry through the principal pathways is assessed as moderately likely for plants for planting and very unlikely for living parts of plants, such as fruit and cut flowers with foliage, the discrepancy being mainly {{due to the}} difference in probability of transfer to a suitable host. Establishment is rated as very likely outdoors in Mediterranean areas and indoors in the whole risk assessment area (where the pest has been present for a long time), and unlikely outdoors in non-Mediterranean areas. Spread within the EU {{is considered to be}} moderately likely because the pest can readily be moved with plant material but is limited by climatic conditions. The magnitude of the potential consequences is rated as minor. The Panel evaluated the effectiveness of current EU phytosanitary measures and concluded that the removal of P. nigra from Annex IIAII would not affect its probability of entry, because the importation from Third countries of some host plants regulated for P. nigra (Citrus, Fortunella, Poncirus species and their hybrids) is prohibited in Annex III. However, spread could be affected since there would no longer be a requirement to inspect for this pest before issuing a <b>plant</b> <b>passport</b> (Annex V).

40|$|Bioversity International, {{with the}} {{financial}} support of the Global Crop Diversity Trust (the Trust) has led the development of strategic key sets of characterization and evaluation descriptors for 22 crops included in Annex I of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). The strategic sets of data standards are designed to facilitate access to and utilization of plant genetic resources information. Together with passport information, descriptors are critical to the effective sharing of evaluation data and to the efficient use of <b>plant</b> genetic resources. <b>Passport,</b> characterization and evaluation descriptors are included on the GENESYS portal, to facilitate access to information and promote the utilization of germplasm accessions. Along with the definitions of key sets of data standards, which are also available on Bioversity’s web site, the project also documented the standard development process, the outcome being these detailed methodologies for each crop. These guidelines provide the background information and objectives and give insights into the structure and elements of the methodologies developed by Bioversity to devise the crop-specific standards. They include specific methodologies for each crop {{and serve as a}} reference guide to develop further standards. Each methodology describes the development process for each key set of descriptors...|$|R
