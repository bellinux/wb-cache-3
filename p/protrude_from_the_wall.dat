500|$|Although heavily {{influenced}} by architecture from Mesopotamia and Byzantium, the Fatimids introduced or developed unique features such as the four-centred keel arch and the squinch, connecting square interior volumes to the dome. [...] Their mosques followed the hypostyle plan, where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches, initially resting on columns with leafy Corinthian capitals. They typically had features such as portals that <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> domes above mihrabs and qiblas, and façade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions, and stucco decorations. The woodwork of the doors and interiors of the buildings was often finely carved. The Fatimids also made considerable development towards mausoleum building.

[...] "Clashes of colour and culture are the norm, not the exception," [...] with {{the value of an}} artefact, [...] "rather than consistency of style" [...] being the major criterion of display. Foreigners may be also be struck by the lack of finishing touches in construction ("Electrical switches may <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> supported only by their wiring") or maintenance ("Piles of masonry are likely to lie scattered beside and on the streets of expensive suburbs").|$|E

Consisting of a single 8.5 foot length of wire, both ends of Moving Wire (1988) <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and are set 14 inches apart; as one end of the wire extends out from the wall at random intervals, the other retracts.|$|E
5000|$|Welch Apartments is an {{historic}} building located in downtown Muscatine, Iowa, United States. The Scott House hotel existed on this property {{prior to this}} building, which was constructed about 1900. The Italianate-style building contain 26 units with different floor plans. The main floor contains commercial space. The four-story structure measures 120 by 80 ft. The dominant feature of the exterior is the bay windows that <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> surface. The pressed-metal cornice unifies the building's composition. High parapet gables are located above the cornice. They are executed in the Flemish Renaissance style. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. It became a contributing property in the Downtown Commercial Historic District in 2006.|$|E

50|$|In a {{semicircle}} {{on the sides}} of the back of the stage are the figures of 18 young women popularly known as the muses (although there are only nine muses in Greek mythology). The monotone upper bodies of the women <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and their lower bodies are depicted by colorful mosaics that form part of the wall. Each of the women is playing a different musical instrument, and each is wearing a different skirt, blouse, and headdress of elaborate design. In the early days of the Palau, many critics found these figures unsettling or even eerie, but today they are widely regarded as perhaps the best sculptural work in the concert hall. The upper bodies were sculpted by Eusebi Arnau, and the mosaic work of their lower bodies was created by Lluís Bru.|$|E
50|$|Juliet {{balconies}} {{are named}} after Shakespeare's Juliet, who, in traditional stagings {{of the play}} Romeo and Juliet, is courted by Romeo while she is on her balcony—though the play itself, as written, {{makes no mention of}} a balcony, but only of a window at which Juliet appears. Various types of balcony have been used in depicting this famous scene; however the 'balcony of Juliet' at Villa Capuleti in Verona is not a 'Juliet balcony', as it does indeed <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the villa (see photograph below). The Julian Balcony is a slightly larger version of the well-known Juliet Balcony, protruding slightly from the wall, unlike the smaller Juliet balcony, and spanning at least two windows rather than one; this variation was made famous by Julian Assange's numerous addresses to the press from his refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador, London.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} Abbasid palace, {{built around}} 775, is the al-Ukhaidir Fortress.It {{has a plan}} derived from earlier Sasanian and Umayyad palaces.The palace lies in the desert about 180 km {{to the south of}} Baghdad.It is rectangular in shape, 175 by 169 m, with four gates. Three are in half-round towers that <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and one in a rectangular recess in the wall. Inside there is a vaulted entrance hall, a central court, an iwan (hall) open to the court opposite the entrance hall, and residential units.Sasanian techniques persist in the construction of vaults with pointed curves using rubble and mortar faced with brick and stucco, blind arches as decorations for large wall surfaces, and long vaulted halls with recesses behind arches supported by heavy pillars. Verbal descriptions indicate that palaces in Baghdad had similar layout, although on a larger scale.|$|E

5000|$|This {{dates to}} 1553 and is {{decorated}} with an angel who holds a banner inscribed [...] "LE 15 JOVR DE MARS L'AN 1553 FVT FONDE CESTE CHAPELLE AU NO(M)DE DIEV ET DE MADAME SAI(N)CTE APPOLINE DE PAR HERVE K(ER)JAHES ET GVILL(AVME)E BRAS FABRIQVES DE LAD.CHAPEL" [...] According to local records Hervé Kerahès and Guillaume Bras were local builders. The porch comprises an entrance arch decorated with vine leaves and bunches of grapes as well as carvings of small animals, people eating grapes and playing a trumpet. In the external voussure of the entrance arch, the carvings start on the bottom left with a lion and after the floral decoration, ends on the right with a dragon. In the centre there is a human head, wearing a hat and nibbling at grape seeds. In the interior voussure, the sculptors repeat the same pattern but a pig replaces the dragon. A large tympanum is located over the arch, with a nativity scene depicting the Virgin Mary and Joseph {{on either side of}} the baby Jesus who lies on a bed of straw whilst above him the heads of a cow and a donkey <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This group is situated to the right hand side of the tympanum suggesting that there had been another sculpture on the left side perhaps depicting another part of the nativity scene. The double band of piédroits and voussures (the piédroit is the stone at the bottom part of an arch up until the point when the arch starts to curve. The stones in the curved part of the arch are called voussures and it was common practice at the time to carve both stones) in the Pencran porch arch portray scenes from the Book of Genesis. In the first nine stones and alternating between left and right we see a depiction of the temptation of Adam and Eve with a tree around which is a coiled snake who offers Eve the forbidden fruit. Move to the right hand side and we see an angel brandishing a sword and throwing the couple out of Paradise which is symbolised by a tree laden with leaves. In other scenes we see Cain and Abel lighting sacrificial fires. Cain fails to get his fire burning and the smoke blows back into his eyes which he shields with his right hand. Abel is more successful with his fire. We also see Cain murdering his brother. In other piédroits, there is a depiction of Noah's ark carrying Noah and his family and animals and of Noah picking grapes. He lifts his tunic to create a fold so that he can carry as many grapes as possible. A smaller carving shows Noah intoxicated having overdone the sampling of his wine! The outside of the porch is decorated in the Flamboyant Gothic style, the buttresses topped with pinnacles. After the biblical scenes from the Book of Genesis, there are depictions in the final two piédroits of the four evangelists with their usual attributes, with Mark and John on the left and Luke and Matthew on the right. We then have the voussures and in the double band are twenty one carvings depicting angels playing a variety of instruments; a veritable [...] "Heavenly Host". Above the tympanum there is a small statue of the Virgin Mary with child. The remaining statuary can be found in the buttress niches. In the niche to the far left of the left buttress, there is a small version of the Virgin Mary before the cross. Her hands are clasped in prayer and she wears a veil. The right side buttress has Saint Suzanne in the central niche with another Virgin Mary and child in the first niche. Saint Suzanne reads a book and holds a folded scroll. In the final niche we have a depiction of Saint Ann teaching the Virgin Mary to read. Inside the church porch are statues of Christ and each of the apostles stood on a richly decorated domed dais.|$|E

50|$|This {{monument}} {{was built}} {{in the first half of}} the 5th millennium BC and reused in the 3rd millennium BC. It is one of the oldest examples of monumental architecture in Atlantic France. Excavation in 1977 revealed a steep hemispherical mound containing a circular structure of 2.5 m in diameter. It lies within a triple concentric drystone facade and is covered with a corbelled vault. The architecture is similar to the complex of Er-Mané near Carnac, Brittany. The tomb, which dates from about 4700 BC, contained the unarticulated remains of about ten individuals, half of them children. A layer of red clay had been placed atop the natural floor level. There were few artifacts, mainly two pots, six bone chisels and some flint tools. They lay near the bones on two stones of around 30 cm height that <b>protruded</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> latter use was also associated with that structure.|$|R
