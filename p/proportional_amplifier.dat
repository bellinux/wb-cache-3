The discharge is controlled in proportion by the applied electrode bias below the breakdown point. This form of detection is referred as ionization-GDD.|$|E

The analog <b>proportional</b> <b>amplifier</b> provides the required response time and maintains system stability. The digital integrator block is used to eliminate the output voltage steady-state error. Simulink is used to model the proposed DC-DC buck converter on the system level. The proposed system is verified by full system level simulation. The digital part is synthesized with HDL coder and laid-out using 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The estimated silicon area of the proposed solution is about 0. 1 mm 2.

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the goals}} of {{synthetic}} biology is to develop programmable artificial gene networks that can transduce multiple endogenous molecular cues to precisely control cell behavior. Realizing this vision requires interfacing natural molecular inputs with synthetic components that generate functional molecular outputs. Interfacing synthetic circuits with endogenous mammalian transcription factors has been particularly difficult. Here, we describe a systematic approach that enables integration and transduction of multiple mammalian transcription factor inputs by a synthetic network. The approach is facilitated by a <b>proportional</b> <b>amplifier</b> sensor based on synergistic positive autoregulation. The circuits efficiently transduce endogenous transcription factor levels into RNAi, transcriptional transactivation, and site-specific recombination. They also enable AND logic between pairs of arbitrary transcription factors. The results establish a framework for developing synthetic gene networks that interface with cellular processes through transcriptional regulators...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents a comprehensive dynamic analysis of fluidic laminar <b>proportional</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (LPA) and a subsequent {{design of a}} broad-band voice communication system and narrow-band data link that demonstrates {{the utility of the}} analysis. Starting from first principles, the governing equations for the lumped parameter representation of the various flow regimes found in an LPA are derived. From these governing equations, in the Laplace domain, equivalent electrical circuits are derived. The input of the LPA is determined to have a fifth order impedance. The transmission of the signal from input to output is delayed by a transport time, determined both phenomenologically and experimentally, to be twice the average particle transit time. A pressure is developed at the output that is dependent on the loading and the vent conditions. This pressure is acoustically fed back to the control region of the jet, augmenting jet deflection when in phase. The vent inductance has the effect of producing a low frequency hump on the Bode plot. The regions of enhanced gain correspond almost exactly to the edge-tone Eigen frequencies reported in the literature and as such the theory developed herein may be used to predict not only the ratios of Eigen frequencies but also their actual values, Experiments have shown good agreement between theory and data for the amplitude frequency response of LPA's and excellent agreement for their phase shift. Using the analysis as a tool, an engineering guide was developed for the dynamics characteristics of LPA's especially the HDL STD MOD 3. 1. 1. 8.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} description and analysis of a model of direction-selective simple cells in cat striate visual cortex. There are three main defining features of our modeling effort compared to previous ones. (1) Local excitatory intracortical connections, known to be very numerous, are taken into account. (2) The model is very detailed: compartmental models of neurons are used and spiking is modeled using Hodgkin and Huxley-like active ionic currents. (3) Model responses are analyzed through standard electrophysiological methods and are compared in detail to physiology. Two separate operating modes are described. When the model acts as a <b>proportional</b> <b>amplifier,</b> contrast-response curves are relatively linear. In the hysteretic amplifier mode, contrast-response curves are much steeper initially, including an early portion with expansivity nonlinearity, but saturate abruptly at high contrasts. These features of the second mode {{are very similar to}} cortical contrast-response curves, but very different from the thalamus'. The second mode also predicts that hysteresis is latent in cortex, but that because of resetting through inhibition, cortical neurons do not fire in the absence of stimulation. In both modes, the model achieves strong amplification of the input through the excitatory cortical feedback. Amplification results in small changes in conductance for stimuli moving in the null direction, long a puzzling experimental finding; direction selectivity also persists during blockade of all inhibition in a single cell, as observed in recent experiments. Due to the nonlinearity of this amplification, bandpass velocity-response curves of thalamic neurons can be transformed into velocity low-pass cortical curves. Direction selectivity is invariant over a wide range of contrasts and velocities, a prominent feature of direction-selective cells in cortex. The model also makes specific predictions concerning the effects of selective blockade of cortical inhibition on direction selectivity at different velocities. Finally, we address the important issue of testing experimentally the linearity of cortical neurons. The same intracellular linearity test that has been used for cortical neurons is performed on the model. Although the model has substantial nonlinearities, it appears quite linear according to the linearity test. We explain these surprising observations in detail, and conclude that such tests are much more limited in usefulness than apparent at first...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} control fluid flow within a microactuator, two special types of fluidic beam element, beam {{deflection}} amplifiers and bistable wall attachment amplifiers are miniaturised and investigated. The elements are fabricated out of Plexiglas {{by means of}} the LIGA-technique and their characteristics with different kinds of gas as working fluid are determined. Beam deflection amplifiers, which are fluidic <b>proportional</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and a nozzle width of 55 #mu#m. They are operated with nitrogen and have a gain of 3. 5 at a supply pressure of 20 hPa. Bistable wall attachment amplifiers, which are fluidic flip flops, are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and nozzle widths of 30 #mu#m and 60 #mu#m. They are working with Argon, Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen as working fluid. The bistable behaviour can be observed for supply pressures higher than a certain value. Working with nitrogen, this value does not depend on the element height if the aspect ratio (=element height/width of supply nozzle) is greater than 5. In this case it is 260 hPa for elements of 30 #mu#m nozzle width and 140 hPa for elements of 60 #mu#m nozzle width. The control pressure to switch the fluidic flip flop is about 20 hPa at low supply pressures and decreases with decreasing element height. The maximum pressure at the output port at which the jet is directed depends linearly on the supply pressure. It does not depend on the element height for heights greater than 250 #mu#m. The value of the maximum output pressure is about 40 hPa at an element height of 500 #mu#m, a nozzle width of 30 #mu#m and a supply pressure of 330 hPa. The steady state flow within a fluidic flip flop is calculated numerically with finite-element-simulations. The flow through the ports is calculated with 10 % difference to the experiment and the pressure at the output ports with 20 % difference. By means of the calculations an optimization of the element geometry is achieved. In detail the geometry of the control area and the angle of the attachment walls is optimized and the characteristics of the elements are improved. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by J.

A second optical fiber receives {{a portion of the}} light reflected from the nodule and directs this to a photodiode.

The system was used to show that inhibition of nitrogenase activity in soybean nodules by NO 3 − treatment, stem-girdling, continuous darkness, or nodule disturbance is caused by a reduction in Oi and limitation of respiration in support of nitrogenase activity. A plot of nitrogenase activity (measured as peak H 2 evolution in Ar:O 2) versus Oi for the various treatments was consistent with the concept that Oi limits in vivo nitrogenase activity in legume nodules under adverse conditions. The potential for using Oi to estimate nitrogenase activity in laboratory and field-grown legumes is discussed...|$|R
