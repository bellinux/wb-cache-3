40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, risk {{measurement}} {{has received a}} much needed amount of attention from the …nancial community. Risk measures based on …xed quantiles under the actual probability distribution, especially Value-at-Risk and its re…nement the Conditional Tail Expectation, were instrumental in capturing the attention of …nancial decision-makers. However, these were developed {{in a way that}} is inconsistent with economic theory. Consequently, these instruments possess characteristics that make them invalid risk measures for the purposes they intend to serve, be it informing life-cycle investors or guaranteeing the …rm’s capital adequacy through regulation. In particular, in addition to failing to guarantee the intregity of …nancial …rms when used for capital adequacy, these measures can eventually decrease with the investment horizon. Risk-neutral …xed-quantile measures are valid for framing life-cycle decisions because of their economic content. When endowed with a dynamic replication technology, Q-measure …xed-quantile risk measures become least-cost insurance contracts that may be used for capital adequacy considerations. However, no single quantile of the risk-neutral distribution can be used for the procurement of risk capital at all horizons. A risk-neutral varying-quantile instrument is needed. This unique instrument is a put option proposed by Merton-Perold (1993) and Bodie (1995). The Bodie-Merton-Perold Put is universally valid for both risk disclosure to investors and for the regulatory <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> at all horizons.

50|$|In this infographic example, {{there are}} four investors each with a {{different}} amount <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> that choose the same money manager. The money manager trades the entire capital, $100,000 total, on one master account (the money manager can only trade the accounts; no access to the investor’s funds is permitted to withdraw any money).

The paper extends the discussion to the layered risk financing approach and reinforces its importance. That is, cash flow engineering instruments are employed to match different segments of the loss distributions. The role <b>of</b> insurance <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> to assume extreme losses is further discussed, while reinsurance still remains a form of capital restructuring.

There are many kinds of methods or rules to allocate <b>risk</b> <b>capital.</b> However, they have flaws, such as non-continuity, unfairness. In {{order to get a}} better method, we propose a new risk measure to be the base <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation rule. Design/methodology/approach: We proposed two kinds of allocation methods: one is marginal risk contribution based on iso-entropic coherent risk measure(IE), the other one is to combine the minimal excess allocation(EBA) principle and IE into <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. The iso-entropic coherent risk measure has many advantages over others; it is continuous and more powerful in distinguishing risks, consistent with higher-order stochastic dominances than other risk measures. And EBA is consistent with the amount <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> which means fairness for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. Findings: Through cases, simulations and empirical application, it shows that these two allocation rules satisfy some good properties, can be more efficient, more precise and fairer. And the EBA based on IE may be the better one. Research limitations/implications: However, there are some problems still open. One is how to treat the negative value of allocation. Second is that the consistence between the allocated <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> and the amount <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> needs to be studied further. Originality/value: A good risk measure is very important for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. We proposed two methods to deal with <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation based on a new coherent risk measure called iso-entropic risk measure, which is smooth and consistent with higher-order stochastic dominance and has higher resolution <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> It shows that the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation rules based on iso-entropic risk measure are better than the other rules.
