For a transportation package containing substances that could generate hydrogen gas, the <b>package</b> <b>designer</b> should calculate the gas generation rate and ensure that it is limited to a molar quantity of no more than 5 percent by volume in the package over a 60 -day shipping period under standard temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the maximum normal operating pressure (MNOP) of the containment vessel should be designed below the design pressure. Therefore, the MNOP calculations should include the hydrogen gas generated in the payload and released into the inner cavity. <b>Package</b> <b>designers</b> have used various approaches to estimate hydrogen gas generation and demonstrate compliance with the regulatory limits. Because it may be difficult to directly measure the hydrogen gas concentrations during transportation operations, it is important that designers use consistent and reliable methods to evaluate hydrogen gas generation. This paper presents a generic evaluation approach for estimating hydrogen generation from radiolysis and thermal decomposition in generic transportation packages. It also presents the calculation of associated MNOP induced by the potential combined effects of radiolysis, thermal decomposition, thermal expansion, and water vapor. In addition, this paper discusses a generic inerting process commonly used to control combustible gases during the normal conditions of transport.

50|$|In 1950, Tscherny {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} <b>packaging</b> <b>designer</b> with Donald Deskey Associates. In 1953, Tscherny joined George Nelson & Associates, a firm {{in the vanguard of}} post-war Modernist design. Tscherny became an associate and head of the graphics department before leaving the Nelson office to open an independent design office in 1955.Tscherny began to teach in the same year. He was hired by the Cartoonist and Illustrators School (soon to become the School of Visual Arts) to establish a graphic design department and change the direction of the curriculum. He also designed a series of posters to appear in the subway that would reflect the new image and expanded goals of the school and later designed the school's current logo.The Tscherny design office quickly acquired a distinguished roster of institutional and corporate clients. Tscherny was appointed design consultant to the Ford Foundation. In 1955, he designed the first appointment calendar for the Museum of Modern Art. The Tscherny office designed comprehensive identification programs for United Aircraft, Texasgulf, and W.R. Grace, as well as corporate annual reports for RCA, American Can, Burlington Industries, Colgate Palmolive, General Dynamics, Johnson & Johnson, CPC International, Morgan Stanley, SEI Investments, Uris Buildings, Colonial Penn Group, Mickelberry Corp., and Overseas National Airways.A wide range of other assignments has included the design of a U.S. postage stamp commemorating Alexander Graham Bell and the centennial of the telephone, cigarette packaging for Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co., and illustrations for the Saturday Evening Post.

40|$|Thinking Keeping' is a creative, practice-based enquiry {{into the}} {{irreversible}} act of ‘breaking in’ to a sealed package. Breaking open a product’s packaging structures the user’s first experiences of owning the product, and reinforces {{perceptions of the}} product’s newness, perfection and desirability. It is a pivotal stage in the emotional lifetime of a product. Through creative methods we are subverting the experience of ‘breaking the seal’, by applying it to products {{that have already been}} owned and used. Our enquiry raises questions about the potential of packaging to overcome barriers to reuse, to help construct meaningful lasting relationships with products, and to challenge the desire for newness. We intend to expose contradictions in how consumers value, keep and destroy packaging. The research brings a new angle to research relating design to practices of keeping things and sustainable consumption (e. g. Chapman 2005, Fisher and Shipton 2010, Schifferstein et al 2008). Design can {{play a key role in}} influencing consumers’ relationships to their possessions, and designers are in a position to propose powerful ways of rethinking the relationship through creative, practice-based approaches. Our explorations are structured around sketching, prototyping, and data collection via exhibition. Working without the constraints of a commercial brief means that we can develop concepts that subvert expectations, and whose ambiguity prompts reflection and speculation. Thinking Keeping is a collaboration between a product designer, a <b>packaging</b> <b>designer,</b> and a jewellery designer...|$|E
40|$|Meeting {{the needs}} of both present and future generations forms the {{foundation}} of sustainable development. Concern about food demand is increasing alongside the continuously growing population. In the pursuit of food security preventing food waste is one solution avoiding the negative environmental impacts that result from producing food unnecessarily. Packages offer one answer to preventing food waste, as they 1) preserve and protect food, 2) introduce the user to the correct way to handle and use the food and package and 3) allow the user to consume the food in its entirety. This thesis aims to enhance the sustainability of food packages by giving special emphasis to preventing food waste. The focus of this thesis is to assist the <b>packaging</b> <b>designer</b> {{in being able to}} take into account the requirements for the sustainability of food packages and to be able to integrate these requirements into the product development process. In addition, life cycle methods that can be used as a tool in the packaging design process or in assessing the sustainability of finished food-packaging combinations are evaluated. The methods of life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle working environment (LCWE) are briefly discussed. The method of life cycle assessment (LCA) is examined more thoroughly through the lens of the literature review of food-package LCA case studies published in the 21 st century in three relevant journals. Based on this review and on experiences learned from conducting LCAs, recommendations are given as to how the LCA practitioner should conduct a food packaging study to make most of the results. Two case studies are presented in this thesis. The first case study relates the results of a life cycle assessment conducted for three food items (cold cut (ham), sliced dark bread (rye) and Soygurt drink) and the alternative packaging options of each. Results of this study show that the packaging constitutes only 1 – 12 % of the total environmental impacts of the food-packaging combination. The greatest effect is derived from the food itself and the wasted food. Even just a small percentage of wasted food causes more environmental impacts than does the packaging. The second case study presents the results of LCC and LCWE analysis done for fruit and vegetable transport packages. In this thesis, the specific results of the study itself are not the focus, but rather the study methods and scope are analysed based on how these complement the sustainability assessment of food packages. This thesis presents reasons why prevention of food waste should be more thoroughly taken into account in food packaging design. In addition, the task of the <b>packaging</b> <b>designer</b> is facilitated by the requirements of sustainable food packaging, by the methods and step-by-step guidance on how to integrate sustainability issues into the design process, and by the recommendations on how to assess the sustainability of food packages. The intention of this thesis is to express the issues that are important in the field of the food packaging industry. Having recognised and implemented these issues, businesses can better manage the risks that could follow from neglecting these sustainability aspects...|$|E
