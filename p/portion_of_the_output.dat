2500|$|If {{predictable}} {{operation is}} desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>output</b> voltage to the inverting input. The closed-loop feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. [...] When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, {{rather than by}} the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response AOL does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. [...] The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in analog computers. High input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.|$|E

50|$|Brown {{diamonds}} are {{the most}} common color variety of natural diamonds. In most mines, brown diamonds account for 15% of production. The brown color makes them less attractive as gemstones because of the reduced glimmer, and most are used for industrial purposes.
