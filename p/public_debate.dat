40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} study is to examine whether it is possible to use the method of reflective equilibrium in order to enhance the usefulness of <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> as a support for political decision-making. Since <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> from political quarters are seen as an important tool for policy-making, the need for a rational assessment of the views put forward in such debates are important. And since reflective equilibrium aims for coherence between judgments on different levels – intuitions, principles and theories, which all are put forward in <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> – the point of departure for this theses is that this method could be useful for the matter of bringing some kind of structure to <b>public</b> <b>debates.</b> The analysis in this study shows that there actually are similarities between the method of reflective equilibrium and the course of <b>public</b> <b>debates,</b> since they both are characterized by the fact that viewpoints are mutually scrutinized in the light of one another. Further, it is argued that a more systematic applying of the method of reflective equilibrium would further the justification force of the outcome of <b>public</b> <b>debates,</b> since the method stresses the need of rationality and the importance of taking all relevant opinions into consideration. Therefore, the conclusion is that applying reflective equilibrium to <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> could make the political decision-making more democratic...|$|R
