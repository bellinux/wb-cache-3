5000|$|The MTL <b>prompting</b> {{procedure}} (Cuvo, Leaf, & Borakove, 1978) removes <b>prompts</b> {{by moving}} through a hierarchy from most restrictive to less restrictive. The MTL <b>prompting</b> procedure {{begins with the}} most restrictive <b>prompt,</b> usually a physical <b>prompt.</b> After the learner has received reinforcement for completing the task with physical <b>prompts,</b> a less restrictive <b>prompt</b> is given (e.g., a partial physical <b>prompt),</b> and then an even less restrictive <b>prompt</b> (e.g., verbal <b>prompt).</b> Usually, a specific criterion is set for each <b>prompt</b> change (e.g., {{after three days of}} correct performance of the behavior {{with the use of a}} partial physical <b>prompt,</b> a verbal <b>prompt</b> will be used). If the individual fails to perform the behavior correctly with the less intrusive <b>prompt,</b> the instructor would return to a more intrusive <b>prompt</b> for a specified number of trials. Eventually, the discriminative stimulus for the behavior is the typically occurring stimulus (e.g., when lunch is finished, student independently goes to the sink to wash hands) or the direction (e.g., when teacher says [...] "Class, it is time to sit in your desks", the student sits in his desk).|$|R
50|$|A <b>prompt</b> is a cue or {{assistance}} {{to encourage the}} desired response from an individual. <b>Prompts</b> are often categorized into a <b>prompt</b> hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive. There is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive: physically intrusive versus hardest <b>prompt</b> to fade (i.e., verbal). In a faultless learning approach, <b>prompts</b> are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically to ensure the individual experiences {{a high level of}} success. There may be instances in which a least-to-most <b>prompt</b> method is preferred. <b>Prompts</b> are faded systematically and as quickly as possible to avoid <b>prompt</b> dependency. The goal of teaching using <b>prompts</b> would be to fade <b>prompts</b> towards independence, so that no <b>prompts</b> are needed for the individual to perform the desired behavior.|$|R

5000|$|Response <b>Prompting</b> Procedures are {{systematic}} {{strategies used}} {{to increase the}} probability of correct responding and opportunities for positive reinforcement for learners by providing and then systematically removing <b>prompts.</b> Response <b>prompting</b> is sometimes called [...] "errorless" [...] learning because teaching using these procedures usually results in few errors by the learner. The goal of response <b>prompting</b> is to transfer stimulus control from the <b>prompt</b> to the desired discriminative stimulus. Several response <b>prompting</b> procedures are commonly used in special education research: (a) system of least <b>prompts,</b> (b) most to least <b>prompting,</b> (c) progressive and constant time delay, and (d) simultaneous <b>prompting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SLP <b>prompting</b> {{procedure}} {{uses and}} removes <b>prompts</b> by moving through a hierarchy from less to more restrictive <b>prompts.</b> If the student emits the correct behavior {{at any point}} during this instructional trial (with or without <b>prompts),</b> reinforcement is provided. The system of least <b>prompts</b> gives the learner the opportunity to exhibit the correct response with the least restrictive level of <b>prompting</b> needed. Because teachers are required to use multiple types of <b>prompts</b> (e.g., verbal and physical <b>prompts),</b> the SLP <b>prompting</b> procedure may be complicated for use in typical settings, but may be similar to non-systematic teaching procedures typically used by teachers that involve giving learners an opportunity to exhibit a behavior independently before providing a <b>prompt.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{first class}} {{includes}} systems that pose <b>prompts</b> {{to students and}} {{have proven to be}} effective in supporting cognitive and meta-cognitive learning strategies (Glogger et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2002). <b>Prompts</b> are hints or questions that induce productive learning processes. <b>Prompting</b> assumes that learners already know certain learning strategies, but that they are not able to apply them appropriately. <b>Prompts</b> are supposed to overcome the deficiency of applying learning strategies, that is, a student’s lack of application of a helpful strategy that is already in a student’s repertoire (Glogger et al. 2009; Flavell 1978). <b>Prompts</b> {{can also be used to}} support journal writing. Writing learning journals, students are instructed to write down a text in which they reflect on the previous classes’ learning contents and their learning process. Berthold et al.
