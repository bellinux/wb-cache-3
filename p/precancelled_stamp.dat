50|$|<b>Precancelled</b> <b>stamps</b> and service-inscribed stamps are {{not usually}} tagged because they need not be routed through the {{cancelling}} equipment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>precanceled</b> <b>stamp,</b> or <b>precancel</b> for short, is a {{postage stamp}} that has been {{cancelled}} before being affixed to mail.|$|R
50|$|<b>Precanceled</b> <b>stamps</b> are {{typically}} used by mass mailers, who {{can save the}} postal system time and effort by prearranging to use the precancels, and delivering the stamped mail ready for sorting. Precancels were also used on newspaper wrappers in Canada, Austria and Great Britain. The postal administration will typically offer an incentive {{in the form of}} a reduced price for <b>precanceled</b> <b>stamps</b> in volume. <b>Precancels</b> cannot normally be purchased by the general public, although they are often seen in one's daily mail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Precancel</b> <b>Stamp</b> Society, {{formed in}} 1922 from two previously-existing clubs, {{specializes in the}} study of precancels. A number of catalogs list all the types of precancels issued in the {{countries}} that use them.|$|R
5000|$|Precancels for {{official}} government use are fastidiously prepared, but other kinds {{are almost always}} [...] "heavy cancels" [...] which deliberately obliterate much of a stamp's design. For this reason, <b>precancelled</b> <b>stamps</b> are usually left unrepresented in philatelic collections.|$|R
5000|$|Postage Payment: All mailpieces {{must include}} {{appropriate}} valid postage. Postage payment {{may be in}} the form of <b>stamps,</b> <b>stamped</b> stationery, <b>precanceled</b> <b>stamps,</b> postage meter imprints & PC Postage products ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), or permit imprint (indicia). Members of the U.S. Congress, among others, have franking privileges, which require only a signature.|$|R
25|$|<b>Precancels</b> are <b>stamps</b> {{that have}} been issued with printed {{cancellations}} on them, typically to mass mailers. Precancels cannot normally {{be used by the}} general public.|$|R
5000|$|On cover - An {{envelope}} {{bearing a}} used plate number coil stamp with a contemporary postmark tying the stamp to the envelope. Many collectors prefer the cover {{to have the}} correct postage and proper stamp or stamps used for the envelope. An example of an improper use is to combine many <b>precanceled</b> <b>stamps</b> and older issues on an envelope as payment for a first class postage. Although this practice is allowed by the Post Office, most collectors find this and stamp collector contrived or philatelic covers less desirable.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956 Smythies' {{interest}} {{shifted to}} Canadian stamps and postal history. He focused on British North America but also included Canadian cancels, duplex cancels, registered <b>stamps,</b> <b>precancels,</b> rollers, secret dates, Admirals and perforations. Forgers held {{a special interest}} for Smythies: these include Jean de Sperati, Angelo Panelli and Philip Spiro ...|$|R
5000|$|Franking {{refers to}} any devices, markings, or {{combinations}} thereof ("franks") applied to mails of any class which qualifies {{them to be}} postally serviced. Types of franks include uncanceled and <b>precanceled</b> postage <b>stamps</b> (both adhesive and printed on postal stationery), impressions applied via postage meter (via so-called [...] "postage evidencing systems"), official use [...] "Penalty" [...] franks, Business Reply Mail (BRM), and other permit Imprints (Indicia), manuscript and facsimile [...] "franking privilege" [...] signatures, [...] "soldier's mail" [...] markings, and any other forms authorized by the 191 postal administrations that {{are members of the}} Universal Postal Union.|$|R
40|$|Another y e a r {{comes to}} its close, the 49 th {{one for the}} Perfins Club. Once again we can list some accomplishments in our field. During 1992 we {{produced}} "The American pages" of The World Perfins Catalog as a complete unit. At the same time, we have continued to pro-duce pages of the African coun-tries in The Perfins Bulletin and soon will start with the p ages of the Asian countries. We have finally gotten off the ground with our development of the new U. S. Catalog. Cata-log Editor, John Randall is hard at work preparing the ma-terial for our BUlletin editor, John Lyding, wh o is doing the t yping. Randa l l is preparing t h e material t o match up t he printed p age s and s oo n we will be asking members t o mount a nd prepare such pages for us.
