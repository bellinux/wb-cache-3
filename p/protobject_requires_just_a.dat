50|$|Common argon and krypton lasers {{are capable}} of {{emitting}} continuous-wave (CW) output of several milliwatts to tens of watts. Their tubes are usually made from nickel end bells, kovar metal-to-ceramic seals, beryllium oxide ceramics, or tungsten disks mounted on a copper heat spreader in a ceramic liner. The earliest tubes were simple quartz, followed by quartz with graphite disks. In comparison with the helium-neon lasers that <b>require</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few milliamperes, the current used for pumping the krypton laser is several amperes, as the gas has to be ionized. The ion laser tube produces a lot of waste heat and requires active cooling.|$|R

In this work, we exploit a Broyden-based input space mapping (SM) algorithm with both fine and coarse models implemented with the finite-element method (FEM), to efficiently optimize design parameters of a modern package interconnect. This optimization algorithm has been applied to a single-ended package line resulting in a significant decrease of the return loss in the 5 - 10 GHz range, <b>requiring</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few fine model evaluations...|$|R

A 'single-shot', rapid texture measurement on a high-count-rate instrument can be of considerable benefit for studying materials at non-ambient conditions or for bulky samples that cannot be mounted on a goniometer. The capabilities of GEM for texture analysis are demonstrated with results on copper texture standards, which were studied to accompany diffraction analyses of archaeological objects. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{semi-automatic}} system that converts conventional video shots to stereoscopic video pairs. The system <b>requires</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few user-scribbles in a sparse set of frames. The system combines a diffusion scheme, which {{takes into account}} the local saliency and the local motion at each video location, coupled with a classification scheme that assigns depth to image patches. The system tolerates both scene motion and camera motion. In typical shots, containing hundreds of frames, {{even in the face of}} significant motion, it is enough to mark scribbles on the first and last frames of the shot. Once marked, plausible stereo results are obtained in a matter of seconds, leading to a scalable video conversion system. Finally, we validate our results with ground truth stereo video. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We discuss ways {{to enhance}} the {{location}} privacy of Bluetooth. The principal weakness of Bluetooth with respect to location privacy lies in its disclosure of a device’s permanent identifier, which makes location tracking easy. Bluetooth’s permanent identifier is often disclosed {{and it is also}} tightly integrated into lower layers of the Bluetooth stack, and hence susceptible to leakage. We survey known location privacy attacks against Bluetooth, generalize a lesser-known attack, and describe and quantify a more novel attack. The second of these attacks, which recovers a 28 -bit identifier via the device’s frequency hop pattern, <b>requires</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few packets and is practicable. Based on a realistic usage scenario, we develop an enhanced privacy framework with stronger unlinkability, using protected stateful pseudonyms and simple primitives...|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of static RAM (SRAM) {{is that it}} is much faster than dynamic RAM. Its disadvantage is its high price. SRAM does not need continuous electrical refreshes, but it still requires constant current to sustain the difference in voltage. In general, SRAM needs less power than DRAM, even though the power requirements differ based on the computer's clock speed. At moderate speeds SRAM usually <b>requires</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> fraction of the power used by DRAM. When idle, the power requirements of static RAM are low. Every single bit in a static RAM chip needs a cell of six transistors, whereas dynamic RAM requires only one capacitor and one transistor. As a result, SRAM is unable to accomplish the storage capabilities of the DRAM family.|$|R
