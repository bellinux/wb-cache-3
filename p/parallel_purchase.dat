40|$|Abstract: Individuals {{routinely}} devote time to skill acquisition by pursuing {{activities such}} as formal schooling, formal employer-provided training, and informal on-the-job training. Here, we use a business-cycle model to analyze the general-equilibrium implications of a representative agent’s decision to devote time to skill acquisition; we also use the model to make inferences regarding the behavior of aggregate skill-acquisition activities. Under the model, investment {{of time in the}} acquisition of skills increases the stock of human capital available for use in production activities in the following period. In <b>parallel,</b> <b>purchases</b> of the physical investment good increase the stock of physical capital available for use in production activities in the following period. We use aggregate data on consumption, investment and labor hours to formally estimate the parameters of the model, and then use the estimated model and the observed data to infer the aggregate behavior of skill-acquisition activities. We find that these activities have important cyclical implications, and follow a distinct countercyclical pattern. We also find that they exhibit a systematic correspondence with time-series data on U. S. college enrollments. Corresponding author...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the patronage and collecting of Alexander, l 0 th Duke of Hamilton, premier peer of Scotland, son-in-law of the maniacal collector William Beckford, and arguably the greatest collector {{in the history}} of Scotland. Using archival evidence from many sources, it begins with investigations of the Duke's early collecting of Italian Renaissance paintings and manuscripts, acquisitions associated with Russia between 1807 and 1814, involvement with Princess Pauline Borghese and the Bonaparte family, and purchases of porphyry and marble in Rome between 1817 and 1827. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the extension and refurbishment of Hamilton Palace between 1822 and 1832 and <b>parallel</b> <b>purchases</b> of furniture, furnishings and applied art. Special attention is paid to motivation and the acquisition of items from the Fonthill sale, tapestries made for Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, furniture owned by Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon's 1810 tea service, bronze statues (wrongly) associated with Francis I of France - which served to underline the Duke's status and "support" his claim to the French dukedom of Chatellerault - and porphyry busts of Roman emperors that were "superior" to the bronze copies in the British royal collection. Chapter 7 reviews the last grand projects: the extremely expensive great black marble staircase, planned equestrian monument of the Duke as Marcus Aurelius, and Hamilton Mausoleum. The final chapter concentrates on the later purchases of Classical items and plaster copies, second marble bust of Princess Pauline, Thorvaldsen 's Napoleon Apotheosized, and Old Master paintings, and discusses how the Duke displayed his collection, in colourways, running sequences, clusters, and "end statements". A "post mortem " conclusion sketches out the continuity of collecting Napoleonic material, {{as a consequence of the}} Duke's son and heir's marriage to the daughter of the adopted daughter of Napoleon and cousin of Napoleon Ill and the dispersal of the collection and demolition of Hamilton Palace between 1880 and 1930...|$|R
25|$|In 1988, Monitor Reports was {{supplanted by}} a nightly half-hour news show, World Monitor, which was {{broadcast}} by the Discovery Channel. The program was anchored by veteran journalist John Hart. The Church then purchased a Boston cable TV station for elaborate in-house programming production. In <b>parallel,</b> the church <b>purchased</b> a shortwave radio station and syndicated radio production to National Public Radio. However, revenues fell {{far short of}} optimistic predictions by church managers, who had ignored early warnings by members and media experts.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{concept of}} the IWR was {{proposed}} in 1985 and accepted by the UniversitySenate two years later. After securing the necessary finances, the first <b>parallel</b> computer was <b>purchased</b> in 1989. The Graduiertenkolleg"Modellierung und Wissenschaftliches Rechnen in Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften" [...] (Modelling and Scientific Computing in Mathematics and the Sciences) was established in 1992 and evaluated by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in 1994 and 1998. Since 1994, the IWR has grown in size and resources {{and will continue to}} do so.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} motor trams of the GT8N series were delivered, the VAG {{was able to}} offer its {{passengers}} a low-floor entry starting from 1990. This {{was to be the}} third tramway network to do so after Würzburg and Bremen. The rapid development of low-floor technology during these years reflected in Freiburg's way of obtaining trams. If the first trams only had a ow-floor section of seven percent and therefore a depth rise of five doors, the second low-floor generation of 1994 had a low-floor section of 48 percent and barrier-free access to three out of the four doors. From 1999, only low-floor units were <b>purchased.</b> <b>Parallel</b> to investments in vehicle parking, VAG equipped almost all older stops across the network to have 24 centimetre high platforms.|$|R
5000|$|The Hawkins {{sections}} {{were written by}} Twain; these include several humorous sketches. Examples are the steamboat race {{that leads to a}} wreck (Chapter IV) and Laura’s toying with a clerk in a Washington bookstore (Chapter XXXVI). Notable too is the comic presence throughout the book of the eternally optimistic and eternally broke Micawber-like character, Colonel Beriah Sellers. The character was named Escol Sellers in the first edition and changed to Beriah when an actual George Escol Sellers of Philadelphia objected. A real Beriah Sellers then also turned up, causing Twain to use the name Mulberry Sellers in The American Claimant. The Sellers character was modeled after Twain's maternal cousin, James Lampton, and the land-purchase plot <b>parallels</b> Twain's father's <b>purchase</b> of a Tennessee parcel whose prospective sale, Twain wrote in his autobiography, [...] "kept us hoping and hoping, during 40 years, and forsook us at last".|$|R
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{has become}} a key {{instrument}} for climate change mitigation. Parties with emission targets are using it to buy greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for compliance against the Protocol's emission reduction targets. In <b>parallel,</b> the <b>purchase</b> of emission reductions through a voluntary carbon market {{has become a}} mainstream practice across business and individuals who, although not having any regulatory mandate, aim to offset their emissions. This voluntary market relies on mitigation projects {{which may or may}} not follow the standards of the CDM. This review compares these two instruments and traces similarities and differences in terms of project types, offset quality and contribution to sustainable development. It is shown that both mechanisms support a wide range of mitigation options and technologies, and differ considerably in the contribution of forestry and industrial gas offsets to their markets. There is not enough empirical data to assess the actual additionality and quality of produced offsets and their contribution to national and local sustainable development also requires further empirical assessment. Large scale mitigation options provide a substantial percentage of GHG reductions in both markets, with methane-based mitigation and fuel switching dominating over renewable investments such as solar and tidal. Africa remains the least benefited continent in both schemes. The review supports proposals towards reforming the CDM so that the least developed countries can also participate in a transition towards a decarbonised global society. Voluntary markets, in turn, are likely to remain driven by investors' willingness to support projects which are in line with poor countries' demands and priorities...|$|R
5000|$|In Case E-2/97 Mag Instruments a <b>parallel</b> {{importer}} <b>purchased</b> Maglite flashlights in California, {{where they}} were manufactured, and imported them into Norway without the manufacturer’s and trade mark owner’s consent. According to established Norwegian law, international exhaustion applied to trade marks. The EFTA Court held that under the First Trade Mark Directive 89/104/EEC, the EFTA States were entitled to opt for the international exhaustion of trade mark rights. The Court emphasized that they retained their sovereignty in foreign trade matters. Unlike the EC Treaty, the EEA Agreement did not establish a customs union, but an enhanced free trade area. The purpose and {{the scope of the}} EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement are therefore different. According to Article 8 EEA, the principle of free movement of goods as laid down in Articles 11 to 13 EEA applies only to goods originating in the EEA, while in the Community a product is in free circulation once it has been lawfully placed on the market in a Member State. In general, the latter applies {{in the context of the}} EEA only with respect to products originating in the EEA. In the case at hand, the product was manufactured in the United States and imported into Norway. Accordingly, it was not subject to the principle of the free movement of goods within the EEA. Based on this, the EFTA Court rejected the argument put forward by the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as by the European Commission that giving the EEA/EFTA States the right to opt for international exhaustion would lead to disparities in the EEA market. Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was interpreted so that it was for the EEA/EFTA States’ legislatures and courts to decide whether they wanted to introduce or to maintain the principle of international exhaustion of trade mark rights with regard to goods originating from outside the EEA. The EFTA Court found that international exhaustion was in the interest of free trade and competition and thus in the interest of consumers. Furthermore, the principle of international exhaustion was in line with the main function of a trade mark, to allow the consumer to identify with certainty the origin of the products. This interpretation of Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was also consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, which left the issue open for the Member States to regulate.|$|R
