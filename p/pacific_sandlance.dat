50|$|Fish {{species of}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes personatus) {{is found in}} fairly large number in the harbor. They feed on crustaceans, {{barnacle}} larve, copepods, and chaetognaths. They in turn are the food chain and form the feed source for marine mammals, birds and other species of fish. Seals are spotted, ringed, and bearded species; spotted is seen when the sea is calm (seals and seal oil form the staple diet {{of the people who}} live on the shores of the harbor in towns like Teller). Herring, whitefish, starry flounder, pike and tomcod are netted during spring, fall and midsummer. All five salmon species are found here of which red salmon is the primary catch and they migrate inland to the Salmon Lake to breed. Chum salmon migrate to the Pilgrim River and Agiapuk River. King salmon are rare.|$|E

40|$|Although the <b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) {{is known}} to burrow into soft marine {{sediment}} to escape predation and conserve energy, {{few studies have examined}} its use of intertidal habitat in winter. I characterized intertidal sandlance habitat at a North Puget Sound beach in relation to tide height, oxygen concentration, and sediment size. The density of sandlance increased significantly as elevation in the intertidal decreased from 0. 00 /m 2 at 0. 61 m above mean lower low water (MLLW) to 5. 00 /m 2 at - 0. 30 m below MLLW. There were no significant differences among depths to which sandlance were buried at three elevations (0. 30, 0. 00, and - 0. 30 m) in the intertidal zone (mean = 5. 0 cm, range = 4. 0 - 6. 0 cm). The oxygen content of interstitial water at 0. 30 m above MLLW tended to be lower at 6. 0 cm (26. 56 mm Hg) than at 4. 0 cm (31. 84 mm Hg) in depth but did not change during a low tide cycle when sediments were exposed to air. Additionally, there was no significant interaction between time of exposure and depth on interstitial water oxygen content. The oxygen tension of interstitial water at 0. 30 m above MLLW was approximately one fifth of the saturated value (oxygen content of water in equilibrium with air) shortly after being exposed by receding tide and remained near this level until the site was reinundated with the incoming tide. This oxygen level is near the suspected anaerobic metabolism threshold for sandlance. Disturbances that lower interstitial oxygen levels or change the size of beach sediments could adversely affect intertidal aggregations of sandlanceQuinn "Habitat characteristics of an intertidal aggregation of <b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) at a North Puget Sound beach in Washington.

50|$|Species that co-occur with redtail surfperch on ocean beaches {{include the}} silver surfperch, <b>Pacific</b> staghorn sculpin, <b>sandlance,</b> Dungeness crab, shiner perch, mole crab, Pacific razor clam, sandhoppers and other {{crustaceans}}. Sandlance and crustaceans are eaten by the redtail surfperch. Redtail surfperch are documented {{to include a}} significant amount of fish in their diet unlike many other surfperch. Harbor seals are observed swimming and diving in areas where redtail surfperch were being caught; the fish often stop biting and may move when harbor seals arrive. Sea lions have been observed surfing in waves just offshore of redtail surfperch fishing beaches but not as close in-shore as harbor seals. Newborn silver surfperch co-occur with neonate redtail surfperch along Oregon beaches; however the silver surfperch are born smaller and up to two months earlier. Stranded-decaying kelp, seagrass, invasive marsh grass as well as plankton and bacteria contribute energy and nutrients to this beach ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 The {{diet and}} feeding {{behavior}} of maturing sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were investigated {{during the final}} marine phase of the spawning migration, prior to reentering natal streams. The stomach contents of commercially caught sockeye salmon, migrating within the nearshore waters of the Kodiak Archipelago during 1998 and 1999, were examined to determine the level of feeding activity and taxa of dominant prey items. Samples were collected throughout {{the majority of the}} migration (early June to late August) from areas known to be used principally as migration corridors, and from areas proximate to several natal streams. Dominant prey of sockeye salmon were decapod larvae, <b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus), and the pteropod Limacina helicina. Feeding activity levels and dominant prey taxa varied both between areas and within areas over time. Feeding activity levels for the population appear to gradually diminish, rather than abruptly ceasing, as sockeye approach their natal streams to spawn...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 20, 2014 - Sept. 20, 2014 In the last decade, the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem has experienced a trend of increased severity of upwelling-driven coastal hypoxia. This thesis strove to examine the potential upper trophic level impacts of moderate and severe hypoxia in the CCLME. Initially I conducted a literature review of Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) diet in the regions of Oregon and Washington. Thirteen papers were reviewed which detailed harbor seal foraging studies in Washington, Oregon and the Columbia River from 1931 until 2012. 148 prey species or genera were described in harbor seal diet in Oregon, Washington and the Columbia River. Accordingly, I created energetic individual-based models of harbor seal spatial foraging behavior in response to hypoxia-related habitat compression for three predominant prey species, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), English sole (Parophyrs vetulus) and <b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus). The model was composed of three submodels which simulated hypoxia and spatial foraging, foraging energetics, and dive mechanics. Hypoxia was scaled from 0 {{to a level of}} 1, which represented a severe inner-shelf hypoxic or anoxic event in which up to 80...|$|E
40|$|The short-tailed shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris is an apex {{predator}} in {{the southeastern}} Bering Sea ecosystem. During 1997 to 1999, a period of great variability in the Bering Sea, we used a multi-pronged approach to study transfer of carbon and nitrogen to short-tailed shearwaters through analysis of stomach contents of birds collected while foraging, and stable isotope and fatty acid composition of tissues from shearwaters and their prey. Two conclusions result from these 3 analyses of feeding history. First, short-tailed shearwaters demonstrated localized differences in diet with respect to sampling location and season, indicating that shearwaters feed in discrete locations long enough (several weeks) to reflect regional differences in prey availability. Second, elevated δ 15 N levels (∼ 1 to 2 ‰) in the liver of shearwaters {{in the fall of}} 1997 and 1998 were likely a response to nutritional stress and overturn of nutrients in the tissues of birds or elevated isotope levels in tissues of prey, rather than an increase in the trophic level of the diet. Over the 3 yr period, shearwater diets switched from adult euphausiids Thysanoessa raschii and T. inermis (usually females with spermatophores) taken in spring to an increase in the amount of fish (<b>Pacific</b> <b>sandlance</b> Ammodytes hexapterus), juvenile Gadidae fishes and larval walleye pollock Theragra chalcograma particularly in fall (1997 excepted). For each location and year, there was a consistent trend in isotopic values, with an increase of 3 to 5 ‰ for δ 15 N and 1 to 3 ‰ for δ 13 C between shearwaters and their primary prey. The resolution of our sampling techniques indicates little movement of shearwater flocks among sample locations for periods of up to several weeks. © Inter-Research 2006...|$|E
