40|$|Excerpt] Two {{days after}} the November 1932 elections, newly elected California congressman Frank H. Buck {{provoked}} a massive tree <b>pruners</b> 2 ̆ 7 strike when he announced a wage cut for <b>pruners</b> on his ranch from 1. 40 for an eight-hour day to 1. 25 for a nine-hour day. Buck, one the largest growers in the Vacaville fruit growing region, had raised wages to 1. 40 during his congressional campaign, promising farmworkers even higher wages if he won the election. Running under the campaign slogan 2 ̆ 2 Give Government Back to the People, 2 ̆ 2 Buck garnered nearly unanimous support from farmworkers in the Vacaville area. Within days of his victory, after securing the agreement of other orchardists in the area, Buck announced that the 20 percent wage cut would go into effect starting November 14. On the day the pay cut was to go into effect, 400 Mexican, Filipino, Japanese, and white tree <b>pruners</b> walked off their jobs. Unlike previous agricultural strikes in the region, {{this was not a}} spontaneous walkout. Unbeknownst to Buck, the Communist-led Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAW 1 U) had been actively organizing workers in the area for several months. By the time Buck made his announcement, more than 250 working tree <b>pruners</b> had joined the union, and strike plans were well developed. The tree <b>pruners</b> 2 ̆ 7 strike was to be the first deliberately organized strike since the CAWIU had started organizing California agricultural workers three years before...|$|R

After completing his MA, <b>Pruner</b> moved to Ellinwood, KS, where he rented a small studio that he shared with another artist. When his studio-mate destroyed the studio (and eight years of Pruner's work), <b>Pruner</b> moved to rural Stafford County, where his mother owned 40 acres of land. On this remote property, <b>Pruner</b> moved a 1950s-era bus, which he converted into his studio and living space.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of human parsing using part-based models. In particular, we {{consider}} part-based models that ex-ploit rich pairwise relationship between parts, e. g. the color symmetry between left/right limbs. This poses a computa-tional challenge since the state space of each part is very large, and algorithmic tricks (e. g. the distance transform) cannot be applied to handle these types of pairwise relationships. We propose to prune the state space of each part using a cas-cade of <b>pruners.</b> These <b>pruners</b> can filter out 99. 6 % of the states per part to about 500 states per part, while keeping the ground-truth states in the pruned state most of the time. In the pruned space, we can afford to apply human parsing mod-els with more complex pairwise relationships between parts, such as the color symmetry. We demonstrate our method on a challenging human parsing dataset. Index Terms — human pose estimation, gesture analysis 1...|$|R
