There was a wide variety in reported capacity for self care but two patterns are isolated: those who were active initiators with a self perception of independence and <b>passive</b> <b>responders</b> with a perception of dependence.

50|$|Fug 126: By 1944 the Germans {{were aware}} of the {{operating}} concept of the British Rebecca/Eureka system and the Oboe and G-H systems via captured examples. From this they developed the Baldur system. This was a system or <b>responder</b> <b>beacons</b> working at 2-4 Meters wavelength. The airborne equipment FuG 126 was based on the SN2 radar. Accuracy was +- 100 meters. The system seems to have only deployed in small numbers as bomber operations were ceasing due to the air forces concentration just on fighters and CAS. A variant called FuG162k was produced for single seat fighter (reduced accuracy +- 500 meters) operation but it seems never to have been used.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Sociology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011 The {{present study}} explores {{the process of}} and changes in social {{interaction}} of women who recently completed a women???s self-defense course. Eighteen women from three different courses participated in semi-structured interviews and answered questions related to changes they experienced in their interactions at home, at work, and in public spaces {{as a result of}} taking their course. The qualitative analysis was performed looking through the lens of social interaction. It was found that situational awareness, perspective-taking, and self-perceptions of efficacy were powerfully affected by taking a women???s self-defense course. Implications for future research include the potential for perspective-taking as an intentional pedagogical tool to help both aggressive and <b>passive</b> <b>responders.</b> Sociolog...|$|R
50|$|Transit-time {{measurement}} underlies most {{radio navigation}} systems for boats and aircraft, for example, radar and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation LORAN-C. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent {{out by the}} vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a <b>responder</b> <b>beacon.</b> The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the global positioning system a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with {{the time they were}} sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the transit time can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.|$|R
40|$|Children, and schools, are potent {{symbols of}} {{victimhood}} in industrial disasters. In {{the case of}} historical industrial disasters such as Aberfan and Flixborough, {{and in terms of}} preparation for future industrial disasters under Control of Major Accident Hazard regulations, communities are seen as <b>passive</b> <b>responders</b> to accidents. Moreover, following industrial accidents, communities are frequently accused of culpability or profiting from the disaster. There is hence a double pathologisation in play, with communities seen as comprising passive victims and manipulative survivors. Using an historical approach, the official accounts of the Aberfan and Flixborough industrial accidents are challenged with a focus on schools and children. Rather than being passive victims of these accidents, schools and children demonstrated agency in terms of their tacit knowledge, reporting potential accidents and recording their consequences. This provides a lens through which to interrogate current policy on industrial safety as it relates to schools and communities...|$|R
40|$|In a {{changing}} employment climate {{and with the}} growth of demand for careers guidance at all stages of life, careers guidance practice has moved from its positivist world view, with the counsellor as expert and client as <b>passive</b> <b>responder,</b> to more holistic 2 ̆ 7 constructivist 2 ̆ 7 approaches. In essence, these approaches view the career as a holistic concept in which work and personal life are inextricably intertwined, and individuals are experts in their own lives, actively constructing their careers. The first to fully explore the constructivist approach, this book: provides a theoretical background to constructivism; outlines a range of constructivist approaches to career counselling; and gives examples of the practical application of constructivism. Essential for anyone involved in career guidance wishing to learn more about this vital new approach, this book combines theory with practicable guidance, and represents a new direction for career counselling...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} Austrian school of economics is its emphasis on the methodological foundations of economics and social sciences in general. The two pillars of the approach of this school are methodological individualism and subjectivism. The purpose of this essay {{is not only to}} identify a few of the principles with which most Austrians are in agreement but also to emphasise significant diversity within their common viewpoint. An accent is put on praxeology introduced by Mises and Hayek's requirement of "empirical elements" concerning the processes of human learning. It is further emphasised that within this diversity has run and continues to run a common thread of emphasis on man as an intentional, creative being, an actor rather than a mere <b>passive</b> <b>responder</b> to given constraints and circumstances. The essay treats the development of the Austrian methodology mainly under the separate heads of its individual contributors. methodology, Austrian school, individualism, subjectivism, knowledge, human action, non-mathematical approach, ignorance, praxeology...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} three-player {{game in which}} a {{proposer}} makes a suggestion on how to split $ 10 with a <b>passive</b> <b>responder.</b> The offer is accepted or rejected depending on the strategy pro le of a neutral third-party whose payoffs are independent from his decisions. If the offer is accepted the split takes place as suggested, if rejected, then both proposer and receiver get $ 0. Our results show a decision-maker whose main concern {{is to reduce the}} inequality between proposer and responder and who, in order to do so, is willing to reject both selfish and generous offers. This pattern of rejections is robust through a series of treatments which include changing the "flat-fee" payoff of the decision-maker, introducing a monetary cost for the decision-maker in case the offer ends up in a rejection, or letting a computer replace the proposer to randomly make the splitting suggestion between proposer and responder. Further, through these different treatments we are able to show that decision-makers ignore the intentions behind the proposers suggestions, as well as ignoring their own relative payoffs, two surprising results given the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{profession}} of a miner {{is one of}} the most dangerous in the world. Among the main causes of fatalities in underground coal mines are the delayed alert of the accident and the lack of information regarding the actual location of the miners after the accident. In an emergency situation (failure or destruction of underground infrastructure), personnel search behind and beneath blockage needs to be performed urgently. However, none of the standard technologies – radio-frequency identification (RFID), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Wi-Fi, emitting cables, which use the stationary technical devices in mines – provide information about the miners location with the necessary precision. The only technology that is able to provide guaranteed delivery of messages to mine personnel, regardless of their location and under any destruction in the mine, is low-frequency radio technology, which is able to operate through the thickness of rocks even if they are wet. The proposed new system for miner localization is based on solving the inverse problem of determining the magnetic field source coordinates using the data of magnetic field measurements. This approach is based on the measurement of the magnetic field radiated by the miner's <b>responder</b> <b>beacon</b> using two fixed and spaced three-component magnetic field receivers and the inverse problem solution. As a result, a working model of the system for miner's beacon search and localization (MILES – MIner's Location Emergency System) was developed and successfully tested. This paper presents the most important aspects of this development and the results of experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|By {{measuring}} the lactate response {{it is possible}} to determine whether a teleost is able to adapt to a certain oxygen level. It is hypothesized that recovery will occur at oxygen levels above the critical oxygen level (PO 2) (crit) reflected by a transient lactate increase. In contrast, continuous lactate accumulation occurs at oxygen levels below the (PO 2) (crit), which will be lethal in case of prolonged exposure. Since catecholamines as well as cortisol increase the availability of glucose, it is expected that these stress hormones are involved in the activation of the anaerobic metabolism. Common carp and rainbow trout were cannulated and exposed to stepwise decreasing oxygen levels. At each oxygen level blood samples were taken at several time-points and analyzed for plasma lactate, adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. The results show that both individual and inter-specific differences in lactate response occur during exposure to hypoxia. These differences can be associated with observed differences in behaviour. Whereas carp stayed quiet during the hypoxia treatment, trout displayed individually different behaviour. In contrast to the <b>passive</b> <b>responders,</b> the active responding trout did not survive as a result of continuous lactate accumulation. Interestingly, both in carp and trout a strong correlation exists between the lactate and catecholamine levels. This may indicate that these stress hormones are of importance for the metabolic changes occurring during anaerobic activation...|$|R
40|$|Water is the {{foundation}} of all ecosystems, whether terrestrial or aquatic. In terrestrial ecosystems freshwater not only provides critical water supply for transpiration during plant photosynthesis and drinking water for animals, but also transports, redistributes and stores energy, nutrients and contaminants. In aquatic and snow ecosystems, water is the medium in which the ecosystem functions and so its state mediates all transactions in these systems. Ecosystems are not <b>passive</b> <b>responders</b> to water but through their structure and function can manage water and associated microclimate – forests, grasslands, organic terrain wetlands, and beaver ponds being just a few examples. This chapter will examine the surface water budget in terms of the water continuity equation as a manifestation of the hydrological cycle. To solve the continuity equation for water, the chapter will review hydrological processes and how they interact with vegetation, animals, soils, geomorphology and climate {{in the context of the}} catchment. The coupling of the mass and energy continuity equations in controlling hydrological processes will be discussed. How hydrological processes and their ecosystem interactions are managed by humans will be introduced. Then the chapter will review calculation schemes for the surface water budget via one-dimensional land surface schemes and catchment-based hydrological models, noting the data requirements, uncertainty and limitations of these models and the balance required between model complexity and physical representation of hydrology. This will give the conceptual ideas and basic mathematics of conservation laws and transport processes that form the basis of many models in the forthcoming chapters...|$|R
40|$|Aggregation is a {{defensive}} strategy employed by many prey species {{in response to}} predatory threat. Our group has characterized defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus {{in response to a}} ball of cat fur. In this situation some rats huddle less, and approach the threatening cue more than others (active vs. <b>passive</b> <b>responders).</b> The present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters. The neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding. Active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur, and were predicted by anxiety-like behavior in an open-field emergence test. Active responders displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat, and had higher post-exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution (a test of "anhedonia"). Active responding was associated with: greater cat fur-induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb, reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur; lowered activation of somatosensory cortex, reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics; and reduced activation in the lateral septum. Social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure, and lowered c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey, medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula. We conclude that individual differences in anti-predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype. Social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect, subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding. An association between active responding and lower c-Fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation. 15 page(s...|$|R

It can operate in two setups: either the victims' phones send out a distress signal or the <b>responder's</b> device is <b>beaconing</b> a rescue signal. By means of attaching the responder device to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) the scalability of both setups were compared with each other. Both setups were explored at two different altitudes.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ocean productivity to support salmon populations fluctuates between "good " and "bad" cycles that can span 2 – 3 decades, {{and that these}} fluctuations are negatively correlated between waters off Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, is gaining increasing acceptance. However, not all populations within a geographic area respond to common environmental conditions in the same way. Genetic and life history diversity among salmon and steelhead populations leads to considerable variability in their response to the marine environment. Conversely, events that occur during the marine phase {{of the life cycle}} can profoundly affect metapopulation structure and diversity of salmon and steelhead populations in fresh water. Some empirical examples illustrate that these patterns of genetic and life history diversity can be important on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Figure 1 shows the timing of arrival at a mainstem Snake River dam of outmigrating chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts that had been implanted with <b>Passive</b> Integrated <b>Responder</b> tags (PIT tags) as wild parr or as presmolts in hatcheries (Achord et al. 1996). The natural populations show a protracted outmigration timing over a more than 3 -month period that reflects diversity within populations as well as differences among populations in mean outmigration timing. In contrast, hatchery smolts are typically released during a short temporal window in early spring. More recent research (J. Williams, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, personal communication) has shown that just a few days difference in date of ocean entry of spring/summer chinook salmo...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{represents}} the third edition {{of a work}} cycle that started in 2006 for my PhD thesis. The thesis was presented in 2010 (first edition, GATTIGLIA 2010), partially published as a summary monograph in 2011 (second edition, GATTIGLIA 2011) or in articles (GATTIGLIA 2012, GATTIGLIA 2012 a, GATTIGLIA G. 2011 a), and now (third edition) {{takes the form of}} a more comprehensive publication in the light of new data. Over the past two years, the work study on Pisa, not only relating to the Middle Ages, continued within the MAPPA (Metodologie Applicate alla Predittività del Potenziale – Methodologies Applied to Archaeological Potential Predictivity) project, allowing a widespread collection of data thanks to which it was possible to explain more fully the hydrogeological, geomorphological and topographic context and to check (and in many cases change) part of the assumptions made. Archaeology, albeit slowly, is moving towards Big Data, i. e. enormous amounts of machine readable data, continuously produced, which can modify theories, conclusions and assumptions at any time and develop new applications for archaeology. We no longer live in an age in which printed texts have a long life cycle before becoming outdated; new data are enough today to contradict or validate the assumptions made. Archaeology is closer and closer to science, not only because it uses scientific analysis methods but because it is based on falsifiable hypotheses, to put it as Popper would say. For this reason, the data analysed here are published as open data on the MOD (ANICHINI et alii 2013) (the open data archive of Italian archaeology www. mappaproject. org/mod) or as searchable data on MAPPA Web GIS (MAPPAgis www. mappaproject. org/webgis). In this first introductory chapter, the history of urban archaeology in Pisa will be briefly presented. The second chapter will provide a broad outline of the territorial context and the landscape. The rivers and marshy areas will be analysed in order to understand how the environment influenced the development of the medieval city for better or for worse. Since man was not a <b>passive</b> <b>responder</b> to these events, the study of the port system and road networks will help understand which solutions were taken to draw the geographical benefits and generate economic and commercial profits. The third and last chapter is divided into two parts. The first part will illustrate the great urban transformations throughout the period ranging from the end of the Roman Age (VI century) to the Florentine conquest (start of the XV century). Although it is still difficult to have a clear picture of the Roman and early-medieval urban design of Pisa, it is nevertheless possible to understand some of its nodal points, to interpret the city’s development during the middle years of the Middle Ages and to analyse what happened during the transition that led to the modern city. The second part will deal with the material traces, i. e. the archaeological sources that allowed us to recover pieces of history and build the overall picture. Excavation data will provide information about the buildings, roads, workshops and craft laboratories, waste disposal and water supply systems, and on the wealth and social status of the city’s inhabitants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Providing ad-hoc {{solutions}} for positioning and tracking of emergency response teams {{is an important}} and safety-critical challenge. Although solutions based on inertial sensing systems are promising, {{they are subject to}} drift. We address the problem of positional drift by having the <b>responders</b> themselves deploy <b>beacons,</b> specifically ultrasound beacons, as they progress into an unknown environment. Our research focuses on a sensor network approach that does not require any pre-deployment of infrastructure. This paper targets two important aspects within the context of providing positioning service for emergency responders namely on how to locate the deployed static beacons, and on how to track the responders by using a combination of ultrasound and inertial measurements. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) characterisation of the errors encountered in an inertial-based pedestrian dead reckoning solution and ultrasound range measurements in a mobile setting, (ii) an algorithm for ultrasound beacon localisation (using multidimensional scaling), (iii) formulation of a Kalman filtering based algorithm for tracking the responder using a combination of ultrasound range and inertial measurements, and (iv) the presented algorithms are evaluated using data collected from real deployments and are compared against an ultra-wideband (UWB) precision location system. Our approach of preventing the drift in inertial estimates by combining with ultrasound measurements are promising and offers a viable solution to providing positioning and tracking support to emergency responders.

40|$|Although the {{initiating}} factor(s) is unknown, {{it is now}} {{accepted that}} pulmonary sarcoidosis develops {{as a result of}} an over-stimulated local cellular immune response. Starting as a lymphocytic alveolitis, there is a progression to granuloma formation within the interstitium as stimulated T lymphocytes release mediators capable of attracting and activating monocytes to differentiate into macrophages and epithelioid cells. We are also aware that macrophage-like cells must act as antigen presenters to initiate T cell stimulation within the immune response. To date, interest in the alveolar macrophages of patients with sarcoidosis has focused more on their <b>passive</b> role as <b>responders</b> of the soluble T cell products released as the disease progresses. This paper explores the active role of mononuclear non-lymphoid cells as inducers of immune responses, by taking advantage of monoclonal antibodies capable of discriminating between phenotypically distinct subsets of macrophages. Recent results are presented that suggest a central role for these cells in controlling the course of this disease, focusing specifically on the mechanisms underlying the failure in some patients to resolve the interstitial inflammation and subsequently progressing to fibrosis. A new hypothesis proposes that aberrations in the functional capacity of macrophages may prohibit the emergence of a granuloma-resolving mechanism in some sarcoid patients...|$|R
40|$|This volume, Animal Cognition in Nature, is {{the result}} of an ongoing {{synthesis}} of several ideas that were considered revolutionary, if not heretical, in the 1960 s. At that time, animal behavior, whether studied in field or laboratory, by ethologists or psychologists, was generally interpreted as the result of simple processes relating specific stimuli to specific behaviors. Examples from that time include S–R models, sign stimuli, IRMs, etc. Theoretical constructs such as mental representations, memory or attention were avoided. Today, students of animal behavior work in an entirely different atmosphere. This {{is the result}} of several developments. One of these developments was the aptly named “cognitive revolution” among psychologists which inspired researchers to adapt the cognitive stance and test a wider range of behaviors, revealing many previously unexpected abilities in their subjects. Simultaneously, behavioral ecology appeared, with a whole set of novel concepts such as optimization models, sociobiology and kin selection. In addition, results from fields as diverse as social communication, navigation and neurobiology suggested that animals remember, process and store large amounts of complex information that allows them to predict outcomes in a variety of situations and thus solve a striking range of problems. For example, two of the editors of this volume have worked on spatial memory in seed-caching birds. In order for long-term spatial memory to occur, an animal must first transform spatial information into some type of neurological code (or representation). This must then be stored, remaining intact in memory for some length of time. Later, this information must be retrieved from long-term memory, decoded and translated into appropriate behavior. This {{is an example of how}} cognitive systems involve complexes of neurological and behavioral characteristics. We have long since left the realm where animals are viewed as simple, stimulus-bound <b>responders,</b> <b>passive</b> learners or robotic followers of conditioning regime...|$|R
