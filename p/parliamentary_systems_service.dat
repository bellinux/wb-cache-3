But the hierarchical chain of delegation we found in majoritarian democracies is not always common {{to the rest of}} parliamentary democracies (consensual ones). There are some important characteristics – such as the type of party systems, the number and strength of political parties, electoral system, and executive legislative relationships – that shape political control. The article explains why there is a stronger political control in majoritarian, bipartite <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> due to cabinet stability and somehow divided, and thus weaker, control in consensual <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bipartisan {{bills are}} {{frequent}} in presidential systems, but they exist {{in virtually all}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems.</b> In fact, despite the predominance of governments in legislative agenda-setting in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> considerable shares of both introduced and successful bills are (co-) sponsored by individuals or party groups that belong to both {{the government and the}} opposition camp in parliament. Given the government–opposition divide in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> this requires explanation. In this paper, we seek to address the reasons for the introduction and passage of bipartisan bills in parliamentary democracies – bills that originate with government and opposition party actors. To answer this question in a comparative framework, we develop a simple model that links institutional and policy-related characteristics to the likelihood of a bipartisan sponsorship of bills. More specifically, we look at the effect of divided and minority government, heterogeneity of government coalitions, polarization of parliament and issue salience. Our statistical analysis uses original data for about 11, 000 bills in two <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> Belgium and Germany, 1986 – 2003...|$|R
