40|$|In this project, I {{explore how}} we discuss {{abortion}} in our society. Looking at public spheres, I {{argue that the}} society of the spectacle dominates our airwaves and mainstream print media, silencing the stories of women who have had abortions. This physical and emotional procedure has been reduced to sound bites reflecting the political tensions between <b>pro-choice</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-life</b> <b>groups.</b> However, abortion narratives do emerge, despite the spectacle???s tyranny, such as Gwendolyn Brooks??? poem ???the mother??? and Degrassi: The Next Generation's episode ???Accidents Will Happen,??? which both challenge the spectacle. Because abortion challenges the stability of valued concepts, such as motherhood, femininity, life and death, the stories of women who procure abortions challenge the dominance of the spectacle by embracing ambiguity and rejecting binaries, ???the mother??? and Degrassi: The Next Generation reveal how public spheres can be reclaimed by narratives, allowing for the voices of women to dismantle the spectacle in favor for the power of storytelling...|$|E

Two empirical studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental, examine the HME {{in the context}} of the abortion debate. Both studies show that ingroup identification and group status qualify the HME. <b>Pro-choice</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-life</b> <b>group</b> members perceived an identical newspaper article as biased against their own viewpoint only if they considered their ingroup to have a lower status in society than the outgroup. In addition, only group members with a stronger ingroup identification showed a HME, particularly because of self-investment components of ingroup identification. Taken together, the findings confirm the important influence of ingroup status and ingroup identification on the HME. © 2013 International Communication Association...|$|R

40|$|In a study {{presented}} by the CDC in 2006, 49 % of pregnancies reported were unintended (Finer et al. 2011), accounting for {{almost half of the}} US population of women. Debates surrounding the use of abortion services by women in dealing with unintended pregnancies have entered mainstream media in the form of discussions about the usefulness of Planned Parenthood, and whether or not Planned Parenthood should be defunded by the government. On December 3, 2015, the Senate “passed legislation to defund Planned Parenthood [...] . with a 52 - 47 vote” (Chang 2015), illustrating the divide in the US over abortion politics, and the public’s reengagement with an age old debate over when life begins, as well as larger structural pressures placed on women in dealing with unintended pregnancies.

Research was undertaken with counsellors from both <b>pro-life</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-choice</b> stances.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Sociology. Advisors: Lisa Park, Teresa Swartz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); I, 255 pages. In this dissertation, I illustrate the interactive nature of strategic framing {{processes of the}} American <b>pro-life</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-choice</b> movements <b>and</b> the process whereby movements borrow and co-opt language and imagery from opposing movements. Illustrated by two case studies of reactive and strategic counterframing in the <b>pro-choice</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-life</b> movements, I show how such framing complicates the boundaries between these movements' ideologies. What was once demarcated as progressive becomes a champion of conservative causes and vice versa. I extend social movement theories of interactive framing processes and boundary demarcation by contributing an analysis of instances where activists blur ideological boundaries between movements and risk weakening the collective identification of movement adherents. I have identified two "cases"� that exemplify this interactive framing process and the subsequent blurring of ideological boundaries between the <b>pro-life</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-choice</b> movements [...] 1) pro-choice activists framing abortion as "good mothering" � <b>and</b> 2) <b>pro-life</b> activists framing abortion as "Black genocide". � I argue that as each movement responds to countermovement threats by borrowing and co-opting language and imagery from the opposing movement, the ideological boundaries between the <b>pro-life</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-choice</b> movements are blurred. Blurred boundaries threaten the stability of each movement by weakening collective identity ties and risk marginalizing and alienating certain movement adherents...|$|R
40|$|Writers, philosophers, and theologians have oft {{made the}} {{comparison}} between being a mature human being and a masterpiece work of art or design.

I argue that the value of a potential X is a function of a number of factors, most importantly, what I call the "accessibility relation" between a potential X and a full-fledged instantiation of this potential. The value is as much intrinsic to the “seed” as to some future implementation of the seed’s potential.

40|$|Voluntary {{abortion}} {{remains the}} most controversial medical practice in absolute. Recently, disagreement between the so-called <b>Pro-choice</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pro-life</b> camps has been exacerbated by an attempt to force the recognition, at the international level, that interrupting a pregnancy is a human right and as such, countries must change their legislation eliminating any obstacle to free-unconditional abortion. In spite of those attempts, {{the fact remains that}} no binding document has ever been approved by the international community recognizing a “right to abortion”. We argue that voluntary abortion cannot be a human right because, from a biological point of view, a human embryo is an early form of human life and there can never be a right to terminate a human life.

40|$|Measuring {{attitudes toward}} {{abortion}} is problematic, a fact acknowledged by the battery of questions addressing {{it in the}} ANES 2006 Pilot Study. The proposal for the 2006 ANES Pilot Study abortion questions says that issues of rape, incest, {{and the life of}} the woman are mixed in the wording of the standard ANES abortion question. Instead, seven abortion scenarios and a more detailed response set are proposed as a remedy. This work suggests that even in the transformed state the problem of measuring attitudes about abortion still lacks conceptual clarity. It further suggests that the <b>pro-choice</b> <b>and</b> <b>pro-life</b> rhetoric frequently used to describe the two opposing positions on the issue represent little more than a linguistic gimmick intended to frame the discussion (see Iyengar & Kinder, 1985). Rather, medical, civil, and social/cultural issues underlie the rhetoric of choice and life and represent discrete evaluative structures from which respondents may frame the issue.

Interviews were done in four cities in Kansas and with one organization located in Kansas City, Missouri that is responsible for their national organization’s mission in Kansas. Eighteen individuals were interviewed, which was split evenly with nine <b>Pro-Choice</b> <b>and</b> nine <b>Pro-Life</b> advocates in leadership or communication positions. Race, sex, religion, and age are all considered in the research. Most of the Pro-Choice organizations were found to be focused on multiple issues besides abortion, while {{all but one of the}} Pro-Life organizations were focused on the issue of abortion almost exclusively.

The research found that the Cold War analogy of the two sides works to only an extent, as the messages sent out are not directly sent to one another, even though both sides read what their opposition is saying. There might be subconscious messaging going on with some knowing the opposition is reading what they have to say. The learning factor for opposition organizations is that they are learning news tactics and how they should counter the actions and messages of the other side. Almost all direct communication between the two sides has been cutoff, thus that is where the Cold War analogy falls short as a comparison because both sides feel there is no agreeable middle ground or purpose for negotiations...|$|R
