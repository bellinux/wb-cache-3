25|$|Home insurance, also {{commonly}} called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance (often abbreviated {{in the real}} estate industry as HOI), provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder's home. In some geographical areas, the <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> exclude certain types of risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage. Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowner's responsibility. The <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate policy, especially for people who rent housing. In some countries, insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household, including pets.|$|E

25|$|The {{liability}} {{limit of}} the owner's policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As {{with other types of}} insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of its}} existence, KGO-TV was {{the only}} network-owned {{television}} station in the Bay Area, even throughout the time when ABC underwent ownership changes: Capital Cities Communications bought out ABC and merged with the network in 1985, the combined company Capital Cities/ABC was then sold to The Walt Disney Company in 1996. As such, the station did not heavily preempt network programming unlike its local competitors or its sister stations—such as Philadelphia's WPVI-TV, Houston's KTRK-TV and Fresno's KFSN-TV—which were known for doing so in those days (as of 2007, some exceptions to this <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> be made when breaking news events or selected ABC Sports programs warrant exclusive coverage, in which case independent station KOFY-TV (channel 20), may pick up the pre-empted ABC programming scheduled for the time period). The {{distinction of being the}} Bay Area's only O station ended in 1995 when several other stations in the San Francisco-Oakland market became network-owned stations over the next twenty years—including KBHK (now KBCW) becoming a charter member of UPN (in which the station's then-owner was a partner) in 1995, KPIX becoming a CBS O with the network's 1995 merger with Westinghouse, KNTV becoming an NBC O in 2002 after being bought by the network after it disaffiliated from KRON-TV, and KTVU becoming a Fox O in 2015 after being acquired by the network alongside sister station KICU-TV a year prior (although KICU remains an independent station due to KRON-TV's affiliation with MyNetworkTV). After ABC sold Detroit's WXYZ-TV to Scripps–Howard Broadcasting in 1986 as part of the Capital Cities/ABC merger, KGO-TV went on to be the longest-serving ABC O outside of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis and {{misdiagnosis}} in PGD using PCR {{have been}} mathematically modelled {{in the work}} of Navidi and Arnheim and of Lewis and collaborators. The most important conclusion of these publications is that for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of an embryo, two genotypes are required. This can be based on a linked marker and disease genotypes from a single cell or on marker/disease genotypes of two cells. An interesting aspect explored in these papers is the detailed study of all possible combinations of alleles that may appear in the PCR results for a particular embryo. The authors indicate that some of the genotypes that can be obtained during diagnosis may not be concordant with the expected pattern of linked marker genotypes, but are still providing sufficient confidence about the unaffected genotype of the embryo. Although these models are reassuring, they are based on a theoretical model, and generally the diagnosis is established on a more conservative basis, aiming to avoid the possibility of misdiagnosis. When unexpected alleles appear during the analysis of a cell, depending on the genotype observed, it is considered that either an abnormal cell has been analysed or that contamination has occurred, and that no diagnosis can be established. A case in which the abnormality of the analysed cell can be clearly identified is when, using a multiplex PCR for linked markers, only the alleles of one of the parents are found in the sample. In this case, the cell can be considered as carrying a monosomy for the chromosome on which the markers are located, or, possibly, as haploid. The appearance of a single allele that indicates an affected genotype is considered sufficient to diagnose the embryo as affected, and embryos that have been diagnosed with a complete unaffected genotype are preferred for replacement. Although this <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> lead to a lower number of unaffected embryos suitable for transfer, it is considered preferable to the possibility of a misdiagnosis.|$|E
500|$|Without special federal {{protection}} for the Tribe, the state statute of limitations should apply to its claim in this case. [...] For it is well established that federal claims are subject to state statutes of limitations {{unless there is a}} federal statute of limitations or a conflict with federal policy. [...] Although federal <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> preclude the ordinary applicability of a state statute of limitations for this type of action {{in the absence of a}} specific congressional enactment to the contrary, the Catawba Act clearly suffices to reestablish the usual principle regarding the applicability of the state statute of limitations. In striking contrast to the situation in , the Catawba Act represents an explicit redefinition of the relationship between the Federal Government and the Catawbas; an intentional termination of the special federal {{protection for}} the Tribe and its members; and a plain statement that state law applies to the Catawbas as to all “other persons or citizens.” ...|$|E
500|$|Martin Lee {{said that}} [...] "according {{to all the}} {{evidence}} that has been reported, I believe that Mr. Lee had been taken against his will by certain law enforcement agents from across the border through illegal means". He described the disappearances as the [...] "most worrying thing {{that has happened in}} Hong Kong since the handover in 1997". Benny Tai and former chief secretary Anson Chan both said the case poses a genuine threat to the [...] "one country, two systems" [...] principle, which China ought to uphold. Former legislator Margaret Ng suggested that Hong Kong's status as a world city was coming into question, and said [...] "Hong Kong can be deemed to be no longer safe unless we have a clear resolution of the problem". Albert Chan said [...] "this is the first time there has been such a clear violation of Hong Kong's law, a clear violation of 'one country, two systems' principle, that has taken place in such an open manner", and Lee Cheuk-yan, called the disappearances a [...] "milestone for suppression". Joseph Wong, former secretary for the Hong Kong civil service, also said that the incident will have drastic consequences as foreign confidence in the one country two systems <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> be irreparably damaged, which may in turn jeopardise Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.|$|E

500|$|From 825 {{control of}} Kent {{fell to the}} kings of Wessex, and a {{compromise}} was reached between Archbishop Ceolnoth and King Egbert in 838, confirmed by his son Æthelwulf in 839, recognising Egbert and Æthelwulf as [...] lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship, particularly over election of abbots and abbesses, to bishops. One copy of the record of this agreement was preserved either at Reculver or at Lyminge. A factor leading to this abandonment of Wulfred's strict <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> have been the increasing intensity of Viking attacks, which had begun in Kent in the late 8th century and had seen the ravaging of the Isle of Sheppey in 835. An army of Vikings spent the winter of 851 on the Isle of Thanet and the same occurred on the Isle of Sheppey in 855. Reculver, {{like most of the}} Kentish monasteries, lay in an exposed coastal location, and would have presented an obvious target for Vikings in search of treasure. By the 10th century the monastery at Reculver had ceased to be an important church in Kent and, together with its territory, it was {{in the hands of the}} kings of Wessex alone. In a charter of 949 King Eadred of England gave Reculver back to the archbishops of Canterbury, at which time the estate included Hoath and Herne, land at Sarre, in Thanet, and land at Chilmington, about [...] south-west of Reculver.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "thought variant" [...] <b>policy</b> <b>may</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} for publicity, {{rather than as a}} real attempt to define the sort of fiction Tremaine was looking for; the early [...] "thought variant" [...] stories were not always very original or well executed. [...] Ashley describes the first, Nat Schachner's [...] "Ancestral Voices", as [...] "not amongst Schachner's best"; the second, [...] "Colossus", by Donald Wandrei, was not a new idea, but was energetically written. [...] Over the succeeding issues, it became apparent that Tremaine was genuinely willing to publish material that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos elsewhere. [...] He serialized Charles Fort's Lo!, a nonfiction work about strange and inexplicable phenomena, in eight parts between April and November 1934, in an attempt to stimulate new ideas for stories. [...] The best-remembered story of 1934 is probably Jack Williamson's [...] "The Legion of Space", which began serialization in April, but other notable stories include Murray Leinster's [...] "Sidewise in Time", which was the first genre science-fiction story to use the idea of alternate history; [...] "The Bright Illusion", by C.L. Moore, and [...] "Twilight", by John W. Campbell, writing as Don A. Stuart. [...] "Twilight", which was written in a more literary and poetic style than Campbell's earlier space opera stories, was particularly influential, and Tremaine encouraged other writers to produce similar stories. [...] One such was Raymond Z. Gallun's [...] "Old Faithful", which appeared in the December 1934 issue and was sufficiently popular that Gallun wrote a sequel, [...] "Son of Old Faithful", published the following July. [...] Space opera continued to be popular, though, and two overlapping space opera novels were running in Astounding late in the year: The Skylark of Valeron by E.E. Smith, and The Mightiest Machine, by Campbell. [...] By the end of the year, Astounding was the clear leader of the small field of sf magazines.|$|E
