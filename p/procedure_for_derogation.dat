30|$|The {{question}} of whether state parties may derogate from economic, social and cultural rights in times of public emergency has {{been a matter of}} much debate. Derogating from a right essentially allows states to put their obligations on hold for a specified period of time. As derogating is a somewhat extreme measure, whether or not a particular right may be derogated from, and under which circumstances, is usually laid down in the text of a human rights treaty. However, {{this is not the case}} for the ICESCR, which neither contains a <b>derogation</b> clause allowing <b>for</b> <b>derogations,</b> nor a provision prohibiting derogations. This is unlike the ICCPR, Article 4 of which specifies the conditions <b>for</b> <b>derogations</b> from its provisions, and prohibits derogations from several rights (Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively). Nonetheless, the fact that there is no derogation clause in ICESCR does not necessarily mean that states would be precluded from derogating from them.|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction to the Proceedings "The European Consortium for Organic Plant Breeding (ECO-PB) is {{an active}} network {{supporting}} the production and use of organic seeds. It sees the European Union’s Organic Seed Regime as potentially a great step forward for {{in the development of}} organic seed but is concerned about the latest discussions regarding implementation per January 1 st 2004. Current European Commission proposals seem to allow a great deal of room <b>for</b> <b>derogation.</b> Seed companies are indicating that this year (2003) their organic seed sales have already dropped. Growers are aware that the probable new rules will allow <b>derogation</b> even <b>for</b> those crops for which there is sufficient, appropriate organic seeds. A number of key seed companies have announced they will definitely stop their organic programmes should the criteria <b>for</b> <b>derogation</b> remain unclear and if <b>derogation</b> remains possible <b>for</b> all crops irrespective of availability, as it becomes financially unviable. That is a real threat and would be a great setback for ongoing efforts to build up a healthy organic seed sector and hence further close the organic production chain. Furthermore, we have received much feedback about national authorities which are tentative about how to tackle the national implementation of the new seed regulation. ECO-PB has therefore decided to organise at short notice a WORKSHOP on the ORGANIC SEED Regime 2004 to help clarify the above issues. We aim to facilitate an international discussion with key national players to exchange valuable information and concerns, and to establish common points of view on the organic seed regime in the organic sector on international level. The workshop will tie into discussions held and decisions made in the Article 14 Committee of the European Commission on April 4 - 6. "...|$|R

Even though this is long-standing case law, many uncertainties remain as to its interpretation. This thesis contains a detailed examination of this concept of ‘(objective) justification’, focusing in particular on its scope and the applicable legal conditions. The thesis submits that this concept is highly important, as it can steer Article 102 TFEU away from a formalistic approach and give ample weight to the prevalent context. Although the thesis focuses on EU law, it also seeks inspiration from the approach in other jurisdictions. A comparative study includes relevant cases from various EU Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) and non-EU jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa and the US). The study reveals that these jurisdictions have accepted the availability of a justification plea, and have dealt with the concept in strikingly similar ways...|$|R

40|$|The {{future of}} the more western {{transition}} economies (TEs) is usually directly linked to the eastward enlargement of the European Union (EU) for two reasons. First, accession is supposed to spur on growth of the TEs, enabling them {{to catch up with}} the more developed EU members. Second, once the conditions for accession met, perhaps by 2002 or 2003, it signals in some sense successful completion of the transition toward a market economy. This paper examines the conditions for accession as spelled out at recent European Councils and subsequently elaborated in concrete recommendations by the European Commission. I show that these official conditions for accession are fuzzy and that the TEs will have to meet other, as yet unspecified, conditions that shape the profile of “suitable“ future EU members, although such candidates may well fail to exist. In addition, the negotiation process itself may modify these conditions, if only because there may be a need <b>for</b> <b>derogations</b> and transitional arrangements upon entry. ...|$|R
