40|$|Privatisation of {{both the}} {{ownership}} and control o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is an increasingly central feature o f all national economic reform programmes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In those countries where SOEs have dominated all or most sectors o f the formal economy, comprehensive <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes</b> are regarded (particularly by the World Bank and the IMF) as being o f crucial importance for the future development o f a strong private sector which, in many respects, has become the superordinate medium-long term objective o f adjustment programmes everywhere in Africa. Privatisation is also justified {{on the grounds that}} SOEs are invariably inefficient and, without decisive interventions, {{will continue to be a}} massive drain on extremely limited public resources (see World Bank, 1995). The article is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the sources and types o f data that were included in the survey. Section 3 presents an overview o f the number, value, type, and ownership characteristics o f privatisations between 1980 and 1995 disaggregated by country and main economic sector. Sections 4 and 5 then discusses how the design and implementation o f <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes</b> in SSA have been affected by a number o f key political and economic factors. Section 6 reviews the limited evidence that is available on the performance of privatised SOEs. Finally, section 7 considers the prospects for privatisation in SSA during the next five years. Data from five main sources were utilised for the survey, (i) The Candoy-Sekse and Sader data bases for the periods 1980 - 1987 and 1988 - 1992 respectively, (ii) Unpublished data from the World Bank that partially updates the Sader data base up to and including 1995.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore the changes of the Libyan economy, {{which began in the}} mid- 1980 s. The core of this {{research}} is to examine the influence of these changes on the course {{of the state and the}} implementation of the economic reform programmes. The relevant theoretical literature is based upon the relationship between the international and internal factors leading up the economic reform. The globalisation and state power are reviewed. The theory of rentier state and also the discussion of the most relevant aspects of the privatisation process were considered. The contribution of the thesis is its sustained analysis of the Libyan economic policies and, more importantly, its response to the neglect of the international and domestic influences of the economic reform process particularly in oil states. In addition, the literature on Libya and its structural and economic reform suffers from a lack of theoretically-grounded analysis. The methodology of this study is based upon combination of both interviews and questionnaires seemed the ideal methods in examining the economic reform and the <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The documentary research was also an important element for this study. In order to identify the determinants of the changes of the Libyan economy and the implementation process, it employs a variety of Libyan official documents and economic data. In general the study reveals that the relationship and the interaction between the international and domestic factors is extremely vital to understand the economic reform and <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes</b> in Libya. Despite the significance of the international arena, its impacts are mitigated through the domestic context. Moreover, the previous state policies, the role of the state institutions and the interaction between the state apparatus and the Libyan society are important in understanding the Libyan economy...|$|R
40|$|Although {{privatisation}} {{has turned}} into a worldwide phenomenon, it is only recently that developing countries have launched extensive <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes.</b> This paper surveys the empirical literature on the operating and financial performance of newly privatised firms in developing countries. The major studies in the field suggest that privatisation improves the operating performance of former state-owned enterprises. However, performance improvements seem to be less marked for firms in less developed countries. The paper also provides new evidence for a subset of firms privatised exclusively in African countries. The preliminary results for a sample of 16 privatised firms in Africa suggest that privatisation resulted in profitability improvements, although not significantly. Efficiency as well as output measured by real sales decreased slightly but not significantly, while capital expenditures rose significantly in the post-privatisation period.

Drawing on a Habermasian theoretical framework applied to a privatised state monopoly (Telecom Fiji), it is demonstrated how an implementation of privatisation concealed social and political interests. Thus privatisation provided a convenient rhetoric and tool of implementation for social and political gain by a ruling elite. For those inside the Telecom company, the ethos of public service could not withstand the messengers of capitalism with their rhetoric of the need for greater efficiency, effectiveness and consumer awareness.

The analysis indicates that, in Egypt, the legal framework of privatisation did not explicitly incorporate FDI participation. FDI regulations were developed separately from privatisation regulations. As a result, a foreign investor in Egypt is faced with multiple laws and multiple regulating agencies for FDI. Unlike in Argentina, the legal framework of privatisation explicitly incorporated the participation of FDI, and FDI regulations were totally liberalised. This explains why FDI participation in Argentine privatisation during 1989 â€“ 2000 accounted for 63 % of privatisation proceeds, while, in Egypt, FDI participation accounted for only 24 % of privatisation proceeds during 1993 â€“ 2000. egypt; fdi; argentina; regulations; privatisation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on international human resource management (IHRM) strategies of multinational corporations (MNCs) and the factors that influence them. In doing so it sought to address a number of weaknesses in the existing literature, notably a marked lack of research into the strategies adopted by MNCs in developing economies, particularly when they become involved under the auspices of <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes.</b> More specifically, the study sought to investigate the human resource management (HRM) reforms introduced by three French MNCs in privatised Jordanian companies and the factors that influenced them. The research utilised a longitudinal multiple-case design to achieve the study's aim and objectives, and was conducted in three phases over three years. More specifically, the study was based upon a sample of three case studies of privatised Jordanian companies that had recently come under the control of French MNCs operating in different sectors. Primary data was gathered through 67 in-depth semi-structured interviews with company directors, senior line and finance managers, and HR staff, including senior personnel based at headquarters in France. In addition, 14 interviews were conducted with government officials in Jordan and a range of supplementary documentary evidence was examined. In general, the findings from the case study companies revealed that in each of the Jordanian subsidiaries a wide range of changes had been made to the previously existing HRM policies. These encompassed the making of reforms in each of the specific areas of HR activity investigated: the people management responsibilities of line managers; staffing, recruitment and selection; training and development; performance appraisal; rewards; and communication and consultation. Taken together, the case studies highlighted similarities in terms of the objectives and broad thrust of the structural, policy and cultural reforms that were introduced. However, they also showed the companies to differ in terms {{of the way in which}} the reforms were centrally authored, the extent to which they were implemented in a participative way, the types of control mechanisms that were used to support the reform process, and the pace with which the reforms were introduced. The above similarities and differences appeared to nave been influenced by a number of interrelated factors. Most important was the beliefs that senior management held of what constituted 'good and appropriate' human resource practice. Others related to the characteristics of the industries in which the MNCs operated and the implications these had for company business strategies and structures; the parent company's country of origin and experience in managing international operations; the strategic role of the subsidiaries and their mode of establishment; and a number of host country effects. Overall, it is argued, that the study's findings contribute to existing knowledge in a number of ways. First, the findings lend some further support to the validity of Perlmutter's typology of the IHRM strategies that are adopted by MNCs, while also raising doubts about its future usefulness. They also add weight to the view that a process of convergence is occurring in respect of the HRM policies utilised by MNCs, and that this convergence is centred around an Anglo-Saxon conceptualisation of HRM best practice. At the same time, they also lend weight to the argument that this process of Anglo-Saxonisation is occurring in the context of national specific frameworks. As a result, the study suggests that there remains some country of origin influence over the way MNCs mange their human resources. More generally, the study's findings tend to suggest, contrary to some arguments in the literature, that MNCs do not apply different IHRM strategies and practices to their subsidiaries in developing economies. They also suggest that more attention needs to be paid to the way in which government policies and wider political pressures, surrounding the <b>privatisation</b> <b>programmes</b> of such countries act to influence the way in which MNCs approach the process of reform in subsidiaries acquired as a result of privatisation.
