2500|$|Due to the {{hazardous}} nature of skydiving, {{the greatest of}} precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. For first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction. Since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing (approximately 85%), the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> (PLF), which seeks to orient the body as to evenly disperse the impact through flexion of several large, insulating muscles (such as the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus [...] ), as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> is most {{commonly}} performed by jumpers {{who are using}} round canopies. Such parachutes allow less directional control and less lateral- or vertical-speed control than square parachutes. When square canopies are used, experienced jumpers can often land in a standing or short run position at a low vertical speed, so they can remain in a standing position on arriving at the ground. When arriving at greater vertical speed under a round canopy, the <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> prevents injuries to the feet, ankles, legs, hips, or upper body.|$|E
50|$|A <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> (PLF) is {{a safety}} {{technique}} {{that allows a}} parachutist to land safely and without injury. The technique is performed by paratroopers and novice recreational parachutists when using round parachutes deployed by static line.|$|E
5000|$|Airborne Orientation Course. For {{students}} completing {{basic training}} at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, preparation for Airborne and rigger training begins before even departing for Fort Lee with {{attendance at the}} post's Airborne Orientation Course. According to an Army News Service story, [...] "while most of the course involves physical training, soldiers are also familiarized with such Airborne operations as <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>falls,</b> rigging equipment and actions in the aircraft." [...] The AOC has raised the success rate for soldiers subsequently attending Airborne training from 60 percent to 89 percent.|$|R
2500|$|Single Action Release Personal Equipment Lowering Equipment (SARPELS) – The Force Recon {{operators}} {{are equipped with}} a complete equipment lowering system for both LLSL and MFF parachute operations. It allows them carry various configurations of all their individual mission-essential equipment, usually contained within their Flyer's Kitbag. SARPELS provides easy access to their weapons and equipment upon <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> and has a single-action release capability. It can be front or rear mounted, whichever is preferred. Once they have descended to about [...] above the surface, they use the SARPEL to release their gear (weapons/kitbag), dropping it below them while still attached to their harness by a [...] rope. It is used to minimize injuries in landing due to heavy load of equipment. The parachustists must maneuver themselves {{in order not to}} drop onto their gear during <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Captain Taylor {{managed to}} get the {{services}} of Sergeant Robert Zweiner, a parachute rigger from an Air Delivery Platoon at the nearby airstrip on Camp Pendleton. Sgt. Zweiner led a grueling course, instructing the Marines in <b>Parachute</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Falls</b> (PLFs), body positioning and positive exits from aircraft. All of them were able to pass the pull-up physicals and complete the long runs; by the time the Test Unit's recon Marines were sent to the actual school, they were well-prepared and everyone passed the course, each earning their silver wings and returning to MCTU #1. Robert Zweiner was quickly reassigned and transferred to MCTU #1 to head the test unit's newly formed Parachute Loft, becoming the founder of 1st Force Reconnaissance Company's Paraloft.|$|R
50|$|During a <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall,</b> the jumper's {{legs are}} {{slightly}} {{bent at the}} knee, the chin is tucked in, and the parachute risers may be grasped in an arm-bar protecting the face and throat, with the elbows tucked into the sides to prevent injury. Alternatively, the hands can be linked behind the neck with elbows tucked in close.|$|E
50|$|The fall is {{executed}} {{in one of}} six directions — left front, left side, left rear, right front, right side, right rear — depending on the jumper's direction of drift, the terrain, wind, and any oscillation of the jumper. With repeated practice by jumping from a shoulder height platform onto the ground or into a sawdust pit, parachutists can learn to make smooth falls automatically, with a reflex action. Experienced jumpers can deploy a <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> naturally during an accidental fall; this has reduced or prevented injuries.|$|E
50|$|For use by Airborne troops, the Denison {{was worn}} over the battledress {{and under the}} webbing, with a {{sleeveless}} green denim oversmock being worn over the ensemble to prevent rigging lines snagging in the webbing and causing a 'chute malfunction. This sleeveless smock had a long external zip (often removed and {{used to make the}} half-zip Denisons full zip), a monkey tail that press studded to the outside front of the oversmock and two elasticated open pockets on the lower front which were to hold grenades for use whilst in the air or immediately upon landing. After a successful <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall,</b> the oversmock was discarded.|$|E
40|$|Military static-line {{parachuting}} is {{a highly}} tactical and hazardous activity, with a well-documented injury risk. Due to the high impact forces and rapid rate of loading when a parachutist lands, injuries most frequently occur to the lower limbs and the trunk/spine, with ankle injuries accounting for between 30 and 60 % of all parachuting injuries. Although military static-line parachuting injuries can be sustained at any time between the paratrooper attempting to leave the aircraft until they have landed and removed their harness, most injuries occur on landing. Throughout the world, various landing techniques are taught to paratroopers {{to reduce the risk}} of injury, by enabling <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> forces to be more evenly distributed over the body. In this chapter, we review research associated with static-line military parachuting injuries, focusing on injuries that occur during high-impact landings. We summarize literature pertaining to strategies for military paratroopers to land safely upon ground contact, especially when performing the <b>parachute</b> <b>fall</b> <b>landing</b> technique. Recommendations for future research in this field are provided, particularly in relation to the <b>parachute</b> <b>fall</b> <b>landing</b> technique and training methods. Ultimately, any changes to current practice in landing technique, how it is taught, and whether protective equipment is introduced, should be monitored in well controlled, prospective studies, with the statistical design accounting for the interaction between the variables, to determine the effect of these factors on injury rates and paratrooper performance. This will ensure that evidence-based guidelines can be developed, particularly in relation to landing technique and how this is trained, in order to minimize injuries associated with landings during military static-line parachuting in subsequent training and tactical operations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first week}} of the Basic Airborne Course is {{dedicated}} to teaching prospective troopers how to land properly to minimize the potential for injury and general familiarization with the T-10D and T-11 parachute. The T-10D is a round-shaped parachute, and the T-11 is a square-shaped parachute both using static line extraction with a descent rate of 18-23 ft/sec and 16-20 ft/sec respectively, dependent on the weight and equipment outfitting of the individual jumper. Prospective troopers are taught how to wear the parachute harness correctly and how to use the special training gear. During Ground Week, prospective troopers will spend the majority of time learning, practicing, and perfecting their <b>Parachute</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Fall</b> (PLF) and proper exit technique from the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The flare {{follows the}} final {{approach}} phase and precedes the touchdown and roll-out phases of landing. In the flare, {{the nose of}} the plane is raised, slowing the descent rate, and the proper attitude is set for touchdown. In the case of conventional landing gear-equipped aircraft the attitude is set to touch down on all three wheels simultaneously or on just the main landing gear. In the case of tricycle gear-equipped aircraft the attitude is set to touchdown on the main landing gear. In the case of monowheel gear-equipped gliders, the flare consists only of leveling the aircraft. In parachuting, the flare is the part of the <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> preceding ground contact, and is executed about 15 ft above ground.|$|E

Often, injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb, such as a hand or foot, is extended separately {{from the rest of}} the body, causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within. This tendency is displayed in the accompanying chart, which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the 186 injured in a 110,000 parachute jump study.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} type, location, incidence and mechanism of injury sustained by amateur parachutists in Denmark during a five-year-period. A total of 110, 000 parachute jumps resulted in six (0. 005 %) fatalities and 155 (0. 14 %) cases, requiring medical treatment. The latter group sustained 176 injuries of which 36. 9 % were significant soft tissue lesions and 63. 1 % fractures. Landing {{is the most dangerous}} part of the parachuting procedure, causing 83. 8 % of the accidents, while 9. 3 % were caused by faults during opening of the parachute. Based on the injury pattern, some modifications to the procedures and equipment are mentioned. A simplification of the <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall</b> and the development of safer parachutes may reduce the incidence of casualties. An enforcement of the present regulations is necessary as many injuries are the result of noncompliance with regulations due to ignorance, inexperience or carelessness...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chinese paratroopers have {{traditionally}} performed the half-squat parachute landing (HSPL), which {{was different from}} the wellknown <b>parachute</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fall.</b> During HSPL, ankle biomechanics have been shown to vary greatly between genders. Therefore, it is necessary to consider gender with regard to the design of ankle stabilizers for paratroopers. Methods: Eight male and eight female healthy participants landed from platforms under three ankle conditions based on different stabilizer rigidity levels (barefoot control, elastic tape, and semi-rigid brace). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the effects and interactions of ankle stabilizer, gender, and dropping height on the ground reaction forces (GRF), ankle kinematics, and the shank surface electromyogram (EMG). Results: Compared to men, women had signifi -cantly higher peak medial-lateral GRF when they were equipped with stabilizers (tape: men 0. 521 vs. women 0. 856 bodyweight; brace: men 0. 531 vs. 0. 935 bodyweight), except when barefoot. Both stabilizers signifi cantly decreased all peak angular displacements, but no signifi cant interaction was detected between gender and stabilizer rigidity in ankle kinematics. Compared to barefoot, the semi-rigid brace signifi cantly increased male pre-landing EMG amplitude of the tibialis anterior from 218 to 525 m V and post-landing EMG amplitude of the lateral gastrocnemius from 323 to 910 m V, but no corresponding change took place in women. Discussion: The semi-rigid stabilizer was helpful for men in increasing shank muscle activities. Increased stabilizer rigidity had little infl uence on the muscle activities of women and this could contribute to greater injury risk in women during HSPL.
