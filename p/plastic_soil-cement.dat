40|$|Controlled {{low-strength}} material (CLSM) is a self-compacted, {{cementitious material}} used {{primarily as a}} backfill in lieu of compacted fill. Many terms are currently used to describe this material including flowable fill, unshrinkable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, flowable fly ash, fly ash slurry, <b>plastic</b> <b>soil-cement,</b> soil-cement slurry, K-Krete and other various names. This report contains information on applications, material properties, mix proportioning, construction and quality-control procedures. This report`s intent is to provide basic information on CLSM technology, with emphasis on CLSM material characteristics and advantages over conventional compacted fill. Applications include backfills, structural fills, insulating and isolation fills, pavement bases, conduit bedding, erosion control, void filling, and radioactive waste management...|$|E
30|$|The American Concrete Institute (ACI) {{defines a}} CLSM as a self-leveling, self-compacting, and {{cementitious}} material primarily used to replace conventional backfill soil and structural fillings {{that result in}} unconfined compressive strengths of 1200  psi (8.3  MPa) or less [2]. CLSM {{should not be considered}} as a type of low-strength concrete, but rather as a structural backfill. CLSM is known by many different names such as flowable fill, controlled density fill, unshrinkable fill, flowable mortar, soil–cement slurry, and <b>plastic</b> <b>soil–cement.</b> There are various inherent advantages of using CLSM instead of compacted fill in these applications. These benefits include reduced labor and equipment costs (due to self-leveling properties and no need for compaction), faster construction, and the ability to place material in confined spaces [2]. If future excavation is anticipated, the maximum long-term compressive strength should generally be less than 2.1  MPa (i.e., general fill) [2]. It is advantageous due to the relatively low strength itself of CLSM. Another advantage of CLSM is that it possibly contains by-product materials, thereby reducing the demand on landfills, where these materials may otherwise be deposited and contributing towards the sustainable development [32]. In general, CLSM mixtures consist of standard materials such as Portland cement, fly ash, fine aggregate and water. However, other industrial by-products and recycled materials are also accepted and encouraged {{as long as they are}} considered to be available, cost-effective for specific application and the necessary characteristics of the mixture such as flowability, strength, excavatability, and density are acceptable [2].|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} and structural changes in cement-treated soils under influence of freeze/thaw (f/t f/t) exposure are investigated. Specimens from <b>plastic</b> and compacted <b>soil-cement</b> mix designs were exposed to different f/t f/t scenarios to study the influence of f/t f/t dimensionality (i. e., one-dimensional versus three-dimensional exposure) and specimens’ age {{at the time of}} f/t f/t exposure on changes in their performance. Changes in hydraulic conductivity, unconfined compressive strength, and longitudinal resonant frequency of the specimens were studied under each exposure scenario. An examination of the microstructure of the f/t f/t exposed and control specimens using transmitted light optical microscopy was also performed to evaluate how the soil-cement matrix was disrupted after exposure to f/t f/t cycling. Observations showed increases in water content of the mix design (when wet of optimum water content), as well as increased specimen age at the time of exposure may increase f/t f/t susceptibility. On the other hand, comparison of {{the performance}} of the specimens exposed to 1 D and 3 D f/t f/t exposure did not show any significant variation. Microstructural analysis of petrographic thin section samples from control and f/t f/t exposed specimens showed that while optical microscopy can detect matrix disintegration for highly damaged specimens, it is not able to identify structural degradation at early stages of damage development...|$|R
