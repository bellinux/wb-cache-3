As w ell as studying the participation of the General State Administration and the Regional Autonomous Communities, we highlight the cooperation, coordination and financial support demanded of these government entities. Effective management is only possible if this commitment is fulfilled, based on identifying current needs and establishing appropriate action towards the achievement of well-defined healthcare goals...|$|E

Previous sensor network research has, therefore, focused on in network aggregation and query processing, but has done so for applications where the features of interest are known a priori. When features are not known a priori, {{as is the case with}} many scientific applications in dense sensor arrays, efficient support for multi-resolution storage and iterative, drill-down queries is essential.

40|$|Abstract: Despite the <b>progressive</b> <b>ageing</b> of a {{worldwide}} population, negative attitudes towards old age have proliferated thanks to cultural constructs and myths that, for decades, have presented old age as a synonym of decay, deterioration and loss. Moreover, even though {{every human being}} knows he/she will age and that ageing {{is a process that}} cannot be stopped, it always seems distant, far off in the future and, therefore, remains invisible. In this paper, I aim to analyse the invisibility of old age and its spaces through two contemporary novels and their ageing females protagonists –Maudie Fowler in Doris Lessing’s The Diary of a Good Neighbour and Erica March in Rose Tremain’s The Cupboard. Although invisible to the rest of society, these elderly characters succeed in becoming significant in the lives of younger protagonists who, immersed in their active lives, become aware of the need to enlarge our vision of old age...|$|E
30|$|Our {{results on}} the {{relative}} employability of individuals with vocational education clearly reflect the current economic situation, and the current balance of demand and supply of skills. But what about future demand developments? Is {{the number of jobs}} requiring vocational skills expected to decline or to increase in the future? Statistics Norway (2013), has produced projections up to 2030 on the expected labour demand by type of education. These projections show that the relative number of jobs requiring upper secondary vocational education are likely to grow faster than supply in the near future, especially in the health care industry-because of the <b>progressive</b> <b>ageing</b> of the population, with potentially positive developments for the earnings and employability of those having the required skills. Of course, if the demand for jobs requiring academic tertiary education grows even faster, thereby offering better earnings and employment prospects, enrolment in vocational education may decline even in the presence of favourable demand developments.|$|E

Finally, some conclusions are drawn as to the opportunity of subdividing the renewal process into two macrophases, reverse engineering and restoration, which integrate the process activities generating the benefits.

Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness service enabler aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the service enabler introduced contribute to “context-awareness” paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences...|$|E

The advantages of this approach are multiple: the synthetic approach is flexible, provided a C C tethering arm is present on the molecule of interest; a self-assembled hydrocarbon chain can guarantee a good coverage and resistance to the further synthetic steps; the redox centers are located at the outer surface, where a good contact with the electrolyte becomes possible. We have monitored the progression of the reaction steps by XPS, and characterized the resulting new hybrid on Si by electrochemical methods. The presence and chemical nature of the redox species covalently attached to the SAM on Si has been evaluated by XPS, while the overall coverage has been calculated by CV measurements. A reversible electrochemical response has been evidenced for the hybrids and the <b>progressive</b> <b>ageing</b> followed at thousands of oxidation–reduction cycle...|$|E
