The experiment investigated the effect of 635 -nm, 10 -mW diode laser radiation with ex-clusive energy dispersing optics. Total energy values of 1. 2 J/cm 2, 2. 4 J/cm 2, and 3. 6 J/cm 2 were applied on human adipose tissue taken from lipectomy samples of 12 healthy women.

The distance between each transceiver is optimized to prevent some relays {{from being the}} bottleneck and guarantee the high end-to-end channel capacity. However, in some cases, the location of relays can’t be set at the desired location, the transmit power of each relay should be optimized.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{efficiency}} of opportunistic multicast routing in Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Specifically, an opportunistic multicast routing protocol has been developed in this work {{in order to gain}} better performance in WMNs compared to traditional multicast routing <b>protocols.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network to deliver a packet from a source to group of destinations has been taken as measure for the performance <b>of</b> the <b>protocol.</b> Less number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network to deliver a packet to group of destinations is an indicator for a better performance. The work has been divided into two parts. In the first part, a proposal of the first version of opportunistic multicast routing protocol (OMRPv 1) will be explained. By calculating the expected number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network, the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>protocol</b> will be examined. OMRPv 1 will be compared against a traditional protocol, non-opportunistic protocol, to confirm its better performance in the network. Then, a second version <b>of</b> our <b>protocol</b> will be introduced, OMRPv 2, as a solution for some problems encountered in the first version. The comparison between OMRPv 1 and OMRPv 2 will show the better performance achieved with the newer version. In the second part, QualNet simulator will be used to simulate the protocol OMRPv 2. In this part, not only the number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network will be considered, but also other metrics like end to end delay and delivery rate will be taken into account. The overhead <b>of</b> the <b>protocol</b> will be examined as well. Observation of the results from the simulation will lead to the third version <b>of</b> the <b>protocol</b> (OMRPv 3). OMRPv 3 will be simulated as well to show the improvement in the performance over the previous version OMRPv 2. Finally, OMRPv 3 will be compared to the best opportunistic multicast routing protocol in the literature, Beacon-less Geographic Routing for Multicast Applications (BRUMA). For that reason, BRUMA will be simulated in QualNet as well. For fair comparison, few modifications will be added to BRUMA. Then, the two protocols will be compared to each other using many metrics. Delivery rate, end to end delay, and number <b>of</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network to serve the multicast groups are some of the metrics that will be used to compare the two protocols.
