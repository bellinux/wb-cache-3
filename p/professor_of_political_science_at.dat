25|$|However, much {{empirical}} {{research in the}} field of happiness economics, such as that by Benjamin Radcliff, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Science</b> <b>at</b> the University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{before the}} system was {{declared}} operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>at</b> Tel Aviv University for costing too much compared {{to the cost of}} a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means. The estimated cost of each Tamir interceptor missile has been cited from US$20,000–50,000 whereas a crudely manufactured Qassam rocket costs around $800 and the cost of each Hamas Grad rocket is only several thousand dollars each. Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are worth the cost.|$|E

25|$|In the {{intended}} third volume of The Life of Mind, Arendt {{was planning to}} engage the faculty of judgment {{but she did not}} live to write it. Nevertheless, although her notion of judging remains unknown, Arendt did leave manuscripts (such as Thinking and Moral Considerations and Some Questions on Moral Philosophy) and lectures (Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy) concerning her thoughts on this mental faculty. The first two articles were edited and published by Jerome Kohn, an assistant of Arendt and a director of the Hannah Arendt Center at The New School in New York, and the last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>at</b> the University of Toronto. Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, ephemera, and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment.
