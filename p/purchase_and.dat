For too long business has focused on short-term cost advantages through low-cost country sourcing with little regard for the longer-term implications of global sustainability. As the first book to fully address the environmental, social and economic challenges of how companies manage <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chains, it aims to inspire the development of current <b>and</b> future <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain leaders. In addition to explaining the basic principles and processes of both <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management, the book evaluates how to develop strategic <b>and</b> sustainable <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management. A key message is that <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management needs to focus on value creation rather than cost cutting. This requires the development of completely new <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain models that involve closed-loop supply structures, supply chain transparency and collaboration with new stakeholders in traditional sourcing and supply chain processes.

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 A {{literature}} study {{was done on}} the concepts of <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management to develop a framework of <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management in a mine. A questionnaire was designed, {{based on the findings}} in the literature, and to assist to develop a framework of sustainable <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management process and procedure towards value creation in a mine. The state of the internal <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management process and procedures was assessed through a survey questionnaire to extract the data. The elements of procurement and supply management were broken down into clear activities towards the creation of value in a mine. The key area of concern is to ensure adherence to proper processes and procedures to create an environment that is conducive towards the objectives of the mine and install a mechanism that is measurable. The focus on procurement and supply management towards value creation has became the key determining factor in the mine. A practical development framework of sustainable <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management manage towards value is proposed for a mine and to address the gaps found after analysing the questionnaires. The findings of the empirical study and the literature review were used as the basis of the framework. In this thesis the main focus was <b>Purchasing</b> <b>and</b> Supply Management process and procedures, and Contract Management. The relationship between procurement in the supply chain management process and its functional departments is critical towards sustainable development <b>and</b> value creation. <b>Purchasing</b> <b>and</b> Supply Management are one of the key value drivers in a mine and in particular assisting with governance of purchasing activities which contribute significance towards value adding and cost. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are drawn and rendered in order to develop a framework of <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management in a mine. Master...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} internal functions within a company, which have gained increased importance, are <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics. <b>Purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics both contribute to the competitiveness of an organisation by conducting different value adding activities separately. There is also a huge potential for increased benefits if a high degree of integration exists between the two functions. Although there is evidence that <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics have been working closely together historically, the operational focus of logistics and the commercial focus of purchasing have created a tension between the two functions. It has been shown that some purchasing managers mostly have been committed to reducing the price. The logistics function has as a cause of this sometimes been forced to deal with late deliveries and inferior quality from suppliers. To manage the interface activities between the functions is crucial in order to able to achieve integration. <b>Purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics functions are of major importance within wholesaling companies because they are considered as core internal functions. This study has been conducted at the wholesaling companies The Body Shop, Hälsokostcentralen (HKC), Mekonomen, Elgiganten and ICA. Research questions: § What activities exist within the <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics function at the specific wholesaling companies and which of these activities are integrated? § What are the factors that influence the integration between the <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics functions and how do these factors hinder or enable the integration? Purpose: Initially this thesis aims to identify what activities that exist and which of them that are integrated between the <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> logistics functions within the wholesaling companies The Body Shop, HKC, Mekonomen, Elgiganten and ICA.
