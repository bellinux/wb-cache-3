There are also forming capabilities including CNC filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, compression moulding, and thermoplastic moulding, {{to name a}} few. The use of curing ovens and paint booths is also needed for some projects.|$|E
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastic pre impregnated materials produced continuously by diverse {{methods and}} processing conditions {{were used to}} produce composites using pultrusion. The processing windows used to produce these materials and composites profiles were optimized by using the Taguchi / DOE (Design of Experiments) methods. Composites were manufactured by <b>pultrusion</b> and compression <b>moulding</b> and subsequently submitted to mechanical testing and microscopy analysis. The obtained results were compared with the expected theoretical ones predicted from the Rule of Mixtures (ROM) and with those of similar engineering conventional available materials. The results obtained shown that produced composites have adequate properties for applications in common and structural engineering markets...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} ways of forming {{components}} from composite materials. These include injection moulding, hand lay-up, diaphragm forming, stamping, <b>pultrusion,</b> resin transfer <b>moulding,</b> filament winding, and vacuum forming [1]. In recent years, attention {{has been focused on}} optimising the structural properties of composite components by using continuous fibres. Producing materials that can be formed with minimum force to produce high quality components is a challenging task. In order for a textile composite material to form a given shape, various deformation mechanisms may occur. The most important and widely studied of these is intra-ply shear. One simple approach to predict the formability of components- kinematic draping- is t...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reviews the}} work made in last years to produce {{thermoplastic}} matrix towpregs to highly demanding and more cost-effective commercial applications using a powder coating technology developed in Portugal by Minho and Porto Universities. Different thermoplastic matrices and continuous fibre reinforcements {{were used in}} the towpregs produced for highly demanding markets (e. g., carbon fibre reinforced Primospire towpreg) and for more commercial applications (e. g., glass fibre reinforced polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride towpregs). The relevant processing parameters, such as, fibre pull-speed and furnace temperature were varied to determine their influence on the polymer mass fraction obtained in the studied raw materials. Several technologies were also developed and used (compression <b>moulding,</b> <b>pultrusion</b> and filament winding) to process composite parts with adequate properties for the envisaged markets at compatible production rates. The obtained results lead us to conclude that the studied thermoplastic matrix towpregs and their processed composite parts have very interesting conditions for being applied both in highly advanced and cost-effective markets.
