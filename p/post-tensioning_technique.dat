40|$|With the {{development}} of the <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>technique,</b> prestressed concrete structures have been widely used in civil engineering. To ensure the long-term effectiveness of the prestressed tendon, the grouting quality of the tendon duct is one of the important factors. However, it is still a challenge to monitor the grouting quality of post-tensioning tendon ducts, due to the invisibility of the grouting. The authors’ previous work proposed a real-time method that employed a stress wave-based active sensing approach with piezoceramic transducers to monitor the grouting compactness of a Post-Tensioning Tendon Duct (PTTD). To further understand the piezoceramic induced stress wave propagation in the PTTD with different grouting levels, this paper develops a two-dimensional finite element model for monitoring the grouting compactness of the tendon duct with a piezoceramic transducer. A smart aggregate (SA) developed to utilize one Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) transducer with marble protection is installed in the center location of the tendon duct as an actuator. Two PZT patches are bonded on the bottom and top surface of the tendon duct as the sensors. The analysis results show that the finite element analysis results are in good agreement with the experimental results, which demonstrates that the finite element analysis is feasible and reliable. For {{the top half of the}} specimen, not much stress wave could be detected before the full grouting level, except for negligible signals that may propagate through the walls of the tendon duct. When the tendon duct grouting is at 100 %, the stress wave propagates to the top of the specimen, and the displacements are symmetric in both left-right and top-bottom directions before the stress waves reach the boundary. The proposed two-dimensional finite element model has the potential to be implemented to simulate the stress wave propagation principle for monitoring grouting compaction of the post-tensioning tendon duct...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} principally {{concerned}} with the shape formation of different forms of space trusses with non-zero Gaussian curvature {{by means of a}} <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>technique.</b> The space truss that is shaped and erected by a post-tensioning procedure, rather than by traditional techniques involving cranes and scaffolding, is called a post-tensioned and shaped space truss. The construction procedure for a post-tensioned and shaped space truss initially involves the assembly of a planar truss with a single-layer of chords, together with out-of-plane web members, at ground level. In proportion to the desired space shape, certain bottom chords are given gaps. The bottom chords comprise shorter tubes and strands that pass through the tubes and through the bottom joints. The initially too-short chords are used to create pre-defined gaps, while the tensioning strands are used to close the gaps. By means of post-tensioning, a planar layout can be deformed and erected to its desired space shape at the same time. In this thesis, the principles of the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses, together with the essential aspects that lead to shape formation and self-erection, are investigated theoretically and are verified by experimental models. In addition to theoretical work, seven domes and one hypar have been constructed by means of a post-tensioning method under laboratory conditions. Also, a pyramidal unit of a full-size practical space truss has been tested. After the shape formation tests, three post-tensioned and shaped domes and one hypar space truss have been loaded to failure in order to observe the ultimate load carrying capacity. The post-tensioned and shaped space trusses have satisfactory ultimate load capacity. The post-tensioning process m a y increase or reduce the ultimate load capacity of posttensioned and shaped space trusses, due to the resulted prestress forces in some critical members. Compared with the simplicity in construction and erection procedure, the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses still have evident advantages in economy, even if the ultimate load capacity is reduced. Furthermore, the ultimate load capacity of a posttensioned and shaped space truss can be improved by stiffening only a few critical members according to the test results...|$|E

Similarly, the potential of newly proposed technical solutions to reduce the floor damage by creating a “jointed” or articulated floor system, is discussed. Finally, a brief presentation of recent on-site applications of such systems, featuring some of the latest technical solutions developed in the laboratory, is given as a valuable example of a successful implementation of performance-based seismic design theory and technology in the real construction industry...|$|R
40|$|<b>Post-tensioning</b> <b>techniques</b> for {{strengthening}} existing timber elements {{have been}} used throughout history with excellent results. Former applications on wooden trusses have already shown some {{of the advantages of}} such a consolidating system, but very few tests were performed on the topic. During an experimental campaign, a full-scale historical timber truss was deeply analysed and tested in its original (unreinforced) condition, reaching a considerable level of damage. It was later repaired with a steel cable system, using prestresses to recover the structure bearing capacity, and tested again. The results show that the repair allowed a recovery of at least the 80 % of the ultimate load-carrying capacity. The complete failure was not achieved, but {{it is likely to be}} presumed that the structure could have regained the totality of its strength. The data acquired in both tests were later compared in order to understand in detail the behavior of the truss.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} and successful preliminary experimental validations of innovative types of ductile connections for multi-storey seismic-resisting {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) timber buildings have opened major opportunities for extensive use of structural timber in seismic regions. These particular solutions, named jointed ductile connections or hybrid systems are based on <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>techniques</b> to assemble structural LVL members for both frame and shear wall systems which are designed to exhibit controlled rocking deformations during seismic loading.

40|$|An {{appreciation}} of the crucial need for {{a high level of}} performance from reinforced concrete structures located in seismically active regions has been extensively recognised in the past decade. Appropriate performance-based criteria are essential in ensuring the desired behaviour of structures, especially when a low level of postearthquake damage is desired. “Hybrid” jointed ductile connections originally developed for either pre-cast concrete frames and wall systems have been shown to exhibit superior performance complemented with a reduced level of damage and negligible residual deformations of the structural systems.

The present work reports on the experimental validation into the performance of hybrid bridge pier systems in a cantilever configuration (pier to foundation connection). The response of a single hybrid solution, tested under a uni-directional quasi-static testing regime is compared against a monolithic benchmark.

40|$|Remarkable accomplishments {{have been}} {{observed}} in seismic engineering {{in the recent past}} with the definition and development of high-performance seismic resistant systems, able to sustain major ground motions with limited level of structural damage. Following the introduction and further developments of jointed ductile connections for the seismic design of precast concrete buildings, the concept of hybrid system, where self-centering and energy dissipation capacity are adequately combined by using unbonded <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>techniques</b> and alternative sources of dissipation, has been recently proposed as a viable and efficient solution for an improved seismic performance of bridge systems.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that following a major earthquake a substantial percentage of economic loss results from downtime of essential lifelines in and out of major urban centres. This has thus led to an improvement of both performance-based seismic design philosophies and to the development of cost-effective seismic structural systems capable of guaranteeing a high level of protection, low structural damage and reduced downtime after a design-level seismic event. An example of such technology is the development of unbonded <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>techniques</b> in combination with rocking-dissipating connections. In this contribution, further advances in the development of high-performance seismic-resistant bridge piers are achieved through the experimental validation of unbonded post-tensioned bridge piers with external, fully replaceable, mild steel hysteretic dissipaters. The experimental response of three 1 : 3 scale unbonded, post-tensioned cantilever bridge piers, subjected to quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic loading protocols, are presented and compared with an equivalently reinforced monolithic benchmark. Minimal physical damage is observed for the post-tensioned systems, which exhibit very stable energy dissipation and re-centring properties. Furthermore, the external dissipaters can be easily replaced if severely damaged under a major (higher than expected) earthquake event. Thus, negligible residual deformations, limited repair costs and downtime can be achieved for critical lifeline components. Satisfactory analytical-experimental comparisons are also presented as a further confirmation of the reliability of the design procedure and of the modelling techniques.

40|$|<b>Post-tensioning</b> {{rehabilitation}} <b>technique</b> {{is often}} used to improve the static and dynamic stability of concrete gravity dams. The required post-tensioning force has often been estimated from the gravity method using simple static rigid body equilibrium. However, the application of linear and nonlinear (fracture) analysis techniques using the finite element method could be advantageous to optimize the design of post-tensioning strengthening schemes, specially under seismic loads where controlled damage is an acceptable performance criterion. In this study, the flood and seismic safety evaluations of prestressed dams were carried out using the gravity method, and linear and fracture finite element methods. Two typical concrete gravity dam models, 35 m and 90 m in heights, were examined. The performance of different <b>post-tensioning</b> modelling <b>techniques</b> such as the equivalent force method, and bonded/unbonded cable elements was examined in finite element analyses. A new nonlinear analysis methodology using displacement control was studied to determine the required amount of post-tensioning forces under flood condition. Sliding stability (local and global), overstressing, and controlled damage requirements were considered to develop post-tensioning design criteria in rehabilitation of concrete gravity dams. Various schemes of post-tensioning cable layouts were examined in seismic analyses. The different prestressing modelling techniques present almost identical static and seismic structural behaviours. The material properties of the horizontal joint at the dam-foundation interface, and the tendon layouts were found the key prestressing design parameters. Linear finite element analyses predict higher required prestressing forces compared to other analysis methods. In general, flood resistant: design of prestressing also presents adequate seismic performance for small dams. However, additional partial prestressing is required near the downstream face of higher dams to prevent cracking at this location...|$|R

40|$|While the {{technology}} of post-tensioning has been widely used and well developed in concrete structures, {{it has also been}} applied to other structures, such as timber frame construction. In addition, post-tensioning, along with other strengthening techniques such as retrofitting and carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP), has been used to strengthen and upgrade existing steel structures using similar materials and setup as in post-tensioned concrete beams. However {{the technology}} required for prestressed members can be very expensive and not widely available in many developing countries, or even in remote areas of developed countries such as Australia, and, if specified, may prove to be uneconomical if for example personnel and equipment have to be imported or relocated. The objective of this thesis is therefore to introduce and investigate local post-tensioning (LPT) as a simple and low-cost alternative to modern high-tech <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>techniques.</b> LPT uses conventional reinforcing bars and a manual screw jack (in the case of concrete or steel members) or bracing straps and bracing tensioners (in the case of timber members), instead of tendons and hydraulic jacks, to apply post-tensioning to the new or existing structure. This research investigated LPT reinforced concrete, timber and steel beams, resulting in the following findings: •	Four large-scale concrete beams were locally post-tensioned and tested. Theoretical predictions were made based on AS 3600 - 2009 and a new theoretical approach was proposed to determine the cracking moment of tested beams, since the current design guide was not applicable to this post-tensioning method. •	LPT timber panels were investigated as an application to new structures. Six identicalpanels made of butt jointed and nailed timber beams were post-tensioned and tested under four-point bending. These were compared with equivalent panels made from continuous unjointed beams. In addition, the dynamic behaviour of these panels was experimentally investigated. Results showed that the post-tensioning created hogging deflections and decreased the overall serviceability deflections by almost half of their values; moreover, LPT affected the dynamic behaviour of these panels, in particular the damping ratio, which significantly decreased but remained within the acceptable limits. •	The effectiveness of LPT to enhance the repair of damaged steel beams was studied. Six repaired beams with different bar diameters and levels of pre-stress were tested under three-points bending. The level of post-tensioning controlled the beams’ stiffness, while restoration of their ultimate load-carrying capacity was governed by the bar size. Significantly higher repaired capacities were achieved by this method than by other published methods used for the strengthening of steel beams. •	Upgrading of intact steel beams using LPT was also investigated. In total, seven beams were upgraded and tested under three-point bending, using different configurations of reinforcing steel. The level of post-tensioning, the type of LPT (internal or external) and the diameter of reinforcing bars used significantly affected the beams’ stiffness and their ultimate load-carrying capacity. The results obtained in this study compared favourably with those of other methods used for upgrading steel beams...|$|R

A total of six two-span simply-supported T-section RC girders were cast and five of them strengthened using the provision of the proposed post-tensioned negative moment connections. Both laboratory tests and nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis were conducted to investigate the structural performance of the strengthened RC girders.
