40|$|<b>Patella</b> <b>infera</b> {{may occur}} after {{reconstruction}} of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), high tibial osteotomy and total knee replacement (TKR). Restriction of movement of the knee and pain may result. Our aim was to compare the incidence and to assess the effects of <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> after TKR and unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR). We reviewed radiographs of the knees of 84 patients who had had either TKR or UKR {{as part of a}} randomised, controlled trial The length of the patellar tendon was measured on serial radiographs taken before, at eight months and at five years after operation. There was no significant change in the length of the patellar tendon after UKR, but a significant reduction was observed after TKR. Five years after the operation, the shortening of the tendon had increased to a mean of 3. 5 mm. Of the knees with TKR reviewed at five years, 34 % developed <b>patella</b> <b>infera,</b> defined as 10 % or more of shortening, compared with 5 % of those with UKR. Shortening was greatest in those knees which had required a lateral release; in this subgroup the mean shortening was 7. 2 mm. Shortening correlated with restriction of movement and pain in the knee. Our study has shown that <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> develops in most patients after TKR with lateral release, and in approximately 25 % of patients after TKR without this additional procedure. <b>Patella</b> <b>infera</b> rarely occurs after UKR. It is associated with restriction of movement and pain in the knee. It may be an effect of the more extensive exposure required to perform TKR and may, in part, explain the better clinical results of UKR...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) is resected in {{approximately}} 88 % of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries. The {{aim of this}} review is to investigate {{the impact of the}} IPFP resection on clinical outcomes post-TKA. Materials and methods: A systematic search of five major databases for all relevant articles published until May, 2015 was conducted. Studies comparing the effect of IPFP resection and preservation on outcomes post-TKA were included. Each study was then assessed individually for level of evidence and risk of bias. Studies were then grouped into post-operative outcomes and given a level of evidence ranking based on the collective strength of evidence. Results: The systematic review identified ten studies suitable for inclusion, with a total of 10, 163 patients. Within these ten studies, six post-operative outcomes were identified; knee pain, vascularisation of the patella, range of motion (ROM), <b>patella</b> tendon length/patella <b>infera,</b> wound complications and patient satisfaction. Moderate evidence increased knee pain with IPFP resection post-TKA was found. Conflicting evidence was found for patella vascularisation and patellar tendon length post-TKA. Moderate evidence for no difference in ROM was found. One low quality study was found for wound complications and patient satisfaction. Conclusions: This systematic review is limited by the lack of level one randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There is however moderate level evidence that IPFP resection increases post-operative knee pain. Further level one RCTs are required to produce evidence-based guidelines regarding IPFP resection.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to present the {{different}} surgical procedures of tibial tubercle osteotomies for patellar instability or patellar mispositioning such as patella alta or <b>patella</b> <b>infera.</b> This study analysed the Caton– Deschamps index used for assessment of vertical patella height in order to make a precise plan for tibial tuberosity osteotomies. This study included 61 knees (50 patients) treated for patellar instability with patella alta and 24 patients treated for <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> of mechanical origin. The results of medial transfer of the tibial tuberosity, with or without distal transfer in cases of patellar instability with patella alta, gives excellent results for stability in 76. 8 % of the cases. The results of the proximal transfer of the tibial tuberosity in cases of <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> were excellent or good in 80 % of the cases in our series of 24 patients. A precise preoperative plan is needed with determination of the vertical patellar height using the Caton–Deschamps index and the situation of the tibial tuberosity and the Tibial Tubercle to Trochlear Groove distance (TT-TG) of the knee on CT scan in order to obtain satisfactory results...|$|E

40|$|Background According to the literature, closing {{and opening}} wedge high tibial valgus osteotomies can raise or lower the patella, and diffèrent methods of patella height {{measurement}} show similarly conflicting results.

Effects on tibial slope and patellar tendon length are not well delineated and the influence of sex and age is unknown. Questions/purpose A group of patients who underwent high tibial valgus osteotomy was investigated to determine how surgical technique influenced postoperative (1) patel-lar height and (2) tibial slope and patellar tendon length, and (3) whether age or gender independently influence...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Insall-Salvati {{method of}} {{assessing}} {{the position of}} the patella was applied to four groups of patients: normal patients, and those with dislocation of the patella, chondromalacia of the patella, and apophysitis of the tibial tubercle. The ratio of patellar length to tendon length was 1. 0 in the normal patients, 0. 8 in the patients with dislocations, 0. 86 in those with chondromalacia, and 1. 2 in those with apophysitis of the tibial tubercle. Patella alta may be an important cause of dislocating patella and of chondromalacia patellae. The significance of the <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> found in the Osgood-Schlatter lesion may be one of either cause or effect. Patella alta has been considered a highly significant cause of recurrent dislocation of the patella t,$. 13,i 5 and ha...|$|E
30|$|Although {{proximal}} {{migration and}} gap {{in our case}} became obvious with knee flexion (Fig. 5), patellar migration {{did not seem to}} be pronounced in the extended knee. Neither preoperative traction nor additional intraoperative procedures were performed to relocate the patella to its anatomic position. We did not have any difficulty to move the patella distally by tightening the cerclage wire intraoperatively in the extended knee, as mentioned in the literature [1, 10]. Tightening the wire too much in the extended knee may result in <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> [3]. After repair of the extensor mechanism, resultant quadriceps tension and restriction of flexion were counteracted upon with the use of CPM and repeated bi-weekly brace adjustments in maximum flexion. Good functional result was achieved. The positive outcome in this case suggest that this approach should be studied as a possible solution to obtain proper patellar position and functional ROM.|$|E
30|$|Some authors [68 – 70] have {{suggested}} that opening wedge HTO with emicallotasis and external fixator is the treatment that should be chosen to correct the malalignment; however, we prefer to use this technique with a circular external fixator (Taylor Spatial Frame; Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN) only in deformities that need correction greater than 12.5 °. If an external fixator is applied, the osteotomy is performed distal to the tibial tubercle and does not change patellar height; instead, medial opening wedge HTO is performed proximal to the tibial tubercle, and if the gap is too large, <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> (baja) may occur. This circular external fixator has a computer program that aims to achieve triplanar correction of the deformity and correct also the tibial slope in the sagittal plane [108]. An external fixator enables slow correction of the deformity, improving consolidation of even large osteotomy gaps. An external fixator {{could also be used}} for treatment of failed medial opening wedge HTO [109].|$|E
30|$|Meneghini et al. [9] studied over 1, 000 {{patients}} with TKA {{and concluded that}} a decrease in patella tendon length occurs; stair and function scores after TKA are adversely affected compared with patients in whom the ISR is not decreased. Other studies have associated <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> after TKA with decreased post-operative range of motion, extensor lag, anterior knee pain, anterior polyethylene impingement and wear, and diminished outcomes [5 – 9]. In contrast, after UKA no consistent major effects on early clinical outcome were seen and a weak negative correlation between lower pre-operative BP values and the post-operative knee extension, and a weak negative correlation between lower pre-operative IS values and post-operative knee scores were seen [5]. Our results did show a significant difference only in stair-climbing scores at final follow-up for {{patients with}} post-operative patellar baja. However, when the scores were compared between those patients who had pre-operative patella baja according to both ISR and BPI, who became normal after surgery, and those who remained patella baja after surgery, {{there was no significant}} difference between them. Thus, it shows that a corrective effect of surgery on pre-operative patellar baja is not present.|$|E

30|$|Unicompartmental knee {{arthroplasty}} (UKA) {{is used as}} a modality in {{the management}} of single compartment arthritis [1 – 4]. The evolution of patient selection, surgical technique and implant design over the past 30 years has refined the indications and improved the clinical outcome [1 – 5]. Occurrence of <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> or baja after total knee arthroplasty has been well reported in the literature, wherein patellofemoral mechanics may be altered, resulting in a decreased post-operative range of motion, extensor lag, anterior knee pain, anterior polyethylene impingement and wear, and diminished outcomes [5 – 10]. Patella baja can occur in a relative fashion after a TKA because of elevation in joint line or can occur directly because of excessive scar formation, contracture and shortening of the patellar tendon, such as reported after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, high tibial osteotomy, fractures about the knee etc. [5 – 10]. In spite of the surge in literature of results after UKA, the status of patellar height has been infrequently discussed in the literature. Weale et al. [10] reported an infrequent occurrence of patella baja after UKA, while Naal et al. [5] reported that though patella baja occurred with UKA it had no consistent major effect on the clinical outcome at short-term follow-up.|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} 20 {{patients with}} 24 knees affected by idiopathic genu recurvatum who {{were treated with}} an anterior opening wedge osteotomy of the proximal tibia because of anterior knee pain. We managed to attain full satisfaction in 83 % of the patients with a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. The mean Hospital for Special Surgery score was 90. 3 (range 70. 5 – 99. 5), and the mean Knee Society score score was 94. 6 (70 – 100) for function and 87. 7 (47 – 100) for pain. The mean Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index score for knee function was 87. 5 (42 – 100), for stiffness 82. 8 (25 – 100) and for pain 87. 3 (55 – 100). Radiographs showed {{a significant increase in}} posterior tibial slope of 9. 4  deg and a significant decrease of patellar height according to the Blackburne–Peel method of 0. 16 postoperatively.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{decrease}} of patellar height following opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy can affect function, and subsequent total knee arthroplasty {{may be more}} difficult and give poorer results. HypothesisPre-operative patellar height is an objective predictor of functional result in opening-wedge osteotomy. Patients and methodsThe effect of opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and internal fixation on patellar height and its functional outcome were assessed. Forty supra-tuberosity medial opening wedge osteotomies were performed in 36 patients presenting with medial femorotibial osteoarthritis and varus deformity. Mean age was 55 years. Mean varus was 9 ° and mean opening 11 °. Minimum follow-up was 22 months, {{with a mean of}} 4. 2 years. Clinical results were assessed on the International Knee Society (IKS) scale. X-ray measurements (HKA angle, tibial slope, and patellar height as per Caton-Deschamps [CD], Insall-Salvati [IS] and Blackburne-Peel [BP]) were taken pre-operatively, postoperatively and on follow-up. ResultsPatellar height decreased by 10 to 15 % (p< 0. 0001), depending on the selected ratio. Mean CD index was 0. 85 preoperatively (S. D. = 0. 12), 0. 76 postoperatively (S. D. = 0. 14) and 0. 75 at follow-up (S. D. = 0. 14). Mean IS index was 0. 95 preoperatively (S. D. = 0. 11), 0. 86 postoperatively (S. D. = 0. 12) and 0. 87 at follow-up (S. D. = 0. 12). Mean BP index was 0. 68 preoperatively (S. D. = 0. 10) and 0. 58 postoperatively and at follow-up (S. D. = 0. 12). Tibial slope was altered by a mean of 1. 5 ° (range: − 4 to + 9 °). There was no correlation between opening angle and patellar lowering. Patellar height decrease did not affect functional results whether height remained normal or became low (total IKS score, 179 and 170, respectively); the poorest functional results, however, were associated with <b>patella</b> <b>infera</b> (total score, 147). DiscussionMedial opening-wedge HTO is an established treatment for unicompartmental varus knee osteoarthritis. We do not, however, recommend it in case of preoperative patellar height of less than 0. 6 on the CD ratio. Level of evidenceRetrospective, level IV...|$|E
