2500|$|A {{cycle helmet}} should {{generally}} be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling {{can be an}} intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature, and the head in particular {{needs to be able}} to regulate its temperature. The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the leather [...] "hairnet" [...] style. This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal impact protection, and was mainly used by racing cyclists. More widespread use of helmets began in the U.S. in the 1970s. After many decades, when bicycles were regarded only as children's toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s. Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR, a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment, and Bell Sports, a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles. These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate <b>plastic</b> <b>shells.</b> The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc., having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business.|$|E
2500|$|IC {{locations}} changed {{frequently on}} each motherboard revision, {{as did the}} presence or lack thereof of the metal RF shield around the VIC-II. PAL boards often had aluminized cardboard instead of a metal shield. The SID and VIC-II are socketed on all boards, however the other ICs may be either socketed or soldered. The first production C64s, made in 1982 to early 1983, are known as [...] "silver label" [...] models due to the case sporting a silver-colored [...] "Commodore" [...] logo. The power LED had a separate silver badge around it reading [...] "64". These machines also have only a 5-pin video cable and cannot output S-video. In late 1982, Commodore introduced the familiar [...] "rainbow badge" [...] case, but many machines produced into early 1983 also used silver label cases until the existing stock of them was used up. In the spring of 1983, the original 326298 board {{was replaced by the}} 250407 motherboard which sported an 8-pin video connector and added S-video support for the first time. This case design would be used until the C64C appeared in 1987. All ICs switched to using <b>plastic</b> <b>shells</b> while the silver label C64s had some ceramic ICs, notably the VIC-II. The case is made from ABS plastic which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix [...] "Retr0bright".|$|E

All contacts are the same diameter. Originally metal construction was used, {{but now they are}} also made with <b>plastic</b> <b>shells.</b> Since only keying in the connector shell is used, and since the keys can be damaged in industrial use, it is possible to mis-match worn connectors.|$|E
50|$|Märklin, a German model train maker, {{released}} a {{limited range of}} Thomas & Friends merchandise in HO scale. Because of copyright reasons (using Hornby's toolings), they were only available in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but they did leak out to other countries.

They were only released in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Portable urine-diversion {{dehydration}} toilets are self-contained dry toilets, {{sometimes referred}} to as mobile or stand-alone units. They are identifiable by their one-piece molded <b>plastic</b> <b>shells</b> or, in the case of DIY versions, simple plywood box construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{simulation}} grenade {{which is not}} intended to cause harm, the Thunder-B grenade does not use any explosives. Instead, the grenade simply makes a loud [...] "bang" [...] sound, through the use of compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to burst a <b>plastic</b> <b>shell.</b> The core, which is reusable, is the component with the safety pin which is pulled out to start the timer. The user installs one standard 12 g disposable CO2 cartridge inside the core, and then screws the core into a disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> designed for the grenade. Then, when the user wishes to use the grenade, they pull out the safety pin and throw it. The mechanical parts in the core will puncture the CO2 cartridge and begin releasing pressurized CO2 gas inside the shell. In approximately 3 to 5 seconds, the pressure will be sufficient to cause the <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> to burst, releasing the pressure and producing the loud [...] "bang" [...] sound.|$|R
50|$|Expendable mold casting is {{a generic}} {{classification}} that includes sand, <b>plastic,</b> <b>shell,</b> plaster, and investment (lost-wax technique) moldings. This method of mold casting {{involves the use}} of temporary, non-reusable molds.|$|R

The O chive is made of soft touch <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> and a white matt varnished metal chain and clip. There were originally 10 colours [...] but the three 80' clock colours were added bringing the total to 13. The <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> can be removed and replaced with another colour much like the O clock faces. The packaging is based on a shoe polish container.|$|R
5000|$|With the introduction, between 1969 and 1972, of the Nordica Astral and Grand Prix designs, these [...] "front-entry" [...] style boots {{achieved}} their modern form, with {{a removable}} innerboot {{that could be}} customized for precise and comfortable fit. Martin-style buckles provided the force necessary to close the stiff <b>plastic</b> <b>shells.</b> New buckle designs and other adjustments have been added, but today's overlap race boots look remarkably like the original Nordica Grand Prix. In 1976 Nordica introduced its own series of three-piece designs.|$|E

The inner disks {{come in a}} variety of colors {{including}} pink, blue, yellow, red and green. Googly eyes are used for a variety of arts and crafts projects including pipe cleaner farm animals, silly sock puppets, mischievous pranks, and other creations. Googly eyes may also be attached to inanimate objects in order to give the objects a [...] "silly" [...] or [...] "cute" [...] appearance. This use often personifies the objects for a humorous effect.|$|E

50|$|Fixed-weight {{dumbbells}} are weights {{created in}} a dumbbell shape. Inexpensive varieties consist of cast iron, sometimes coated with rubber or neoprene for comfort, and even cheaper versions {{consist of a}} rigid <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> that is filled with concrete.|$|R
50|$|Some vendors provide true blast shelters {{engineered}} to provide good protection to individual families at modest cost. One common design approach uses fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>shells.</b> Compressive protection may {{be provided by}} inexpensive earth arching. The overburden is designed to shield from radiation. To prevent the shelter from floating to the surface in high groundwater, some designs have a skirt held-down with the overburden. A properly designed, properly installed home shelter does not become a sinkhole in the lawn. In Switzerland, which requires shelters for private apartment blocks and large private houses, the lightest shelters are constructed of stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|Paper shotshells, {{consisting}} of a paper body with a brass base and rim, have continued to be made and used many years after their general replacement with plastic shotshells. The only areas where these are still used in fairly large numbers, though, are in extremely cold areas where <b>plastic</b> <b>shells</b> often split when fired at -40 degree C temperatures (-40F), and when handloading very low pressure rounds for extremely old shotguns. Paper shotshells consist of a coiled paper tube, placed in a brass base, with the web of the case made of compressed paper pulp. These cartridges are sturdy enough to be reloaded many times.|$|E
50|$|Trench bunkers {{are small}} {{concrete}} structures, partly {{dug into the}} ground. Many artillery installations, especially for coastal artillery, have historically been protected by extensive bunker systems. Typical industrial bunkers include mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes living quarters. When a house is purpose-built with a bunker, the normal location is a reinforced below-ground bathroom with fibre-reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>shells.</b> Bunkers deflect the blast wave from nearby explosions to prevent ear and internal injuries to people sheltering in the bunker. Nuclear bunkers must also cope with the underpressure that lasts for several seconds after the shock wave passes, and block radiation.|$|E
50|$|Each IBM 1316 Disk Pack is 4 in high, weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and {{contains}} six 14 in diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are {{mounted on a}} common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack {{is covered with a}} clear <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the <b>plastic</b> <b>shell,</b> which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{itself is}} made of a glossy black <b>plastic</b> <b>shell</b> over <b>plastic</b> {{internals}} and includes a detachable pancake-style lens hood. The lens itself is colloquially {{referred to as a}} pancake lens as it is currently the thinnest lens offered for Sony E-mount.|$|R
50|$|The {{ring core}} {{may also be}} {{composed}} of two separate C-shaped hemispheres secured together within a <b>plastic</b> <b>shell,</b> permitting it {{to be placed on}} finished cables with large connectors already installed, that would prevent threading the cable through the small inner diameter of a solid ring.|$|R
