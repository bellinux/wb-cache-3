60|$|A compact {{crystalline}} rock, banded {{in straight}} lines with innumerable layers {{of white and}} grey shades of colour, varying in width from the thirtieth to the two-hundredth of an inch; these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar, and they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar, which are placed lengthways; they are also thickly studded with microscopically minute, amorphous, black specks, which are placed in rows, either standing separately, or more frequently united, {{two or three or}} several together, into black lines, thinner than a hair. When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe, the black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads, which become magnetic,--characters that apply to no common mineral except hornblende or augite. With the black specks there are mingled some others of a red colour, which are magnetic before being heated, and no doubt are oxide of iron. Round two little cavities, in a specimen of this variety, I found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals, appearing like those of augite or hornblende, but too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer; in the specimen, also, I could distinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar, grains, which had the aspect of quartz. By trying with a <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler,</b> I found that the thin grey layers and the black hair-like lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each other. It is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties, or indeed the character of the different layers in the same specimen, without feeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect aggregation of diffused matter, into the black and red specks of hornblende and oxide of iron.|$|E

5000|$|In 1813 Farey also {{constructed}} a machine for drawing ellipses, the so-called ellipsograph. The device became so popular, that the 6th {{edition of the}} Encyclopædia Britannica (1824) included an article about it, which started with: [...] ELLIPTOGRAPH, an instrument for drawing ellipses. The trammel is an instrument {{that has long been}} known and used for describing ellipses. On the principle of the trammel, Mr Farey constructed his elliptograph in a form much more commodious for drawing. Mr Farey's elliptograph is represented at fig. 5. Plate LXXIX. The circle A slides between the two <b>parallel</b> <b>rulers</b> D E. The circle 13 slides between two <b>parallel</b> <b>rulers</b> FG, at right angles to the former. In this way, if a line, joining the centres of the circles, is made to revolve, M, the extremity of that line, will describe an ellipse in the same manner, as the extremity E of the line C D E, fig. 1, does in the trammel. The elliptograph may be considered as a trammel, in which the pins C and D, rig. 1, are enlarged into the circles A and B, fig. 5...etc, etc.|$|R

5000|$|The {{wings of}} the Breguet 900 were straight-tapered, with squared off tips with small tip fences. They had marked dihedral. Forward of the single box spar [...] the wing was plywood covered, with fabric aft. Narrow ailerons {{occupied}} the outer halves of the wing trailing edge, with flaps of the same chord inboard. From the second prototype onwards the Breguet 900 had spoilers at about mid-chord just inboard of the ailerons. On the earliest aircraft these were of the DFS type but were later replaced by Schempp-Hirth <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler</b> action brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler</b> {{was invented}} in about 1584 by Fabrizio Mordente, {{but it was not}} in common use until the 18th century.In the 19th century a retired sea captain, Captain William Andrew Feild (c. 1790/1 - 1870) of Fold Farm, Herbrandston in Pembrokeshire, {{improved}} the design by adding a protractor-style scale to the upper edge of one rule, and compass points to the opposing edge, which made reading bearings easier. Examples exist of boxwood, ivory or ebony, usually with brass hinges. The instrument usually had two links, but longer models sometimes had three, and sometimes the links were scissored. Another variation is the [...] "roller" [...] model which included a cylindrical roller for ease of use.|$|E
5000|$|Ciani {{designed}} the Eventuale {{with the intention}} of combining the cross country speed of his Urendo with the low speed thermal climb ability of the CVV-6 Canguro. Like his other designs it was built by Sezioni Sperimentale di Volo a Vela (SSVV) of Milan. [...] It had a wooden, straight tapered, mid-mounted wing built around a single spar and entirely plywood covered. The wing spar had slight forward sweep; the wing leading edge was unswept but there was marked forward sweep on the trailing edge. By moving the centre of gravity forward the forward sweep enabled both pilots to sit ahead of the wing, allowing them better visibility. <b>Parallel</b> <b>ruler</b> configuration airbrakes were fitted just aft of the spar at about mid-span.|$|E

5000|$|The {{competition}} stipulated the 15 m span gliders {{had to be}} wooden, though fabric covering {{could be}} used. [...] Its cantilever wing was built around a single spar with plywood skinning around the wing forward of it. The wing was attached to a pylon about 230 mm above the fuselage and at the centreline the wing ply extended back to about 70% chord, returning to the spar about 1 m along it. The wing planform was strongly double straight tapered, mostly on the trailing edge where ailerons occupied almost half the span. [...] These were split into two nearly equal sections and acted differentially. <b>Parallel</b> <b>ruler</b> type airbrakes were placed a little inboard of the ailerons, at mid-chord. [...] Near the roots the airfoil section was NACA 4514; further out this was tapered into the symmetric NACA 0012 of the tips, which had 4° of washout to prevent tip stalling.|$|E
50|$|At a glance, this pistol is {{visually}} {{more similar}} to the later Colt 1911 than to the Colt 1902 Sporting Model from which it evolved. However, a cursory inspection will show many differences to the Model 1911: {{the lack of any}} safety as well as the lack of a slide lock, the magazine release is {{at the bottom of the}} grip rather than a button on the side, and a wedge retaining the slide. The locking system uses two links vs. the single link of the later M1911. The two links (one near the muzzle, the other under the chamber) unlocked the barrel in a motion identical to that of a <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler.</b> The drawback to this design was the need for a cross-wedge in the slide near the muzzle, for assembly and dis-assembly. If the slide cracked or the wedge came loose, the slide could exit the frame to the rear, injuring the shooter. The design limited the strength of the cartridge that could be used.|$|E

5000|$|The Circe {{is built}} from {{composite}} materials, with flying surfaces and fuselage shells made from glass-balsa-glass sandwiches. The wings {{have a single}} spar with flanges of aligned glass fibre (uni-directional rovings) and a glass-balsa sandwich web. The fuselage has GRP-balsa stiffening cross-members. The wing is tapered in two sections, with more taper on the outer 40% of the span. Such double taper plans can provide lift/drag ratios close {{to that of the}} ideal elliptical wing, and have benign stall characteristics. [...] Ailerons occupy all the trailing edge of the outer panels, with flaps across the inner panels. Four sets of Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, two per wing, are located just behind the spar, roughly centred on the inner panels. Each set extends its surfaces, mounted like <b>parallel</b> <b>rulers,</b> above and below the wing. They were difficult to design because of the considerable flexure of the wing, the latter leading to the Circe's nickname of Gummiflügel (Rubberwing) at a time of stiffer structures.|$|R
60|$|Mr Pecksniff's {{professional}} engagements, indeed, were almost, if not entirely, {{confined to}} the reception of pupils; for the collection of rents, with which pursuit he occasionally varied and relieved his graver toils, can hardly {{be said to be}} a strictly architectural employment. His genius lay in ensnaring parents and guardians, and pocketing premiums. A young gentleman's premium being paid, and the young gentleman come to Mr Pecksniff's house, Mr Pecksniff borrowed his case of mathematical instruments (if silver-mounted or otherwise valuable); entreated him, from that moment, to consider himself one of the family; complimented him highly on his parents or guardians, as the case might be; and turned him loose in a spacious room on the two-pair front; where, in the company of certain drawing-boards, <b>parallel</b> <b>rulers,</b> very stiff-legged compasses, and two, or perhaps three, other young gentlemen, he improved himself, for three or five years, according to his articles, in making elevations of Salisbury Cathedral from every possible point of sight; and in constructing in the air a vast quantity of Castles, Houses of Parliament, and other Public Buildings. Perhaps in no place in the world were so many gorgeous edifices of this class erected as under Mr Pecksniff's auspices; and if but one-twentieth part of the churches which were built in that front room, with one or other of the Miss Pecksniffs at the altar in the act of marrying the architect, could only be made available by the parliamentary commissioners, no more churches would be wanted for at least five centuries.|$|R
50|$|The Košava was {{commissioned}} by the Yugoslavian Aeronautical Union and built at the Ikarus factory to replace the pre-World War II Kranich II aircraft. It is a wooden glider, covered {{in a mixture of}} plywood and fabric. The wings are built up around single spars, with ply covering to the leading edge forming a D- or torsion box. Behind the spar the covering is fabric. Forward sweep of 4.5° at one quarter chord allows the centre of gravity to be far enough forward to place the rear of the two tandem seats at it and the leading edge. The wing is of gull wing design, the roots at the shoulder wing position and with 7° of dihedral on the inboard 40% of span. A subsidiary spar carries plain flaps inboard, mass balanced and sealed ailerons, divided into two sections, outboard. The first prototype had a pair of under surface airbrakes on each wing but these were replaced on the second aircraft with Schempp-Hirth <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler</b> action brakes.|$|E
40|$|Visualization is an {{important}} aspect of architectural design. This field has evolved and influenced continuously the design medium and process. Architecture implies experience of space and experience relies on motion. Presently, the visualization process offers minimal experiential feed-back as it lacks immersive and proprioceptive output. Recent technological leaps necessitate a re-evaluation of the architectural visualization process. Advancements in flight simulation and virtual reality applications can be implemented in new tools for architects. This thesis defines the parameters of a 3 D, immersive design tool. The proposed tool provides feed-back beyond photo-realism, tapping into the experiential qualities of the designed spaces. The parameters of the proposed tool extend the boundaries of architectural visualization into experientialization. These alternatives investigate the use in architecture of digital 3 D environments and space/time continuum. Modeling, manipulation, and navigation are analyzed and concrete original implementations are shown. A new method, similar to a 3 D <b>parallel</b> <b>ruler,</b> is demonstrated to overcome constraints in representation, imposed by two-dimensional displays. Immersion and engagement are necessary for the simulation of a compelling architectural experience. An analysis of stimuli and determination of necessary levels of input is performed. For this, {{it is important to understand}} perception and environmental properties. In this thesis, a phenomenological approach to architectural experience analysis is employed. The practical application of the proposed tool is critical. Specific hardware and software analysis is performed to assure the feasibility of implementing such a tool. by Razvan Neagu. Thesis (M.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{construction}} of the Golomb optimal rulers is studied with a tree search approach. Improvements to the basic algorithm are given and it is parallelized using a shared memory. The application associated to this approach is written in C using the standard OpenMP and MPI libraries. The algorithm takes advantage of a collaboration mech-anism between the processors. Different load balancing strategies are studied. The application has proved efficient up to 32 processors. This solution opens up some new perspectives such as solving the already resolved instances of the problem more quickly, and solving next open instances in the future.

60|$|Jim paced athwart, and his {{footsteps}} {{in the vast}} silence were loud to his own ears, as if echoed by the watchful stars: his eyes, roaming about {{the line of the}} horizon, seemed to gaze hungrily into the unattainable, and did not see the shadow of the coming event. The only shadow on the sea was the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from the funnel its immense streamer, whose end was constantly dissolving in the air. Two Malays, silent and almost motionless, steered, one {{on each side of the}} wheel, whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval of light thrown out by the binnacle. Now and then a hand, with black fingers alternately letting go and catching hold of revolving spokes, appeared in the illumined part; the links of wheel-chains ground heavily in the grooves of the barrel. Jim would glance at the compass, would glance around the unattainable horizon, would stretch himself till his joints cracked, with a leisurely twist of the body, in the very excess of well-being; and, as if made audacious by the invincible aspect of the peace, he felt he cared for nothing that could happen to him to the end of his days. From time to time he glanced idly at a chart pegged out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged table abaft the steering-gear case. The sheet of paper portraying the depths of the sea presented a shiny surface under the light of a bull's-eye lamp lashed to a stanchion, a surface as level and smooth as the glimmering surface of the waters. <b>Parallel</b> <b>rulers</b> with a pair of dividers reposed on it; the ship's position at last noon was marked with a small black cross, and the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as Perim figured the course of the ship--the path of souls towards the holy place, the promise of salvation, the reward of eternal life--while the pencil with its sharp end touching the Somali coast lay round and still like a naked ship's spar floating in the pool of a sheltered dock. 'How steady she goes,' thought Jim with wonder, with something like gratitude for this high peace of sea and sky. At such times his thoughts would be full of valorous deeds: he loved these dreams and the success of his imaginary achievements. They were the best parts of life, its secret truth, its hidden reality. They had a gorgeous virility, the charm of vagueness, they passed before him with an heroic tread; they carried his soul away with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an unbounded confidence in itself. There was nothing he could not face. He was so pleased with the idea that he smiled, keeping perfunctorily his eyes ahead; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of the wake drawn as straight by the ship's keel upon the sea as the black line drawn by the pencil upon the chart.|$|R
40|$|As liberation {{movements}} {{rise up and}} overthrow existing {{powers of}} imperialism and oppression, a sense of promise and hope is felt that is all too often lost {{in the years to}} follow. The role that these liberation movements must fulfil shift from agencies of transformation to effective governments that uphold the democratic principles they strived for. However, as this article explains, this role change is rarely realised as ruling parties become a new elite replacing the former oppressors. These <b>parallels</b> between colonial <b>rulers</b> and liberation-movements-turned-dominant-parties are drawn by the author by exploring many trends. Namely, analysing decolonisation as a method of consolidating rule that is maintained through processes of rhetoric and national unification is addressed. This is followed by a discussion of how the state is subordinated both interests of the ruling party, using examples from Southern Africa. Finally, the discussion concludes with the issue of identity within liberation movements pre- and post- independence, and the limitation this places on true democratisation. [URL]...|$|R
