50|$|Different cable {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} methods of identification for the shielded pairs of cable. Belden have a sequenced color code {{and a number}} {{for each of the}} conductors in their products of up to 52 pair cables, for their plenum cables each pair is covered with their <b>patended</b> Belfoil shield, that is only conductive on the inner surface. For their portable cables they use a French braid. Canare, Mogami, Clark Wire & Cable and GEPCO mark numbers on the PVC insulation of the individual pairs.|$|E

On 4 February 1833, he was <b>patended</b> bookseller from maison Gide fils. He was a major printer of lithographs and financed the publication of six volumes among the nineteen of the Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France by Charles Nodier and Justin Taylor.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new, and {{different}} approach for {{return to the}} launch site of non-SSTO reusable space transportation vehicles. The winged reusable stages are {{to be caught in}} the air, and towed back to their launch site without any necessity of an own propulsion system. This so called in-air-capturing method (<b>patend</b> pending) is initiated by large cargo transports, ffering sufficient thrust capability to tow a winged launcher stage with restrained lift to drag ratio. Technical requirements of the tow-aircraft indicate, that (depending on the stage's size) an Airbus A- 34 o or B- 747 -class jet offers good thrust margins. The performance gain by the advanced capturing method shows a possible increase in delivered payload between 15 % and 25 %, assuming the same structural technology level of the stages. Alternatively, the size of a reusable system can be significantly reduced compared to the standard approach, without any loss in payload mass. The paper presents {{a detailed description of the}} proposed method, giving data of numerical simulations regarding the nominal mission. A comparative analysis, looking also at conventional systems quantifies the advantages. The second part of the paper proofs the viability of the proposed in-air-capturing method by regarding its off-design performance. Assuming different perturbations of the normal flight, including a change in atmospheric wind or slightly different stage-separation conditions. Analysis shows the flight dynamic potential of the descending vehicle to dissipate energy to be quite comfortable...|$|R
5000|$|Guilford mill was {{situated}} on the northern branch of the Patuxent River, known as the Little Patuxent River. A mill {{may have been in}} operation there by 1743, and one is documented to have been in operation there in 1761 when the area was still part of Northwestern Anne Arundell County. Charles Alexander Warfield and Elizabeth Ridgley built a joint mill on land <b>patended</b> as [...] "Wincopin Neck". Gristmill operations were underway by 1760. Later owners of the factory included Richard Ridgley. [...] By 1792 the site consisted of a gristmill, sawmill, blacksmith and a stable. Around 1834 a granitequarry was started. Just north of the quarry, Charles Worthington built a stone home with walls two feet thick named [...] "Moundview" [...] that would stand until 1990 when the South Columbia Baptist Church was built on its site. By 1860, Henry A Penny built a house onsite in 1860 and worked as a hauler, he would become county commissioner in the early 1900s. From 1863 to 1890 when slave labor was unavailable the quarries were mostly stagnant. On December 31, 1874 the Guilford Post office opened and remained in operation until June 30, 1920. In 1876, Guilford School opens on Guilford and Oakland Mills roads, and Guilford Colored School opens on land given by Williams, Clark and Rodgers near Guilford and Mission roads.|$|E
5000|$|... 1950 the Swiss Roger Perrinjaquet invents an appliance, {{which is}} <b>patended</b> on the 6th March 1950 under the section {{handheld}} appliances. His wish {{was to work}} with this appliance directly in pans on the stove. Bamix, {{the name of this}} handheld blender is composed of the words battre and mixer (beat and mix). Without having investors, Perrinjaquet sold the patents to ESGE Ltd, which was producing initially bicycle racks, electrical kitchen knives, watches and small electrical motors. At the end of the Fifties, the company launched the fabrication of the first handheld blenders in serie. At the beginning of the Sixties, several production sites were opened, especially the current head office of the company in Mettlen, in the canton Thurgau. During this period, the daily production amounts to 250 blenders, today it is a number of 2000 blenders. The company is selling nowadays its products worldwide in over 25 countries. 1964 the company was sold to the group General Electrics. The Americans tried to increase the falling sales figures through the reduction of the production sites.The Belgian Walter Bodart purchased the company back in 1971. ESGE Ltd. in Mettlen will be the only site for Bamix. The philosophy of Walter Bodart is simple: Quality for quantity, concentration on one single product and an administrative organisation as small as possible.1986 took place a management by out to the sirs Gunsch, Rüttiman and Stahl. 2002 the group is sold to the Sirs Jud and Eigenmann. Erich Eigenmann serves as CEO of ESGE Ltd. since 1 October 2002. Since its inventation, Bamix has changed rarely during the last decennium.|$|E
40|$|Designated {{verifier}} signatures {{were introduced}} {{in the middle of}} the 90 's by Jakobsson, Sako and Impagliazzo, and independenty <b>patended</b> by Chaum as private signatures. In this setting, a signature can only be verified by a unique and specific user. At Crypto' 03, Desmedt suggested the problem of generalizing the designated verifier signatures. In this case, a signature should be intended to a specific set of different verifiers. In this article, we provide a formal definition of multi-designated verifiers signatures and give a rigorous treatment of the security model for such a scheme. We propose a construction based on ring signatures, which meets our definition, but does not achieve the privacy of signer's identity property. Finally, we propose a very efficient bi-designated verifiers signature scheme based on bilinear maps, which protects the anonymity of signers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationships}} between salesperson emotional intelligence, dispositional affectivity, and customer-orientation levels in pharmaceutical marketing. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 71 pharmaceutical salespeople working in the UK provided responses to scales designed to assess emotional intelligence, dispositional affectivity (positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) and customer orientation). The emotional intelligence and dispositional affectivity scores provided by the salespeople were then analyzed to determine the degree to which they related to customer-orientation levels. Findings – The findings indicate that salesperson emotional intelligence levels are positively correlated with their customer-orientation scores. Positive dispositional affectivity levels are also significantly correlated with salesperson customer-orientation levels. This result suggests that UK pharmaceutical salespeoplewho possessedmore <b>PAtended</b> to also bemore positively oriented to the customer. However, NA levels are not significantly correlated with salesperson customer-orientation levels. Research limitations/implications – From a theoretical perspective, these findings provide a venue for future research in professional sales which could focus on the relationships existing between salesperson behaviors/characteristics that relate to salesperson customer-orientation, skills, social desirability, and performance. Practical implications – From a practical basis, the findings suggest that pharmaceutical firms in the UK who are focused on increasing the customer-orientation levels of their sales force would be well advised to assess the emotional intelligence and dispositional affectivity levels of both their potential and current salespeople and use this information in their selection and training activities. Originality/value – The research reported provides an initial assessment of the relationship between these variables in a pharmaceutical sales situation in the UK. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{wave energy}} plant {{based on the}} <b>patended</b> Seawave Slot-Cone Generator (SSG) is under {{development}} by the Norwegian company WAVEenergy AS. The concept {{is based on the}} principle that the incoming waves will run uphill on a structure slope and on their return downhill they will flow into multiple reservoirs at different levels. A turbine with multiple stages is being designed to handle the conversion of the potential energy from the different reservoirs. One critical design element of the so-called Multi Stage Turbine (MST) is the choice of labyrinth seals. The labyrinth seals need to be designed in a way that prevents air from leaking into the suction side of the turbine stages. The company Mechanica AS has suggested a design where the labyrinth seals are pressurized by leading water from above the turbine through orifices to the lower labyrinth seal. A model has been made and the labyrinth seal has been tested. The model does not include the turbine, but only the labyrinth seal with appropriate pressure conditions. Additionally, a CFD model of the seal was made, and the calculated results were compared with the test results. Seing that the CFD results showed relatively good correlation with the test results, the CFD model was used to make some further simulations of the labyrinth seal performance. The most important conclusion of both model and CFD results is that the orifices appear to sufficiently pressurize the labyrinth seal. It is not known if this will still be the case when the seal is implemented in the turbine. And although the labyrinth seal should meet the requirement to prevent air leakage, it may still reduce the efficiency of the turbine by causing disturbances in the turbine flow. This must be considered when deciding upon the final MST design, where eventually manufacture practicality and cost are the main regulators. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{delivery}} is considered for {{an increasing number}} of existing and new drugs and vaccines, but current nasal delivery devices have major disadvantages. The Norwegian company OptiNose AS is developing a novel concept that challenges traditional delivery systems. The <b>patended</b> bi-directional delivery system improves drug and vaccine distribution to the nasal mucous membrane {{while at the same time}} preventing lung deposition. It takes advantage of the posterior connection between the nasal passages persisting when the velum automatically closes during oral exhalation. It is the exhalation into the delivery device that triggers the release of particles into an airflow, which enters one nostril via a sealing nozzle and exits through the other nostril. This paper describes how OptiNose is using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) during the development process for their drug delivery concept. The simulations are used to visualize and demonstrate the basic features of the bi-directional technique and discuss how its design and function could be further optimized. CFD computations thus increase the efficiency of device development and reduce the need for expensive and time consuming laboratory experiments. To perform successful CFD calculations on the nose, construction of a proper surface grid of the nasal cavity is important. The process of building the surface grid is presented in the paper. The final surface grid was next imported into Tgrid, a volume grid generator, and finally the simulations were carried out by use of the commercial CFD code FLUENT. These steps are described in the paper. Testing of the cell quality, both during surface grid and volume grid generation, is mandatory. The testing procedures are briefly presented in the paper. Finally, to be able to rely on the CFD computations done, one needs thorough validation. This article presents some comparison of the CFD computation results against physical experiments. The comparison analysis shows promising results...|$|E
