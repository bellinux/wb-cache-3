40|$|All {{patients}} operated {{because of}} WPW-syndrome between 1980 and 1990 at the University clinics of Zurich were followed up by clinical examination and by electrocardiography. Relief from symptoms (tachycardia, vertigo and/or syncopes) {{was defined as}} "symptomatic" success, lack of preexcitation in the ECG at rest as "surgical" success. Overall 56 patients (40 men, 16 women) aged from 13 to 66 years had been operated in the stated time period. Before operation 52 of these patients had <b>pre-excitations</b> in the ECG, 54 had tachycardia and 23 had syncopes. None of the patients died from the operation. In order to localize the AAVVs epicardial cartography was performed in all patients during operation before the AAVVs were cut through an endocardial access. The follow-up was possible after an average interval of 5. 5 years (1 - 120 months) in 50 of the 56 patients. One patient died 10 years after operation from heart failure. 6 patients were reported {{to be out of}} the country. The follow-up revealed symptomatic success of the intervention, defined as absence of tachycardia, in 88 % (44 out of 50). In 84 % (42 out of 50) also a surgical success of the operation was found. In these patients the accessory atrio-ventricular bundle had been successfully ablated, and they were free of tachycardia and of preexcitation in the ECG. Two patients with persisting preexcitation remained free of clinical symptoms. Insofar the rate of symptomatic success was higher than the rate of surgical success.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of five years 12 {{patients}} underwent electrophysiological studies for the investigation of recurrent tachycardias which showed ventricular <b>pre-excitation.</b> Nine patients had a type B pattern and two a type A.

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenic}} {{mechanism for}} the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic <b>pre-excitation</b> syndrome has not yet been fully elucidated. We sought {{to assess the impact of}} <b>pre-excitation</b> on LV systolic function and whether the use of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and speckle tracking is more helpful in detection of the LV dyssynchrony than conventional echo parameters in these patients. Methods: This observational case control study was carried out on adults with manifest <b>pre-excitation</b> syndromes. A detailed echocardiographic assessment was performed including TDI and speckle tracking examination. Results: Our study patients were divided into two groups, group 1 : with lateral accessory pathways (AP) (23 patients aged 31. 65  ±  6. 5  years), group 2 : with septal AP (25 patients, 34. 84  ±  10. 8  years). Echocardiography showed a lower ejection fraction (EF) in group 2 than in group 1 (0. 60  ±  0. 07 % in group 1 vs. 0. 50  ±  0. 08 % in group 2, p =  0. 000). The radial strain dyssynchrony index was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (58. 78  ±  33. 47 vs. 139. 52  ±  21. 14  ms; p <  0. 0001) with a significant negative correlation with EF (r = − 0. 8, p =  0. 000). Dyssynchrony detection was higher using speckle tracking technique than M mode/Doppler methods (p =  0. 006). Conclusion: Patients with <b>pre-excitation</b> syndrome may have depressed LV function unrelated to tachyarrhythmia, especially if the AP has a septal location.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{characterize}} an animal {{model of the}} Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome to help elucidate the mechanisms of accessory pathway formation. BackgroundPatients with mutations in PRKAG 2 manifest cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular pre-excitation; however, the mechanisms underlying the development and conduction of accessory pathways remain unknown. MethodsWe created transgenic mice overexpressing either the Asn 488 Ile mutant (TGN 488 I) or wild-type (TGWT) human PRKAG 2 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid under a cardiac-specific promoter. Both groups of transgenic mice underwent intracardiac electrophysiologic, electrocardiographic (ECG), and histologic analyses. ResultsOn the ECG, ∼ 50 % of TGN 488 Imice displayed sinus bradycardia and features suggestive of <b>pre-excitation,</b> not seen in TGWTmice. The electrophysiologic studies revealed a distinct atrioventricular (AV) connection apart from the AV node, using programmed stimulation. In TGN 488 Imice with <b>pre-excitation,</b> procainamide blocked bypass tract conduction, whereas adenosine infusion caused AV block in TGWTmice but not TGN 488 Imice with <b>pre-excitation.</b> Serial ECGs in 16 mice pups revealed no differences at birth. After one week, two of eight TGN 488 Ipups had ECG features of <b>pre-excitation,</b> increasing to seven of eight pups by week 4. By nine weeks, one TGN 488 Imouse with WPW syndrome lost this phenotype, whereas TGWTpups never developed <b>pre-excitation.</b> Histologic investigation revealed postnatal development of myocardial connections through the annulus fibrosum of the AV valves in young TGN 488 Ibut not TGWTmice.

40|$|In a {{study of}} 45 cases of {{ventricular}} <b>pre-excitation,</b> 19 were classified as type A and 20 as type B according to Rosenbaum's criteria, which depend on the polarity of the major deflections in the right praecordial leads and not, as is commonly thought, on {{the direction of the}} delta vector. Six cases that could not be classified as type A or type B were termed intermediate. Vectorcardiograms were recorded from 29, and these showed a wide but continuous range of values for both the delta and the main QRS vectors in all three planes. Any classification based on these features must, therefore, depend on arbitrary quantitative data. Three patients in this series had associated right bundle-branch block.

40|$|The {{rationale}} behind active treatment and ablation in asymptomatic WPW {{is to prevent}} sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD in asymptomatic WPW syndrome has been noted to vary from 0. 15 to 0. 39 % over 3 - 10 years follow up [1, 2]. SCD happens in WPW in relation to rapid pre-excited atrial fibrillation (AF) with fast ventricular response. It happens in 50 % of SCD as the first manifestation. Hence, though the incidence of SCD is low in WPW, the same is avoidable in suitably selected cases. It can presently be taken care of, by radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the bypass tract without significant morbidity. What then are the criteria to select patients of Asymptomatic WPW who may be predisposed to SCD? The markers identified for SCD include: 1.

In the two human subjects with type B WPW, the area of <b>pre-excitation</b> was located on the anterior aspect of the RV and in the dog with type A the pre-excited area was located on the posterior aspect of the RV. A probable Kent bundle electrogram was recorded from the A-V margin {{in one of the}} human patients. Serial sections (7 p,) of a block taken from the region of <b>pre-excitation</b> in the dog revealed an anomalous A-V communication (Kent bundle). Propagation velocity across this pathway was estimated to be 0. 3 mm/msec. Electrophysiologic data recorded from one of the human subjects at the onset and during an episode of supraventricular tachycardia demonstrated an atrioventricular-atrial {{sequence of}} excitation. The mechanism of initiation of the tachyeardia was a ventriculo-atrial echo following a premature atrial contraction blocked in the anomalous pathway. Surgical separation of right atrium and RV at the site of <b>pre-excitation</b> normalized the activation and ECG and abolished the tachycardia in both patients.
