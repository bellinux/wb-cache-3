5000|$|Being {{part of the}} Black Country, Bloxwich grew {{rapidly in}} the 18th century around coal mining, iron {{smelting}} and various manufacturing industries, {{as part of the}} Industrial Revolution. Manufacturing in the area consisted of bridle bits, stirrups, keys, cabinet locks, <b>plane</b> <b>irons,</b> buckle tongues, chains and saddles. Its most famous product of manufacture were awl blades, which it is reputed to have surpassed all other places in the United Kingdom in manufacturing. In the early 19th century, Bloxwich was still a village. Most of its inhabitants were employed in the newly founded mining and forging industries, as well as light metalworking.

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{advantage}} of the scary sharp system is speed and cost. Anyone with access to sandpaper and a reasonably flat surface can sharpen any cutting tool, often with good results. Unlike traditional stones, no maintenance {{is required for the}} scary-sharp set-up, since the sharpening surface does not form a hollow with repeated, uneven usage. A hollowed surface is undesirable in most sharpening situations, an example being the flat surface required in the back (as opposed to the beveled surface) of most woodworking <b>plane</b> <b>irons.</b> Compared to stones, sandpaper is lower in cost as well. A fresh sheet of sandpaper often cuts significantly faster than a bench sharpening stone. For this reason, coarse-grit papers can be used to dress damaged cutting edge quickly, removing chips along the edge and preparing it for the next stage/grit of edge refinement.|$|R
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman <b>plane</b> <b>iron</b> used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England.

50|$|In 1835 minor {{conflict}} {{had occurred}} {{in the area and}} threatened to erupt into full-scale war. William Thomas Fairburn, the CMS missionary, attempted to solve the issues for nearly a year. With the agreement of local Maori at a meeting at Puneke on the Tamaki River on 22 January 1836, he purchased the entire Bucklands Beach, Howick and Pakuranga area of 40000 acre. The price paid to 3 local chiefs was 10 blankets, 24 axes, 26 hoes, 14 spades, $80, 1900 lb of tobacco, 24 cobs and 12 <b>plane</b> <b>irons.</b> The value of the goods was about 907 pounds and 17 shillings and 6 pence. The 3 hapu who sold the land were Ngatitawaki, Urikaraka and Matekiwaho. The principal chiefs who signed the sale were Herua, Te Waru, Hauauru and Te Tara. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed at Karaka Bay on the Tamaki River opposite Big Bucklands Beach in 1840 by Capt Hobson and Ngati Paoa.After the treaty signing the Fairburn purchase was examined by the government, who determined that Fairburn could keep 1/7 of the land, with the rest being claimed by the government, who later sold it on in smaller blocks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{rotation}} {{of a star}} {{on the distribution of}} chemical species in radiative zones is discussed. Gravity darkening generates a large radiative force on heavy element ions which is directed toward the equatorial <b>plane.</b> Taking <b>iron</b> as an example, it is shown that this force may produce drift velocities similar to, and larger than, the typical velocities of bulk motion due to meridional circulation. This potentially allows large chemical abundance inhomogeneities to build up across a meridian over the lifetime of the star – particularly near the equatorial plane. This enhancement may be significantly reduced if the mass loss of the star is strongly metallicity dependent, in which case the mass-loss rate may be enhanced in the equatorial plane...|$|R

40|$|Photolysis of HbCO, MbCO, and CO-protoheme {{has been}} {{investigated}} by measuring transient differential spectra and kinetics of induced absorption after excitation with a 250 -fsec laser pulse at 307 nm. Probing was performed by {{a part of a}} continuum pulse between 395 and 445 nm. Photodissociation of the three liganded species occurred within the pulse duration. By contrast, the formation of deoxy species appeared with a mean (+/- SD) response time of 350 +/- 50 fsec. This time constant was identical for the three species and independent of {{the presence or absence of}} the protein structure. Our results suggest the formation of a transient high-spin in <b>plane</b> <b>iron</b> (II) species which relaxes in 350 fsec to a high-spin stable state with concerted kinetics of CO departure and iron displacement.
