40|$|AbstractIncubation of digitonin-permeabilized bovine chromaffin cells {{results in}} a loss of Ca 3 +-dependent {{catecholamine}} secretion. The addition of cytosolic proteins <b>prevents</b> <b>this</b> loss of secretory activity. It has been proposed that calpactin might be the protein which is responsible for <b>preventing</b> <b>this</b> loss of activity. The experiments described in this paper show that cytosolic proteins which have been depleted of calpactin are as effective as control cytosolic proteins in preventing the loss of Ca 2 +-dependent secretion. Thus, a cytosolic protein(s) other than calpactin appears to be responsible for <b>preventing</b> <b>this</b> loss of secretory activity...|$|R

5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E

5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would <b>prevent</b> <b>this.</b> Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} {{that this type of}} {{atmosphere}} loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field may <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E

EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> from happening.|$|E

Despite a sharp contest, the Austrians succeeded in pushing the French out of the Winterthur highlands, although both sides took high casualties. Once the union of the Habsburg armies took place in early June, Archduke Charles attacked French positions at Zürich and forced the French to withdraw beyond the Limmat.|$|E

Captain John Talbot of HMS Victorious arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When Rivoli attempted to escape under cover of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, Rivoli losing over half her crew wounded or dead.|$|E
5|$|While nesting, Arctic terns are {{vulnerable}} to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as common and Sandwich terns.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and sneak up on the fort unopposed. To <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of a}} fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Pacts of May, {{which ended}} the near-war {{tensions}} between Argentina and Chile, Argentina sold its two armored cruisers, Rivadavia and Moreno, that were under construction in Italy to Japan. Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903. While the United Kingdom was not entirely interested in the ships, international politics took precedence: when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships, the British grew concerned that the Swiftsure class could be used against their new ally Japan. To <b>prevent</b> <b>this,</b> the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains {{the energy}} of the {{students}} at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher's stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to <b>prevent</b> <b>this</b> from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.|$|E
