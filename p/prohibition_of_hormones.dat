The article present and analyzes the impediments to marriage according to articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code.

40|$|This {{article will}} address the issue {{regarding}} <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture and its challenges at two levels: ASEAN and Indonesia. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture {{is considered to be}} a rule of “jus cogens” or peremptory norm as well as customary law. In addition the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture is absolute and non-derogable. Therefore. it entails some obligations for states whether or not they ratify the CAT. States have the universal obligations to prevent torture and inhuman degrading treatment in theirjurisdiction under international customary law. Since many of ASEAN countries do not ratified ICCPR, the AICHR have to implement the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture based on the customary international law. In addition, AICHR needs to monitor the national law regarding the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. However. theAlCHR lacks of protection mandate and might not mnctioning well especially when dealing with the allegation <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture or other human rights’ allegations within ASEAN jurisdiction. In Indonesia. the use of torture to get the confession is widely used by the police. Not all the perpetrators are brought to the Court of Law and are given an equitable sentences: although. Indonesia does have a regulation on <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture; the Criminal Code, the Law No 39 / 1999 concerning Human Rights. and the Law No. 26 / 2000 concerning Human Rights Courts. There is lack of competence of the Indonesian Human Rights Court to hear the violation cases. Also. there is lack of competence of the Indonesian Commission on Human Rights to investigate cases concerning torture.

Therefore, the accused will have confidence that the appeal will not do wrong to his interest. Nevertheless, the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius can only be considered as a legal favour, but at the same time, many problems and counterarguments are being discussed regarding the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius, such as the violation of fundamental principles and constitutionality.

40|$|Resumé Aj The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to provide}} a {{detailed}} view <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture in contemporary practice of States. De iure is the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture unquestionable. However situation de facto is more complicated. States are very inventive in finding ways of circumventing this absolute prohibition. Their justification for circumventing the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture may be called various things, such as diplomatic assurances, extraordinary rendition, interpretation of the definition of torture, national security, etc. Due to the limited scope of this work, I have selected the approaches of those States, which I find most worrisome and I will address them by presenting the practice of these individual States. This thesis has focused on an approach of certain European States, USA and Israel in their attempts to circumvent the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. All examples support the topic of this thesis, however in different contexts. The thesis is composed of three core chapters. Chapter One deals with the legal status <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. Chapter Two affirms the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture by case - law of ECtHR in cases Chahal v UK and Saadi v Italy. Chapter Three is subdivided into three parts. Part one reveals disturbing willingness of German courts as well as German [...] ...|$|R
