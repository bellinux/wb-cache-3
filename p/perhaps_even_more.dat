Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E

25|$|After Ceaușescu left, {{the crowds}} in Palace Square entered a celebratory mood, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> intense {{than in the}} other former Eastern Bloc {{countries}} because of the recent violence. People cried, shouted and gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to Christmas Day, which was a long suppressed holiday in Romania.

Their stories have been reflected in the band's music, costumes, stage shows and promotional material for the entirety of their professional career.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> confusing, both Game 5 sites (Coliseum at Richfield in Cleveland and Omni Coliseum in Atlanta) {{were in the}} Eastern Time Zone, so differing local start {{times were}} not a factor. Previously, CBS aired Game 2 of the Chicago-Cleveland series nationally, while relegating Game 2 of the Atlanta-Milwaukee series to TBS. CBS used its primary announcing team, Dick Stockton and Hubie Brown to call the latter game.|$|E
25|$|An independent, {{critical}} {{voice on}} politics, literature, science, {{and the arts}} seems as much needed {{today as it was}} when Barbara Epstein and I put out the first edition of the New York Review fifty years ago – <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so. Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny. That will be a central concern of the Review for the years to come.|$|E

25|$|Income {{and wealth}} {{statistics}} {{may serve as}} a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner. In 2005, approximately one and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding $157,000. Furthermore, only 2.6% of households held assets (excluding home equity) of more than one-million dollars. One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of American society are members of rich households. The richest 1% of the American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90%, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, on March 1, 1970, von Braun and {{his family}} {{relocated}} to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on May 26, 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> frustrating {{for him to see}} popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.|$|E
25|$|Another and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> {{immediate}} {{challenge to}} the potter using the available backswamp clay is its extreme stickiness, which is called plasticity in ceramic terminology. All but the coarsest of clays are somewhat plastic and malleable {{in the presence of}} water; however, the minute clay plate-like particles of backswamp clay are so small that they are influenced by the ionic charges which sit at their edges. The collective ionic charge acts to cause the clay plates to repel each other and thus slip and slide against each other. The shell particles, also plate-like, were produced by the Mississippian potter by collecting then burning freshwater mussel shells, which were originally most likely a byproduct of harvesting the meat for food.|$|E

25|$|An {{ecological}} {{switch from}} a predatory to herbivorous lifestyle {{was likely to}} have been a driving and influential force in directing the morphological adaptations of therizinosaurians. This is <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so true for therizinosaurids, which seem to have further adapted their pelvic and pectoral girdles to increase their upright reach, an adaption believed to have aided in a life of herbivory. Moreover, understanding the feeding patterns of these dinosaurs is important for understanding their morphology and how herbivory emerged within Theropoda. While a majority of theropod dinosaurs were carnivorous, a few select groups either transitioned or returned to an herbivorous lifestyle. Of the groups thought to have returned to herbivory, therizinosaurians are thought to have made the switch first, and are subsequently the most widely regarded candidate for the emergence of herbivory within Theropoda.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} mixed {{feelings}} over the European population's increased life expectancy and declining birth rate ever since the European countries {{were the first to}} start the demographic transition between the 18th and 19th century, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> since this was achieved. Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the European Commission point to the declining birth rate {{of the population of the}} native European peoples, which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4 in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each generation, back to a replacement level of 2.1. Some have claimed that in order to compensate, it is necessary to allow migrants to settle in Europe in order to prevent labour shortages. It has been argued that such immigration leads to ethnic conflicts, such as the 2005 civil unrest in France.|$|E
25|$|The Federalists {{promoted}} {{the financial system}} of Treasury Secretary Hamilton, which emphasized federal assumption of state debts, a tariff to pay off those debts, a national bank to facilitate financing, and encouragement of banking and manufacturing. The Republicans, based in the plantation South, opposed a strong executive power, were hostile to a standing army and navy, demanded a limited reading of the Constitutional powers of the federal government, and strongly opposed the Hamilton financial program. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important was foreign policy, where the Federalists favored Britain because of its political stability and its close ties to American trade, while the Republicans admired the French and the French Revolution. Jefferson was especially fearful that British aristocratic influences would undermine republicanism. Britain and France were at war 1793–1815, with one brief interruption. American policy was neutrality, with the federalists hostile to France, and the Republicans hostile to Britain. The Jay Treaty of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state. President Washington, while officially nonpartisan, generally supported the Federalists and that party made Washington their iconic hero.|$|E

500|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> persuasive to Henry {{than the}} wishes of his {{northern}} nobility were the visible divisions within the Scottish nobility.

[...] This marriage never came to pass, however; Carrick married Mary Douglas, the daughter of [...] Dunbar's rival on the march, the earl of Douglas. Dunbar, in his 'outraged honour,' appealed to Henry IV for assistance. Already known as 'one of the finest soldiers of his age [...] until now an implacable enemy' of England, Dunbar travelled to London and pledged allegiance to Henry IV. When Henry invaded Scotland, he was accompanied by Dunbar. Dunbar was not only an example of the divisions within the Scottish nobility, but one of Scotland's own greatest military commanders.|$|E
