5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.|$|E

[Subjects] In total, 3, 650 middle-aged workers (production job, n = 2, 615; office job, n = 1, 035) ≥ 50 {{years of age}} from eight geographical areas were evaluated from 2007 to 2008. [Methods] The subjects’ subjective <b>physical</b> <b>condition,</b> exercise status, smoking status, and drinking status were investigated, and precise physical measurements, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, reflexes, and reactions were measured. [Results] Subjectively, the <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> and exercise status of those with office jobs were superior to those of production job workers. Office workers exhibited {{a higher rate of}} drinking than produc-tion workers, and also had better cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, reflexes, and reactions. However, production workers were more flexible than office workers. [Conclusion] Middle-aged produc-tion job workers in Korea have poorer overall <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> than middle-aged office job workers. The <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> of middle-aged and elderly workers must be managed through various health management programs to secure a productive aging society...|$|R
40|$|COPD is a {{preventable}} and treatable chronic {{pulmonary disease}} {{which leads to}} a non-fully reversible airflow limitation. Because of their bad <b>physical</b> <b>condition,</b> COPD patients are inactive and become socially isolated, resulting in an even worse <b>physical</b> <b>condition.</b> To overcome this downward spiral, patients can be enrolled in a rehabilitation program. This consists of group sessions for about 12 weeks, 2 or 3 times a week, at the physiotherapist to perform physical activities, both aerobic exercise as resistance training. After the rehabilitation program, patients need to maintain their <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> themselves. Often patients are not compliant to the training advice, resulting in a bad <b>physical</b> <b>condition,</b> more COPD related health issues and reenrolment to the rehabilitation program. To improve the compliance to the training advice patients need to be motivated. For that purpose the Integrated Training System (ITS) for COPD patients has been developed.

Purpose: to substantiate criteria for pupils’ physical fitness assessment, considering their <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> indicators. Material: {{in the research}} 10 - 11 form pupils (n= 406; 211 boys and 195 girls) participated. After physical fitness testing by requirement of acting programs we carried out diagnostic of pupils’ psycho-emotional state.

Conclusions: testing without consideration <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> indicators does not facilitate pupils’ motivation for further physical self-perfection.

25|$|A similar {{situation}} occurs in general relativity with the gravitational singularity {{associated with the}} Schwarzschild solution that describes the geometry of a black hole. The curvature of spacetime at the singularity is infinite which {{is another way of}} stating that the theory does not describe the <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> at this point. It is hoped that the solution to this paradox will be found with a consistent theory of quantum gravity, something which has thus far remained elusive. A consequence of this paradox is that the associated singularity that occurred at the supposed starting point of the universe (see Big Bang) is not adequately described by physics. Before a theoretical extrapolation of a singularity can occur, quantum mechanical effects become important in an era known as the Planck time. Without a consistent theory, there can be no meaningful statement about the <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> associated with the universe before this point.|$|E
