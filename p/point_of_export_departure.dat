The costs of transporting a total of 13. 1 MtCO 2 /y from small- to large-scale emitters around Le Havre (France), to Rotterdam (Netherlands) via onshore pipeline or shipping are evaluated. Sources send emissions to five CO 2 capture centres, which are then linked via a 40 km long collection network to deliver the treated CO 2 to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>export.</b> This network was designed to accommodate peak flow rates and multiple network designs were considered for the various export scenarios evaluated in the study. The economic evaluation established that conditioning CO 2 at the cluster level, {{rather than at the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>export,</b> and transporting it in dense phase was the most cost-effective solution for both export systems. As for exporting the CO 2 from Le Havre to Rotterdam, the evaluation highlighted three potential transport solutions: either onshore via one 24 in. or one 28 in. diameter pipeline or offshore using three ships with effective capacities of 30, 000 m 3 each. The onshore pipeline options proved to be 10 % cheaper than the shipping scenario. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the onshore options remained the best choice. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract]: A gas {{chromatograph}} {{is the most}} common method to continuously determine the hydrocarbon dew <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> natural gas. It is used to ascertain the composition of the natural gas mixture which is applied to a thermodynamic equation of state. Due to the inherent design of the process type {{gas chromatograph}} there are limitations to the computation of the gas mixture in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. It was found that process type C 9 + gas chromatographs determine a higher hydrocarbon dew point than actual, because it summates all the chromatogram hydrocarbon peaks within the respective carbon group into the normalised alkane of that carbon group. The reason for this, is that the process type gas chromatograph does not have a method to identify these species between the normalised alkane components in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. Therefore the aim of this project was to research the 'equations of state' used to calculate natural gas hydrocarbon dew point from constituent analysis by Gas Chromatography and to develop a methodology to improve Gas Chromatography hydrocarbon dew point determination. One important characteristic of the gas chromatograph, is that the measurement of carbon fractions greater than pentane, n - C 5, is based on the relationship of component elution time and hydrocarbon boiling point. The International Standard Organistation standard 23874 (ISO 23874, 2007) uses this relationship to calculate the boiling <b>points</b> <b>of</b> unidentified hydrocarbon components by linear interpolation between the normalised alkanes. The limitation of the ISO 23874 standard is that it is only applicable for laboratory analysis type gas chromatographs. In order to exploit the boiling point and hydrocarbon component elution time relationship to identify unknown components using a process gas chromatograph, the author developed his own method and a modified method of the ISO 23874 standard. Trials on export natural gas, using the equation of state software program, GasVLE, a manual chilled mirror instrument and a Daniel 500 C 9 + gas chromatograph proved that the Grygorcewicz method is a valid characterisation method for further research and use in improving the hydrocarbon dew <b>point</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>export</b> natural gas when applied to a process gas chromatograph on a custody transfer station or pipeline...|$|R

It was an established <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> using the meandering River Mersey, and by 1800 it had a thriving canal network, with links to the Ashton Canal, Rochdale Canal the Peak Forest Canal and Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal. The fustian trade gave the towns a skilled workforce {{that was used to}} the complicated Dutch looms, and was perhaps accustomed to industrial discipline. While Manchester became a spinning town, the towns around were weaving towns producing cloth by the putting out system. The business was dominated by a few families, who had the capital needed to invest in new mills and to buy hundreds of looms. Mills were built along the new canals, so immediately had access to their markets. Spinning developed first and, until 1830, the handloom was still more important economically than the power loom when the roles reversed. Because of the economic growth of Manchester, a new industry of precision machine tool engineering was born and here were the skills needed to build the precision mechanisms of a loom.|$|R

It is possible to benefit from a forecast of any future event or an estimation of any historical event in order to create strategies for countries. Building a bridge from past by the help of estimation may be useful for strategic planners to shape the future.

40|$|International audienceThe {{inorganic}} {{contamination of}} sediment and harvested molluscs {{was investigated in}} the mangrove environment of Southern West Senegal. Trace metals were analysed in surface sediments, two bivalves (Arca senilis and Crassostera gasar) and three gastropods (Conus spp., Hexaplex duplex and Pugilina morio) collected from four stations: Dionewar, Niodor and Falia localised in the Saloum Delta, and Fadiouth from the Petite Côte. A geochemical normalisation approach by using aluminium allowed for discrimination of sediment contamination among sites. Indeed, Fadiouth appeared highly contaminated with Cd, Hg and Ni compared to the Saloum Delta. For all mangrove sites, trace metals exhibited significant higher concentrations (on a dry weight basis) in shellfish compared to sediments, excepted for Ni and Pb. The distribution pattern followed a similar global trend in molluscs regardless of the spatio-temporal variability, with the predominance of Zn (80 % of total metals) followed by Cu and Cd. However, strong differences of metal bioavailability and bioaccumulation in biota were demonstrated, revealing the requirement of employing a suite of organism bioindicators to monitor metal contamination in mangrove ecosystems.

40|$|This two-part paper investigates performances, {{costs and}} {{prospects}} of using commercially ready technology to convert coal to H 2 and electricity, with CO 2 capture and storage. Part A focuses on plant configuration and {{the evaluation of}} performances and CO 2 emissions. Part B focuses on economics, establishing benchmarks {{for the assessment of}} novel technologies and guidelines for technological development. In the co-production plants considered in the paper, coal is gasified to synthesis gas in an entrained flow gasifier. The syngas is cooled, cleaned of particulate matter, and shifted (to primarily H 2 and CO 2) in sour water–gas shift reactors. After further cooling, H 2 S is removed from the syngas using a physical solvent (Selexol); CO 2 is then removed from the syngas, again using Selexol; after being stripped from the solvent, the CO 2 is dried and compressed to 150 bar for pipeline transport and underground storage. High purity H 2 (99. 999 %) is extracted from the H 2 -rich syngas via a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit and delivered at 60 bar. The PSA purge gas is compressed and burned in a conventional gas turbine combined cycle, generating co-product electricity. The H 2 /electricity ratio can be varied by lowering the steam-to-carbon ratio in the syngas or by letting part of the de-carbonized syngas by-pass the PSA unit. Performances and emissions of H 2 /electricity co-production with CO 2 capture are compared with those of a system that vents the CO 2. We examine different methods of syngas heat recovery (quench versus radiant cooling) and explore the effects of changing the electricity/H 2 ratio, gasifier pressure and hydrogen purity. Results show that state-of-the-art commercial technology allows transferring to de-carbonized hydrogen 57 – 58 % of coal LHV, while exporting to the grid decarbonized electricity amounting to 2 – 6 % of coal LHV. In contrast to decarbonizing coal IGCC electricity, which entails a loss of 6 – 8 percentage <b>points</b> <b>of</b> electricity conversion when capturing CO 2 as an alternative to venting it, CO 2 capture for H 2 production gives a minor energy penalty (∼ 2 percentage <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> electricity). For H 2 production, the efficiency gain achievable by hot syngas cooling vs. quench is a modest 2 percentage point increase in electricity for export, compared to 2 – 4 percentage points in the electricity case.
