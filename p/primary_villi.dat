50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} week of development, some cells of the {{trophoblast}} penetrate and form rounded columns into the syncytiotrophoblast. These columns are known as <b>primary</b> <b>villi.</b> At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphogenetic}} {{events that}} occur in the development of villi in human foetal colon have been observed by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. At nine weeks, the colon is a simple tube composed of pseudostratified columnar epithelium and mesenchyme. By ten weeks, up to eight longitudinal ridges have formed by an elongation of individual epithelial cells. Even as the ridges are forming, the bases of some of the ridges become indented with mesenchyme thus forming longitudinal mucosal folds. By eleven and a half weeks, these have folded in a concertina fashion forming a longitudinal zig-zag pattern. From ten and a half weeks, small lumina develop within the epithelium near to its base. At this stage, they are not in continuity with the main lumen. Extension of these lumina to the main luminal surface and exfoliation of redundant cells result in division of the zig-zag folds into broad <b>primary</b> <b>villi.</b> Division of the <b>primary</b> <b>villi</b> occurs when cyst-like structures which develop within the pseudostratified columnar epithelium of the <b>primary</b> <b>villi</b> enlarge and extend to the lumen. Together with upgrowth of mesenchyme this results in small secondary villi with simple columnar epithelium...|$|E
40|$|Pregnant ewes were {{challenged}} with Chlamydia abortus at 91 - 98 days of gestation and euthanised at 14, 21 and 28 days post-challenge. IFNγ mRNA labelling {{appeared to}} be co-localised with Chlamydial lipopolysaccharide within trophoblast cells in discrete areas lining the <b>primary</b> <b>villi</b> in the limbus and hilar zone of the placentomes from challenged sheep on days 21 and 28 post-infection. The presence of IFNγ was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. No labelling was seen in tissues from the non-infected ewes. The presence of IFNγ in trophoblast cells from infected ewes may indicate an attempt to restrict the replication of the organism and be an important trigger for the inflammatory responses that develop on the fetal side of the placenta in enzootic abortion...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Adrenomedullin is {{increased}} in maternal plasma in pregnancy {{and has been}} found in very high concentrations in amniotic fluid and umbilical plasma. To identify adrenomedullin-producing tissue in pregnancy we measured adrenomedullin concentration and distribution in fetoplacental tissues. STUDY DESIGN: By use of a specific radioimmunoassay we determined the concentrations of adrenomedullin and, by immunohistochemical studies, its localization and distribution in fetal membranes and placentas collected at elective cesarean section from 11 healthy pregnant women at term. RESULTS: The content of adrenomedullin in placentas (117. 7 ± 7. 8 pg/mg wet tissue) and fetal membranes (168. 7 ± 2. 3 pg/mg wet tissue) was similar to the adrenomedullin concentration in adrenal medulla (157. 3 ± 4. 4 pg/mg wet tissue). Adrenomedullin staining appears to be greater in fetal membranes than in placentas and was localized in amnion and trophoblast cells. In term placentas positive staining was detected predominantly in extravillous trophoblast cells, although a few syncytiotrophoblast cells and endothelial cells of <b>primary</b> <b>villi</b> stained for adrenomedullin. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that is consistent with fetoplacental tissues as a site of synthesis or action of adrenomedullin during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The {{placenta}} forms {{a complex}} interface between {{the mother and}} fetus during development that is designed for efficient nutrient exchange. A large surface area is created by extensive branching morphogenesis of the trophoblast-derived epithelium to create a villous network, called the labyrinth in rodents. These villi are subsequently vascularized with an elaborate capillary network. Morphogenesis begins with selection of a subset of trophoblast cells in the basal layer of the chorion that express the Gcm 1 transcription factor. These cells leave the cell cycle and undergo cell shape changes that initiate a process of involution to create <b>primary</b> <b>villi</b> into which fetal blood vessels grow. Much less {{is known about the}} regulation of subsequent events in branching, certainly compared with other organs. However, over 60 different mouse mutants have defects during later labyrinth development. Some of these mutant genes encode components of signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways that play evolutionarily conserved roles in other branched organs, These mutants represent a still largely untapped resource as most of them have not been studied in detail in relation to placental morphogenesis. © 2008 International Society for Differentiation...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Primary intraosseous lytic meningiomas {{are rare}} tumors, with only 16 cases {{described}} in the literature. We present {{a case in which}} CT and MR imaging with contrast agent helped diagnose preoperatively an enlarging skull mass as a primary intraosseous lytic meningioma in a 70 -year-old woman. Radiographic findings revealed a lytic mass centered on the coronal suture line that separated and thinned both the outer and inner tables of the frontal bone. Meningiomas arise from arachnoid cap cells of the arach-noid cap <b>villi.</b> <b>Primary</b> extradural meningiomas are rare lesions, accounting for less than 2 % of all meningiomas. 1 In-traosseous meningiomas are increasingly rare, occurring in 14 % of cases of ectopic or primary extradural meningiomas. 2 Osteoblastic or mixed osteoblastic-osteolytic lesions compose most intraosseous meningiomas, with purely lytic lesions the least common. 3 In 2004, Rosahl et al 4 reported 16 cases of primary intraosseous osteolytic meningiomas without evi-dence of soft-tissue invasion. We report the case of a primary calvarial osteolytic in...|$|R
40|$|Human placental {{development}} involves coordinated angiogenesis and trophoblast outgrowth {{that are}} compromised in {{intrauterine growth restriction}} (IUGR). As Tie- 2 (−/−) mice exhibit growth retardation and vascular network malformation, the expression of Tie- 2 and its ligands, angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) and angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), were investigated in human placenta from normal pregnancies and those complicated by severe IUGR. Ribonucleotide protection assays showed no {{significant change in the}} expression of Ang- 2 mRNA between gestationally matched normal and IUGR placentas; however, immunoblots revealed that Ang- 2 protein was significantly decreased in IUGR, suggesting that this may contribute to the abnormal development of the villous vasculature. In situ hybridization studies showed that Ang- 1 and Tie- 2 were detected in the cyto/syncytiotrophoblast bilayer in first-trimester placenta, whereas Ang- 2 mRNA was restricted to the cytotrophoblast, suggesting their role in trophoblast function. At term, Ang- 1 mRNA and immunoreactive protein were restricted to the paravascular tissues of the <b>primary</b> stem <b>villi,</b> supporting its role in vessel maturation. In contrast, Ang- 2 was expressed throughout the term villous core, perhaps to permit the developing placental vascular network to remain in a state of fluidity. As these studies also revealed that trophoblast, in addition to endothelial cells, expressed Tie- 2 receptors, we investigated the potential role of Ang- 1 /Ang- 2 on trophoblast proliferation, migration, and the release of NO. Using spontaneously transformed first-trimester trophoblast cell lines that exhibit cytotrophoblast-like (ED 27) and extravillous trophoblast-like (ED 77) properties, we show that the addition of Ang- 2 (250 ng/ml) stimulated DNA synthesis in ED 27 trophoblast cells and triggered the release of NO. Ang- 1 stimulated trophoblast (ED 77) migration in a dose-dependent manner that was inhibited by recombinant Tie- 2 -FC. These data thus imply, for the first time, a specific role for angiopoietins as regulators of trophoblast behavior {{in the development of the}} utero/fetoplacental circulation, an action independent of their well-established roles in vascular endothelium...|$|R
