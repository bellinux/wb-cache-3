40|$|Early {{detection}} of many fetal abnormalities {{is now possible}} due to the availability of antenatal ultrasound screening in the 12 th to 16 th week of gestation. Regarding urinary tract anomalies, most can be detected at 18 – 20 weeks of gestation. The incidence of antenatal hydronephrosis is 0. 6 – 4. 5 %, and it makes up about 92 % of antenatally-detected urinary tract anomalies. If antenatal hydronephrosis is detected, the patient should be carefully followed-up {{in order to identify}} the associated congenital anomaly. Usually, if the renal <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> exceeds 5 mm in the second trimester, then fetal ultrasonography should be repeated in the third trimester. Renal <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> greater then 7 mm is often related to a significant congenital anomaly; therefore, a plan for management after birth should be detailed.

40|$|Purpose: There are {{no current}} {{guidelines}} for diagnosing and managing mild prenatal hydronephrosis. Variations in physician approach {{make it difficult}} to analyze outcomes and establish optimal management. We determined the variability of diagnostic approach and management regarding prenatal hydronephrosis among maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, pediatric urologists and pediatric radiologists. Materials and Methods: Online surveys were sent to mailing lists for national societies for each specialty. Participants were surveyed regarding criteria for diagnosing mild prenatal hydronephrosis and recommendations for postnatal management, including use of antibiotic prophylaxis, followup scheduling and type of followup imaging. Results: A total of 308 maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, 126 pediatric urologists and 112 pediatric radiologists responded. Pediatric urologists and radiologists were divided between Society for Fetal Urology criteria and use of anteroposterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> for diagnosis, while maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians preferred using the latter. For postnatal evaluation radiologists preferred using personal criteria, while urologists preferred using anteroposterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> or Society for Fetal Urology grading system. There was wide variation in the use of antibiotic prophylaxis among pediatric urologists. Regarding the use of voiding cystourethrography/radionuclide cystography in patients with prenatal hydronephrosis, neither urologists nor radiologists were consistent in their recommendations. Finally, there was no agreement on length of followup for mild prenatal hydronephrosis. Conclusions: We observed a lack of uniformity regarding grading criteria in diagnosing hydronephrosis prenatally and postnatally among maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians, pediatric urologists and pediatric radiologists. There was also a lack of agreement on the management of mild intermittent prenatal hydronephrosis, resulting in these cases being managed inconsistently.

We further aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal short stature on these parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3 D CT pelvimetry was performed retrospectively in 203 non-pregnant women selected consecutively if they {{had at least one}} singleton term delivery with head presentation and if there was no history of maternal or fetal birth trauma or cerebral palsy after childbirth. With standard sagittal and reformatted axial-oblique views, anteroposterior including three conjugates of pelvic inlet, transverse, posterior sagittal <b>diameters</b> of <b>pelvic</b> inlet, the plane of greatest diameter, the plane of least <b>diameter,</b> and <b>pelvic</b> outlet were measured. Selected obstetric parameters were collected. RESULTS: Overall, the pelvises had transverse oval appearance in inlet and size of the female pelvis. The diagonal conjugate was at least 15 mm longer than the obstetric conjugate.

We aimed to investigate whether any relationship between serum bilirubin levels and antero-posterior renal <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameters</b> or pelvicaliceal dilatations exist during newborn period. Methods: Neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (group 1) and healthy neonates (group 2) were randomly selected to the study. Capillary blood samples were used to measure micro-bilirubin. Urinary system ultrasound (US) was performed in both groups by an experienced radiologist. "nFindings: Group 1 (31 neonates, 16 males, 15 females) and group 2 (22 neonates, 11 males, 11 females) were identical by means of postnatal age, gender and weight (P> 0. 05). Mean serum bilirubin levels were 11. 1 ± 3. 1 mg/dl and 1. 4 ± 0. 2 mg/dl in group 1 and 2, respectively. Renal length and renal pelvis antero-posterior (AP) diameters were not different between study groups. Pelvis AP diameters of right kidney were 2. 1 ± 0. 7 mm in group 1 and 1. 9 ± 0. 7 mm in group 2, and of left kidney were 2. 4 ± 0. 8 mm in group 1 and 2. 3 ± 0. 6 mm in group 2.

We also compared maternal and paternal measurements (body mass index (BMI) and height) as predictors of newborn body composition. Methods Weight, height, head and mid-arm circumferences, skinfold thicknesses and external <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameters</b> were measured at 30 ± 2 weeks gestation in 571 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of the Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India. Paternal height and weight were also measured. At birth, detailed neonatal anthropometry was performed. Unrotated and varimax rotated PCA was applied to the maternal and neonatal measurements. Results Rotated PCA reduced maternal measurements to 4 independent components (fat, pelvis, height and muscle) and neonatal measurements to 3 components (trunk+head, fat, and leg length). An SD increase in maternal fat was associated with a 0. 16 SD increase (β) in neonatal fat (p Conclusion Principal components analysis is a useful method to describe neonatal body composition and its determinants.

Methods: weight, height, head and mid-arm circumferences, skinfold thicknesses and external <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameters</b> were measured at 30 ± 2 weeks gestation in 571 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of the Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India. Paternal height and weight were also measured. At birth, detailed neonatal anthropometry was performed. Unrotated and varimax rotated PCA was applied to the maternal and neonatal measurements. Results: rotated PCA reduced maternal measurements to 4 independent components (fat, pelvis, height and muscle) and neonatal measurements to 3 components (trunk+head, fat, and leg length). An SD increase in maternal fat was associated with a 0. 16 SD increase (?) in neonatal fat (p < 0. 001, adjusted for gestation, maternal parity, newborn sex and socio-economic status). Maternal pelvis, height and (for male babies) muscle predicted neonatal trunk+head (? = 0. 09 SD; p = 0. 017, ? = 0. 12 SD; p = 0. 006 and ? = 0. 27 SD; p < 0. 001). In the mother-baby and father-baby comparison, maternal BMI predicted neonatal fat (? = 0. 20 SD; p < 0. 001) and neonatal trunk+head (? = 0. 15 SD; p = 0. 001). Both maternal (? = 0. 12 SD; p = 0. 002) and paternal height (? = 0. 09 SD; p = 0. 030) predicted neonatal trunk+head but the associations became weak and statistically non-significant in multivariate analysis. Only paternal height predicted neonatal leg length (? = 0. 15 SD; p = 0. 003). Conclusion: principal components analysis is a useful method to describe neonatal body composition and its determinants. Newborn adiposity is related to maternal nutritional status and parity, while newborn length is genetically determined. Further research is needed to understand mechanisms linking maternal pelvic size to fetal growth and the determinants and implications of the components (trunk v leg length) of fetal skeletal growt...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{implants}} {{may be used}} to treat iliac fractures in dogs, of which osteosynthesis with plate is the most described and recommended in the literature. The type of plate and screw are major factors in osteosynthesis success. The use of locking plates has been advocated for this purpose, as they do not allow the plate-bone-screw unit to shift, providing angular stability and rigidity to the system. The present study aimed to describe the unprecedented use of a locking notched head T-plate in the treatment of a caudal body of ilium fracture. A two year old male mongrel dog was attended after falling from a third floor height, with two days of evolution. The animal was in standing position, and during orthopedic examination non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb, instability, and crepitus in the right body of ilium, with considerable swelling and pain. The radiographic examination allowed diagnosing a complete fracture of the caudal body of ilium with decrease of the <b>pelvic</b> canal <b>diameter.</b> The patient underwent surgery, and the fracture was stabilized with an LCP notched head T-plate. The patient evolved satisfactorily, with good weight-bearing of the affected limb within 24 hours of surgery, and complete recovery with medical discharge after 60 days of postoperative period, with consolidation of the fracture...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{criteria}} used for deciding on surgery {{in children with}} presumed antenatally detected pelviureteric junction obstruction (PPUJO) are the level of hydronephrosis (ultrasonography), the level of differential renal function (DRF) {{and the quality of}} renal drainage after a furosemide challenge (renography), the importance of each factor being far from generally agreed. Can we predict, on the basis of ultrasound parameters, the patient in whom radionuclide renography can be avoided? Methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical charts of 81 consecutive children with presumed unilateral PPUJO detected antenatally. Ultrasound and renographic studies performed at the same time were compared. Anteroposterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> (APD) and calyceal size were both divided into three levels of dilatation. Parenchymal thickness was considered either normal or significantly decreased. Acquisition of renograms under furosemide stimulation provided quantification of DRF, quality of renal drainage and cortical transit. Results: The percentages of patients with low DRF and poor drainage were significantly higher among those with major hydronephrosis, severe calyceal dilatation or parenchymal thinning. Moreover, impaired cortical transit, which is a major risk factor for functional decline, was seen more frequently among those with very severe calyceal dilatation. However, none of the structural parameters obtained by ultrasound examination was able to predict whether the level of renal function or the quality of drainage was normal or abnormal. Alternatively, an APD 30  mm, major calyceal dilatation and/or parenchymal thinning. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of ultrasonography during pregnancy {{has resulted in a}} higher detection rate for antenatal hydronephrosis. This {{is one of the most}} common birth defects detected (1 - 3 %). The most common causes of antenatal hydronephrosis are transient hydronephrosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and vesicoureteral reflux. It can be detected as early as the 12 th to 14 th week of gestation and in addition, ultrasonography performed in the third trimester (28 to 34 weeks gestation) has been suggested to be more helpful in predicting postnatal outcome. The Society of Fetal Urology grading and renal <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> grading systems have been developed to diagnose and grade the severity of antenatal hydronephrosis. If dilatation is detected, ultrasound should focus on: laterality, severity of hydronephrosis, echogenicity of the kidneys, hydronenephrosis or hydro-ureteronephro-sis, bladder volume and bladder emptying, sex of the child and amniotic fluid volume. They are helpful in determining the cause of hydronephrosis. To date, the reported long-term outcomes of antenatal intervention for severe obstructive uropathy are mixed. The goal of prenatal management is to detect those cases, which will impact the health of the infant and require antenatal and postnatal evaluation and possible intervention to minimize adverse outcomes. Postnatal evaluation includes physical examination and the use of radiologic studies to determine the cause of hydronephrosis and then treatment should focus on this. The main goal of this review is to evaluate and summarize the antenatal hydronephrosis. (JAREM 2013; 3 : 60 - 5...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{correlate}} sonographic renal parenchymal measurements {{among patients}} with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) labeled Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) hydronephrosis grades 1 to 4 {{and to examine}} whether sonographic renal parenchymal measurements {{could be used to}} differentiate conservative versus surgical management. Materials and Methods: Retrospective chart review and sonographic renal parenchymal measurements (renal length, medullary pyramid thickness, and renal parenchymal thickness) were performed in patients with SFU grades 1 to 4 hydronephrosis secondary to UPJO managed between 2009 and 2014. Exclusion criteria included other concomitant genitourinary pathology or incomplete follow-up. Anterior-posterior renal <b>pelvic</b> <b>diameter</b> (APRPD) and radionuclide renography were also evaluated when available. Results: 104 patient with ureteropelvic junction obstruction underwent 244 RBUS (1, 464 sonographic renal parenchymal measurements in 488 kidneys). Medullary pyramid thickness and renal parenchymal thickness progressively decreased from SFU grades 1 to 4 (p< 0. 05). A similar trend was appreciated when comparing SFU grades 1 and 2 vs. 3 and 4, as well as SFU grades 3 vs. 4 (p< 0. 05). SFU grade 3 and 4 patients who underwent pyeloplasty had longer renal length in comparison to those who were managed conservatively (p< 0. 02). Conclusions: This is the first study that evaluates these objective, quantifiable sonographic renal parenchymal measurements in children with unilateral UPJO. These sonographic renal parenchymal measurements correlate closely with worsening of hydronephrosis graded by the SFU and APRPD classification systems. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of sonographic renal parenchymal measurements in the management of children with UPJO. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of two cerclages {{with wire}} spirals as distractor spacers was {{evaluated}} for the correction of pelvic stenosis in felines. A three-year-old, mixed-breed, male feline {{was taken to}} the Veterinary Hospital of the UFRJ. It presented symptoms of constipation, dyschezia, hyporexia and mild apathy. On radiographic examination, a deformation of the pelvic bones and a narrowing of the pelvic canal were detected. The patient underwent pelvic stenosis correction surgery. Two spirals were made with cerclage wire and 2. 0 -mm diameter Steinmann pins; coupled to the chuck of a drill, the pins were wrapped with cerclage wire, running laps around the pin. Then, the coils were positioned in the space formed by separating the hemipelves and stabilized by keeping them separated to the desired opening. Effectiveness of the technique was evidenced by measurements made using new radiographic images in comparison with the images obtained before the surgical procedure. There were evident decreases in the sacro-ischium line and pubic line of 3. 98 and 3. 18, demonstrating an increase of approximately 21 % in the <b>pelvic</b> canal <b>diameter.</b> The animal showed no apparent macroscopic or radiographic reaction. The preliminary clinical application of the adapted pelvic distraction technique is relevant for allowing the appropriate correction of a stenosis of the pelvic girdle and its consequences, representing a major technical and scientific innovation in the correction...|$|R
40|$|The erect lateral {{radiograph}} pelvimetry measurements {{was related}} to the outcome of labor in 173 patients. The most common indication for pelvimetry was one previous caesarean section in 90 (52 %) patients. Sixty-nine (39. 9 %) pelvimetry measurements were performed because of suspected cephalopelvic disproportion, while 20 (11. 6 %) were done because of breech presentation. In patients with a cephalic presentation at delivery, the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) obstetric conjugate for the 87 women who delivered vaginally (group 1) was 11. 42 +/- 1. 5 cm, while that of the 45 women who had emergency caesarean section (group 2) was 10. 77 +/- 1. 5 cm. The mean +/- SD anteroposterior outlet diameter for groups 1 and 2 were 12. 24 +/- 1. 9 cm and 11. 84 +/- 1. 7 cm respectively. Both differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05 respectively). The mean +/- SD birthweight of the babies in groups 1 and 2 were 3. 34 +/- 0. 79 kg and 3. 42 +/- 0. 86 kg respectively. There was no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (p < 0. 05). The critical obstetric conjugate for safe vaginal delivery was 9. 88 cm while the corresponding value for the anteroposterior <b>pelvic</b> outlet <b>diameter</b> was 10. 24 cm...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} family with Noonan {{syndrome}} (NS), giant proximal nerve hypertrophy, and hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type 1 A (HMSN 1 A). Five members of a family {{were found to have}} clinical features of NS. In all cases, NS was associated with giant hypertrophy of proximal nerves and two individuals also exhibited cafe-au-lait spots. In one case, an 8 -to- 10 -cm <b>diameter</b> <b>pelvic</b> mass was shown to be a grossly hypertrophied nerve, with histologic features of demyelination and remyelination. In addition, four of five family members affected with NS were found to have HMSN 1 A clinically and by demonstration of constitutional HMSN 1 A duplication on DNA testing. Linkage analysis for NS ruled out the involvement of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene and the known NS locus in chromosome 12, supporting the existence of an additional NS locus. 7 page(s...|$|R
