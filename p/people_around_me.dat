500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie."

Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll.

One particularly powerful scene showed Indians attacking a clinic while the volunteers inside sterilized Indian women against their will. The film {{is thought to be}} at least partially responsible for the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in 1971. Peace Corps volunteer Fred Krieger who was serving in Bolivia at the time said, [...] "It was an effective movie – emotionally very arousing – and it directly targeted Peace Corps volunteers.

A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit.

2500|$|Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, {{and felt}} lonely {{and out of}} place there. The young Chamberlain was [...] "a {{compulsive}} dreamer", {{more interested in the}} arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self. Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: [...] "The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is the only word which describes my feelings – than any of the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship". During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of [...] "Merry Old England", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.|$|E

When the book was first published, straight hair was the prevailing style {{for women in the}} U.S., the U.K., and elsewhere, and many women felt pressured to straighten their hair with flat irons or relaxers. Massey, who is white, writes in her introduction about growing up in England, where she was ridiculed for having curly hair. When she moved to New York City, she had an eye-opening experience: [...] "Jewish, Italian, Latino, and African-American <b>people</b> living <b>around</b> <b>me</b> had curly hair that looked like mine!

I needed <b>people</b> <b>around</b> to remind <b>me</b> of certain things that happened, so I got a lot of {{information}} from somebody that was hanging around while I was in the studio. It's crazy, because when I talk about people from a whole other rap era, I don't know if people understand how much that meant to me, just coming up around legends like Kool G Rap and Eric B. and Large Professor and people like Akinyele who was around in the early stages that I met through Large Professor from a rap group named Main Source that most cats today never even heard of.|$|R

40|$|Willie Henderson {{has drawn}} upon recent {{literary}} theory {{to write a}} good book on a much neglected topic, namely John Ruskin’s views on classical political economy, and consequently the arguments and conclusions contained in this publication deserve to be reviewed at length. Before proceeding to my highly qualified criticisms of this book, however, the now relative obscurity of its central character, at least within the narrow world inhabited by economists, calls for some prefatory biographical remarks. Ruskin {{was one of the}} most influential art and social critics of the nineteenth century and, indeed, his writings conveniently frame the Victorian Age, his first piece appearing in 1830 and his last in 1900. He was also a tragic figure of theatrical, if not Greek, proportions. He was delicate, exceedingly thin and possessed an unshapely mouth, having been savaged by a dog in early childhood; his unhealthy filial devotion to his grim evangelical mother and doting vintner father, which continued into middle age, clearly retarded his emotional development; and his disposition to morbidity and hypochondria constantly threatened to push him over to madness, as the following passage, written at 43, reveals: “I feel as if I were living in one great churchyard, with <b>people</b> all <b>around</b> <b>me</b> clinging feebly to the edges of open graves” (quoted in Harrison 1911 : 310) ...|$|R
