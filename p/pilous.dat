5000|$|Chicago {{got off to}} a good start, playing over [...]500 hockey {{thirteen}} {{games into}} the season, as they had a 6-5-3 record, however, the club fell into a slump, going 4-12-3 in their next 19 games, falling out of the playoff race. Tommy Ivan decided to step down from head coaching duties, as he hired former Teepees head coach Rudy <b>Pilous</b> to take over the team. The Hawks responded, playing [...]500 hockey in Pilous' first 18 games behind the bench {{to get back into the}} playoff race, however, a seven-game losing streak soon followed, and the team fell out of playoff contention for good. The Hawks finished the year 24-39-7, earning 55 points, their highest total since 1952-53, and did not finish in last place for the first time since 1953, as they had two more points than the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
50|$|Ivan {{won three}} Stanley Cup while {{coaching}} Detroit, in 1950, 1952, 1954. He took the reins as Black Hawks coach-general manager in 1954, after winning six straight regular-season championships with Detroit. At {{the time the}} Hawks were a franchise in trouble. Ivan led a rebuilding effort, adding farm teams and stocking the Hawks' farm system with good prospects. He also made key trades that would help fortify the Hawks into a contending team {{for the next several}} seasons. Rudy <b>Pilous</b> was hired to coach the Hawks by Tommy Ivan and he would eventually guide the team to the 1961 Stanley Cup. The 1961 Hawks team produced the results that Ivan's rebuilding process began back in 1954. The Black Hawks also reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 1962, 1965, 1971, and 1973. Ivan served 25 years as Black Hawks GM and then served as the Black Hawks' vice-president and alternate governor (NHL Board of Governors) in the years following his GM tenure.|$|E
5000|$|Storey {{became an}} NHL referee in 1950 {{and worked in}} the league until 1959. On April 4, 1959, he was officiating a playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks, which Montreal won, along with the series, scoring the winning goal with 88 seconds left in the sixth game. Chicago fans nearly rioted, and Black Hawks coach Rudy <b>Pilous</b> accused Storey of choking by not calling {{penalties}} against the Canadiens late in the game. Storey was scheduled to referee the final game in the series between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins, but when an Ottawa newspaper reported that NHL president Clarence Campbell said that Storey had [...] "frozen" [...] on two calls that should have been penalties against the Canadiens, Storey immediately resigned. He never returned to the NHL. His career included 480 regular season games and seven consecutive Stanley Cup finals from 1952 through 1958.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} microbiologic contamination of samples of medicinal plants collected and commercialized in Montes Claros – MG, Brazil. The plants were acquired in various places and in a public market in Montes Claros. They were estimated for infection by fecal coliforms, mold and yeast, through the method described in APHA (1992). The results showed that 72. 3 % of plants commercializad in popular markets in Montes Claros were infected by fungus and that 100 % of these were creepers. The results also showed that 57 % of plants acquired in organic cultivation systems and having fungal infections were <b>pilous</b> plants. However, it was noted in the determination of fecal coliforms that all the samples had infections lower than the maximum established limit. Since medicinal plants are often used in natura, {{there is no need to}} maintain a higher microbiological quality...|$|E
40|$|Title: Selected {{views of}} pupil {{mistakes}} {{in the teaching of}} mathematics Author: Derek <b>Pilous</b> Department: Department of mathematics and mathematics education Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Ladislav Kvasz, Ph. D. Abstract: The main goal of the thesis is to describe in depth the problem of pupil mis- takes in mathematics, both from the psychological and mathematics education points of view and {{from the point of view}} of mathematics teachers. Four questions were addressed: How does research in mathematics education view mistakes and what is the difference between this view and that of research of general mistakes? How can mistakes made by future mathematics teachers be classified? How do (future) mathematics teachers see the erroneousness of some border phenomena and the seriousness of mistakes? Are there differences between respondents with some teaching experience and without it? The theoretical part of the thesis consists of (1) characterisation of a general mistake, (2) pupil mistakes in mathematics including their seriousness, (3) psychological view of mistakes including learning without and with mistakes and a more detailed description of a cognitivist viewpoint of mistakes, (4) mistakes from the point of view of mathematics education research. It is shown that pupil {{mistakes in the}} teaching of mathematics are not the [...] ...|$|E
