50|$|The primary base {{ingredients}} {{of the liquid}} solution is <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin. About 20% to 27% of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin-based liquid particles are inhaled. The long-term effects of inhaled <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has not been studied, and is unknown. The effects of inhaled glycerin are unknown. Being exposed to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The risk from the inhalation of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin is probably low. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin have not {{been shown to be}} safe. Some research states that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> emissions may cause respiratory irritation and raise the likelihood to develop asthma. Long-term inhalation of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> indoors could increase risk to children to develop asthma.

30|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate that detection of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is common in}} hospital patients, particularly those managed from drug overdoses or other toxic ingestions. The major source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> comes from iatrogenic administration of poorly water-soluble medications, especially intravenous lorazepam used for sedation. Intravenous formulations of lorazepam may contain up to 80 % (v/v) <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Other intravenous medications that may contain <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> include diazepam, etomidate, and phenytoin (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002). Another source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is activated charcoal preparations that use <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as the excipient to make the charcoal less gritty and easier to administer (Krasowski et al. 2012). Although the toxic plasma concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is not well-defined, toxicity has been reported with plasma concentrations as low as 100  mg/dL (Zar et al. 2007). However, even if not directly toxic, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> increases plasma osmolality and complicates the use of osmolal gap in clinical diagnosis and management, especially for patients receiving multiple doses of propylene glycol-containing medication, as may be done in intubated patients requiring extended sedation (Krasowski et al. 2012). <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has also been reported as an interferent in enzyme assays for ethylene glycol (Malandain & Cano 1996; Juenke et al. 2011). Our study demonstrates that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may be detected in patients who have ingested ethylene glycol, with iatrogenic drugs such as intravenous lorazepam or activated charcoal being common sources of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These findings illustrate the importance of specific assays for determination of ethylene glycol in human samples.|$|R

We describe two adolescents with sensitivity to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> confirmed by patch testing whose dermatitis improved dramatically after cessation of oral antihistamines containing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> We report these cases to alert providers to the potential for worsening of ACD due to systemic exposure to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in patients with a cutaneous sensitivity to the allergen...|$|R
40|$|Keratosis, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} skin manifestations of arsenicosis, can be treated by either oral or topical formulation of drug. In this study we examined the effectiveness and tolerance of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> for the treatment of arsenical palmer keratosis. Sixty patients of arsenicosis with palmer keratoses were randomly divided into three groups and different concentrations (15, 30 and 45 %) of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> were applied topically into their palms once at bedtime for eight weeks. The perception of the patient about the progress of treatment was scored with “Likert scale”. The mean (±SD) score of patient’s perception following completion of treatment were 1. 27 ± 1. 26 (using 15 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol),</b> 2. 88 ± 1. 26 (30 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol),</b> and 3. 75 ± 1. 06 (45 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> respectively. The scores increased with higher concentra-tions. Thirty percent or more concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was effective for mild to severe form of keratosis. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was well tolerable. In conclusion, both roughness and thickness of arsenical palmer keratosis can be reduced using <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and as the concentration of the drug increases it increases its effectiveness without any significant adverse effect...|$|R

5000|$|Prolonged {{contact with}} <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is {{essentially}} non-irritating to the skin. Undiluted <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as capture preservative in pitfall traps, {{with the aim}} of using the captured spiders for DNA barcoding, was tested. For this purpose a laboratory experiment on the conserving and/or denaturing effect of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> on mitochondrial DNA (COI) was set up. For the experiment 110 specimens of the common and abundant wolf spider species Pardosa lugubris were manually captured, killed and incubated from one to four weeks in either pure or watered <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> or 70 % denatured ethanol. Rates of successful sequencing, following a standard protocol, did not differ between samples incubated in <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and in the more commonly used ethanol. Thus, within four weeks, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> did not significantly denaturize mitochondrial DNA. In two field studies, pitfall traps with <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> captured more spiders than traps with acetic acid. The effect was significant only in one of two field trials, but then consistent at three different sites and the three dominant spider families.

The solubility was maximal in <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and very low in water at all the temperatures.

The current research is based on developing an improved and fundamental understanding of technology that will allow the conversion of this crude glycerin to a <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> based antifreeze product. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was performed using copper chromite catalyst. At temperatures above 200 C̕ and hydrogen pressure of 200 psi, the selectivity to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> decreased due to excessive hydrogenolysis of the <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> The yield of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> increased with decreasing water content.
