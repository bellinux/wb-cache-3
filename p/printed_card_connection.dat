50|$|The hottest {{cards in}} the town view {{category}} are real photo postcards (RPPCs), postcards printed on actual photographic paper using the photographic process rather than <b>printed</b> <b>cards</b> created on a printing press. The attraction of a RPPC is that the scene shown is an actual scene from the past whereas a <b>printed</b> <b>card</b> can often be an artist's conception of how the particular scene appeared. RPPCs are usually much rarer than <b>printed</b> <b>cards</b> as <b>printed</b> <b>cards</b> were easier to produce in large numbers. The most reliable method of differentiating the two is with a magnifying glass. A <b>printed</b> <b>card</b> viewed through a glass will display a series of dots used to create the image that are lacking in a RPPC. Another way to identify a RPPC is by information {{on the back of}} the card. Older RPPS may also display a silver sheen in the darker areas when viewed at an angle due to the silver used in the early photographic process.|$|R

This classification system was developed to facilitate orderly storage and faster search of fingerprint <b>cards,</b> called ten <b>print</b> <b>cards.</b> It was used when the ten <b>print</b> <b>cards</b> were catalogued and searched manually and not digitally.

5000|$|Arizona is {{classified}} as a [...] "shall issue" [...] state. Even though Arizona law allows concealed carry by adults without permit, concealed carry permits are still available and issued by the Concealed Weapons Permit Unit of the Arizona Department of Public Safety for purposes of reciprocity with other states or for carrying firearms in certain regulated places. Requirements for issuance include taking a training class (provided by a licensed third party) or hunter education class, submitting a finger <b>print</b> <b>card,</b> and paying a $60 fee. Applicants {{must be at least}} 21 years of age. New permits are valid for five years.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that clinical evaluation of the real-world consequences of eye disease requires new performance-based tests. This is because Sueilen acuity and other common clinical tests are often poor predictors of everyday function. Ahn and Legge!(1995) Vision Research, 35, 1931 - 1938] validated a computerized test of reading speed by showing that it provides an accurate prediction of low-vision reading performance with magnifiers. Here, we describe development of a printed-card version of the test suitable for clinical use. This printed-card test retains key design features of the validated computerized test, including {{the same set of}} sentences and display format. Data from 23 low-vision subjects showed that a very simple testing procedure using <b>printed</b> <b>cards</b> and a stop watch could be used effectively to estimate reading speed. Reading speed based on a single card was quite accurate (SD equal to about 18 % of the mean) and showed no practice effects from one card to the next. Reading speeds obtained with <b>printed</b> <b>cards</b> correlated highly (r [...] 0. 887) with those from computerized testing. We conclude that a simple test, using <b>printed</b> <b>cards,</b> can be used to obtain useful estimates of low-vision reading speed.
