40|$|Firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> {{are most}} {{important}} forensic evidences in firearm identification, Howeveq there are no general guidelines available for optical imaging, processing, and analyzing the images of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> for firearm identification, In this respect, the further development for firearm identification is highly demanded from both theoretical and practical point of view. This paper aims {{to address the problem}} of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> identification. A novel approach is proposed for measuring the similarity of firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> in terms of their co-occurrencefeature descriptors. In doing so, the markings on the surface of cartridge case are captured by a CCD camera. After extracting the firing pin imagesn we calculate the co-occurrence feature sets of the firing pin images. Then we can classify the firing pin images based on the relative distances between sample images. The experimental results indicate that the firing <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> can be preciously classified in terms of their co-occurrence features...|$|R

500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate <b>marks,</b> and ejector <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> {{are usually}} {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|R

The size and shape of the abnormal tissue induced by pin insertion depended on the size of needle, growth rate of trees, and the tree species. Since the abnormal tissue changed its shape and size as the cross section receded from the center, it was concluded to be necessary to use the cross section obtained from the center of pinning for correct application of the pinning method. The site relation between cambial initials at the time of pinning and the abnormal tissue was investigated following the modified Wolter's procedure. As a result, the site of cambial initials at the time of pinning was assumed to be at the cambial-side margin of the spindle-like abnormal tissue...|$|R

Trumpeter has a cooperation with Japanese ship model manufacturer Pit-Road for kits in 1:700 scale. These kits are usually available under the Pit-Road label in Japan {{and under the}} Trumpeter label {{in the rest of}} the world.Trumpeter's ship models have included a rising number of parts, but quality is still disputed due to insufficient research and some recent releases have been over-engineered. For example, the 1:350 scale kit of the American aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) (an early release) has been found to compromise in detail ("disappointment"), while the hull form shows major mistakes and the island is also not perfect. Fit, however, is said to be excellent, and surface detail [...] "very credible". Also modern US carriers (for example the 1/700 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers) suffer from a wrong hull form. Hull form problems are also found in the Baltimore-class cruiser kits. Mistakes in the correct outfit (catapults, armament) have been pointed out regarding the details of some Essex-class carrier kits and the Bismarck-class battleships (wrong AA fit). Especially regarding the Essex class, the well known modeller Scott van Aken on the Modeling Madness website praises the kits of a competitor as preferable over Trumpeter: [...] "The moldings on the kit (of the competitor) are top rate and without the myriad of ejector <b>pin</b> <b>marks</b> that have plagued Trumpeter ship kits since day one." ...|$|R
