40|$|Enterprise Level Security (ELS) is an {{architecture}} for enabling information sharing with strong security guarantees. It is built upon basic tenets and concepts that shape its component technologies and implementation. One challenge in sharing information {{is that the}} source and recipient of the information may use different units, protocols, data formats, or tools to process information. As a result, a transformation of the data is needed before the recipient can use the information. These conversions introduce potential security weaknesses into an ELS system, so an approach for enterprise-wide mediation is required. Methods in common use today, such as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) translation and an <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> <b>service,</b> do not preserve the basic ELS tenets and concepts. This paper examines these existing approaches and compares them with two new approaches designed to preserve ELS security. It looks at the complete picture of security, performance, and ease of implementation, offering a framework for choosing the best mediation approach based on the data sharing context...|$|R

Although <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> is increasingly used, research has hardly investigated {{the conditions under which}} e-mediation should be done and/or how parties experience it. In this presentation, we present e-supported mediation practices in the Netherlands as well as the results of research related to the effects of different types of e-mediation. Specifically, we will refer to fully e-mediated divorce cases and e-mediated labor conflicts in which an online intake tool is used before the joint mediation session (hybrid type of e-supported mediation).

40|$|Abstract: Argumentation {{theory is}} often used in multi agent-systems to {{facilitate}} autonomous agent reasoning and multi-agent interaction. The technology {{can also be used}} to develop <b>online</b> negotiation and <b>mediation</b> <b>services</b> by providing argument structures that assist parties involved in a dispute to resolve outstanding issues or avoid future disputes. While Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) represents a move from a fixed and formal process to a more flexible one, Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) moves ADR from a physical to a virtual place. The research aims to capitalise on the recent trend towards ODR by creating a JADE based multi-agent ODR environment. The utility functions and argument structures of two existing ODR applications are being re-deployed as Web based intelligent agents capable of intuitively coordinating during a negotiation. One agent uses expert knowledge of the Australian Family Law domain to recommend a percentage property split, while another uses heuristics and game theory and combines this split with a significance rating of items provided by each party, to allocate issues and advise upon possible trade-offs. The ultimate aim is to provide disputants with an integrated ODR environment offering a range of services to assist them in achieving fairer outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Online-Mediation {{deals with}} {{conflict}} resolution methods that {{are carried out}} partially or completely online. The book analyses <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> as a socio-technical system through {{the means of the}} computer-based technological platform deeply interwoven with conflict-related social communication. The first part of the book discusses the multiple options and restrictions of online communication in moderation and mediation processes. For example, one advantage of <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> is that geographically separated parties (e. g. in e-commerce settings) can resolve conflicts at comparatively low cost. The second part of the book reports <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> examples from politics and industry. Although <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> is described as a seminal method increasingly requested, several socio-technical problems need to be addressed by further research. The book provides an informative view of the subject, focusing on the German-speaking countries. Unfortunately, it lacks a systematic comparison of different <b>online</b> <b>mediation</b> tools and techniques as well as {{a closer look at the}} business models and professional issues in this new field of activity.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> in the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} and awareness of this service in society. The Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> is a state organization that works {{in the field of}} criminal policy. Its main goal is to resolve the conflicts associated with criminal activities effectively and in favour of society. But this is not the only aim of the organization. It also strives for efficient and dignified execution of alternative punishments and measures. Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> is based on a concept of restorative justice which is increasingly developing in the Czech Republic. It stresses the integration of offender, participation of victim and protection of society. The probation officers have to face many problems that make their work difficult. Key issue is a low awareness of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> in society which is caused by insufficient PR strategy. The consequence of inadequate promotion is a limited cooperation between probation officers and offenders or victims. The low awareness is proved by the results of questionnaire surveys that were conducted among general public in the Czech Republic and clients of the Probation and <b>Mediation</b> <b>Service</b> centre in Prague.

The Semantic Sensor Web enables interoperability to support various applications that use data made available by semantically heterogeneous sensor services. However, several challenges {{still need to be}} addressed to achieve this vision. More particularly, mechanisms that can support context-aware semantic mapping that adapts to dynamic metadata of sensors are required. Semantic mapping for Sensor Web is required to support sensor data fusion, sensor data discovery and retrieval, and automatic semantic annotation, to name only a few applications. This paper presents a context-aware ontology-based semantic <b>mediation</b> <b>service</b> for heterogeneous sensor <b>services.</b> The semantic <b>mediation</b> <b>service</b> is context-aware and dynamic because it takes into account the real-time variability of thematic, spatial and temporal features that describe sensor data in different contexts.
