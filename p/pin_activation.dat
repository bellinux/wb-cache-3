40|$|The {{development}} and morphology of vascular plants is critically determined by synthesis and proper {{distribution of the}} phytohormone auxin. The directed cell-to-cell distribution of auxin is achieved through a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are proposed auxin efflux transporters, and auxin fluxes can seemingly be predicted based on the-in many cells-asymmetric plasma membrane distribution of PINs. Here, we show in a heterologous Xenopus oocyte system {{as well as in}} Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence stems that PIN-mediated auxin transport is directly activated by D 6 PROTEIN KINASE (D 6 PK) and PINOID (PID) /WAG kinases of the Arabidopsis AGCVIII kinase family. At the same time, we reveal that D 6 PKs and PID have differential phosphosite preferences. Our study suggests that <b>PIN</b> <b>activation</b> by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that {{must be taken into account}} to understand auxin distribution within the plant...|$|E

The activation energy, Ea, for thermally assisted flux flow (TAFF) in intergranular region is determined. It was established that a correlation {{exists between the}} intergranular critical current and flux <b>pinning</b> <b>activation</b> energy.

40|$|The tetragonal FeSe {{phase is}} an intensively {{investigated}} iron based superconductor. In {{this study we}} examined the influence of Ag addition on the superconducting properties of selenium deficient polycrystalline FeSe 0. 94. The samples were obtained by solid state reaction and melting methods. XRD analysis shows the presence of tetragonal phase and EDX analysis establishes inhomogeneous Ag distribution in the grains. The superconducting properties were investigated by fundamental and third harmonic AC magnetic susceptibility. The intergranular critical current determined from AC magnetic susceptibility in the Ag doped sample is several times higher than that in the undoped one, obtained by melting at approximately the same temperatures. Intra-granular current is field independent up to almost 1000 Oe. Using the temperature dependence of third harmonic AC magnetic susceptibility at different DC magnetic fields, the irreversibility lines were obtained for all samples. It is found that Ag addition increased the irreversibility field in comparison with undoped melted and powder sintered samples.

40|$|A careful {{analysis}} of the magneto-transport properties of epitaxial nanostructured Nb thin films in the normal and the mixed state is performed. The nanopatterns were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. They provide a washboard-like pinning potential landscape for vortices in the mixed state and simultaneously cause a resistivity anisotropy in the normal state. Two matching magnetic fields for the vortex lattice with the underlying nanostructures have been observed. By applying these fields, the most likely pinning sites along which the flux lines move through the samples have been selected. By this, either the background isotropic pinning of the pristine film or the enhanced isotropic pinning originating from the nanoprocessing have been probed. Via an Arrhenius {{analysis of the}} resistivity data the <b>pinning</b> <b>activation</b> energies for three vortex lattice parameters have been quantified.

50|$|During mitosis, {{mitotic spindle}} {{orientation}} {{is essential for}} determining the site of cleavage furrowing and position of daughter cells for subsequent cell fate determination. This orientation is achieved by polarizing cortical factors and rapid alignment of the spindle with the polarity axis. In fruit flies, three cortical factors {{have been found to}} regulate the position of the spindle: heterotrimeric G protein α subunit (Gαi), Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), and Mushroom body defect (Mud). Gαi localizes at apical cortex to recruit Pins. Upon binding to GDP-bound Gαi, Pins is activated and recruits Mud to achieve polarized distribution of cortical factors. N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) in Pins is the binding region for Mud, but is autoinhibited by intrinsic C-terminal GoLoco domains (GLs) in the absence of Gαi. <b>Activation</b> of <b>Pins</b> by Gαi binding to GLs is highly ultrasensitive and is achieved through the following decoy mechanism: GLs 1 and 2 act as a decoy domains, competing with the regulatory domain, GL3, for Gαi inputs. This intramolecular decoy mechanism allows Pins to establish its threshold and steepness in response to distinct Gαi concentration. At low Gαi inputs, the decoy GLs 1 and 2 are preferentially bound. At intermediate Gαi concentration, the decoys are nearly saturated, and GL3 begins to be populated. At higher Gαi concentration, the decoys are fully saturated and Gαi binds to GL3, leading to <b>Pins</b> <b>activation.</b> Ultrasensitivity of <b>Pins</b> in response to Gαi ensures that Pins is activated only at the apical cortex where Gαi concentration is above the threshold, allowing for maximal Mud recruitment.|$|R
40|$|AimsCardiac {{hypertrophy}} is elicited by endothelin (ET) - 1 as well {{as other}} neurohumoral factors, hemodynamic overload, and oxidative stress; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy partly via the anti-oxidative stress. One of their common intracellular pathways is the phosphorylation cascade of MEK signaling. Pin 1 specifically isomerizes the phosphorylated protein with Ser/Thr-Pro bonds and regulates their activity through conformational changes. There is no report whether the <b>Pin</b> 1 <b>activation</b> contributes to ET- 1 -induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and whether the Pin 1 inactivation contributes to the inhibitory effect of statins. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal these questions. Main methodsWe assessed neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy using ET- 1 and fluvastatin by the cell surface area, ANP mRNA expression, JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation, and [3 H]-leucine incorporation. Key findingsFluvastatin inhibited ET- 1 -induced increase in the cell surface area, ANP expression, and [3 H]-leucine incorporation; and it suppressed the signaling cascade from JNK to c-Jun. The phosphorylated Pin 1 level, an inactive form, was decreased by ET- 1; however, it reached basal level by fluvastatin. Furthermore, Pin 1 overexpression clearly elicited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which was inhibited by fluvastatin. SignificanceThis is the first report that ET- 1 -induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is mediated through the <b>Pin</b> 1 <b>activation</b> and that the inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy would partly be attributed to the suppression of the Pin 1 function. This study firstly suggests that Pin 1 determines the size of hypertrophied cardiomyocyte by regulating the activity of phosphorylated molecules and that statins exert their pleiotropic effects partly via Pin 1 inactivation...|$|R

Two representative cases were studied in this work. First, a synergetic reduction approach {{was used to}} synthesize Ag nanoparticles, in which the experimental parameters, especially temperature, were optimized for the formation and growth of silver nanoplates. The kinetic control for such particle growth was discussed. Secondly, multi-filament tape of Bi- 2223 nanocrystals sheathed by Ag was manufactured at the temperature of 835 - 845 o C, respectively. The chemical reaction kinetics suggested and developed by Kolmogorov, Johnson, Mehl and Avrami (abbreviated by KJMA) were used to investigate the crystalline evolution of Bi- 2223.

40|$|Cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} is a conserved {{mechanism that}} controls mRNA translation and stability. A key protein that promotes polyadenylation-induced translation of mRNAs in maturing Xenopus oocytes is the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB). During this meiotic transition, CPEB {{is subjected to}} phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and partial destruction, which is necessary for successive waves of polyadenylation of distinct mRNAs. Here we identify the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin 1 as an important factor mediating CPEB destruction. Pin 1 interacts with CPEB in an unusual {{manner in which it}} occurs prior to CPEB phosphorylation and prior to <b>Pin</b> 1 <b>activation</b> by serine 71 dephosphorylation. Upon induction of maturation, CPEB becomes phosphorylated, which occurs simultaneously with Pin 1 dephosphorylation. At this time, the CPEB-Pin 1 interaction requires cdk 1 -catalyzed CPEB phosphorylation on S/T-P motifs. Subsequent CPEB ubiquitination and destruction are mediated by a conformational change induced by Pin 1 isomerization of CPEB. Similar to M phase progression in maturing Xenopus oocytes, the destruction of CPEB during the mammalian cell cycle requires Pin 1 as well.

A slow creep regime, where the motion is controlled by wall <b>pinning</b> and thermal <b>activation,</b> and a flow regime with linear variation of the DW velocity, are observed. In asymmetric stacks, where the Rashba spin-orbit field stabilizes the domain wall against turbulent transformations, the steady linear regime is extended to higher currents, leading to higher velocities than in single-layer or symmetric stacks.

The results are interpreted with a theoretical analysis of a simplified bistable reaction-diffusion model. Weak coupling results in trivial pinned states where the activation cannot propagate. At strong coupling, a uniform state is expected with active or inactive elements at small or large degree networks, respectively. A nontrivial stationary spatial pattern, corresponding to an <b>activation</b> <b>pinning,</b> is predicted to occur at an intermediate number of peripheral elements and at intermediate coupling strengths, where the central activation of the network is pinned, but the peripheral activation propagates toward the center.

40|$|User {{interfaces}} often {{account for}} a majority of application code and defects. High quality user interfaces come with equally high development costs ? lower than the cost of multitudes of users coping with low quality user interfaces, but higher than the mild frustration experienced by any individual user. Thus, the economics of software lead to a situation where barely passable user interfaces abound. That most user interface code comes from bespoke attempts to implement vague human interface guidelines is a leading cause of high cost and low quality.

40|$|The {{extensive}} research {{effort in the}} development of high-Tc superconducting (HTSC) class-II (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox+ 10 (Bi(Pb) - 2223) coils, and magnets, through processing optimization, and characterization of silver, and silver-alloy composite tapes, has been conducted at the Center for Superconducting and Electronic Materials (part of the Institute of Materials Technology and Manufacturing), Department of Materials Engineering, University of Wollongong. Studies leading up to the production of Bi(Pb) - 2223 class-II coils, and magnets include the following investigations in materials processing, and science of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes:- The processing of Bi(Pb) - 2223 short, and long length composite tapes (from the standard procedure of PIT, to the conventional method of CTFF, and the novel format of WIT, or wire-in-tube), and the characterization on their physical, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties by means of measurements - implemented techniques include; Vickers microhardness tests (HyT), particle size analysis (PSA), Xray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal and thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS), electrical transport, ac-susceptibility, and the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometry. The effect of powder packing density, using the conventional method of powder-intube (PIT) by various means, on the transport critical current density, Jc, mechanical properties, and high-Tc phase (2223) formation of Bi(Pb) - 2223 single filamentary (SF) superconducting tapes - higher initial packing density of PIT monocore short tapes has been found to give higher Jc values, as well as higher rate of 2223 formation, while lower initial packing density samples gave better mechanical performance. Critical strains for bend tests showed a dependence on the core thickness, and silver/oxide volume ratio. The effect of sintering periods on the microstructure, phase development, and electrical transport and magnetic properties of Bi(Pb) - 2223 SF tapes - comparisons have been made between three batches of tapes with the same thermomechanical deformation, and sintering conditions, but with the starting precursor powders being different in their synthesis. It has been found that the volume density of the macroscopic pinning force in fields up to IT is greater for a particular sintering period, viz. 60 h in duration. Resistivity measurements further showed that the <b>pinning</b> <b>activation</b> energy also reaches a higher value for the same sintering period chosen. Scanning electron microimages of the fractured surfaces indicated that better core morphology, and density can be achieved in SF tapes from using this particular sintering period. Prolong sintering has been found to lead to greater porosity, while short duration sintering inhibits grain growth, which is undesirable for not providing sufficient time for the healing of cracks, induced during the intermediate deformation between sintering periods. The results also showed that longer sintering periods (of duration 3 ̆e= 100 h) tend to give better grain growth (in terms of grain size), but greater grain misalignment. Prolong sintering however, has been found to facilitate the increase in porosity of the core due to random grain growth. Critical currents in tapes treated with long sintering periods also have been measured to be lower in comparison with the values obtained for samples treated with slightly shorter sintering periods. The tapes made using 2 ̆ 7 threeto- four-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 60 h) showed superior electrical transport properties over the 2 ̆ 7 two-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 3 ̆e= 100 h) tapes, and revealed less microcracks in comparison with the 2 ̆ 7 five-to-six-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 40 h) tapes. These attributes are the result of higher core density with better connected and aligned grains, owing to sufficient sintering time for each period of heat treatment. The effect of intermediate rolling reduction on the transport property, microstructure, phase formation and fill factor of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - well controlled intermediate deformation between sintering stages of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes is crucial in achieving high critical current density. This deformation whether by rolling or pressing, depends on factors such as the compositional phase, the degree of microcracks, sintering periods or duration, and sintering temperature. It has been investigated that there is indeed an optimal 2 ̆ 7 window 2 ̆ 7 of reduction for intermediate rolling (at room temperature) between sintering stages. For a particular sintering temperature, this window has been determined to vary depending on the time of sintering and phase composition after a certain sintering period. It has been found that the amount of intermediate deformation controls the transformation rate of 2223, as well as determining the tape 2 ̆ 7 s final microstructure and fill factor. Mechanical property, and filamentary configuration of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - mutifilamentary (MF) tapes prepared by both methods of oxide-powder-in-tube (OPIT), and continuous-tube-forming-filling (CTFF) technique with reproducible, and scalable transport critical current densities between 15 and 20 kA/cm 2 (77 K, self field, 1 μ V/cm) by rolling have been achieved. It has been found that the filament distribution (geometry of filaments), the fill factor (ratio of superconducting ceramic core to the total cross-section of the conductor), and the stacking factor (number of times the filaments are stacked) play a crucial roll in determining the overall mechanical and electrical performance of these tapes. The determination of stability parameters for Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - with high upper critical fields, HTSC have been recognized as candidate materials for coil and magnet applications. High field devices at one time or another, when operated close to their rated limits, are often faced with instability problems which normally are of electrical, magnetic or mechanical nature. The determination of stability parameters therefore are of interest to the conductor designer which assists in the processing aspect of long length production of wires and tapes. It has been found that Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag tapes are cryostabled, as well as flux-jump stabled. Processing parameters such as intermediate deformation and fill factor, have found to have a direct effect on the stability outcome of these tapes. Thermal stability of Bi(Pb) - 2223 coils at 77 K - it has been found that the degree of thermal stability of Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag pancake-shaped coils at 77 K can be determined by controlling the amount of matrix and superconducting materials during processing. The intermediate deformation step between sintering stages {{has been found to be}} crucial in optimizing the performance of the processed composite tapes as well as governing the thermal stability of the subsequently produced pancake-shaped coils. Results obtained from numerical analysis by the finite element method has shown that monolayer coils produced from Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag composite tapes are thermally very stable, with high values of fill factor. Increasing the number of co-wound tapes however, for reasons of achieving higher current carrying capacity, and improving in mechanical integrity of the coil or magnet system, has been found to require either a reduction in the fill factor or an increase in cooling rate for thermal stability to be sustained as would otherwise be achieved with the metallurgically same single tape. Development of Bi(Pb) - 2223 class-II coils and magnets - once the production of high quality long length Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag tapes have been achieved considerations such as how to fabricate them into practical applications without degrading the performance of the tape becomes the major issues. The main problems concerned are usually related to the winding procedures (e. g. wind-react (W 2 ̆ 6 R) and react-wind (R 2 ̆ 6 W)), the insulating material, the construction or stacking of coils if they are pancake-shaped, and the study of quench propagation parameters. A novel W 2 ̆ 6 R solenoidal coil (reaching 973 ampere-turns) wound on an alumina ceramic tube generates a dc-field of 19 m T at 77 K has been produced together with five pancake-shaped coils, each generates an average of 5 m T at 77 K, destined for magnet construction with a possible combined calculated field of - 0. 04 T at 77 K (with liquid nitrogen as a coolant). Critical currents of superconducting silver, and silver-alloy composite double pancake coils of Bi(Pb) - 2223 have been measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. A critical current density of - 12. 5 kA/cm 2 has been measured for a coil fabricated from Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag composite tape of length 2. 2 m (342 Ampere-turns) using the W I T method.

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} plant growth and development. Many aspects of its action depend on the formation of local maxima or gradients within tissues. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins facilitate auxin efflux from cells and, by their dynamic polar localization, provide a basis for its directional transport. PIN-dependent auxin transport is regulated by several members of the plant specific AGCVIII kinase family. Phosphorylation of the central serine residues in three conserved TPRXS(N/S) motifs by PIONOID (PID) is crucial for polar targeting of PINs. The D 6 protein kinases (D 6 PKs) were also shown {{to be involved in the}} control of polar auxin transport and are functionally linked to PIN 1 and PIN 3, however they do not interfere with PIN subcellular localization. In this work, the X. laevis oocyte expression system was used to study the impact of D 6 PK and other representative members of the AGCVIII kinase family on transport activity of PIN 1 and PIN 3. An assay was established that allowed monitoring auxin efflux after direct injection of oocytes with radiolabeled substrate. It could be shown that co-expression of PIN 1 and PIN 3 proteins with D 6 PK or PID results in phosphorylation of PINs and in enhanced auxin efflux. Contrarily, expression of PIN proteins alone did not cause measurable auxin efflux when compared to water-injected control oocytes. Based on the observation that a kinase-inactive version of D 6 PK could no longer stimulate PIN-mediated auxin efflux, it was concluded that phosphorylation is essential for <b>PIN</b> function. <b>Activation</b> of <b>PIN</b> 1 and PIN 3 could be achieved by co-expression of D 6 PK and PID, but not two other members of the AGCVIII kinase family, PHOT 1 and UNC, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between PINs and D 6 PK / PID. Analyses of different mutants lead to the identification of phosphorylation target sites that are essential for D 6 PK / PID – mediated PIN 1 transport activity. A serine to alanine substitution at position 271 caused decreased auxin efflux from PIN 1 S 271 A / D 6 PK co-expressing oocytes, but had no effect on PID mediated activation, indicating that S 271 is important for D 6 PK function, while PID acts independently of S 271, i. e. vy phosphorylation of different residues. Consistently, an opposite effect was observed in a PIN 1 S 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A triple mutant with alanines replacing the central serines in the TPRXS(N/S) motifs. The different impacts of the S 271 A and the S 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A mutations on D 6 PK and PID function suggested that <b>activation</b> of <b>PIN</b> 1 by D 6 PK is mediated preferentially via phosphorylation of S 271 A whereas PID favors the central serines in the TPRXS(N/S) motifs, thereby regulating polarity as well as activity. While both PIN 1 S 271 A as well as the triple mutant PIN 1 S 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A could still mediate enhanced auxin efflux from oocytes when co-expressed with D 6 PK or PID, although to a varying extent, transport activity was almost completely lost in a combined quadruple mutant PIN 1 S 231 A/S 252 A/S 271 A/S 290 A. The results obtained from the analysis of PIN 1 mutants suggest that the main phosphorylation sites that contribute to PIN 1 activatability by D 6 PK and PID have been identified and include S 271 as well as S 231 /S 252 /S 290. However, it was clearly demonstrated that not all of the sites have to be phosphorylated at the same time to confer transport activity to PIN 1. In fact, phosphorylation of either S 271 or one or more of the S 231 /S 252 /S 290 sites is sufficient for transport activity under the given experimental conditions. PIN 3 generally exhibited higher transport rates than PIN 1 when co-expressed with an activating kinase, probably reflecting its function in processes that involve rapid polar redistribution of auxin. A serine to alanine exchange at position 262 of PIN 3 which corresponds to S 271 in PIN 1 had no effect on the activation by either D 6 PK or PID when compare to wild type PIN 3 indicating that different amino acid residues are important for PIN 3 activity. In summary, the results obtained in the first part of this work provide evidence that the transport activity of the auxin efflux carriers PIN 1 and PIN 3 is controlled by the AGCVIII kinases D 6 PK and PID and depends on phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues, thereby giving important insights into the biochemical mechanisms that control PIN protein function. In the second part of the thesis, the role of phytohormone responses in plant-nematode interactions was studied. Plant parasitic nematodes are destructive pathogens with a broad host range and cause enormous yield losses each year. The sedentary endoparasitic nematodes are divided into two groups, the root knot nematodes (RKN) and the cyst nematodes (CN). The free living juveniles of RKN and CN enter their host plant’s roots and induce the formation of highly specialized feeding sites termed giant cells or syncytia, respectively, in the vascular cylinder. From these feeding sites, all the nutrients required for growth and development of the nematodes are withdrawn. Giant cells and syncytia are functionally equivalent and represent strong terminal sink tissues. However they differ in their genesis and in the way how they are loaded with nutrients. While syncytia are connected to the surrounding vasculature by plasmodesmata, giant cells are symplastically isolated and nutrient uptake occurs via membrane dependent processes. Both syncytia and giant cells are enclosed in vascular tissue which is formed de novo and is required for the transport of nutrients towards the feeding sites. The unloading phloem that is induced around syncytia consists of sieve elements and companion cells with the ratio shifted towards an excess of sieve elements. Giant cells on the other hand are surrounded by a unique phloem tissue that is built up of nucleate sieve elements whereas companion cells are absent. It was shown before that both CN and RKN secrete auxin- and cytokinin-like compounds and that auxin plays an important role in the establishment of the feeding sites. However, nothing was known about how the vascularization of syncytia and giant cells is controlled and whether phytohormones play a role in this process. Therefore auxin and cytokinin responses were monitored in nematode infected Arabidopsis roots using the synthetic hormone responsive promoters DR 5 and TCS, respectively, fused to the coding sequence for ER-localized green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP fluorescence was recorded and immunohistochemical experiments were performed in order to identify the cell types within the nematode induced tissues that responded to the phytohormones. This provided insights into a possible function of phytohormone dependent processes in feeding site vascularization. In uninfected differentiated parts of control roots a constitutive auxin response was found in companion cells, but no response to cytokinin mediated by B-type response regulators was observed. Neither giant cells nor syncytia themselves responded to auxin or cytokinin at the timepoints of the infection cycle that were analyzed in this work but the response was limited to cells that surrounded the feeding sites. The observed hormone responses differed between RKN and CN-induced tissues. In developing root knots, an auxin response in cells around the giant cells preceded their subsequent differentiation into sieve elements, which were identified using a well established sieve element marker. Possibly, the auxin response primes these cells for the differentiation process. GFP signal was retained even after the responding cells had assumed sieve element identity while cells that tested positive only for GFP but not for the sieve element marker were an exception in the mature root knot. The latter observation adds further evidence to the previously described finding that companion cells are absent from fully developed root knots. Cytokinin signaling could not be observed in root knots of PTCS:ER-GFP plants which means that either cytokinin levels are low or cells are not susceptible to the signal. In contrast to the situation in root knots, the phloem around syncytia responded to both hormones. Auxin response was detected in companion cells and sieve elements while cytokinin response was limited to the sieve elements. Taking into account the distinct characteristics of the phloem tissues around syncytia and giant cells and the differential hormone responses, the ratio of cytokinin and auxin response might contribute to the identity of the de novo formed phloem, i. e. metaphloem in CN induced tissues and protophloem in RKN induced tissues...|$|R
40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a binary {{targeted}} therapy that uses suitably designed pharmaceuticals to deliver (superscript 10) B to tumor cells. The region is then irradiated with neutrons and neutron capture by the (superscript 10) B nucleus {{leads to the}} emission of an alpha particle and lithium ion. These have very short ranges similar to the dimensions of a biological cell and therefore the technique could have potential for selective killing of tumour cells. In order to achieve adequate neutron fluxes {{at the site of}} the tumour epithermal (0. 5 eV � 10 s of keV) neutron beams are used. A review of the general details of BNCT is presented in this thesis. This thesis investigates the use of two semiconductor devices for measuring the neutron and gamma dose components involved in epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT. The silicon lattice in PIN diodes undergoes displacement damage when irradiated with neutrons. This leads to a change in the forward bias voltage of the diode that is proportional to the neutron dose received. To verify that the energy dependence of this effect follows the published silicon displacement damage KERMA (Kinetic Energy Released per Mass of Absorber) data measurements were performed using quasi-monoenergetic neutrons obtained from a Van de Graff accelerator (Ansto) in the energy range from 90 keV � 890 keV. These measurements were in agreement with the published data for silicon displacement damage KERMA. A sensitivity factor for the diodes was also derived from these measurements. The thermal neutron sensitivity of the PIN diodes was then determined using the TC- 10 thermal neutron column on the Moata reactor at Ansto. The sensitivity results were in general agreement with the Van de Graff derived sensitivity factor. Since the silicon damage KERMA is not the same as the tissue KERMA function PIN diodes are not intrinsically tissue equivalent. A Monte Carlo (MNCP) ideal beam study was undertaken to see if for some limited energy range tissue dose could be parameterised in terms of silicon damage dose and foil activation. This was found to be approximately true for neutron energies from thermal to 100 keV. Coefficients are given that allow tissue dose to be determined on the basis of a single <b>PIN</b> diode and <b>activation</b> foil measurement in spectra where the maximum neutron energy is 100 keV or less. MOSFETS can be used as gamma radiation dosimeters by measuring the change in threshold voltage (simplistically understood as the potential applied to the gate to initiate current flow from source to drain electrodes) that occurs when they are exposed to radiation. The MOSFETs used in this study were characterised using a Varian 2100 C medical linac beam and low energy x-rays from a superficial x-ray unit. The sensitivity of the MOSFETs was measured with different potentials applied to the gate during irradiation. Depth dose profiles in 6 MV x-ray beams were measured and found to be in good agreement with both ionisation chamber measurements and MCNP simulations. This good agreement was also obtained for the buildup region. Although the silicon oxide layer of the MOSFET is not intrinsically very sensitive to neutron irradiation the presence of encapsulating materials leads to the generation of secondary photons and electrons which lead to shifts in threshold voltage and therefore confound gamma ray measurements in mixed neutron / gamma fields. To determine the energy dependant neutron response function of the MOSFET a detailed MCNP simulation was used. A lithiated shield was also incorporated into this model. The calculated neutron response functions were used to correct for neutron contributions to MOSFET measurements in mixed fields. MOSFET thermal neutron responses were measured using a series of measurements with MOSFETS both with and without lithiated covers exposed in the the Moata thermal neutron column at Ansto. The measurements were repeated with various gate potentials. The gamma doses measured were consistent with gamma doses measured using paired ionisation chambers. The Petten HB 11 facility is briefly described as are phantoms and MCNP models fabricated by S Wallace for an associated work. Measurements using PIN diodes and MOSFETs in phantoms exposed in the HB 11 beam are described. Foil activation data is compared to MCNP calculations to validate the MCNP models used. This thesis presents a number of results that have been recalculated in more detail and with various parameters changed. In particular the effect of variations in phantom hydration have been incorporated as have response functions for MOSFET detectors and associated shields. PIN diode measurements in a Perspex cube phantom exposed in the HB 11 beam show good agreement with MCNP calculated silicon displacement dose. Similarly good agreement is obtained for a cylindrical phantom filled with tissue equivalent gel when the hydrogen content of the gel in the original model is corrected for dehydration. Measurements in a more complex skull phantom show larger discrepancies between the experimental results and a MCNP simulation especially at depth. The discrepancies range from 25 � 300 % in absolute terms but are only 2 - 3 % of the maximum silicon dose. MOSFET measurements performed in the Perspex cube phantom using lithiated covers show excellent agreement with ionisation chamber measurements (also with lithiated covers). Measurements in a cylinder phantom and head phantom using lithium/perpex covered MOSFETs are compared with Monte Carlo calculations of induced gamma dose. In this case the measured gamma doses at approximately 2 cm depth appear to be too low. Further investigation involving a detailed MCNP simulation including the lithiated MOSFET covers in the model indicated that the covers suppress the thermal neutron flux at the measurement point and therefore the gamma dose is also reduced. Measurements at greater depths show a similar effect but to a lesser extent. The epithermal neutron beam at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) is described is described. PIN diode and MOSFET measurement results in a Perspex cube phantom are also presented. Reasonable agreement between calculated and measured PIN diode results is observed. MOSFET measurements show good agreement with the known percentage depth dose curve for the total gamma dose. However there is a discrepancy in the absolute magnitude of the measured gamma doses. It is proposed that this is also due to thermal neutron flux depression arising from the use of relatively thick lithiated neutron shields around the MOSFETS. In summary; It is demonstrated that PIN diodes could be useful for verifying treatment planning dose distributions in epithermal neutron beams. This includes the possibility of on line real-time measurements. They could also be used in conjunction with an activation foil to yield tissue equivalent dose measurements where the maximum neutron energy is less than 100 keV. Lithium shielded MOSFET measurements can be reconciled with calculated gamma dose distributions when the effect of flux depression is taken into account. However the perturbations introduced by the shield mean that the measured dose does not represent the dose at the measurement point in the absence of the shield. In order to use MOSFETs for gamma dosimetry in epithermal neutron beams different encapsulation is required to minimise neutron response and eliminate the need for lithiated covers. It is suggested that MCNP simulations of MOSFETs similar to the models in this thesis would provide an adequate tool for optimising the appropriate encapsulation...|$|R
