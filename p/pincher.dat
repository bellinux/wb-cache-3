Driberg's colleague Michael Foot denied Pincher's claim that Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had made a secret agreement with Foot to protect Driberg if Foot, in turn, would remain silent about the supposed treachery of Roger Hollis, another of Pincher's recently dead targets.|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature <b>Pincher.</b> The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E

25|$|Unfit for {{military}} service because of his polio, he joined the MI5 in November 1939, {{two months after the}} start of World War II, upon Ball's recommendation.

25|$|In September 1963, Mitchell {{unexpectedly}} took early retirement, due {{to health}} reasons, at age 58, after 24 years service.

The main suspicion then fell on Hollis and, although the matter has never been completely resolved, Christopher Andrew in his Authorised History of MI5 comes to a firm conclusion that neither were traitors. <b>Pincher,</b> conversely, believes that Hollis was the most likely culprit, if there was one.|$|E

500|$|The {{local road}} now {{designated}} as Township Road7-0 is the historic alignment of Highway3 across the Castle River west of <b>Pincher</b> Creek and immediately {{north of the}} <b>Pincher</b> Creek Airport. [...] From the east, the highway paralleled the railway until <b>Pincher</b> Station at the junction with Highway6, but then continued due west to cross the river approximately [...] south of the present-day crossing. [...] Highway3 turned northwest, then west {{to pass through the}} south side of Lundbreck on a local road now named Township Road7-4. [...] West of Lundbreck, the highway briefly paralleled the Crowsnest River before crossing it near Lundbreck Falls. [...] East of Lethbridge, Highway3 was composed of sections of road that followed a grid system for long stretches, using only roads that ran due east or due north. [...] Exiting Lethbridge, it followed a road now designated as Highway512 to Coaldale, then turned north into Coaldale where it turned east. [...] South of Tempest, it turned back north, then east near the hamlet of Chin. [...] After following {{the vast majority of the}} present-day alignment alongside the railway to Seven Persons, it diverged from the railway and curved northeast into Medicine Hat.|$|E

500|$|More vituperation {{followed}} when Pincher's {{allegations of}} Driberg's {{links with the}} Russian secret service were published in 1981; <b>Pincher</b> christened him [...] "Lord of the Spies". However, Foot dismissed these accusations as typical of the [...] "fantasies {{of the secret service}} world that seem to have taken possession of Pincher's mind". Foot added that Driberg [...] "had always been much too ready to look forgivingly on Communist misdeeds, but this attitude was combined with an absolutely genuine devotion to the cause of peace".|$|E
500|$|East of Lundbreck and Cowley, {{the highway}} crosses Castle River to Highways6 and 785 north of <b>Pincher</b> Creek. [...] It briefly {{parallels}} the creek {{for which the}} town was named before crossing it and reaching Brocket, and Highway786 which meets Highway507 southeast of <b>Pincher</b> Creek. [...] Highway3 follows the Oldman River to Fort Macleod, approximately [...] east of Brocket. Just prior to Fort Macleod, the highway enters the Municipal District of Willow Creek No.26 and Highway810 splits south to the communities of Ardenville and Glenwood after which Highway3 widens to a divided highway. [...] It meets Highway2 at a trumpet interchange, and diverges into a one-way road pair through Fort Macleod at a reduced speed limit of , concurrent with Highway2. Highway811 turns north from Highway3 in central Fort Macleod to cross the Oldman River on a historic alignment of Highway2. [...] At the Fort Macleod Health Centre, Highways2 and 3 curve southeast to leave the town as the one-way roads rejoin into a divided highway. [...] The concurrency ends as Highway2 splits south as a two-lane highway to Cardston and the United States border at Carway. Highway3 bends back to the northeast, now designated as the Red Coat Trail and carrying CANAMEX traffic destined for the primary border crossing on Highway4 at Coutts.|$|E
500|$|British Columbia Highway3 is a two-lane {{undivided}} {{highway that}} becomes Alberta Highway3 {{at the border}} in mountainous terrain, paralleling {{a branch of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway.

[...] It curves through communities of the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass on the south side of Crowsnest Lake, crossing the Crowsnest River and reaching Highway40 at Coleman. [...] It continues alongside the railway through Blairmore, again crossing the Crowsnest River and bisecting the community of Frank and the rubble of the Frank Slide, a major landslide that killed more than 70 people in 1903. The highway, the Crowsnest River, and the railway meander east into the Municipal District of <b>Pincher</b> Creek No.9 and Burmis from which Highway507 splits south to Beaver Mines and forms an alternate route from the west into <b>Pincher</b> Creek. [...] Highway3 curves northeast to the hamlet of Lundbreck which it bypasses, and from which Highway22 begins and runs north. [...] The first of four former alignments of Highway3 (all of which are now designated as Highway3A) passes through Lundbreck, splitting from Highway3 prior to the hamlet and rejoining it [...] later.|$|E

50|$|The game {{takes place}} on the island region of Oblivia. The player, and a friend and fellow Ranger, Ben (Summer, if the player is male), are flying on Staraptors in the clouds, chasing after Pokémon <b>Pinchers</b> after Latias (Latios for male players). The player allows Latios/Latias to escape by distracting the <b>Pinchers.</b> However, when their squad leader, Red Eyes comes in, the player's partner taunts Red Eyes. He {{responds}} by shooting a plasma gun. The player moves forward and shields their partner from the blow, and is sent into the sea below, where the player loses and eventually recovers their styler. (The player's partner is then kidnapped.) The player washes up on a beach- the shores of Dolce Island. The player meets a Pichu with a ukulele, who is known throughout the game as the Ukulele Pichu. This Pichu becomes the partner Pokémon of this game. It will join the player as their Partner Pokémon, after they fix its broken ukulele. As a newly recruited Pokémon Ranger, the player would go on various missions and encounter friends, foes, and rivals, not to mention hordes of Pokémon. The new enemy, the Pokémon <b>Pinchers,</b> are controlling Pokémon and using them to their advantage. With newly found Pokémon companions at his side, the player begins his journey {{to put a stop}} to the Pokémon <b>Pinchers</b> and restore peace in Oblivia.|$|R
