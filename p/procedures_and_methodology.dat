In particular, species composition {{may be a}} suitable indicator for climate and landuse effects as well. For effective utilization of lichen diversity data in biomonitoring studies including air pollution, ecosystem functioning, and forestry studies, standardized sampling procedure and avoiding sampling and non-sampling errors are the important aspects to be considered.

In the second phase, we re-engineered the VME systems to maximize availability of the linac operation considering reliability, usability, expandability and flexibility. We newly developed an optically linked remote I/O system and intelligent motor control units. By adopting these systems, we could re-allocate the VME controllers away from known noise sources and also reduce the number of the controllers. All interface connector boxes were re-designed and replaced to achieve easy maintenance and expandability.

Testing <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology,</b> and closure measurement techniques, are described in detail. The strain levels chosen for the study cover from predominantly elastic to grossly plastic strains. Crack closure measurements are made at different crack lengths. The study reveals that, at high strains, cracks close only as the lowest stress level in the cycle is approached. The crack opening is observed {{to occur in the}} compressive part of the loading cycle. The applied stress needed to open a short crack under high strain is found to be less than for cracks under small scale yielding. For increased plastic deformations, the value of sigma sub op/sigma sub max is observed to decrease and approaches the value of R. Comparison of the experimental results with existing analysis is made and indicates the limitations of the small scale yielding approach where gross plastic deformation behavior occurs...|$|E

However, optimal care and restoration of health for a patient are dependent on reliability of diagnosis, therapy, prognosis and prophylaxis. This requires for all tests <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> a maximal repeatability and reproducibility, a sensitivity and specificity of 85 - 95 % for <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> <b>and</b> a comparison of results <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> to a gold standard.

Thus reproducibility in this context has to be divided into at least three levels: individual (epistemological, organoleptic, inter- and intra-observer variation, and formal/technological- and normative reproducibility).

40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) {{emerged in}} the second decade of the 20 th century as a {{technique}} for recording the neurophysiological response. Since then, {{there has been little}} variation in the physical principles that sustain the signal acquisition probes, otherwise called electrodes. Currently, new advances in technology have brought new unexpected fields of applications apart from the clinical, for which new aspects such as usability and gel-free operation are first order priorities. Thanks to new advances in materials and integrated electronic systems technologies, a new generation of dry electrodes has been developed to fulfill the need. In this manuscript, we review current approaches to develop dry EEG electrodes for clinical and other applications, including information about measurement methods and evaluation reports. We conclude that, although a broad and non-homogeneous diversity of approaches has been evaluated without a consensus in <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology,</b> their performances are not far from those obtained with wet electrodes, which are considered the gold standard, thus enabling the former to be a useful tool in a variety of novel applications...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a low-cost <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology</b> for markerless projectile tracking in three-dimensional (3 D) space. Understanding the 3 D trajectory {{of an object}} in flight can often be essential in examining variables relating to launch and landing conditions. Many systems exist to track the 3 D motion of projectiles but are often constrained by space or the type of object the system can recognize (Qualisys, Göteborg, Sweden; Vicon, Oxford, United Kingdom; Opti-Track, Corvallis, Oregon USA; Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa, California USA; Flight Scope, Orlando, Florida USA). These technologies can also be quite expensive, often costing hundreds of thousand dollars. The system {{presented in this paper}} utilizes two high-definition video cameras oriented perpendicular to each other to record the flight of an object. A postprocessing technique and subsequent geometrically based algorithm was created to determine 3 D position of the object using the two videos.
