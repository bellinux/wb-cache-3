25|$|Land reform {{measures}} were passed in 1919 and 1925 {{under pressure from}} an impoverished peasantry. They were partially implemented, but resulted in the <b>parcellation</b> of only 20% of the great agricultural estates. Poland endured numerous economic calamities and disruptions in the early 1920s, including waves of workers' strikes such as the 1923 Kraków riot. The German–Polish customs war, initiated by Germany in 1925, {{was one of the}} most damaging external factors that put a strain on Poland's economy. On the other hand, there were also signs of progress and stabilization, for example a critical reform of finances carried out by the competent government of Władysław Grabski, which lasted almost two years. Certain other achievements of the democratic period having to do with the management of governmental and civic institutions necessary to the functioning of the reunited state and nation were too easily overlooked. Lurking on the sidelines was a disgusted army officer corps unwilling to subject itself to civilian control, but ready to follow the retired Piłsudski, who was highly popular with Poles and just as dissatisfied with the Polish system of government as his former colleagues in the military.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn neuroimaging, multi-subject {{statistical}} analysis {{is an essential}} step, as it {{makes it possible to}} draw conclusions for the population under study. However, the lack of power in neuroimaging studies combined with the lack of stability and sensitivity of voxel-based methods may lead to non-reproducible results. A method designed to tackle this problem is Randomized Parcellation-Based Inference (RPBI), which has shown good empirical performance. Nevertheless, the use of an agglomerative clustering algorithm proposed in the initial RPBI formulation to build the <b>parcellations</b> entails a large computation cost. In this paper, we explore two strategies to speedup RPBI: Firstly, we use a fast clustering algorithm called Recursive Nearest Agglomeration (ReNA), to find the <b>parcellations.</b> Secondly, we consider the aggregation of p-values over multiple <b>parcellations</b> to avoid a permutation test. We evaluate their the computation time, as well as their recovery performance. As a main conclusion, we advocate the use of (permuted) RPBI with ReNA, as it yields very fast models, while keeping the performance of slower methods...|$|R

50|$|The initial explorations in {{macroscale}} human connectomics {{were done}} using either equally sized regions or anatomical regions with unclear {{relationship to the}} underlying functional organization of the brain (e.g. gyral and sulcal-based regions). While much {{can be learned from}} these approaches, it is highly desirable to parcellate the brain into functionally distinct parcels: brain regions with distinct architectonics, connectivity, function, and/or topography (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991). Accurate <b>parcellation</b> allows each node in the macroscale connectome to be more informative by associating it with a distinct connectivity pattern and functional profile. <b>Parcellation</b> of localized areas of cortex have been accomplished using diffusion tractography (Beckmann et al. 2009) and functional connectivity (Nelson et al. 2010) to non-invasively measure connectivity patterns and define cortical areas based on distinct connectivity patterns. Such analyses may best be done on a whole brain scale and by integrating non-invasive modalities. Accurate whole brain <b>parcellation</b> may lead to more accurate macroscale connectomes for the normal brain, which can then be compared to disease states.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} decade or so, there has been a very clear {{transition}} in many countries throughout the world from a graphical cadastre and/or relatively non-accurate digital cadastre toward an accurate coordinate based legal cadastre. Aiming at defining accurately the turning points position of the cadastral sub-division based on current data without the need to re-measure the cadastral entities, motivates the development of new algorithms and approaches suitable to performing the task. Implementation on a nationwide level requires to first develop advanced mathematical algorithms and methods to process separate <b>parcellations</b> (cadastral blocks or mutation plans), and then additional algorithms and methods to combine the numerous separate <b>parcellations</b> into a cadastral continuity maintaining rigid topological compatibility.

40|$|We present group eight {{resolutions of}} brain <b>parcellations</b> for {{clusters}} generated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance images for 99 cognitively normal elderly persons and 129 patients with mild cognitive impairment, pooled from four independent datasets. This dataset was generated {{as part of}} the following study: Common Effects of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment on Resting-State Connectivity Across Four Independent Studies (Tam et al., 2015) [1]. The brain <b>parcellations</b> have been registered to both symmetric and asymmetric MNI brain templates and generated using a method called bootstrap analysis of stable clusters (BASC) (Bellec et al., 2010) [2]. We present two variants of these <b>parcellations.</b> One variant contains bihemisphereic parcels (4, 6, 12, 22, 33, 65, 111, and 208 total parcels across eight resolutions). The second variant contains spatially connected regions of interest (ROIs) that span only one hemisphere (10, 17, 30, 51, 77, 199, and 322 total ROIs across eight resolutions). We also present maps illustrating functional connectivity differences between patients and controls for four regions of interest (striatum, dorsal prefrontal cortex, middle temporal lobe, and medial frontal cortex).

40|$|We readdress the {{diffusion}} tractography {{problem in a}} global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers {{a number of important}} benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based <b>parcellations,</b> allowing <b>parcellations</b> of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity...|$|R

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{suffers from a}} degradation in quantitative accuracy due to a phenomenon known as the partial volume effect (PVE). The effects are due to the limited spatial resolution of the scanner. Methods that correct for PVEs are known as partial volume correction (PVC) techniques and are either data-driven or make use of anatomical information from other modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This thesis reports investigations into PVC techniques for improving the quantification of brain amyloid PET tracers. These tracers image amyloid plaque aggregation in-vivo, which is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. An extension to existing anatomy-based PVC methods is reported. Region-based voxelwise (RBV) correction {{has been shown to}} reduce PVE-induced regional bias and variance when compared to commonly applied PVC techniques. This has been proven in phantom studies and observed in clinical data. In addition, RBV has been used to demonstrate that white matter variability exists in two different amyloid tracers. This finding has implications for the application of PVC in amyloid imaging and also how scans should be normalised. Alternative reference regions were investigated in two amyloid PET tracers. The brain stem, in combination with PVC, was found to result in the strongest agreement between tracers. Anatomy-based PVC techniques rely on <b>parcellations</b> of structural images. These <b>parcellations</b> are not necessarily representative of the PET data. A further extension to RBV is proposed which iteratively modifies the <b>parcellations</b> to find an optimal PVC in terms of the observed PET data. This novel technique reduces quantification errors due to PET-MR mismatch and has the potential to provide an additional parameter of ‘functional volume change’ in longitudinal studies...|$|R
40|$|Spatial gene {{expression}} profiles provide a novel means of exploring the structural {{organization of the}} brain. Computational analysis of these patterns is made possible by genome-scale mapping of the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse brain in the Allen Brain Atlas. Here we describe methodology used to explore the spatial structure of {{gene expression}} patterns across a set of 3041 genes chosen {{on the basis of}} consistency across experimental observations (N = 2). The analysis was performed on smoothed, co-registered 3 D expression volumes for each gene obtained by aggregating cellular resolution image data. Following dimensionality and noise reduction, voxels were clustered according to similarity of expression across the gene set. We illustrate the resulting <b>parcellations</b> of the mouse brain for different numbers of clusters (K) and quantitatively compare these <b>parcellations</b> with a classically-defined anatomical reference atlas at different levels of granularity, revealing a high degree of correspondence. These observations suggest that spatial localization of gene expression offers substantial promise in connecting knowledge at the molecular level with higher-level information about brain organization.

40|$|Cytoarchitectonical {{brain mapping}} is of growing {{interest}} {{as a powerful}} tool for localization of activated brain regions in functional neuroimaging. Mapping of neurotransmitter receptors can provide novel molecular and functionally relevant information to the available cytoarchitectonical brain maps, because receptors are key molecules of neurotransmission. This review highlights the relation between cytoarchitectonical <b>parcellations</b> and the regionally inhomogeneous distribution of receptors. It will demonstrate the potential of receptor mapping for novel and functionally relevant insights into the regional organization of the human cortex. Mapping of a single receptor type can already reveal borders of functionally and cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical regions. The combined mapping of various receptors in each cortical area (receptor fingerprint) represents the balance between different neurotransmitter systems and often reveals hitherto unknown <b>parcellations.</b> Different brain regions are identified as parts of distinct functional systems. Receptor mapping of the human brain, particularly multireceptor mapping, provides a novel and multimodal view of its anatomical, functional and molecular organization. It reveals organizational principles of the segregation of cortical and subcortical structures. It improves our understanding of the brain's architecture beyond the limits of cytoarchitectonics and serves as a basis for clinical and pharmacological studies of brain diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{striatum}} {{is involved}} in many different aspects of behaviour, reflected by the variety of cortical areas that provide input to this structure. This input is topographically organized {{and is likely to}} result in functionally specific signals. Such specificity can be examined using functional clustering approaches. Here, we propose a Bayesian model-based functional clustering approach applied solely to resting state striatal functional MRI timecourses to identify intrinsic striatal functional modules. Data from two sets of ten participants were used to obtain <b>parcellations</b> and examine their robustness. This stable clustering was used to initialize a more constrained model in order to obtain individualized <b>parcellations</b> in 57 additional participants. Resulting cluster time courses were used to examine functional connectivity between clusters and related {{to the rest of the}} brain in a GLM analysis. We find six distinct clusters in each hemisphere, with clear inter-hemispheric correspondence and functional relevance. These clusters exhibit functional connectivity profiles that further underscore their homologous nature and are consistent with existing notions on segregation and integration in parallel cortico-basal ganglia loops. Our findings suggest that multiple territories within both the affective and motor regions can be distinguished solely using resting state functional MRI from these regions...|$|R

50|$|The parcels {{resulting}} from the <b>parcellation</b> plans were entered in the Land Registers and came to be traded {{on the open market}} in Israel and also abroad. At that time great importance was attached to the redemption of the land and for that reason many parcels were bought by the Jews of Europe, USA and South Africa, with the assistance of public leaders who were harnessed to the task on visiting Jewish communities abroad. Thus, for example, Dr Haim Kugel, who {{went on to become the}} first Mayor of Holon, helped in the land redemption when he visited the Jewish community in South Africa. For that reason there are still many owners (the heirs of the original owners) of land within the boundaries of the scheme who are non-residents.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space - physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→sports facilities) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called “sport scape”. In movement, straight lines {{and the culture of}} the streamline were confronted by mazes and labyrinthine structures, by patterns of fractal geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the <b>parcellation</b> of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003).

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the generators of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is important for understanding brain processes. Since the inverse problem has no unique solution, additional knowledge or assumptions are needed. Often, results from other anatomical or functional measurement modalities are difficult to interpret directly in terms of EEG source strengths, but they provide valuable information about the functional similarity between brain regions, for example, in form of <b>parcellations.</b> We propose a novel approach to the incorporation of such <b>parcellations</b> as priors into the {{reconstruction of}} distributed source current densities from EEG. Two algorithms are described, based on a surface-constrained LORETA (Low Resolution Electromagnetic TomogrAphy) approach. The first, patchLORETA 1, uses both topological neighborhood and prior information to define smoothness, while the second, patchLORETA 2, neglects topological neighborhood. Computer simulations, using a smooth reconstruction surface on the brain envelope, reveal {{important aspects of the}} algorithms' performance, in particular the influences of noise and incongruence between measurements and prior information. It turns out that patchLORETA 1 makes efficient use of the provided prior information {{and at the same time}} is quite robust towards faulty priors as well as noise. The algorithms are also tested on the localization of the sources of event-related potentials. Here, both the smooth brain and folded cortical surfaces serve as reconstruction spaces. We find that patchLORETA 1 becomes ineffective on the folded cortex, while patchLORETA 2 yields plausible results. We also discuss the extension of the proposed algorithms to other types of priors and propose ways to overcome shortcomings of the current implementation...|$|R
