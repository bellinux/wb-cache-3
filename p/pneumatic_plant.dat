40|$|In view of {{the limited}} land {{available}} for new development in Malta, 20 -year old, two-storey terraced houses are today making way for apartment blocks, typically 5 floors in height, including a number of basement parking levels. This calls for additional civil works beyond simply building the plot, namely involving demolition and excavation below ground level. The new development is sandwiched between two existing terraced houses or similar blocks, thus any excavations are bound to adversely affect neighbouring property to some magnitude. Buildings are constructed in load bearing masonry walls with reinforced concrete slabs having a simple bearing on masonry walls. A soft storey is often introduced to satisfy parking or commercial requirements. This heavy form of construction lacking flexibility is prone to cracking. Studies suggest that blasting, piling, pneumatic machinery and heavy vehicles’ road traffic cause ground-borne vibrations. These typically translate into intolerable noise levels, even if claimed as only temporary. Tolerance limits vanish when nominal superficial cosmetic cracks develop into structural damage to neighbours’ property. These {{points to the need}} to assess and regulate the allowable noise and vibration levels in urban areas in order to curtail noise levels, thus preventing unnecessary neighbourhood disturbance, and ultimately structural damage. Through fieldwork on five building sites and empirical studies this paper investigates noise and vibration levels generated from site excavations using standard <b>pneumatic</b> <b>plant.</b> Results already indicate that values obtained are well within established International Standards, however complaints still arise. These stem from cosmetic or serious structural damage to neighbouring property. Currently, in Malta there is no control on the permissible vibration levels or allowable noise levels for such sites. The paper goes on to recommend the allowable limits for noise levels generated from ground-borne vibrations. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Considerable work has been performed on the mechanisms of attrition in fluidized beds; hence, they are well understood. On the other hand, there are fewer correlations {{that can be used to}} predict the attrition rate in pneumatic transport and spouted beds. In this study, polymethyl methacrylates particles were attrited in a <b>pneumatic</b> transport pilot <b>plant</b> and the experimental attrition rate was determined. The same particles were also used in a spouted bed with a sonic attrition jet and the attrition rate was measured. Finally, a fluidized bed correlation was applied to the spouted bed and a model was used to determine whether the attrition mechanism in pneumatic transport can be related to the attrition mechanism in the spouted bed...|$|R

Choice and efficiency system work of {{pneumatic transport}}ation depends of the physical – chemical characteristics of ash. Through modernization of unit 5 of thermal power plant Tuzla it will be built new electrofilter facility. New pneumatic system of ash transport will be built under electrofilter hoppers. Most of ash (80 - 90 %) is extracted in electrofilters. Rest of the ash is extracted under concave part of boiler, under air heater and water preheater, and under chimney. Europe standards allowed max. 50 mg/Nm 3 of ash in gas smoke on the exit of the thermal power chimney, so that electrofilters must provide it. Pneumatic transport system works automatically and it's simple for work. This system is proved to work in many thermal power plants.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the most important}} problems in ceramic industrial processes is the atomized slip conveying. Currently conveyor belts pick up the material from the bottom of spray dryer and they rise up it to stocking silos. By conveyor belts, the atomized slip crosses the working environment, so fine particles spread out causing dust pollution and generating dangers for workers' health (silicosis). The paper describes an innovative atomized slip pneumatic conveying to solve this problem. The software simulator "TPSimWin" is able to foresee thermo-hygrometric and fluid-dynamical parameters that give the characteristics request by the specific working process. The attention of this paper will be focused on fluid­-dynamical characteristics of the pneumatic conveying: both solid maximum conveying speed and speed gradient (i. e. the variation of solid's speed, in m/s, for unit length of pipe), need to be limited to guarantee wholeness of product. So the TPSimWin Software gives the necessary solid dynamic information to design correctly the <b>pneumatic</b> conveying <b>plant.</b> The outputs it gives are diagrams that show, step by step along the pipeline, the behaviour of air speed, solid speed, solid speed gradient and air pressure. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce an innovative solution for the transport of atomized slip, taking in consideration the critical problem of material degradation and showing a solution to solve it. A method to ensure and to monitor thermo-hygrometric characteristics will be described in a second following paper. ej 201...|$|R
