5000|$|... 331 species use the flyway.Seven sites {{along the}} route have over a million birds.About 25 species come from the far eastern Paleartic or even from Alaska.These include the {{northern}} wheatear, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and barn swallow.The <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> is the most numerous of the birds migrating along this route, accounting for 15.8% {{of the total number}} of passerines and near-passerines.Raptors such as the steppe buzzard also migrate along the flyway in large numbers.|$|R
5000|$|Before the English {{name was}} {{standardised}} to <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> by William Yarrell in 1843, it was sometimes called [...] "willow wren".|$|R
40|$|Plumage {{constitutes}} a significant {{component of the}} somatic investment of birds. A detailed investigation of feathers and moult can help to uncover trade-offs involved in somatic investment decisions, the sources {{of some of the}} costs birds have to pay and the potential fitness consequences. We used micro-computed tomography imaging to study the second moment of area, a structural parameter that is one determinant of bending stiffness and the cortex volume of flight feather shafts of two sister taxa, the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> Phylloscopus trochilus, a migratory species with two annual moults, and the chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, a migrant with one annual post-nuptial moult. Juvenile and adult <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and chiffchaff feathers, all grown on the breeding grounds, are structurally very similar to each other. <b>Willow</b> <b>warbler</b> feathers grown during moult on the wintering grounds, however, have a significantly higher second moment of area and a significantly larger cortex volume than all the other feather types. We discuss the possibility that the seasonal variability of <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> feathers may be an adaptive structural reflection of a moult–migration strategy that has allowed this species to occupy large breeding and wintering range...|$|R
50|$|The {{northeast}} {{forest is}} also home to a great variety of species and contains an abundance of common redpoll, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> Lapland longspur, bluethroat and redwing.|$|R
50|$|The {{green warbler}} {{alternatively}} named green <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> or green leaf warbler (Phylloscopus nitidus) is a leaf warbler {{found in the}} Caucasus Mountains in southcentral Europe.|$|R
50|$|Birdlife {{includes}} <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> chiff-chaff, blackcap and {{the great}} spotted woodpecker. Some species of snail, fly and beetle are indicators of ancient woodland. A bat box scheme operates.|$|R
50|$|More than 230 {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} along the river valley including eagle-owl, red grouse, stonechat, whinchat, golden plover, pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler, common sandpiper, grey wagtail, dipper, tawny owl, sparrowhawk, greater spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, treecreeper and, in wetter places, snipe and woodcock, chiffchaff, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> garden warbler, and twite.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the many}} bird {{species in the}} reserve are the chaffinch, the common {{blackbird}} and the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler.</b> The Arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis) and the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) also nest there.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} in the cemetery include jay, robin redbreast, green woodpecker, long-tailed tit, goldcrest, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and linnet. It {{is also home to}} the ubiquitous grey squirrel, as well as many species of fungi.|$|R
50|$|Felton Common {{is a local}} {{nature reserve}} which {{consists}} of open calcareous grassland with scrub and bracken. There are birds including kestrel, sky lark, song thrush, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> spotted flycatcher and several species of invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|In all 468 {{species of}} birds have been observed. Of these 256 are nesting species. The most common {{breeding}} birds are the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> common chaffinch, and redwing. The Whooper swan is Finland’s national bird.|$|R
50|$|On 22 September 2002 {{the first}} lanceolated warbler (Locustella lanceolata) {{recorded}} on the Isles of Scilly was found during {{a search for}} migrant birds. Also seen was two sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) and four <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus trochilus).|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{variation}} {{is often used}} to infer the demographic history of species, but sometimes the complexity of species history can make such inference difficult. The <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> Phylloscopus trochilus, shows substantially less geographical variation than the chiffchaff, Phylloscopus collybita, both in morphology and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) divergence. We therefore predicted that the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> should harbour less nuclear DNA diversity than the chiffchaff. We analysed sequence data obtained from multiple samples of willow warblers and chiffchaffs for the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and four nuclear genes. We confirmed that the mtDNA diversity among willow warblers is low (π = 0. 0021). Sequence data from three nuclear genes (CHD-Z, AFLP-WW 1 and MC 1 R) not linked to the mitochondria demonstrated unexpectedly high nucleotide diversity (π values of 0. 0172, 0. 0141 and 0. 0038) in the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> on average higher than the nucleotide diversity for the chiffchaff (π values of 0. 0025, 0. 0017 and 0. 0139). In willow warblers, Tajima's D analyses showed that the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep affecting the maternally inherited genes. The large nuclear diversity seen within willow warblers is not compatible with processes of neutral evolution occurring in a population with a constant population size, unless the long-term effective population size has been very large (Ne > 106). We suggest that the contrasting patterns of genetic diversity in the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> may reflect a more complex evolutionary history, possibly including historical demographic fluctuations or historical male-biased introgression of nuclear genes from a differentiated population of Phylloscopus warblers...|$|R
50|$|The loch is {{eutrophic}} and {{is surrounded}} by a wide wetland margin that dries out progressively towards the surrounding pastures. Animals found at the site include <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus trochilus) are present, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), meadow brown, (Maniola jurtina), and small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae).|$|R
50|$|The <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus trochilus) is a {{very common}} and {{widespread}} leaf warbler which breeds throughout northern and temperate Europe and Asia, from Ireland east to the Anadyr River basin in eastern Siberia. It is strongly migratory, with {{almost all of the}} population wintering in Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
40|$|Capsule: Use of LiDAR data {{identified}} suitable <b>Willow</b> <b>Warbler</b> habitat {{based on}} mean vegetation height. This habitat model provided maps of distribution and occupation of suitable habitat. Aims: To identify habitat associations in woods with different vegetation structure and management systems {{during a period}} of low <b>Willow</b> <b>Warbler</b> populations. Methods: Locations of all Willow Warblers were mapped during the breeding season in three woods of contrasting management; recent low intervention, actively coppiced woodland and high forest with clearfells. Height profile models of each wood were derived from airborne LiDAR. The mean vegetation height at locations with Willow Warblers and a sample {{from the rest of the}} wood were used to produce models of optimum habitat and breadth of habitat occupied in each wood. The habitat model was then used to produce maps of suitable habitat. Results: The habitat models did not differ between woods, with highest probability of <b>Willow</b> <b>Warbler</b> occurrence in mean vegetation heights of 3. 7 m to 5. 3 m. Habitat of heights 6 to 11 m appeared less suitable, being only partly occupied. Habitat maps showed that habitat of suitable height was only occupied when it occurred as large patches; smaller patches (mostly < 0. 5 ha) and edges along rides and fields were not used. Conclusion: The use of LiDAR derived measures of vegetation height identified areas of suitable habitat for <b>Willow</b> <b>Warbler.</b> <b>Willow</b> Warblers occupied areas of low mean vegetation height either as early successional or open canopy woodland in all woods. Height-based habitat maps can identify areas of suitable habitat within larger expanses of heterogeneous woodland and are a potentially useful tool in assessing changes in extent of what are often temporary patches of habitat. ...|$|R
5|$|This warbler {{gets its}} name from its simple {{distinctive}} song, a repetitive cheerful chiff-chaff. This song {{is one of the}} first avian signs that spring has returned. Its call is a hweet, less disyllabic than the hooeet of the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> or hu-it of the western Bonelli's warbler.|$|R
50|$|Otters, red kites, common buzzards, peregrines and hen {{harriers}} can {{be found}} here together {{with a number of}} Welsh Mountain Ponies, and adder, badger, blackcap, Dartford warbler, fallow deer, nightingale, nightjar, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> and woodcock. The site holds a population of rosy marsh moth, a very rare species in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The main summer {{breeding}} birds {{seen on the}} reserve include common tern, little ringed plover, oystercatcher and many more. Summer warblers seen on the reserve include sedge warbler, reed <b>warbler,</b> whitethroat, chiffchaff, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and grasshopper warbler. Coot are a common breeder on the reserve but are often less successful.|$|R
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a patchwork of fields, intersected by overgrown hedgerows, narrow strips of woodland and small streams. There {{are a number of}} magnificent old oaks, and breeding birds include sparrowhawk, stock dove, bullfinch, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and chaffinch. There are also a number of common butterflies and the uncommon chimney sweeper moth.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{well suited}} to birds of prey, snipe and curlew. <b>Willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> tawny owl, {{chaffinch}} have been recorded and roe deer are present, together with common lizard and frog. Botanically the site is dominated by sphagnum mosses and heathers with the carnivorous sundew commonly encountered. The roe deer have prevented regeneration of the areas of woodland.|$|R
40|$|We {{still have}} limited {{knowledge}} about the underlying genetic mechanisms that enable migrating species of birds to navigate the globe. Here we make {{an attempt to get}} insight into the genetic architecture controlling this complex innate behaviour. We contrast the gene expression profiles of two closely related songbird subspecies with divergent migratory phenotypes. In addition to comparing differences in migratory strategy we include a temporal component and contrast patterns between breeding adults and autumn migrating juvenile birds of both subspecies. The two <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> subspecies, Phylloscopus trochilus trochilus and P. t. acredula, are remarkably similar both in phenotype and genotype and have a narrow contact zone in central Scandinavia. Here we used a microarray gene chip representing 23, 136 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata to identify mRNA level differences in <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> brain tissue in relation to subspecies and season...|$|R

50|$|It was {{formerly}} considered to comprise three subspecies, but P. i. humei and P. i. mandellii are now split {{as a separate}} species, Hume's leaf warbler P. humei, leaving P. inornatus monotypic. The two sister species differ slightly but consistently in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. Before the species was split, the names yellow-browed <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and inornate warbler were used by a few authors.|$|R
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|R
50|$|Intra-species {{recognition}} {{systems are}} often subtle. For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the chiffchaff from the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> by eye, {{and there is}} no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different songs of the male. Sometimes, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of frog, the males are not uncommonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.|$|R
