5|$|Plans for {{the town}} centre include greater <b>pedestrianisation</b> and an {{increase}} in size and number of retail units.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that <b>pedestrianisation</b> {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing traffic signals along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis. By 2017, this had been revised forward {{to the end of the}} following year.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 2008, the {{pavilion}} {{at the end}} of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire. Eleven fire engines and 80 firefighters could not contain the blaze, which is believed to have started in the north-east tower of the Pavilion. A competition was held to design a new pavilion, and the project was awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol. Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009, and it was scheduled to reopen in July 2010, after a £39 million rebuilding programme. After continuing problems and setbacks, with the pier not opening until a formal opening ceremony on 23 October 2010, the overall costs have reached £51 million. During the same period there was a £34 million redevelopment of the promenade, including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Pier Square. As part of the work, a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of flood prevention measures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pedestrianisation</b> of the car-park space {{outside the}} Centurion Pub.|$|E
25|$|Also one of {{the main}} {{shopping}} areas in the town, Chapel Street, has undergone a <b>pedestrianisation</b> scheme to be similar to parts of Liverpool city centre.|$|E
25|$|O'Connell Street – {{the main}} street in the town – was pedestrianised on 15 August 2006. Plans for the {{proposed}} redevelopment and paving of this street were publicly unveiled on 23 July 2008 in The Sligo Champion. The newspaper later revealed that people were not in favour of the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the street. The street was reopened to traffic in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} Metro stop and {{numerous}} local bus routes, the complex {{is one of}} the most important transport hubs in the North East. There are currently two Metro and 12 main line platforms seeing 13 million passengers annually, and in light of increasing patronage the main line station has undergone a major refurbishment to increase retail space and enhance the station environment including the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the portico.|$|E
25|$|Objective 1 {{investment}} in regeneration and public realm improvements {{has led to}} the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the town centre and the restoration of some buildings. Some local traders have argued that this has damaged trade {{due to a lack of}} access by taxis and the disabled. Car parking provision and pricing have also been a concern to retailers with calls for free or reduced-price parking to increase town centre visits.|$|E
25|$|The River Sherbourne runs under Coventry's city centre; {{the river}} was paved over during the {{rebuilding}} after the Second World War and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place from 2017 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it {{in parts of the}} city centre. In April 2012, the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Broadgate was completed.|$|E
25|$|The centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) {{is usually}} {{successful}} in Kadıköy in {{both local and}} national elections. Since the mid-1990s the mayor has been from the CHP. Former mayor S. Öztürk is often credited with the recent {{growth in the number}} of shopping and leisure areas around Kadıköy, especially since the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Bahariye Street, which many say has become the Kadıköy equivalent of İstiklal Avenue, including its nostalgic trams, on the European side of Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{an award-winning}} new bus station was {{constructed}} and traffic movements {{around the town}} centre were altered. Local committees, together with the council, started to use the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the town centre to its advantage, culminating in several fairs including Continental Markets, Celtic Festivals, a small Mardi-Gras, and seasonal markets and events. Bridgend Council estimated in 2009 that these events have brought 900,000 visitors to the town and generated around £53 million for the local economy.|$|E
25|$|Leatherhead {{is a town}} in Surrey, England on {{the right}} bank of the River Mole, and {{at the edge of}} the {{contiguous}} built-up area of London. Its local district is Mole Valley. Records exist of the place from Anglo Saxon England. It has a combined theatre and cinema, which is at the centre of the re-modelling following late 20th century <b>pedestrianisation.</b> The streets bypassing the town centre close and feature in the annual London-Surrey cycle classic.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the Penang state government, in {{collaboration}} with the Penang Island City Council and private parties, are intensifying efforts to improve <b>pedestrianisation</b> within George Town and promote Penang as the first cycling state in Malaysia. Dedicated cycling lanes have been marked throughout the city, while in 2016, LinkBike, a public bicycle-sharing system, was launched, making George Town the first city in Malaysia to operate such a system. Aside from LinkBike, a number of private companies are also marketing bicycle-rental services within the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, the University opened {{many more}} major buildings, {{such as the}} Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, Jessop West and the Information Commons. The Arts Tower building, the Students' Union and University House buildings, the Sheffield Bioincubator and University Health Centre were also refurbished. A new six-storey building, the Diamond, was opened on 28 September 2015. In February 2016, the {{university}} started to work with Sheffield City Council to transform public spaces around the campus. The £8million project includes building and improving <b>pedestrianisation,</b> crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus.|$|E
25|$|The only {{rail-based}} {{transportation system}} in George Town is the Penang Hill Railway, a funicular railway to {{the peak of}} Penang Hill. When completed in 1923, the railway, then utilising Swiss-made coaches, was considered an engineering feat of sorts. It underwent an extensive upgrading in 2010 and was reopened in early 2011.Within the city centre, efforts are being undertaken to promote <b>pedestrianisation</b> {{and the use of}} bicycles as a greener alternative transportation mode. Dedicated cycling lanes have been marked throughout the city and in 2016, George Town became the first Malaysian city to operate a public bicycle-sharing service, with the launch of LinkBike.|$|E
25|$|Established in the 12th century, Dudley Market is {{situated}} {{on a wide}} part of the High Street, and is a major shopping area for the town. It has undergone numerous developments in its history, including <b>pedestrianisation</b> in 1982, {{and the removal of}} 12th-century cobblestone paving. Other developments have included the addition of a new roof and toilet facilities, with the new ground level block having replaced underground toilets in the early 1990s. There are also three small shopping centres situated off the High Street: the Churchill Shopping Centre, the Trident Shopping Centre, and the Fountain Arcade.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other towns in south Buckinghamshire, Chesham historically {{was not well}} served by road transport links. The stage coach bypassed the town and, unlike Amersham, there were no turnpikes and consequently roads were poorly maintained. Significant change occurred in the post Second World War period {{with the opening of}} the M1 motorway. The A416 now runs through the town, from Amersham to Berkhamsted, and connects the town to the more recently upgraded A41. The A416 was diverted around the High Street and later upgraded to be dual-lane. Although these improvements enable more through traffic, traffic congestion has increased. Chesham's High Street was pedestrianised in 1990 and the benefits to the High Street have been felt ever since. Whilst some of the previous bustle has been lost, the impact of <b>pedestrianisation</b> has generally been positive.|$|E
25|$|André Labarrère, mayor from 1971 to 2006, worked {{towards a}} first step of the {{beautification}} of the city. Within its recent mandates, on the outskirts, the university was expanding and the Pau-Pyrénées {{was one of the}} first in France to develop a fibre-optic network, infrastructure offering a very high-speed internet access both to individuals and companies. New facilities were created, including sports, such as the Zénith de Pau}, the Palais des Sports, the Jaï Alaï, and the artificial whitewater arena. The city acquired an important centre of health. The racecourse and the airport (depending on CCI) were renovated. The centre of town also saw significant upheavals with the rehabilitation of the Palais Beaumont and the construction of a new private commercial centre named Centre Bosquet. Pau finally embarked on the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of its centre with the reconfiguration of its bus network, the renovation of the Place Clemenceau, the central square of Pau, and the modernisation of the Palais des Pyrénées, a new shopping centre in the city centre, near to the Place Clemenceau. New underground parking compensated for the removal of 400 parking spaces on the surface; also two underground car parks gained redesigned access. Finally, a media library was created in 2012 in the Les Halles quarter.|$|E
500|$|Since 1995 {{access to}} the Rows has been {{improved}} by a <b>pedestrianisation</b> scheme, which affects all the streets containing Rows. Most vehicles are prohibited from using the area between 08:00 and 18:00, although unloading is allowed until 10:30 and from 16:30. [...] Chester Rows are a major tourist attraction in the city because of their unique nature, their attractive appearance and the covered shopping they provide.|$|E
500|$|Plymouth has a post-war {{shopping}} {{area in the}} city centre with substantial <b>pedestrianisation.</b> At {{the west end of}} the zone inside a grade II listed building is the Pannier Market that was completed in 1959 – pannier meaning [...] "basket" [...] from French, so it translates as [...] "basket market". In terms of retail floorspace, Plymouth is ranked in the top five in the South West, and 29th nationally. Plymouth {{was one of the first}} ten British cities to trial the new Business Improvement District initiative. The Tinside Pool is situated at the foot of the Hoe and became a grade II listed building in 1998 before being restored to its 1930s look for £3.4million.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Automobile Club campaigned vigorously {{against the}} <b>pedestrianisation</b> proposal. A {{publicity}} campaign fronted by actress Diana Dors {{in favour of}} reopening the bridge was launched, whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet Robert Graves campaigned {{in support of the}} GLC's plan. Graves's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation, who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as [...] "sending a lot of students around to council flats [...] most people will sign anything without knowing what it is all about". A public enquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating a roadway only [...] wide, {{and with}} serious {{structural}} weaknesses, {{the bridge was}} ill-equipped {{to cope with the}} advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century. Despite the many calls for its demolition or <b>pedestrianisation,</b> the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs, and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced. The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life, making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London, except for the little-used Southwark Bridge. The bridge's condition is continuing to degrade as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the timber deck structure caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park.|$|E
500|$|Following the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Trafalgar Square, the Gallery is {{currently}} {{engaged in a}} masterplan to convert the vacated office space {{on the ground floor}} into public space. The plan will also fill in disused courtyards and make use of land acquired from the adjoining National Portrait Gallery in St Martin's Place, which it gave to the National Gallery in exchange for land for its 2000 extension. The first phase, the East Wing Project designed by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, opened to the public in 2004. This provided a new ground level entrance from Trafalgar Square, named in honour of Sir Paul Getty. The main entrance was also refurbished, and reopened in September 2005. Possible future projects include a [...] "West Wing Project" [...] roughly symmetrical with the East Wing Project, which would provide a future ground level entrance, and the public opening of some small rooms at the far eastern end of the building acquired as part of the swap with the National Portrait Gallery. This might include a new public staircase in the bow on the eastern façade. No timetable has been announced for these additional projects.|$|E
500|$|On 27 April 1944 Sir Patrick Abercrombie's Plan for Plymouth {{to rebuild}} the bomb-damaged city was published; it called for {{demolition}} {{of the few remaining}} pre-War buildings in the city centre to make way for their replacement with wide, parallel, modern boulevards aligned east–west linked by a north–south avenue (Armada Way) linking the railway station with the vista of Plymouth Hoe. A peripheral road system connecting the historic Barbican on the east and Union Street to the west determines the principal form of the city centre, even following <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the shopping centre in the late 1980s, and continues to inform the present 'Vision for Plymouth' developed by a team led by Barcelona-based architect David MacKay in 2003 which calls for revivification of the city centre with mixed-use and residential. In suburban areas, post-War prefabs had already begun to appear by 1946, and over 1,000 permanent council houses were built each year from 1951–57 according to the Modernist zoned low-density garden city model advocated by Abercrombie. By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, more than 13,500 of them permanent council homes and 853 built by the Admiralty. Plymouth is home to 28 parks with an average size of [...] Its largest park is Central Park, with other sizeable green spaces including Victoria Park, Freedom Fields Park, Alexandra Park, Devonport Park and the Hoe.|$|E
2500|$|The Holford plan is {{referenced}} in the short-form {{documentary film}} [...] "Goodbye, Piccadilly", {{produced by the}} Rank Organisation in 1967 {{as part of their}} Look at Life series when it was still seriously expected that Holford's recommendations would be acted upon. Piccadilly Circus has since escaped major redevelopment, apart from extensive ground-level <b>pedestrianisation</b> around its south side in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{plans to}} {{pedestrian}}ise {{of part of}} the Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat next to the Berlaymont. A new Place Schumanplein (currently the Schuman roundabout) {{would be one of}} three new pedestrian squares. Schuman would focus on [...] "policy and politics" [...] and Schuman station itself will be redesigned. Coverings over nearby motorways and railways would be extended to shield them from view. However, the planned <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the Schuman roundabout were cancelled in late 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, a £250 million {{regeneration}} {{plan for}} the town centre was announced, which will include the <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the road surrounding the shopping centre, {{and the creation of}} new cafés, bars and shops which will lead to 1,750 new jobs. The reason for this expansion is that the original [...] "centre" [...] was only ever a shopping place with no real heart (See Shropshire Star 3 June 2004). Since the [...] "centre" [...] closed early evening, there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was paid}} handsomely when on 7 July 2008, George Town was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, {{alongside}} Malacca. It is recognised as having [...] "a unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia". The newly elected Pakatan Rakyat state government also spearheaded the subsequent efforts {{to clean up}} of George Town, and improve traffic flow, <b>pedestrianisation,</b> cultural and environmental aspects. As a result, George Town was also ranked as the most liveable city in Malaysia, the eighth most liveable in Asia and the 62nd worldwide by ECA International in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Strøget (...) is a pedestrian, car free {{shopping}} area in Copenhagen, Denmark. This popular tourist attraction in {{the centre of}} town {{is one of the}} longest pedestrian shopping streets in Europe at 1.1km. Located at the centre of the old city of Copenhagen, it has long {{been one of the most}} high-profile streets in the city. The <b>pedestrianisation</b> of Strøget in 1962 marked the beginning a major change in the approach of Copenhagen to urban life; following the success of the initiative the city moved to place a much greater emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle access to the city at the expense of cars. This approach has in turn become internationally influential.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{expansion}} of the Irish economy in the 1990s, during the [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] years, Drogheda became one of the main secondary locations for people who work in Dublin to buy a house, as property prices in the capital became prohibitive for many first-time home buyers. This was aided by {{the expansion}} of transport infrastructure in the direction of Drogheda i.e. the Swords and Balbriggan bypasses, the Boyne River Bridge and the increased number of commuter trains serving the town. Partly as a result, the downtown area of Drogheda has redeveloped, and two large shopping centres have opened, while several national and international retailers have opened stores. In 2007 the partial <b>pedestrianisation</b> of the town's main street, West Street, was completed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} and the corporation {{did not allow}} the architects a free hand. The developers demanded a closed building with little natural light and rejected a more open, roof-lit, design. The corporation insisted on a bus station, market, car parking, an underground railway station, and provision for deck access to subsequent developments. Cannon Street was to be kept open with no shop frontages. Corporation Street and High Street were allowed shop fronts on the returns to Market Street. Market Street, a busy thoroughfare, had shop fronts as <b>pedestrianisation</b> was proposed, though this did not happen until 1981. The architects, developers, and city council did not communicate well. Display windows were forbidden {{on most of the}} external walls of the centre and were inside the centre. The architects realised that [...] "the brief [...] given... would produce a very introverted building. And we said this would not be attractive".|$|E
2500|$|The {{population}} {{more than}} doubled from 4000 to 9000 during the 19th century. As a consequence {{the centre of the}} town shifted to the east as shops, workshops and cottages sprung up along the High Street and Berkhampstead Road. [...] In the period after the Second World War the town centre was progressively redeveloped. In the 1960s St Mary's Way was constructed, rerouting the A416 around the congested High Street which avoided the need to widen the street, conserved its character and allowed for its <b>pedestrianisation</b> during the 1990s. Industrial development became centred on two areas. At {{the southern end of the}} town at Waterside which was the site of the first mills and factories in the 18th and 19th centuries there is a mixture of original and newly constructed industrial units and at the northern end along the Asheridge Vale there is a further development of generally small commercial business units.|$|E
2500|$|Newbury {{was chosen}} {{as an example of}} a small town that could be redeveloped {{following}} this pattern, with vehicles easily integrating into the urban scenery. But the report warned that the commitment and scale of work required would be hitherto unheard of. The concept was mainly ignored for 25 years until the A34 Newbury bypass was proposed, alongside extensive <b>pedestrianisation</b> and road changes within the urban areas. The new roads dramatically reduced the impact of motor vehicles on the town, especially heavy goods vehicles, and accompanied the reinvigoration of Newbury which had managed to retain its historic core. When completed in 1998 the actual bypass followed approximately the same route as the original proposal, but encountered such protest from so many quarters that all other UK road schemes were soon stalled. As a result, the government and Highways Agency changed its policies and assessment criteria to evenly balance predictions of schemes' environmental impact with their economic, community and safety benefits ...|$|E
2500|$|Until 2001, the pre-war {{houses in}} the {{historic}} centre of George Town was protected from urban development by the Rent Control Act, which prohibited landlords from arbitrarily raising rentals as a measure to provide affordable housing to the poor. Its eventual repeal visibly changed Penang's demographic pattern and economic activity; overnight appreciation of real estate prices forced tenants of multiple generations out of their heritage homes to the city's outskirts, where new townships were being developed. Unperturbed development of modern high-rises, usually in {{the expense of the}} heritage houses, also caused the dilapidation of parts of the city centre. These sparked concerns of the continued existence of Penang's collection of heritage houses (Southeast Asia's largest), leading to more vigorous conservation efforts.In 2008, George Town was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with Malacca. It was a recognition of the conservation efforts of the [...] "unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia". The subsequent cleaning up of George Town and other measures to improve traffic flow, <b>pedestrianisation,</b> cultural and environmental aspects by the newly elected Pakatan Rakyat state government also led to George Town being ranked Asia's 8th most liveable city by ECA International in 2010. The city's services sector has since been boosted by the private sector and an influx of foreign investors, who have converted shophouses within the UNESCO zone into trendy eateries, hotels and shops.|$|E
50|$|The busiest {{portion of}} the street had, since 2000, been pedestrianised all week long. However, the Traffic and Transport Committee of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council voted on 21 November 2013 to {{restrict}} the <b>pedestrianisation</b> to weekends and public holidays only, citing complaints from local residents. A {{survey conducted by the}} Home Affairs Department found that 80 per cent of residents and shop owners wanted to limit <b>pedestrianisation,</b> while most people questioned on the street wanted to keep the weekday <b>pedestrianisation.</b> In spite of criticism, the <b>pedestrianisation</b> hours were reduced to weekends only with effect from January 2014. Retail rents on the street subsequently dropped.|$|E
