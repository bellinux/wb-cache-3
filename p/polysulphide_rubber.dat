The most practical treatment for reducing the noise of present diesel engines is to replace the thin-section, noise-radiating components with constrained damping layers, where a viscoelastic layer is sandwiched between two elastic layers to give the composite panel high damping characteristics. The damping ability of such panels is highly dependent on dynamic shear properties of viscoelastic materials {{as well as on}} the selection of elastic materials. The damping shear properties of viscoelastic materials are highly dependent on frequency and temperature. Experimental data on the damping properties of viscoelastic materials are, so far, limited to a small low frequency range. The forced vibration non-resonant technique is adopted in the present investigation. Atest rig has been designed, built and developed to measure the dynamic shear properties of some visoelastic materials over a wide range of temperature (40 to 1000 C). These properties are also measured over a wide range of frequency (50 - 1500 Hz), covering part of the audio frequency range, in which the severity of engine noise occurs. <b>Polysulphide</b> <b>rubber</b> and ethylene propylene rubber have been tested. Their dynamic shear properties have been obtained, tabulated and plotted as functions of frequency and temperature. The effect of strain amplitude has been investigated and discussed. A new approach for an easy, fast and direct measurement of the loss shear modulus has been proposed. It has been found that both viscoelastic materials possess considerable damping, especially over the frequency range of 900 - 1500 Hz. The effect of strain amplitude was found negligible. The optimum design and damping ability of three layer composite panels have been investigated. The effects of elastic and viscoelastic material on the damping of these panels has been examined. Magnesium has been found to be a superior elastic material of those investigated. Aluminium is the next most suitable elastic material, with steel as the least suitable elastic material. <b>Polysulphide</b> <b>rubber</b> and ethylene propylene rubber have been found suitable for use in composite damping panels, but their relative attractiveness is strongly dependent on frequency and temperature...|$|E
40|$|Sometimes, {{there is}} a need for a {{material}} that has some properties of one polymer as well as some properties of another polymer. Instead of going back in to the laboratory and trying to synthesize a brand new polymer with all the needed Two binary blends were prepared, the components of the first were <b>polysulphide</b> <b>rubber</b> PSR and Epoxy resin EP, while the second was established from Epoxy resin and unsaturated polyester resin UPS for the weight ratios (0 %- 100 %). A study of the Mechanical properties including Tensile strength, and hardness and the thermal conductivity by using lee’s disk has been studied. Heat treatment has been done to all the blends at temperature of (50 o C, 75 oC, 110 oC and 220 oC). The mechanical showed in the blend behavior with respect to nature of material from hard brittle for low ratios of polysulphide, to tough and soft material in the high ratios of polysulphide. Hand lay- up technique was used to prepare four samples of composite materials, unified weight fraction of 30 % of short carbon fiber, the samples are: Epoxy(EPC), Unsaturated polyester(UPC), Binary blend (EP + PSR) with blending ratios (80 % EP / 20 % PSR) and binary blends (EP + UP) for blending ratio (40 % EP / 60 % UP). The sheets were left to solidify at room temperature(23 ± 2 o C). The mechanical tests were done on the composite materials and a thermal conductivity was done on all specimens at the same previously mentioned temperature. When comparing the thermal of composite materials based on mono polymer matrix and those of the composite materials based on polymeric blends matrices, it can be seen that composite materials blends matrix has improvement in the thermal conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Modification of an epoxy {{system with}} a {{conventional}} polysulphide polymer, while resulting in increased adhesion to difficult-to-bond substrates and improved durability, flexibility and impact resistance, also leads {{to a reduction in}} the epoxy glass transition temperature (T(g)), thereby lowering the upper service temperature, and low peel strength, limiting the material's application. The reduction in T(g) is due to reaction of the flexible, rubbery polysulphide into the epoxy/amine system, decreasing the overall rigidity of the matrix. However, if the polysulphide can be made to phase separate then these limitations may potentially be overcome. In this work the type of epoxy resin was kept constant and the effect of modifying the <b>polysulphide</b> polymer (<b>rubber</b> molecular weight, degree of branching, rubber end-group and level of rubber used) was investigated for systems cured with liquid amine or dicyandiamide curative. The new systems are shown to exhibit only a small reduction in the epoxy Tg while having improved peel strength and maintaining the greater lap shear strength expected of a polysulphide-modified material...|$|R
