50|$|Episiotomy, {{also known}} as <b>perineotomy,</b> is a {{surgical}} incision of the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall generally done by a midwife or obstetrician during second stage of labor to quickly enlarge the opening for the baby to pass through. The incision, which can be done at a 90 degree angle from the vulva towards the anus or at an angle from the posterior end of the vulva (medio-lateral episiotomy), is performed under local anesthetic (pudendal anesthesia), and is sutured after delivery.|$|E
40|$|Background: Perineal {{infection}} is an uncommon cause of non-obstetrical recto-vaginal fistula (RVF) which {{is associated with}} HIV infection. Cameroon (Central Africa) is in the fistula belt but infectious RVFs {{have not yet been}} deeply studied in the country. We therefore sought to determine the pattern of non-obstetric infectious RVF in Cameroon. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional and descriptive review of non-obstetric infectious RVFs managed at the Yaound and eacute; University Teaching Hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015. All complete files were included. The following data were retrieved: socio-demographics, characteristics of the RVF, management and outcome. Results: Five non-obstetrical and non-traumatic RVFs of which four were observed in HIV-infected patients were included. All those RVFs occurred spontaneously. The following predisposing factors were identified: perineal warts (one case out of five), perineal suppuration (two cases out of five), hemorrhoids (the HIV-negative patient), spinsterhood (all cases), unemployment (all cases). All HIV-patients were under anti-retroviral therapy (ART) with good immunological and clinical responses for three of them. Three of them underwent previous unsuccessful surgical cure. Management included ART, antibiotics and surgery. Surgical approaches were <b>perineotomy</b> alone or with martius' flap, procto-perineotomy or trans-vaginal advancement flap. Outcome was satisfactory for all HIV patients (closure of fistula and fecal continence). Conclusions: Local {{infection is}} a rare cause of RVF which was associated with HIV in our series. Combined treatment including antibiotics, HAART and surgery gave good results. [Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol 2016; 5 (7. 000) : 2239 - 2242...|$|E
40|$|Until the 1950 s, {{childbirth}} generally {{took place}} in the home. The proportion of hospital childbirths rose rapidly from the 1960 s, and from the 1990 s birth management associated with artificial medical intervention, the medicalization of birth, came to be seen as an issue. However, while childbirth in a birth center is one form of facility-based birth, as hospital birth is, since it offers the natural birth that women in childbirth seek, it is the opposite of birth with artificial medical interventions. I have implemented an interview survey with respect to the activities of Sakura Birth and women who have given birth there. It was clear that women about to give birth aspire to a natural birth without <b>perineotomy,</b> and that they are selecting Sakura Birth through information on the Internet or through word of mouth. The practicing midwives who are assisting in the birth are responding to the needs of these women for natural birth by inproving the quality of their midwifery and guidance skills, as well as continuing to provide services such as recording the baby 2 Ì† 7 s first cry and footprints immediately after the birth. Thus if we consider natural birth to be a form of consumer birth, then the "natural" birth mode becomes a commodity differentiated from "artificial" birth. The practicing midwife then becomes the provider of "natural birth" and various other mother-and-child services, and it is also possible to view this as a birth center business strategy in the present era of falling birthrates...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cloacal exstrophy is {{a complex}} and rare {{congenital}} malformation. Because of improvements in medicine, operative techniques, and perioperative management the survival rates are now approaching 100 %. Currently, treatment is focused on improving quality of life. Since 1974, we encountered 20 patients with cloacal exstrophy in our hospital. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate our clinical experience and outcome during the last 39 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of the medical records was performed. We evaluated anatomical status, phenotype and genotype at birth, subsequent surgical treatment and current gastrointestinal, urinary, spinal, genital, and gender status and outcome. RESULTS: The records of all 20 patients who were treated in our center were included in this study. Of the 20 patients, 18 were primary patients, 2 referred. Six patients died within the first year of life. Median age of the surviving 14 patients was 25 years (range, 4 - 39 years) at time of evaluation. At the last follow-up, 11 patients had an endileostomy or endcolostomy. Three patients had a pull-through; two of them were continent for feces. Two patients were continent for urine; one with a sinus urogenitalis and one after urethra reconstruction. Eleven patients are incontinent; six of them had an incontinent urinary deviation (Bricker deviation). Of the other five incontinent patients, two had a urethral reconstruction, one vesicovaginal anastomosis, one <b>perineotomy,</b> and one epispadias bladder. Urinary continence was unknown in one patient. Of the surviving patients, nine have 46 XY karyotype and five 46 XX karyotype. Initially, six XY patients underwent external genital reconstruction with reassignment to female gender; however, one died postoperatively. One declared to feel like a man at age of 15 years. Remaining four XY patients underwent male external genital reconstruction. All XX patients underwent vagina or vulva reconstruction, except for one who still has aplasia vaginae. All patients were born with varying types of spinal dysraphism. DISCUSSION: Despite medical efforts and development in treatment and support, satisfaction in outcome of cloacal exstrophy remains a challenge. Although reconstruction may be very difficult, male genital reconstruction in 46 XY patients has been given preference for more than a decade. A specialized multidisciplinary team should provide lifelong colorectal, urological, sexual, and psychosocial support to these patients, taking into account their age and phase of life...|$|E
