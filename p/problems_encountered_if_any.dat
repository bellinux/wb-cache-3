40|$|We {{conducted}} a prospective investigation using the visual analog scale (VAS) method {{to evaluate the}} pharmacy experience and lectures of the Division of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University. The students were instructed to evaluate their understanding and attainment of the pharmacy experience and lectures. The preceptors then evaluated the students in their charge based on their understanding and attainment of the pharmacy experience. Comparisons {{before and after the}} pharmacy experience and for each student-preceptor pair were performed with the aim of solving <b>problems</b> <b>encountered,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> for improvement. For most of the cases, scores of, self-evaluation by the students for after the pharmacy experience were higher than those for before, indicating that the pharmacy practice had been effective. The student-preceptor comparison showed that the students gave themselves higher scores for understanding and the preceptors gave their students higher scores for skills. This shows that the students felt that they had gained much knowledge of pharmacy but thought that they needed further training to improve their practical skills. In the self-evaluations after the course of lectures but prior to the pharmacy practice, the overall degree of understanding was 60 %, however, this decreased after the pharmacy experience. Thus, the students were not able to retain the knowledge gained during the lectures {{until the end of the}} pharmacy experience, suggesting a need to review the content of the lectures and to rearrange schedules...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{survival}} of a newborn {{or a child}} presenting with ambiguous genitalia depends upon the timely diagnosis and institution of appropriate medical care. We undertook this study with the aim to determine if appropriate clinical and confirmatory diagnosis was arrived on time and if the treatment instituted was relevant and satisfactory. Methods: All children who were evaluated for ambiguous genitalia under the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology over the preceding 18 years were invited for a review. Data including time taken to make a clinical diagnosis, time taken to confirm the diagnosis, reasons for delay if any, and appropriateness of the sex assigned for rearing and treatment instituted were collected from the charts. Patients were evaluated for adequacy of response to treatment, compliance, <b>problems</b> <b>encountered</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> and subjective parental satisfaction. Results: A total of 165 children were diagnosed to have conditions with ambiguous genitalia and were called for a review. 33 children attended the review. 15 were being raised as boys and 18 as girls. 12 children had virilising congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 6 had cryptorchidism, 6 had hypospadias, 3 had complete and 1 had partial testicular feminisation, 2 had mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD), 2 had hypogonadism and 1 was a true hermaphrodite. An appropriate clinical diagnosis was made in 30 childrenon the day one and a final confirmatory diagnosis was made within a month in 23.

As a general rule, methods to extract the useful signal from that received by the detector are well known and give good results.

However, the data reduction software has been changed for the following reasons. <b>Problems</b> are <b>encountered</b> <b>if</b> the container of the sample gives a spurious signal or if the scattering angle is so large that its cosine cannot be approximated by 1.

40|$|A {{proposed}} hybrid (internal-combustion/ electric) automotive {{engine system}} would include as its internal-combustion subsystem, a modified Miller-cycle engine with regenerative air preheating and with autoignition {{like that of}} a Diesel engine. The fuel would be ethanol and would be burned lean to ensure complete combustion. Although the proposed engine would have a relatively low power-to-weight ratio compared to most present engines, this would not be the <b>problem</b> <b>encountered</b> <b>if</b> this engine were used in a non-hybrid system since hybrid systems require significantly lower power and thus smaller engines than purely internal-combustion-engine-driven vehicles. The disadvantage would be offset by the advantages of high fuel efficiency, low emission of nitrogen oxides and particulate pollutants, and the fact that ethanol is a renewable fuel. The original Miller-cycle engine, named after its inventor, was patented in the 1940 s and is the basis of engines used in some modern automobiles, but is not widely known. In somewhat oversimplified terms, the main difference between a Miller-cycle engine and a common (Otto-cycle) automobile engine is that the Miller-cycle engine has a longer expansion stroke while retaining the shorter compression stroke. This is accomplished by leaving the intake valve open for part of the compression stroke, whereas in the Otto cycle engine, the intake valve is kept closed during the entire compression stroke. This greater expansion ratio makes it possible to extract more energy from the combustion process without expending more energy for compression. The net result is greater efficiency. In the proposed engine, the regenerative preheating would be effected by running the intake air through a heat exchanger connected to the engine block. The regenerative preheating would offer two advantages: It would ensure reliable autoignition during operation at low ambient temperature and would help to cool the engine, thereby reducing the remainder of the power needed for cooling and thereby further contributing to efficiency. An electrical resistance air preheater might be needed to ensure autoignition at startup and during a short warmup period. Because of the autoignition, the engine could operate without either spark plugs or glow plugs. Ethanol burns relatively cleanly and {{has been used as a}} motor fuel since the invention of internal-combustion engines. However, the energy content of ethanol per unit weight of ethanol is less than that of Diesel fuel or gasoline, and ethanol has a higher heat of vaporization. Because the Miller cycle offers an efficiency close to that of the Diesel cycle, burning ethanol in a Miller-cycle engine gives about as much usable output energy per unit volume of fuel as does burning gasoline in a conventional gasoline automotive engine. Because of the combination of preheating, running lean, and the use of ethyl alcohol, the proposed engine would generate less power per unit volume than does a conventional automotive gasoline engine. Consequently, for a given power level, the main body of the proposed engine would be bulkier. However, because little or no exhaust cleanup would be needed, the increase in bulk of the engine could be partially offset by the decrease in bulk of the exhaust system. The regenerative preheating also greatly reduces the external engine cooling requirement, and would translate to reduced engine bulk. It may even be possible to accomplish the remaining cooling of the engine by use of air only, eliminating the bulk and power consumption of a water cooling system. The combination of a Miller-cycle engine with regenerative air preheating, ethyl alcohol fuel, and hybrid operation could result in an automotive engine system that satisfies the need for a low pollution, high efficiency, and simple engine with a totally renewable fuel...|$|R
