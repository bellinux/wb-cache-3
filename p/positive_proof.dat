Correspondence ensued with the American authorities as to Lomax' suspected membership of the Communist Party, though no <b>positive</b> <b>proof</b> is found on this file. The Service took the view that Lomax' work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attaché, and that while his views (as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers) were undoubtedly left wing, {{there was no need for}} any specific action against him.|$|E
