25|$|These discoveries soon led to {{the carbon}} print, gum bichromate, and other <b>photographic</b> <b>printing</b> {{processes}} based on differential hardening. Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye. Some processes depended on the hardening only, {{in combination with the}} differential absorption of certain dyes by the hardened or unhardened areas. Because some of these processes allowed the use of highly stable dyes and pigments, such as carbon black, prints with an extremely high degree of archival permanence and resistance to fading from prolonged exposure to light could be produced.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} lower {{high school}} in Tábor, the boy was particularly interested in chemigraphy (a method of printing photographs). In 1891 (at the age of 14) he started {{to work as a}} trainee in the polygraphic factory of Jan Vilím in Prague. After two years, in 1893, he changed jobs to work as a photographer in the studio of František Krátký in Kolín. Krátký's studio specialized in stereoscopy and publishing photographs as educational tools, allowing Josef Jindřich to further develop his interests in <b>photographic</b> <b>printing.</b> His certificate of a completed apprenticeship, written in 1906 by his father Ignác Šechtl, also certifies his studies in the Šechtl & Voseček studios in the period 1892–1895, apparently in parallel with his jobs in Prague and Kolín. At 22, after serving in the army (1898–1899), he started work in the affiliated Šechtl & Voseček studio in Černovice u Tábora, a town near Tábor. At this time his father Ignác was travelling with his cinematograph (motion pictures), and the Tábor studio was run by Ignác's partner Jan Voseček.|$|E
500|$|Kanae felt {{disappointed}} at hand-printing's gradual loss {{of prestige}} in Japan; to revive interest {{he wrote a}} four-part series of articles in 1907 for the art magazine Mizu-e examing {{a wide variety of}} printing media and techniques. [...] Kanae, Hakutei, and a former art-school classmate of Kanae's, , founded the monthly magazine Hōsun. whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907. [...] It was patterned on such European magazines as Cocorico, Jugend, Simplicissimus. [...] The contents were primarily literature, criticism, and art cartoons, and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design. [...] They printed the magazine on fine paper at an unusually large size and mixed colour reproduction with black-and-white. [...] Kanae's contributions included his own prints, haiku poetry, and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others. [...] Kanae's former engraving teacher Sakurai Torakichi furnished the <b>photographic</b> <b>printing</b> plates. [...] The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae. [...] The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores. [...] It sold well, and the circle of contributors grew, as did the page count, which expanded to sixteen.|$|E

60|$|Enough {{was then}} seen {{to show that}} the subject was of real importance, and I {{resolved}} to investigate it; all the more so, as the modern processes of <b>photographic</b> <b>printing</b> would enable the evidence of such results as might be arrived at, to be presented to the reader on an enlarged and easily legible form, and in a trustworthy shape. Those that are put forward in the following pages, admit of considerable extension and improvement, and it is only the fact that an account of them seems useful, which causes me to delay no further before submitting what has thus far been attained, to the criticism of others.|$|E
