40|$|AbstractThe current {{practice}} of Injera (Spongy flat bread) baking {{is based on}} energy sources such as fire wood and fossil fuels, which are both the main causes for environmental pollution and depletion of forest resources. The aim {{of this research is}} to propose a new type of baking system where solar thermal energy is used as a power source. The possibility of baking on a glass stove is investigated using solar thermal energy transferred to the kitchen by means of a circulating heat transfer fluid heated by solar energy concentrated by a parabolic trough. The existing three stone biomass based clay baking pan results in a loss of a major portion of the supplied energy and the baking process also results in significant amounts of indoor air pollution. The proposed system is solely based on a renewable energy source such as solar energy. For experimental simplicity and investigation of the possibility of baking on glass stove, the heat transfer fluid is heated by simulating the solar energy with electricity, and the heated fluid is allowed to circulate through the closed loop of the baking <b>pan</b> <b>assembly.</b> Surface temperatures of 191 ̊C were achieved on top of the glass baking pan and Injera baking experiments were performed successfully...|$|E
30|$|Although DSC/TGA systems share broad commonalities, even {{specific}} {{models are}} often {{available in a}} broad set of configurations to accommodate a variety of sample, measurement, and environment types. The specifics of our instrument are as follows: The system consists of an open-loop, tap-water fed, water-cooled vertical tube furnace with cylindrical graphite resistive heating element that is enveloped in Ultra High Purity Grade Argon gas. The alumina vertical furnace tube of this Setaram 16 / 18 contains a single platinum heat flux pan with two symmetric pockets for holding cylindrical 100  μL alumina crucibles, one for the sample and one for a reference material. This platinum pan is suspended from an alumina rod attached to an electromagnetically stabilized microbalance. In addition to transferring the load to the balance, the rod contains lead wires for a sample thermocouple and heat flow sensor for measuring the heat flux {{across the bottom of}} the two crucibles. During testing, the current compensated balance holds a sample (mass between 50 and 150  mg) and a reference (77  mg of NIST SRM 720 Sapphire rod) at a fixed height in the furnace so long as the balance is within +/− 200  mg of its zero point. This zero point can be adjusted to accommodate a variety of sample and reference masses via the addition and subtraction of tungsten shot from the counterweight arm of the balance. This entire balance, rod and <b>pan</b> <b>assembly</b> is mounted on a vertical moving linear actuator to enable loading and unloading of the pan outside the furnace tube. The balance environment is pressure sealed and coupled with the sample environment. Thus the sample and balance can be purged at various flow rates with a selectable so called carrier gas. In this work, Ar was used at a flow rate of about 1.5  L per hour to purge the sample. Type S Pt/Pt- 10 %Rh thermocouples were used for the sample temperature, heat flow sensor, and the furnace temperature measurement. While sample and heat flow sensors are integrated into the platinum pan on the DSC, the furnace thermocouple is separate and sits just below the pan {{at the end of an}} alumina rod with a notched disk alumina heat shield just below the exposed thermocouple junction. All thermocouple junctions are bare and as small as practical for maximum rate sensitivity.|$|E

40|$|For a long time, robot {{assembly}} programming {{has been}} produced in two environments: on-line and off-line. On-line robot programming uses the actual robot for the experiments performing a given task; off-line robot programming develops a robot program in either an autonomous {{system with a}} high-level task planner and simulation or a 2 D graphical user interface linked to other system components. This paper presents a whole hand interface for more easily performing robotic assembly tasks in the virtual tenvironment. The interface is composed of both static hand shapes (states) and continuous hand motions (modes). Hand shapes are recognized as discrete states that trigger the control signals and commands, and hand motions are mapped to the movements of a selected instance in real-time assembly. Hand postures are also used for specifying the alignment constraints and axis mapping of the hand-pan coordinates. The basic virtual-hand functions are constructed through the states and modes developing the robotic assembly program. The assembling motion of the object is guided by the user immersed in the environment to a path such that no collisions will occur. The fine motion in controlling the contact and ending position/orientation is handled automatically by the system using prior knowledge of the <b>pans</b> and <b>assembly</b> reasoning. One assembly programming case using this interface is described in detail in the paper. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, we {{will present}} a review of our works on the time {{dependence}} of magnetization in nanoparticle systems starting from non-interacting systems, presenting a general theoretical framework {{for the analysis of}} relaxation curves which is based on the so-called scaling method. We will detail the basics and explain its range of validity, showing also its application in experimental measurements of magnetic relaxation. We will also discuss how it can be applied to determine the energy barrier distributions responsible for the relaxation. Next, we will show how the proposed methodology can be extended to include dipolar interactions between the nanoparticles. A thorough presentation of the method will be presented as exemplified for a 1 D chain of interacting spins, with emphasis put on showing the microscopic origin of the observed macroscopic time dependence of the magnetization. Experimental application examples will be given showing that the validity of the method is not limited to 1 D case.

500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to {{fade into the}} background of the activity. Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A <b>pan</b> across the <b>assembly</b> reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|R

This thesis presents a framework for interactive <b>assembly</b> sequence <b>panning</b> for mechanical <b>assemblies.</b> Realizing the utility of such a tool that will enable the product engineer to evaluate the assemblability of his designs and generate suitable assembly sequences, many systems have been developed by beseechers all over the world. The input to these system is a model of the assembly and the output is a set of feasible assembly sequences. The system needs a geometric reasoning capacity to aid this process. The research issue is to devise a framework that preserves design rationale and utilizes all the available assembly information to optimize the assembly planning process, reduce the computational complexity associated with extensive geometric reasoning and represent the constraints in the assembly {{in a manner that is}} easy to interpret. This thesis contributes to simplification of the assembly sequence planning by developing a framework to represent and input vital information regarding implicit precedence relationships, directionality and base-part assumptions to the planner. This is achieved by generating three graph structures: an Abstract Assembly Graph, a FinalPrecedence Graph and a Diamond Graph. Extensive autistic geometric reasoning required to reason about the feasibility of assembly operation is often expensive and time consuming and is therefore replaced with a user interface. A question-answer session with the designer to reason about the assemblability will also help in incorporating additional information other than geometric feasibility constraints into the planning process. The process of finding constraints in the assembly is further streamlined by taking a hierarchical approach to set up precedence among all the assembly operations needed to generate the complete assembly. Preserving and utilizing the precedence information from one level to the next in a hierarchy drastically reduces the number of queries needed to find out all the precedence relationships in the assembly. Finally, all the constraint information is represented using a Final Precedence Graph. The Final Precedence Graph serves as the input to the generation of all the feasible assembly sequences that are then represented using a Diamond Graph...|$|R
