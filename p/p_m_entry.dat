40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of an early paper [Adv. Appl. Math. 47 (2011), 158 - 172] about matroid base polytope decomposition. We will present sufficient conditions on a matroid M so its base polytope <b>P</b> (<b>M)</b> has a sequence of hyperplane splits. These yields to decompositions of <b>P</b> (<b>M)</b> with two or more pieces for infinitely many matroids M. We also present necessary conditions on the Euclidean representation of rank three matroids M for the existence of decompositions of <b>P</b> (<b>M)</b> into 2 or 3 pieces. Finally, we prove that <b>P</b> (<b>M</b> 1 ⊕ M 2) has a sequence of hyperplane splits if either <b>P</b> (<b>M</b> 1) or <b>P</b> (<b>M</b> 2) also has a sequence of hyperplane splits...|$|R
