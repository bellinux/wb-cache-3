5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington would launch an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use atomic bombs {{and that the only}} way of avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E
5|$|From early 1944, No. 266 Squadron {{took part}} in ground attack {{operations}} over the Channel and northern France, operating from RAF Harrowbeer in Devon. The squadron also escorted Allied bombers embarking on or returning from raids, protecting them from German fighters. Larger <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> were fitted to the Typhoons to increase their range. In May 1944 the squadron was visited by the Prime Minister, who had been knighted and was now Sir Godfrey Huggins. Over the next month, {{in preparation for the}} imminent Allied invasion of Normandy, the Rhodesian aircraft took on a fighter-bomber role, flying sorties across the channel twice a day and participating in the bombing of bridges, roads, railways and the like.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 1918, {{the engine}} room of HM Motor Launch 356 {{exploded}} at Dunkirk quay, and the forward <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> burst into flames. Several of the launch's crew were blown overboard by the explosion, while the remainder were driven off by the fire. Flames soon began to issue forth from the cabin, and burning petrol spread {{on the surface of}} the water. As others proceeded to flee the scene, Bagot, along with Lieutenant Robin Hoare, realised the fire was threatening the aft <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> and the depth charges located on board the launch. Jumping in a dinghy, the pair rowed out towards the blaze. On reaching the wreck, Bagot and Hoare removed the depth charges despite the flames; thus preventing any further explosion.|$|E

25|$|During his {{imprisonment}} Alcock had {{resolved to}} fly the Atlantic one day, {{and after the war}} he approached the Vickers engineering and aviation firm at Weybridge, who had considered entering their Vickers Vimy IV twin-engined bomber in the competition but had not yet found a pilot. Alcock's enthusiasm impressed the Vickers' team and he was appointed as their pilot. Work began on converting the Vimy for the long flight, replacing the bomb racks with extra <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks.</b> Shortly afterwards Brown, who was unemployed, approached Vickers seeking a post and his knowledge of long distance navigation convinced them to take him on as Alcock's navigator.|$|E

25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E
500|$|Two [...] lifts (elevators) were {{installed}} to transfer aircraft between {{the flight deck}} and hangars.

500|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, each level being [...] high. The lower hangar was [...] long by [...] wide {{and the upper}} was [...] Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted {{down the side of}} the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Two [...] lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two [...] ready-use <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional [...] of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard Furious in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side. Furiouss long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.|$|E

50|$|Upon being {{confronted with}} the {{forensic}} evidence that the feeding pipe between the <b>petrol</b> <b>tank</b> and the carburettor of the vehicle had been loosened, Rouse remained adamant the fire had been accidental, offering conjecture {{it may have been}} started by the inebriated victim lighting the cigar he had been given after he had filled the <b>petrol</b> <b>tank</b> of his vehicle, and accidentally spilled some of the contents of the <b>petrol</b> <b>tank</b> inside his vehicle. Furthermore, when questioned as to why he had been by the two young men seen walking from the scene of the fire with a briefcase in his hand, Rouse claimed he had taken the briefcase out of the car because he had earlier noticed the man had placed his hand upon it.|$|R
500|$|Whilst escorting Convoy SC 94 {{in early}} August 1942 {{as part of}} Escort Group C1, Assiniboines Type 286 radar spotted [...] in a heavy fog on 6 August. The {{destroyer}} closed on the contact and briefly spotted the submarine twice before losing her in the fog. The submarine reappeared crossing the destroyer's bow at a range of , and both ships opened fire. The range was too close for Assiniboines 4.7-inch guns to engage, but her [...]50-calibre machine guns shot up the submarine's deck and conning tower. This kept the Germans from manning their [...] deck gun, but the [...] flak gun was already manned and firing. The gun punched holes through the destroyer's plating that set some <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> on the deck afire and disabled 'A' gun. It also claimed the only Canadian casualty during the engagement: Ordinary Seaman Kenneth [...] "Wiley" [...] Watson from Revelestoke, British Columbia. The destroyer was unable to ram U-210 until the rear 4.7-inch gun hit the conning tower, killing the entire bridge crew and the [...]50-caliber machine guns were able to silence the flak gun. This caused Lieutenant Sorber, the senior surviving officer, to order the submarine to dive, but this meant {{that she had to}} hold a straight course while doing so. Assiniboine was {{able to take advantage of}} this and rammed U-210 abaft the conning tower whilst she was diving. This caused the electric motors to fail, damaged her propellers and led to water entering the submarine, as a result of which Sorber ordered the ballast tanks to be blown and the submarine abandoned. The destroyer rammed her again when U-210 resurfaced, dropped a pattern of depth charges set to detonate at shallow depth and hit her one more time with a 4.7-inch shell before the submarine finally sank. A number of survivors were rescued by Assiniboine and the British corvette , before the former ship had to head home for repairs as she was taking on water below the waterline. She required nearly two months of repairs at Halifax and was assigned to Escort Group C3 when they were completed on 20 December.|$|E

Nearing the end of the long flight his {{aircraft}} was holed in the <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks</b> by ground fire or heavy machine gun fire from a German trawler and Catanach force landed under fire on the shoreline near Kirkenes (Northern Norway) as he closed in on Murmansk avoiding ditching in the Arctic waters and saving the lives of his crew.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{naval force}} {{consisted}} of two [...] motor boats. Spicer-Simson suggested they be named Cat and Dog, but the names were rejected by the Admiralty. Spicer-Simson then suggested Mimi and Toutou as alternatives, which were accepted. As he later explained, these meant [...] "Miaow" [...] and [...] "Bow-wow" [...] in French. Their crews were assembled from acquaintances of Spicer-Simson, or {{from the ranks of}} the Royal Naval Reserve. Spicer-Simson proposed a number of improvements to the original design; they were cut down to improve their speed, Maxim guns and a 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun were fitted, though the Hotchkiss had to be fired from a kneeling position, and extra steel linings were added to the <b>petrol</b> <b>tanks.</b> The boats were tested on the Thames on 8 June, where arrangements had been made for Mimi to fire a practice shell from her 3-pounder. The shell hit the target, but both gun and gunner flew into the river, as the gun had not been properly bolted to the deck. The boats were loaded aboard [...] on 15 June, along with special trailers and cradles to allow them to be transported by rail or overland, and the expedition′s equipment and supplies.
