Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years. In 2008, the Ministry of the Environment decided not to contest the company's bid, despite studies showing it may increase air pollution-related deaths in the area.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe current {{replacement}} of electronic products is speeding up, {{resulting in a}} growing number of e-waste. Electronic waste, especially waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards contain large amounts of copper, which not only bring greater ecological threat, but also cause a serious waste of copper resources. Therefore, the study on clean, effective copper leaching technology has a very important practical significance to reduce environmental hazards of waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board and resources recycling. Hydrometallurgical is a better technology for recycling copper from waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. In this article, hydrometallurgical copper recovery system is divided into four categories: acid leaching, ammonia - ammonium leaching, chloride leaching, as well as other ways of leaching. The advantages and disadvantages of leaching of copper system are analyzed in the process of copper resource utilization. Studies abound on recycling copper from copper-containing waste with citric acid and other complexing agents as the leaching reagent, but studies on recycling copper from waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards are rarely reported, which can be used for reference. The trends of the research are using environmentally friendly reagent as leaching agent, selecting the appropriate leaching solution at a certain temperature and pressure and optimizing the subsequent separation procedure. Recycling of waste gas and waste leachate generated in the hydrometallurgical processcan further reduce chemical costs and meet increasingly exacting environmental requirements...|$|R
