40|$|Aims and objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the type of tooth usually associated with extraction due to caries or periodontal disease and its relation to age at which these were lost, among patients attending dental surgery outpatient clinic, Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Teaching Hospital (KUTH). Materials and methods: A total no of 626 patients (male- 299 and female- 327) attending at outpatient clinic, in the department of Dentistry, Dhulikhel Hospital were taken in over a period of six months. The details about the permanent teeth to be extracted regarding each tooth type, including age and sex of the patient, type of tooth extracted, cause of extraction were collected, causes other than dental caries and periodontal disease were excluded. Results: The highest <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> due to caries occurred between 21 - 30 years of age, while that of periodontal disease was between 51 - 60 years of age. More than 80 % of teeth lost were from below 40 years of age group. Mandibular �rst molar was by far the most frequently extracted tooth due to dental caries followed by maxillary �rst molar. Maxillary teeth were lost more than mandibular teeth due to periodontal disease. Conclusion: Dental caries and periodontal disease are the two most important factors for extraction or removal of tooth. In this study dental caries is the major cause for loosing tooth among young group of people. Key words: dental caries, periodontal disease, extractio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Fixed {{appliance}} {{orthodontic treatment}} (braces) is routinely used to address mal-positions of teeth and create esthetic smiles. Although {{it is desirable}} that treatment not exceed two years but, in practice, duration of up to two-and-a-half years is deemed acceptable. This review was undertaken to determine treatment duration for routine state-funded fixed appliance treatment in Brunei Darussalam and identify possible influencing factors. Materials and Methods: 100 consecutive cases (Malocclusion class I [29 %], II [51 %] and III [20 %]) of completed routine, single-phase fixed appliance treatment treated at the National Dental Centre, Bandar Seri Begawan, selected retrospectively from 31 st December 2008 were reviewed for treatment duration including possible factors affecting this parameter. Results: Only 19 % had desirable treatment duration (≤ 2 years) and 41 % had acceptable treatment duration (2. 01 to 2. 5 years). Forty percent had treatment duration in excess of 2. 5 years. Excess time due to accumulative non-optimal visit intervals, and number of adjustment visits showed significant high correlation coefficient values to treatment duration (p< 0. 01). Extractions showed low but significant correlation to treatment duration while age revealed low negative correlation to treatment duration (p< 0. 05). The lowest incidence of repairs occurred in those whose treatment did not exceed two years whilst the highest incidence of broken appointments was observed in those who had treatment duration in excess of three years. Conclusions: This retrospective review indicates that treatment duration {{for most of our}} sample is longer than desirable. The accumulative effect of non-optimal visit intervals, increased number of adjustment visits, age at start of treatment, high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> cases, increased incidence of repairs and broken appointments may be contributory.

30|$|Approximately 5  mL culture broth was sprayed rapidly {{into the}} 25  mL precooled {{quenching}} solution, vortexed and instantaneous weighed {{to estimate the}} exact volume of the sample. The resulting mixture was then immediately transferred into the FiltRes-device for filtration (vacuum already applied, slide bar in opened position). After the filtration was finished, the slide bar was closed. To test the influence of washing steps, the mycelial filter cake was then additionally washed 1 – 3 times with 25  mL cold (− 40  °C) quenching solution. Afterwards, the extraction solution was injected as follows. The septa of the injection port were pierced with the canule of the dispenser and 16.5  mL of hot extraction solution was rapidly injected. The injection of the extraction solution from below the filter net forced the mycelial filter cake to completely detach from the nylon filter net (detached filter cake see Fig.  4). This exchange of the quenching and extraction solutions was performed within a few seconds as illustrated in Additional file 2 : Movie S 1, where {{the handling of the}} FiltRes-device was demonstrated with a preculture mycelium. In the next step, the FiltRes-device was tilted to transfer the extraction broth into pre-weighed polypropylene or polycarbonate tube with screw caps (50  mL, Nalgene, UK; preheated in a water bath at 90  °C). Due to the device’s dead-volume (extraction solution below the filter), some of the injected extraction solution (1 – 2  mL) could not be transferred into the extraction tubes. This <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> solution, however, never came into direct contact with the mycelial cake as it remained below the filter disk. Even if metabolites had diffused into this dead volume, the determined intracellular metabolite concentration would have been only minimally distorted. This shortcoming will be eliminated in future prototypes. In any case, to guarantee similar volumetric extraction conditions, the volume transferred from the FiltRes-device to the preheated test tube was determined by weighing and, if necessary, compensated with hot extraction solution. Afterwards, the samples were placed into a shaking water bath at 90  °C and extracted as described later. Since these extracts were subsequently evaporated and resuspended in a defined volume of buffer, the compensation with hot extraction solution had no dilution effect. Concentrations of intracellular nucleotides were normalized to biomass (“Calculations and data analysis” section).|$|E

40|$|The nuclear ribosomal {{internal}} transcribed spacer (ITS) {{region is}} the primary choice for molecular identification of fungi. Its two highly variable spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) are usually species specific, whereas the intercalary 5. 8 S gene is highly conserved. For sequence clustering and blast searches, it is often advantageous to rely on either one of the variable spacers but not the conserved 5. 8 S gene. To identify and extract ITS 1 and ITS 2 from large taxonomic and environmental data sets is, however, often difficult, and many ITS sequences are incorrectly delimited in the public sequence databases. We introduce ITSx, a Perl-based software tool to extract ITS 1, 5. 8 S and ITS 2 – as well as full-length ITS sequences – from both Sanger and high-throughput sequencing data sets. ITSx uses hidden Markov models computed from large alignments {{of a total of}} 20 groups of eukaryotes, including fungi, metazoans and plants, and the sequence extraction is based on the predicted positions of the ribosomal genes in the sequences. ITSx has a very high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> true-positive <b>extractions</b> and a low <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> false-positive <b>extractions.</b> Additionally, process parallelization permits expedient analyses of very large data sets, such as a one million sequence amplicon pyrosequencing data set. ITSx is rich in features and written to be easily incorporated into automated sequence analysis pipelines. ITSx paves the way for more sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes. The software also permits elimination of non-ITS sequences from any data set. This is particularly useful for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing data sets, where insidious non-target sequences are often found among the target sequences. Such non-target sequences are difficult to find by other means and would contribute noise to diversity estimates if left in the data set...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia has {{extensive}} areas <b>of</b> post <b>extraction</b> {{secondary forests}} and degraded lands arising from intensive exploitation of forest resources in recent decades. Using {{the area of}} forests resulting from selective logging practices as an estimate, in year 2000, post extraction secondary forests covered about 23 million ha, or about 55 % of the total concession area. This paper analyses {{the underlying causes of}} transformation of primary to secondary forests and degraded lands, including policy and regulations in forestry and forest resources, poor enforcement of regulations, and the lack of recognition of timber exploitation rights for local communities. The government is committed to promoting participation of local communities in managing forests. Recent policy changes for ameliorating some of the degrading factors have resulted in increased pressure on secondary forests due to rampant illegal logging and use claims by local communities and land speculators. While the largest <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> post <b>extraction</b> secondary forests has been maintained as part of the permanent forest estate, substantial areas have been converted for swidden agriculture, industrial tree and estate crop plantations and transmigration areas.

40|$|Relation Extraction (RE) {{is a task}} <b>of</b> Information <b>Extraction</b> (IE) {{responsible}} for the discovery of semantic relationships between concepts in unstructured text. When the extraction {{is not limited to}} a predefined set of relations, the task is called Open Relation Extraction, whose main challenge is to reduce the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> invalid <b>extractions</b> in the universe of relationships identified. Current methods based on a set of specific machine learning features eliminate much <b>of</b> the invalid <b>extractions.</b> However, these solutions have the disadvantage of being highly language-dependent. This dependence arises from the difficulty in finding the most representative set of features to the Open RE problem, considering the peculiarities of each language. In this context, the present work proposes to assess the difficulties of classification based on features in open relation extraction in Portuguese, aiming to base new solutions that can reduce language dependence in this task. The results indicate that many representative features in English can not be mapped directly to the Portuguese language with satisfactory merits of classification.

One of such systems is the Bord and Pillar system for mining {{which is one of}} the most established strategies for mining. The accomplishment of Bord and Pillar mining is selecting the ideal pillar size. In the event that the pillars are too expensive, then the extraction proportion abatements prompting less productivity and if the pillars are too little it jeopardizes the general mine wellbeing.

Temperature, NaOH amount, and extraction time are the protein yield determining parameters, while pH and volume <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> liquid are critical parameters for production cost. The cost of energy and chemicals for producing 1 t GTR proteins is minimized to 102 €, and its nutritional value is comparable to soybean protein. Furthermore, this technology was successfully applied to other sources of biomass and has potential {{to be used as}} a part of an integrated bio-refinery process...|$|R

In this paper, we studied influence <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions on quality of produced gelatinesprotein content, ash content, rigidity of gelatine gels, viscosity, {{and distribution of}} molecular weights. Ash content of gelatines ranged in limits 3. 5 - 10. 5 %. Rigidity of the gels was influenced by extraction conditions and by elastin content in gelatines; highest-quality gels display rigidity of 213 Bloom. Viscosity of gelatines ranged from 2. 47 to 12. 11 mPa s. Molecular weights of gelatines display a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> fractions from 20 to 36 kDa, a quite high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> fractions from approximately 50 to 100 kDa, in some cases even fractions above 200 kDa appear. It was found that transition temperature and melting temperature of gelatines extracted from tendons are in accord with data on gelatines obtained by traditional extraction techniques from skins and bones. With respect to efficiency <b>of</b> the whole <b>extraction</b> process and to quality of extracted gelatine, we may recommend extraction conditions as follows: in the 1 st processing stage, shaking degreased starting material with water in ratio 1 : 10 at 25 °C for 5 h; in the 2 nd stage, treating the swelled material with 5 % (w/w) added proteolytic enzyme at 40 °C for 25 h; in 3 rd stage, extracting gelatine while boiling for 16 min...|$|R

Humic acid is considered as the main inhibitory agent in the environmental DNA studies. Here, we introduced a rapid and efficient method for DNA extraction and purification from soil. Yield <b>of</b> DNA <b>extraction</b> by the presented method was 130 ng/µl. Three conventional methods <b>of</b> DNA <b>extraction</b> including liquid nitrogen incursion, bead beating and sonication were performed as control methods. Yield <b>of</b> DNA <b>extraction</b> by these methods were 110, 90 and 50 ng/µl, respectively. A rapid and efficient one step DNA purification method was introduced instead of hazardous conventional phenol-chloroform methods. Humic acid removal percentage by the introduced method was 95. 8 % that is comparable with 97 % gained by the conventional gel extraction method and yield of DNA after purification was 84 % and 73 %, respectively. This study could be useful in molecular ecology and metagenomics study as a fast and reliable method...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Regulating common-pool {{resources}} is welfare enhancing for society {{but not necessarily}} for all users who may therefore oppose regulations. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the short-term impact of common-pool resource regulations on welfare distribution. Design/methodology/approach – The authors model a game <b>of</b> common-pool resource <b>extraction</b> among heterogeneous users. Findings – It was found that market-based regulations such as fees and subsidies or tradable quotas achieve a higher reduction <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> from free-access than individual quotas with the same <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> better-off users. Also, they make more users better-off for the same resource preservation. Originality/value – The quota regulation has attractive fairness properties: it reduces inequality while still rewarding the more efficient users.
