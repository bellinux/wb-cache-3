5000|$|A <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> {{was used}} by MCA Disco-Vision (DiscoVision) {{engineers}} in the optical videodisc mastering system. Light from an argon-ion laser was passed through the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> to create pulse modulations corresponding to the original FM video and audio signals to be recorded on the master videodisc. MCA used the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> in videodisc mastering until the sale to Pioneer Electronics. To increase {{the quality of the}} recordings, MCA patented a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizer that reduced the second-harmonic distortion that could be created by the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> during mastering. MCA used either a DRAW (Direct Read After Write) mastering system or a photoresist system. The DRAW system was originally preferred, since it didn't require clean-room conditions during disc recording and allowed instant quality checking during mastering. The original single-sided test pressings from 1976/77 were mastered with the DRAW system as were the [...] "educational", non-feature titles at the format's release in December 1978.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the current state of avalanche transistor based <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> driver development at LLNL and to provide the reader with a set of useful design guidelines. A general description of the units is followed by a short section on the circuit design of avalanche transistor pulsers. A more detailed design guide is given. Techniques for delivering either { 1 / 4 } or { 1 / 2 } wave voltages to a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> are covered. Recently these units have been modified for use at repetition rates up to 10 kHz. Operating at high repetition rates represents problems for both the driver and the <b>Pockels</b> <b>Cell.</b> Design solutions for the pulser are presented as well as discussion of <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> acoustic resonance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceArtifacts in time-resolved {{circular}} dichroism {{experiments are}} carefully analyzed. We show that {{alignment of the}} longitudinal <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> that modulates the laser polarization in such experiments is crucial. By developing a calculation {{of the behavior of}} a slightly misaligned <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell,</b> we are able to propose a simple alignment procedure. This procedure is based on the use of an analyzer at 0 ° or 45 ° of the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> axes, and it allows us to improve the alignment by 3 orders of magnitude and to reduce the artifact below the noise level in our experimental setup.

40|$|The main aims of {{this trip}} were to install {{the latest version of}} the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) circuit to try to improve the Narrabri Autoguider, to reconfigure the blind motor system and to install a "magnetic" <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> In the end, the latter was thwarted by an {{unexpected}} fault in the "velocity" <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> driver. A few maintenance tasks were also achieved...|$|R
40|$|A {{high voltage}} pulse {{generator}} {{is presented to}} drive <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> behaves like a capacitor which slows the rise/fall time of the pulse and restrains the repetition rate of the generator. To drive the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> applied in quantum communication system, it requires about 1 MHz repetition rate with the rise/fall time of the pulse less than 50 ns, adjustable amplitude up to 800 V and an adjustable duration. With the assistance of self-designed transformers, the circuits is simplified that a pair of high current radio frequency (RF) MOSFET drivers are employed to switch the power MOSFETs at a high speed, and the power MOSFETs shape the final output pulse with the requirements. From the tests, the generator can produce 800 V square pulses continously at 1 MHz rate with 46 ns in risetime and 31 ns in falltime when driving a 51 pF capacitive load. And the generator is now used to drive <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> for encoding the polarization of photons...|$|R

50|$|Bismuth {{germanate}} {{has high}} electro-optic coefficients (3.3 pm/V for Bi12GeO20), making it useful in nonlinear optics for building <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells,</b> {{and can also}} be used for photorefractive devices for ultraviolet range.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} field {{can be applied}} to the crystal medium either longitudinally or transversely to the light beam. Longitudinal <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> need transparent or ring electrodes. Transverse voltage requirements can be reduced by lengthening the crystal.|$|E
5000|$|One {{application}} is so-called boxcar switching of a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> Four Marx generators are used, {{each of the}} two electrodes of the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> being connected to a positive pulse generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator. At the trailing edge of the boxcar, the two other generators are fired to [...] "reverse" [...] the cell.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{schematic}} of a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> modulating {{the polarization}} of light. In this case, the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> is {{acting as a}} quarter wave plate, where linearly polarized light is converted to circularly polarized light. With {{the addition of a}} Brewster window (on the left) this change in polarization can be converted to a change in the intensity of the beam, by transmitting on the p-polarized vector component.|$|R
50|$|When a pulse with {{vertical}} polarization {{is reflected}} off the polarizer, after a double {{pass through the}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> it will become horizontally polarized and will be transmitted by the polarizer. After a double pass through the amplification medium, having the same horizontal polarization, the pulse will be transmitted by the polarizer. If no voltage {{is applied to the}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell,</b> a double pass through it will change the polarization of the pulse to vertical, so the pulse will be reflected off the polarizer and will exit the cavity. If a voltage is applied, then a double pass through the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> will not change the polarization and the pulse will get trapped inside the cavity of the resonator. The pulse can stay in the cavity until it reaches saturation or until it extracts most of the energy stored in the gain medium. When the pulse will achieve a high amplification, a second voltage {{can be applied to the}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> in order to release the pulse from the resonator.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers for <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells.</b> These {{have been}} {{designed}} to enable Q-switching of nanosecond lasers without the use of phase retardation plates. High voltage applied to the Pockels cell inhibits oscillation. At a certain time HV is switched to ground, thus allowing the laser to radiate.|$|E
50|$|Deuterated {{potassium}} dihydrogen phosphate (KD2PO4) or DKDP single crystals {{are widely}} used in non-linear optics as the second, third and fourth harmonic generators for Nd:YAG and Nd:YLF lasers. They are also found in electro-optical applications as Q-switches for Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, Alexandrite and Ti-sapphire lasers, {{as well as for}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
50|$|The driver must {{withstand}} the doubled voltage returned to it. <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> {{behave like a}} capacitor. When switching these to high voltage, a high charge is needed; consequently, 3 ns switching requires about 40 A for a 5 mm aperture.Shorter cables {{reduce the amount of}} charge wasted in transporting current to the cell.|$|E

Also reducing size of interferometer...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} a TEM 00 mode, Nd:CaWO 4 laser which generates nanosecond pulses at a wavelength of 1. 06 µm. This {{is achieved by}} simultaneously Q-switching and mode-locking the laser with a single <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> modulated with the appropriate voltage waveform. The same <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> is used in combination with suitable optical components to 'dump' a single pulse from the cavity. Theoretically, this pulse contains all the energy within the cavity. The Q-switching and mode-locking functions could be performed individually and the practical results for the Q-switched PTM and the mode-locking functions are shown to be {{in agreement with the}} theories presented. Some experiments are described using a Nd:glass laser in place of the Nd: CaWO 4 laser where the mode-locking function is performed by a saturable absorber as well as the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> modulator...|$|R
50|$|The delay {{generator}} can be {{used for}} pulse width modulation, e.g. to drive a MOSFET to load a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> within 8 ns with a specific charge.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} {{relatively}} slow-moving mechanical shutter curtains, electro-optic {{devices such as}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> can be employed as shutters. While not commonly used, they completely avoid {{the problems associated with}} travelling-curtain shutters such as flash synchronisation limitations and image distortions when the object is moving. Such shutters are significantly more costly than mechanical shutters.|$|E
50|$|An {{electro-optic}} modulator is a device {{which can be}} used for controlling the power, phase or polarization of a laser beam with an electrical control signal. It typically contains one or two <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells,</b> and possibly additional optical elements such as polarizers. The principle of operation is based on the linear electro-optic effect (the Pockels effect, the modification of the refractive index of a nonlinear crystal by an electric field in proportion to the field strength).|$|E
5000|$|Lithium niobate is used {{extensively}} in the telecoms market, e.g. in mobile telephones and optical modulators. It is the material of choice for the manufacture of surface acoustic wave devices. For some uses it can be replaced by lithium tantalate, [...] Other uses are in laser frequency doubling, nonlinear optics, <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells,</b> optical parametric oscillators, Q-switching devices for lasers, other acousto-optic devices, optical switches for gigahertz frequencies, etc. It is an excellent material for manufacture of optical waveguides.|$|E
40|$|Laser guide star systems {{based on}} Rayleigh {{scattering}} require some means {{to deal with}} the flash of low altitude laser light that follows immediately after each laser pulse. These systems also need a fast shutter to isolate the high altitude portion of the focused laser beam to make it appear star-like to the wavefront sensor. We describe how these tasks are accomplished with UnISIS, the Rayleigh laser guided adaptive optics system at the Mt. Wilson Observatory 2. 5 -m telescope. We use several methods: a 10, 000 RPM rotating disk, dichroics, a fast sweep and clear mode of the CCD readout electronics on a 10 µs timescale, and a <b>Pockel’s</b> <b>cell</b> shutter system. The <b>Pockel’s</b> <b>cell</b> shutter would be conventional in design if the laser light were naturally polarized, but the UnISIS 351 nm laser is unpolarized. So we have designed and put into operation a dual <b>Pockel’s</b> <b>cell</b> shutter in a unique bow tie arrangement.

5000|$|Collinear {{transverse}} acoustic waves or perpendicular longitudinal waves {{can change}} the polarization. The acoustic waves induce a birefringent phase-shift, much like in a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> The acousto-optic tunable filter, especially the dazzler, which can generate variable pulse shapes, is based on this principle.|$|R
40|$|A new laser strainmeter, {{inspired}} by {{those used in}} the first gravitational waves detectors, is presented. A wide-band feedback circuit controls the optical length of the reference arm of an unequal-arm Michelson interferometer {{by means of a}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> No modulation is added to the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> supply, since laser power fluctuations are proved to be of negligible effect if some care is taken in balancing the two outputs of the interferometer. A reset circuit follows variations in arm length greater than lambda, obscuring the servo for 50 -mu-s. As a consequence, an analog signal combined with a digital signal allow to detect any change in the arm length greater than 10 (- 3) -lambda. The frequency band extends from continuous signals to 100 kHz...|$|R
50|$|Some polar liquids, such as {{nitrotoluene}} (C7H7NO2) and nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) exhibit {{very large}} Kerr constants. A glass cell filled {{with one of}} these liquids is called a Kerr cell. These are frequently used to modulate light, since the Kerr effect responds very quickly to changes in electric field. Light can be modulated with these devices at frequencies as high as 10 GHz. Because the Kerr effect is relatively weak, a typical Kerr cell may require voltages as high as 30 kV to achieve complete transparency. This is in contrast to <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells,</b> which can operate at much lower voltages. Another disadvantage of Kerr cells is that the best available material, nitrobenzene, is poisonous. Some transparent crystals have also been used for Kerr modulation, although they have smaller Kerr constants.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> {{is closely related}} to the choice of the crystals which are involved in this kind of device. These crystals must satisfy sev- eral requirements. In order to clearly establish the crys- tal ability for the realization of <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells,</b> we deﬁne several ﬁgures of merit describing its performances for electro-optic Q-Switch and we use these ﬁgures of merit to compare the eﬃciencies of several NLO crystals...|$|E
40|$|Two {{approaches}} to the creating of pulse-shaping techniques that meet the requirements associated with operation of a large fusion laser are examined. These techniques are passive pulse-shaping with double-etalone devices that coherently add or stack short pulses from a modelocked oscillator, and active pulse-shaping with <b>pockels</b> <b>cells</b> to carve a shaped pulse from a much longer pulse generated by a q-switched oscillator. The passive pulse shaper consists of two high-reflectivity mirrors and a wedge with partially transmitting coatings and produces a train of pulses from a single input pulse. The principal advantage of the passive approach is that timing, pulse shape and attenuation depend solely on the device geometry and coatings. <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been used for}} many years to slice a variable-width pulse from a longer q-switched pulse. Pulse-shaping applications require optical-pulse rise times under 200 ps. Measurements of optical rise times in cylindrical ring-electrode <b>pockels</b> <b>cells</b> of potassium-dideuterium phosphate indicate that 200 - to 300 -ps rise times can be reached in existing devices and somewhat shorter rise times can be achieved in the future. The pockels-cell technique provides greater flexibility and lower insertion loss for some pulse shapes than passive pulse shaping...|$|E
40|$|Multifrequency-phase and {{modulation}} fluorometry {{allows for}} accurate analysis of fluorescence decay {{in the frequency}} domain. Essential to these frequency domain methods is a high-frequency modulation of the light source. Techniques for generating wide-band modulation of light are currently limited {{to the use of}} <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cells</b> and intrinsically modulated sources such as mode-locked lasers and synchrotron radiation. We present a method that employs two acousto-optic modulators in series for use with cw light sources. This modulator system gives two orders of magnitude more intensity output than the <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cell</b> modulator and requires less than one-tenth of the rf driving power. In addition, the <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cell</b> system is limited to modulation frequencies less than 250 MHz, whereas the particular implementation discussed here gives a quasicontinuous distribution of modulation frequencies from dc to 320 MHz. To obtain this range of frequencies, acoustic standing waves are set up simultaneously in each modulator, and the desired modulation frequency is achieved by choosing the proper combination of the two standing-wave frequencies. Light modulation is obtained at twice each of the individual standing-wave frequencies and at the sum and difference of twice the two acoustic frequencies. Data are presented to illustrate the use of this system for the measurement of phosphorescence as well as fluorescence decay...|$|R

The diode array pumped, regenerative amplifier consists of only five optical elements, two mirrors, one thin film polarizer, one Nd:YAG crystal, and one <b>pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>pockels</b> <b>cell</b> performed both as a Q-switch and a cavity dumper for amplified pulse ejection through the thin film polarizer.
