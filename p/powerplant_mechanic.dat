50|$|After {{finishing}} his degree, Bohlemann continued with his interests in aerospace, attending Georgia Institute of Technology, {{where he worked}} on a Masters of Science at the Yee Labs. He is a licensed <b>powerplant</b> <b>mechanic</b> based out of Weston, Florida.|$|E
50|$|Aaron {{is also an}} {{experienced}} test pilot, having test-flown a tracking system for the Boeing AH-64 Apache; and an infrared vision system as the first helicopter pilot to deliberately fly into brownout conditions. He is also an FAA certificated Airframe and <b>Powerplant</b> <b>Mechanic,</b> and has assembled three working TAH-1F Cobras from surplus parts.|$|E
50|$|Moment {{received}} his Master of Science from the University of Illinois, College of Commerce. His emphasis was statistical methods for distinct segment identification. Other interests included mathematical optimization theory. Stu's undergrad study was organizational administration/organizational psychology. Stu holds Airline Transport Pilot and Multi-Engine Flight Instructor ratings {{and is an}} Airframe and <b>Powerplant</b> <b>Mechanic.</b>|$|E
50|$|After dating actress Miriam Parrish for years, {{the couple}} married in 1997. The same year he left Los Angeles and his acting career briefly behind. He earned a {{certification}} in airframe and <b>powerplant</b> <b>mechanics.</b> From 2002-03 {{he was an}} acting teacher at the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter High School, South Hadley, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the US and the European systems is that in the United States, aircraft maintenance technicians (Part 65 Airframe and <b>Powerplant</b> <b>Mechanics)</b> are permitted to work under their own certificates and approve their own work for return to service. European Part 66 certificate holders are required to perform their functions under the aegis of a Part 145 organisation for Transport Category and Large (MTOM>5700 kg) Airplanes. The part 145 organisation in the EASA system has the authority to approve for return to service. Many non-European countries have been moving toward the European approach, most notably Canada (See Part 571 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations).|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{earned a}} degree in journalism, with a minor in aviation, from the University of North Dakota. A Federal Aviation Administration-certified flight {{instructor}} and advanced ground instructor, he earned a commercial pilot license, with instrument and multi-engine ratings for single-and multi-engine land airplanes; and an Airframe and <b>Powerplant</b> aircraft <b>mechanic</b> license.|$|R
5000|$|The Aviation Academy at Andrews High School is an Early College {{program which}} {{provides}} free college classes and free college textbooks for students interested in aviation or engineering careers. Students can earn an associate's degree from Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) {{while still in}} high school. Credits transfer to other colleges and universities, such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University or NC State. The program also provides paid internships at aviation businesses, job shadowing opportunities, and FAA licenses and industry certifications, such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD. The five main tracks of the program are engineering, pilot, airframe & <b>powerplant</b> <b>mechanic</b> (A&P), avionics technician, and aviation business. The Andrews Early College of Health Science offers an opportunity for motivated students {{to prepare for a}} future career in the field of health sciences to include nursing, biotechnology, respiratory therapy, physical therapy, pharmacy or medicine to name a few. Students have the opportunity to participate in internships through their courses to gain practical experience in their field of interest. Students in the program complete a rigorous high school curriculum during their freshman, sophomore, and junior years, which prepares them to take first-year college courses, earning dual credit, as a high school senior and a college student. Guilford County Schools (GCS) pays for tuition and non-consumable text books. Students who complete this program earn an Early College diploma in addition to the GCS high school diploma. From 2012 to 2016, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) was another key program at Andrews. According to the school website, [...] "Our first cohort of students began in the fall of 2012 in the 9th grade. AVID is a yearlong elective course taken during the school day. Students are enrolled in the course after completing an application and interview process. During the AVID elective, students learn organizational and study skills, work on critical thinking and asking probing questions, get academic help from peers and college tutors, and participate in enrichment and motivational activities that make college seem attainable. As students progress in AVID, their self-images improve, and they become academically successful students, leaders, and role models for other students. AVID targets students in the academic middle who have the desire {{to go to college and}} the willingness to work hard. These are students who are capable of completing rigorous curriculum, but are falling short of reaching their potential. Typically, they will be the first in their families to attend college, and many are from low-income or minority families. AVID pulls these students out of their unchallenging courses and puts them on the college track: acceleration instead of remediation." [...] The AVID program was discontinued in the 2016-2017 school year due to budgeting constraints.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a nondestructive inspection assessment of eddy current and electrochemical analysis to separate inconel alloys from stainless steel alloys {{as well as}} an evaluation of cleaning techniques to remove a thermal oxide layer on aircraft exhaust components. The results of this assessment are presented in terms of how effective each technique classifies a known exhaust material. Results indicate that either inspection technique can separate inconel and stainless steel alloys. Based on the experiments conducted, the electrochemical spot test is the optimum for use by airframe and powerplant mechanics. A spot test procedure is proposed for incorporation into the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 65 - 9 A Airframe & <b>Powerplant</b> <b>Mechanic</b> - General Handbook. 3 refs., 70 figs., 7 tabs...|$|E
50|$|NASA took {{possession}} of one YO-3A, 69-18010. Following service with the U.S. Army this aircraft {{was transferred to}} an airframe and <b>powerplant</b> <b>mechanics</b> school. NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Federal Airfield in California acquired the YO-3A from the school in 1977. NASA equipped the aircraft with wing-tip and tail-mounted microphones. These microphones were used to record the in-flight acoustic signatures {{of a variety of}} U.S. Army helicopters and Tiltrotor aircraft. The YO-3 was also used to measure sonic booms from the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. In 1997, the NASA YO-3A was transferred to the Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) at Edwards Air Force Base, in California. The YO-3A remained in a flyable storage state until October 2004. Then the YO-3A was flown back to Ames to support rotorcraft research again for nearly two years before once again returning to Dryden. In 2015, the aircraft was retired by NASA and sold by the General Services Administration at auction to the Vietnam Helicopters Museum.|$|R
