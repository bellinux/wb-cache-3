50|$|Anton Strauss {{is famous}} for inventing an {{improved}} method of providing a water-tight vertical layer and simultaneously compressing portions of ground adjacent to the layer for use in dams, dikes and like structures or in the ground. The technology {{was used for the}} first time during construction of buildings of Russian South-West Railways in Kiev. Later the technology was applied to construct bridges, tunnels, ports and houses in Russia and abroad. Anton Strauss patented the technology on 18 May 1909 in the US, patent # 922,207. Anton Strauss supported various projects of his partner and close friend architect Vladislav Gorodetsky. Aton Strauss’s innovative solutions technically implemented the ideas of his famous colleague. For instance, because of a height difference, to construct the legendary House with Chimaeras in Kiev the engineer had to build special stepped foundation, pile on one side and tape on the other. As an engineer Anton Strauss <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> of the Museum of ancient history and arts (Grushevskogo str, 6), the Karaite Kenesa (Bolshaya Podvalnya str.7), the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral (Bolshaya Vasilkovskaya str. 75).|$|E

In 1943 a consortium of contractors including Morrison-Knudsen, which had previously <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> of Hoover Dam, began new construction on the dam ultimately raising its height to 475 ft. [...] Energy demands during World War II coincided with an energy shortage in Seattle, requiring that the dam be constructed quickly, but the dam did not generate any power until many {{years after the war}} ended.

The reservoir, however, did not fill past the national border until 1954.

5000|$|During the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult and costly to meet the fuel and raw materials needs of Czechoslovakia and other East European countries. The unexploited Soviet resources tended to be located in Siberia, where extraction and transport were difficult and costly. One {{solution to the problem}} was Comecon's decision to adjust Soviet energy prices annually after 1974; as a result, Soviet prices approached—and eventually at times exceeded—world market prices. The adjustment improved the terms of trade of the Soviet Union at the expense of Czechoslovakia and its neighbors when world prices for many commodities, particularly crude oil, rose sharply in the middle and late 1970s. The higher prices in turn resulted in a larger return to the Soviet Union for its exports of fuels and raw materials and helped to finance expansion of Soviet production capacity. In addition, in the 1970s Comecon initiated several joint projects, such as the construction of a major natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe and of large nuclear power plants in the Soviet Union. The participating countries, including Czechoslovakia, received payments in the form of natural gas and electricity. In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia also <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> of the Yamburg natural gas pipeline [...] "Progress" [...] in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the toughest}} {{question}} was where the competition games of the Third European Basketball Championship should be played. First European Championship was held in a primitively adapted exhibitions hall, second - in adapted former factory premises. Firstly, there was a thought to organize it in an open-court with a hanging tarpaulin roof, protecting from the rain, in the that time State Court (currently Darius and Girėnas Stadium). Although, such building wasn't suitable nor for the Lithuania, nor for the FIBA. It was decided to build completely new sports hall for the basketball games. Anatolijus Rozenbliumas projected the new basketball hall with capacity of 11.000 people (3.500 seats). It cost around 400.000 LTL, however nobody complained about its necessarily and its building progress. Kaunas Sports Hall was built in time. Many helpers <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction.</b> One of them, Donatas Banionis, remembers: [...] "I remember 1939 European Championship in Kaunas. Then the Kaunas Sports Hall was built. On {{the eve of the}} tournament I learned from friends that helpers are required to number the benches. Free observation of the games was promised for that. This, for us - boys, was a staggering thing. The cheapest ticket to all the games cost 10 LTL. So I numbered the sports hall benches with dye honestly".|$|E
5000|$|Initially, public visitation to {{the land}} was not permitted. However, in the 1980s the Monroe County Conservation District {{negotiated}} access to the bog for purposes of public education. A floating boardwalk was constructed and expanded to 1450 ft in 1993, which consists of treated lumber supported by floating barrels. Planks are now replaced as needed with a recycled plastic product. Leaving the walkway is definitely not recommended - hikers would sink to the knee or worse in smelly peat, would encounter hazardous poison sumac, and one tour leader who <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> of the walkway described movement through the brush as requiring an [...] "army crawl". During spring months all fourth grade public school students in Monroe County are {{given the opportunity to}} visit the bog as a field trip. Parents should note that some poison sumac may be within arm's reach of the walkway, and one fourth grader was hospitalized after intentional contact with it. Additionally, groups of visitors are allowed to visit on walks scheduled by the Monroe County Environmental Education Center, 8050 Running Valley Road, Stroudsburg, PA 18360, telephone (570) 629-3061. These walks occur on summer Wednesdays and Sundays, although more occasional winter walks are available. Access may also be granted by special permission of The Nature Conservancy (Pocono Mountain Office, P.O. Box 55, Long Pond Road, Long Pond, PA 18334, telephone (570) 643-7922). Other trails in the upland woods adjacent to the bog {{are open to the public}} without special scheduling.|$|E
