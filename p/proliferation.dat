40|$|Clonality is a {{frequently}} exploited {{characteristic of}} lymphoid malignancies. However, {{in the natural}} killer (NK) cell subset of large granular lymphocyte <b>proliferations,</b> clonality is difficult to prove {{because of the lack}} of specific genetic markers, such as immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. The human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay, a polymerase chain reaction-based X-chromosome inactivation assay, is a potential diagnostic tool in these disorders. Although there is much experience with X-chromosome inactivation assays in myeloid <b>proliferations,</b> these assays have found only very limited application in clonality assessment of NK cell <b>proliferations.</b> We applied the HUMARA assay in laboratory diagnostics for detection of clonality in NK cell <b>proliferations.</b> We describe its test performance and report three cases in which clonality of INK cell populations was investigated by use of this assay. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the HUMARA assay in the diagnostic workup of NK cell <b>proliferations.</b> Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|A silver colloid {{technique}} to identify nucleolar organiser region associated protein (AgNOR) {{was applied to}} 16 fibrous <b>proliferations</b> of childhood and six low grade fibrosarcomas. The fibrous <b>proliferations</b> comprised five cases of infantile digital fibromatosis, seven of infantile desmoid type fibromatosis, and four of infantile myofibromatosis. The AgNORs were visualised as dots within the nuclei of the cells, and {{on the basis of}} their relative mean numbers of AgNORs fibrous <b>proliferations</b> of childhood could be easily differentiated from low grade infantile fibrosarcoma. The differences observed were significant (0. 01 greater than p greater than 0. 001).

5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid <b>proliferation</b> of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) in {{the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP <b>proliferation</b> in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E

40|$|Sponge-seaweed {{associations}} in the seaweed genus Ptilophora are poorly understood; therefore, 94 specimens, representing all 17 species of Ptilophora, were examined to detail this phenomenon. All but 2 Ptilophora species {{were shown to}} produce surface <b>proliferations,</b> with 13 species found to have sponge associations. Evidence for facultative sponge epiphytism was found with species-specific interactions being unlikely. Results show that surface <b>proliferations</b> are not induced by sponge epiphytes, as they often occur {{in the absence of}} sponge epiphytes, and vice versa. The significant number of proliferate thalli found with sponge epiphytes suggests that there is a likely relationship between the presence of surface <b>proliferations</b> and sponge infestation. Sponge epiphytes and Ptilophora species appeared structurally related in that the sponge probably exploits a niche habitat provided by the alga, for which surface <b>proliferations</b> might aid the sponge in bonding to the alga...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{hypothesis}} that a subset of conjunctival melanocytic <b>proliferations</b> exists that cannot be reproducibly classified as benign, malignant, or indeterminate. METHODS: Three groups of excisional biopsy specimens of conjunctival melanocytic <b>proliferations</b> were evaluated by 5 ophthalmic pathologists. These groups included lesions that were considered by the authors to represent benign (Group 1, n = 5), malignant (Group 2, n = 5) and indeterminate melanocytic <b>proliferations</b> (Group 3, n = 5). The panel classified the same sections in all 3 groups in a randomized, masked fashion, first without and then with a clinical history of patient age, sex and race. The kappa statistic (k) was used to quantify the degree of agreement among observers. RESULTS: There was strong concordance among the panel for both Group 1 (benign, k = 0. 76) and Group 2 (malignant, k = 0. 70) melanocytic <b>proliferations.</b> There was no concordance of the panel for Group 3 (indeterminate) lesions (k = - 0. 045). The concordance for Groups 1 and 2 and lack of concordance for Group 3 lesions were independent of knowledge of clinical history of age, sex, and race. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of melanocytic <b>proliferations</b> of the conjunctiva exists that cannot be reproducibly classified by pathologists as benign, malignant, or indeterminate...|$|R

40|$|Immunohistochemistry is {{important}} for the accurate diagnosis of basal cells in atypical glandular <b>proliferations</b> of the prostate. p 40, an isoform of p 63, may be an adjunct to a marker panel in this setting. Biopsies of 68 patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to 34 betaE 12 and p 40. Basal cell staining was classified as negative, partial (< 60 %), or diffuse (≥ 60 %); irregular staining was defined as discordant staining patterns. In acinar <b>proliferations</b> (N= 41), partial staining for both markers was seen in 42 %, and diffuse staining in 46 % of reactive cases. An irregular reactivity was noted in one case only (2 %). Finally, these lesions were signed out as benign. Acinar <b>proliferations</b> negative for both markers and limited amount of glands (≤ 4) were termed atypical small acinar <b>proliferations</b> (ASAP). Out of six PIN lesions two cases showed partial, three cases showed diffuse reactivity for both markers, and one case was stained irregular. All cases diagnosed as prostate carcinomas (N= 20) had no evidence of basal cell staining for neither of the markers. p 40 expression is closely correlated to 34 betaE 12 with respect to demonstration of basal cells of prostate glands and may provide further information on the dignity of glandular <b>proliferations</b> of the prostate...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{course in}} 50 eyes was analysed after pars plana vitrectomy for progressive diabetic fibrovascular <b>proliferations.</b> Patients {{were assigned to}} pars plana vitrectomy if progression of <b>proliferations</b> occurred despite a photocoagulation treatment with a mean number of 3500 burns and additional peripheral cryoablation. All cases had visual impairment because of fibrovascular tissue covering the macula without detachment of the macula. Flat <b>proliferations</b> were present in all eyes without retinal elevation, vitreous detachment, or vitreous haemorrhage. The follow up intervals ranged from 13 months to 39 months (mean interval 24 months). Twelve months postoperatively, 36 eyes (72 %) showed improved visual acuity, five eyes (10 %) were worse, and nine eyes (18 %) were unchanged. Thirty two eyes (64 %) achieved a final visual acuity of 0. 2 or better, and 45 eyes (90 %) gained 0. 05 or better. In only two eyes could reproliferation be observed. The postoperative course indicates that pars plana vitrectomy for diabetic fibrovascular <b>proliferations</b> covering the macula can preserve socially useful visual acuity of at least 0. 05 in most cases...|$|R

EBV infection may result in a spectrum of proliferative disorders ranging from self-limited usually benign disease such as infectious mononucleosis to aggressive non-malignant <b>proliferations</b> such as the virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome to lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies. Benign EBV-associated <b>proliferations</b> include oral hairy leukoplakia primarily in adults with AIDS, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, primarily in children with AIDS.
