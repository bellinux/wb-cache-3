5|$|Haiti and the Dominican Republic, {{which share}} {{the island of}} Hispaniola, were spared much of the hurricane's force, as it passed 170mi (270km) to their south. However, 15people were killed among the island's two nations. Heavy rain flooded the streets of Santo Domingo and rough surf <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> coast. Rain also caused {{landslides}} in Haiti, destroying several hundred homes and forcing 5,154people into temporary shelters, and compromising the temperamental water system {{in the town of}} Bainet.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{aircraft}} and ships <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> town with rockets, napalm and shells before South Korean {{troops from the}} 22nd and 23rd regiments swarmed the town. However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several miles above P'ohang-dong. The NK 766th Independent Regiment advanced around the ROK 3rd Division and took the area around P'ohang-dong.|$|E

For the next three days New Jersey <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> area with her 16in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by spotter aircraft from the aircraft carrier , New Jersey engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October New Jersey shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.|$|E
50|$|For this Leg's Detour, teams chose between <b>Pounding</b> <b>The</b> Drums and <b>Pounding</b> <b>The</b> Pavement. In <b>Pounding</b> <b>The</b> Drums, teams {{traveled}} to Speakers' Corner and learned a complex drum routine for a lion dance performance. Once they had played {{it to their}} young instructor's approval, they then performed the routine with a lion dance troupe on a nearby stage for their next clue. In <b>Pounding</b> <b>The</b> Pavement, teams {{traveled to}} an open area in Rochor Road where they had to gather supplies - chairs, an umbrella, a loaf of bread, wafers, and 10 boxes of ice cream - and then find a marked ice cream cart to sell 25 Singapore-style ice cream sandwiches for S$1 a piece to receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between <b>Pound</b> <b>the</b> Metal and <b>Pound</b> <b>the</b> Cotton. In <b>Pound</b> <b>the</b> Metal, teams worked with a local {{blacksmith}} to hammer and beat an iron rod into a sharp spiked tool using 10-pound sledgehammers. They had to hand-pump the bellows of the smokey, charcoal fire so they could strike while the iron was hot, and get the blacksmith's approval to get their next clue. In <b>Pound</b> <b>the</b> Cotton, teams made a cotton mattress via a traditional Bengali method. Teams had to use bamboo rods to beat clumps of cotton into a fine, feather-like consistency. Then they had to stuff the mattress, and sew it together. Once the craftsman was satisfied with their work, he would hand them their next clue.|$|R

5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Trunajaya's forces harassed the loyalist army. They had {{fortified}} posts {{along the}} river, {{especially on the}} east bank. These were equipped with cannons of various sizes up to twelve-pounders. Trunajaya's artillery continuously <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> loyalists, even reaching Hurdt and Amangkurat's lodgings, {{as well as the}} army's field hospital. The loyalist army also had cannons, but it did not return fire, saving its limited ammunition for the eventual attack on Kediri. In addition, Trunajaya's cavalry also engaged in skirmishes with the loyalists, causing casualties and undermining their morale. On 21 October, a night attack led by Raden Suradipa burned the VOC's Malay troops' quarters. However, the attack was repelled and Suradipa, one of Trunajaya's brothers, was fatally wounded. On the night of 2–3 November, Trunajaya's skirmishers intimidated the VOC's sentries with the music of gamelan and mocking voices.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people died}} as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land. Rough seas in the western Atlantic {{battered}} the Alberto Benati, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated. A 2,726ton Norwegian car ferry known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hjørring, Denmark. However, one person later died in the hospital. In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fjærland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith.|$|E

5|$|The Season {{began on}} November 9, with a Depression hitting Tamil Nadu. Rainfall begin {{pour in the}} places of Nellore and Chittor district. Tirumala getting a heavy {{rainfall}} of 309mm along with Tirupathi with 148mm in 24 hours triggered a flood situation in Chittoor District. Coastal places of Tada recorded 114mm of rainfall the same day. There were 3-4 good spells of rain between 9th and 15th. As rainfall began in Andhra Pradesh on 16 November, local authorities closed schools in Nellore district. Heavy rain of about 27cm <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> temple town of Tirupathi. Thousands of lakes and ponds across the district overflowed, with breaches reported in some areas. At Sri Kalahasti, a pilgrimage centre in the region, the Swarnamukhi River {{was reported to be}} rising. Three people were swept away by floodwaters in Chittoor district, and water entered some houses. Roads were damaged in many parts of Nellore district, disrupting transport services. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu held a teleconference with the district collectors of affected districts and asked disaster response personnel to be on alert.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E
5|$|To the south, HMS Bellerophon was {{in serious}} trouble as the huge {{broadside}} of Orient <b>pounded</b> <b>the</b> ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from Tonnant as the foremast collapsed as well. Orient had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. Orients captain, Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, Majestic, had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun Tonnant, and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain George Blagdon Westcott was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged Majestic to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between Tonnant and the next in line, Heureux, engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of Leander abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded Culloden off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting Peuple Souverain and opening a fierce raking fire on Franklin and Orient.|$|E
