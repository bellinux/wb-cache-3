40|$|ABSTRACT: Snowpack {{characteristics}} for skier-triggered avalanches {{are described}} {{in order to better}} understand skier triggering, to improve snow <b>profile</b> <b>observation</b> and interpretation, to make suggestions for route selection and to provide a basis for further research. Our analysis is based on field observations of skier-triggered avalanche sites in the Columbia Mountains of Canada and the Swiss Alps. Although these two mountain ranges have different climates the characteristics for skier triggering are similar. The analysis has focussed on slab properties and weak layer properties, and in particular their interaction. The findings support the simple model of skier loading. The slab should preferably be soft to enable the skier to efficiently impart deformations to the weak layer. The slab has to be relatively shallow (50 cm), since the skier’s impact strongly decreases with increasing depth. A distinct difference in hardness between the slab and the weak layer causes stress concentrations and favours fracture initiation. Accordingly, when travelling in the backcountry, areas of thinner-than-average snowpack may be potential trigger points, especially when a persistent weak layer exists in the snowpack. Therefore areas of thinner-than-average snowpack are as well the preferred sites for snow profiles and for testing snow stability...|$|E
40|$|International audience—Game {{theory is}} a {{powerful}} tool that has recently been used in networks to improve the end users' quality of experience (e. g. decreased response time, higher delivery rate). In this paper, we propose to use game theory {{in the context of}} Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to organize video contents into clusters having similar request profiles. The popularity of each content in the cluster can be determined from the popularity of the representative of the cluster and used to store the most popular contents close to end users. A group of experts and a decision-maker predict the popularity of the representative of the cluster. This considerably reduces the number of experts used. More precisely, we model the clustering problem as a hedonic coalition formation game where each coalition represents a cluster. The coalition game converges to a stable partition representing a solution of the problem considered. We compare the results of this approach with the clustering obtained by the K-means algorithm. We evaluate the impact of the content <b>profile</b> <b>observation</b> window considered to establish the clustering. We also evaluate the complexity of the proposed algorithm.

Attempts were conducted to clarify the discrepancy by including the non-thermal O(3 P) population that appears around the exobase and higher, and that can scatter Doppler-shifted photons of the line profile farther from the rest wavelength. All attempts based on detail modeling of the photochemical processes and radiative transfer revealed unable to account for the discrepancy. Recently the FUV and EUV solar flux has been obtained at very high spectral resolution with the SOHO-SUMER instrument, revealing a significant solar oxygen emission at 989 Å, i. e. a source of photons that had never been accounted for before. In this study, we compute the radiative transfer of the OI- 989 Å multiplet including the photochemical sources of excited oxygen, the scattering of incident solar photons and the effect of non-thermal atoms.

Oxidative stress, the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, has been recently incriminated as one of the possible triggers of anemia in CVL. Here, we investigated the putative relationships between parasite load and markers of oxidative stress and hematologic, biochemical and clinical alterations in dogs naturally infected with Leishmania spp. Markers of oxidative stress included albumin, uric acid, bilirubin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant capacity (TOC), oxidative stress index (TOC/TAC) and serum and packed red cells Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).

40|$|It {{has become}} commonplace to {{consider}} ploughing as an agricultural practice that destroys soil fertility. Organic farmers have traditionally used the plough to till their soil and control weeds. However, {{there is a}} growing interest in adopting tillage practices without ploughing to preserve long-term soil fertility and in the hope, subsequently, of increasing crop yields. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess if conservation tillage treatments in organic farming did in fact improve long-term soil fertility, wheat rooting and yield in a long term field experiment (2004 – 2015). We compared the effects of conservation tillage treatments (superficial tillage – ST- with chisel at 15 cm depth and very superficial tillage – VST- at 5 – 7 cm depth) and conventional tillage treatments (traditional mouldboard ploughing- MP at 30 cm depth and shallow mouldboard ploughing – SMP- at 18 cm depth without skim coulter) during 10 years on a sandy loam soil in France. To assess soil fertility, physical (soil penetration resistance, visual soil <b>profile</b> <b>observation),</b> chemical (organic carbon – Corg, total nitrogen – Ntot and available phosphorus – OlsenP) and biotic (earthworms biomass, density and diversity) soil properties were measured in 2004 - 5 and 2015. The effect of soil fertility on wheat roots and crop growth was also measured in 2015. VST, and to a lesser extent ST, increased Corg, Ntot and OlsenP in the upper soil layer (from 0 to 15 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. On the contrary, soil compaction increased using conservation tillage treatments (VST and ST) during the 10 years of experiment, especially in the layers between 15 and 30 cm depth in comparison with ploughing treatments. This effect is not offset by an increase in earthworm abundance and activities in conservation treatments. Earthworm biomass and endogeic abundance were even higher in SMP compared to ST. Soil compaction limits roots, with less roots in depth with VST (from 12 to 30 cm and 48 to 70 cm) and ST (from 24 to 30 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. Conservation tillage treatments had positive effects on soil chemical components in the upper soil layer and contributed to the increase of wheat biomass until tillering stage. However, no wheat yield difference was found between treatments. Physical and biotic soil properties had not significantly improved after 10 years of conservation tillage. This could be due either to the insufficient duration of the experiment to foster a positive earthworm effect on soil porosity, or to the sandy soil, too sensitive to soil compaction in this organic cropping system (intensive mechanical weeding) and unfavourable for the development of the earthworm population...|$|E

Some scholars believe that the level of anonymity that is enticing about online communication brings about a sense of de-individuation. In other words, these scholars believe that anonymity online allows people to disguise themselves, engage in “uncharacteristic” outburst of identity and fosters a loss of individuality. However, through my own personal experiences and general observations throughout the time that I have used Facebook, I began to notice that people are not actually hiding behind anonymity. The more I thought about it the more I noticed that people on Facebook were sharing sometimes very intimate details of their lives. At the same time, Facebook has an incredible power to bring people together if there is some sort of social issue users find important enough to express their opinions. These kinds of situations also occur when there is a topic that is heavily debated. This observation was especially emphasized during the presidential election of 2012. It seemed like every day more people were posting statuses about their thoughts on the election and where they personally stood on different issues that were debated. I wanted to explore whether there was a connection between anonymity online and social identity establishment. This study examined how technology, specifically Facebook, has shaped the way that people manage two kinds of identity: individual and group identity. This study gathered 30 participants (female= 16, male= 14) who agreed to share posts with me from their personal Facebook profiles. Information pertaining to participants’ identity was gathered through <b>profile</b> <b>observation,</b> which I was able to do because I had gained consent from all of my participants. The next step of this study as to cross-examine how participants’ individual identity compared to the amount of social identity disclosures they had. The main research method that was utilized in this study was observation, but in order to understand the levels of social identity disclosure each participant had based on the postings some rhetorical analysis was used as well. The findings of this study are that previous notions of anonymity and social identity disclosure are starting to become less applicable to today’s computer mediated communication methods, such as Facebook. This means that the way we have used technology to communicate in the past, is not necessarily the same way we do so now. People who use social media sites such as Facebook to communicate now feel that they can maintain a level of individual identity which would be similar to the type of identity they would hold in offline settings. Along with this, Facebook users have found this site to be a tool to easily demonstrate various in-group allegiances without losing that sense of individuality...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of nutrient depletion and soil degradation that limit productivity of smallholder African farms are spatially heterogeneous. Causes of variability in soil fertility management at different scales of analysis are both biophysical and socio-economic.

Transects for soil <b>profile</b> <b>observation,</b> participatory rural appraisal techniques and classical soil sampling and chemical analysis were sampled across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka), which together represent much of the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Five representative farm types were identified using socio-economic information and considering production activities, household objectives and the main constraints faced by farmers. Soil fertility management and nutrient resource flows were studied for each farm type and related to differences in soil fertility status at farm scale. Farm types 1 and 2 were the wealthiest; the former relied on off-farm income and farmed small pieces of land (0. 6 ¿ 1. 1 ha) while the latter farmed relatively large land areas (1. 6 ¿ 3. 8 ha) mainly with cash crops. The poorest farm type 5 also farmed small pieces of land (0. 4 ¿ 1. 0 ha) but relied on low wages derived from working for wealthier farmers. Both farm types 1 and 5 relied on off-farm earnings and sold the least amounts of farm produce to the market, though the magnitude of their cash, labour and nutrient flows was contrasting. Farms of types 3 and 4 were intermediate in size and wealth, and represented different crop production strategies for self-consumption and the market. Average grain yields fluctuated around 1 t ha¿ 1 year¿ 1 for all farm types and sub-locations. Grain production by farms of types 4 and 5 was much below annual family requirements, estimated at 170 kg person¿ 1 year¿ 1. Household wealth and production orientation affected the pattern of resource flow at farm scale. In the land-constrained farms of type 1, mineral fertilisers were often used more intensively (ca. 50 kg ha¿ 1), though with varying application rates (14 ¿ 92 kg ha¿ 1). The use of animal manure in such small farms (e. g. 2. 2 t year¿ 1) represented intensities of use of up to 8 t ha¿ 1, and a net accumulation of C and macronutrients brought into the farm by livestock. In farms of type 5, intensities of use of mineral and organic fertilisers ranged between 0 ¿ 12 kg ha¿ 1 and 0 ¿ 0. 5 t ha¿ 1, respectively. A consistent trend of decreasing input use from farm types 1 ¿ 5 was generally observed, but nutrient resources and land management practices (e. g. fallow) differed enormously between sub-locations. Inputs of nutrients were almost nil in Aludeka farms. Both inherent soil properties and management explained the variability found in soil fertility status.

The project has transitioned to the implementation and trial phase using the infrastructure of the Bureau of Meteorology. OceanMAPS has a global grid with 1 / 10 ° by 1 / 10 ° resolution in the Australian region (90 E- 180 E, 70 S- 16 N) and uses the Modular Ocean Model version 4 optimised for the NEC SX 6. The analysis uses an ensemble based multi-variate optimal interpolation scheme where model error covariances are derived from a 72 -member ensemble of intra-seasonal anomalies based on a 12 -year ocean only model integration. The scheme has been formulated to assimilate near real-time sea level height anomalies processed from Jason- 1, ENVISAT and Geosat Follow-On and <b>profile</b> <b>observations</b> including Argo, XBT and the TAO array. The operational configuration including the data management of the near real-time observations is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Broad, {{asymmetric}} iron K {{lines have}} been detected in the Xray spectra {{of about a dozen}} Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The distorted line profiles are most probably due to strong relativistic effects in the innermost parts of an optically thick accretion disk around a central black hole. However, none of the Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHC) has exhibited any clear evidence of a relativistic iron line <b>profile.</b> <b>Observations</b> of the persistently bright black hole candidate Cyg X- 1 have only revealed a narrow Gaussian line. Weak relativistic features may not have been detected due to insufficient signal-to-noise and energy resolution. We present simulated observations of a relativistic iron K line in the spectrum of Cyg X- 1 obtained with SIXA onboard Spectrum X-Gamma. We studied the feasibility of detecting the relativistic effects in the line profile both in the hard and soft state of the source. Our results show that a relativistic line profile can be resolved in Cyg X- 1 within a 50 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the recent results of Lower Hybrid (LH) experiments at JET with the ITER-like wall (ILW) is presented. Topics relevant to LH wave coupling are addressed as well as issues related to ILW and LH system protections. LH wave coupling was studied in conditions determined by ILW recycling and operational constraints. It was concluded that LH wave coupling was not significantly affected and the pre-ILW performance could be recovered after optimising the launcher position and local gas puffing. SOL density measurements were performed using a Li-beam diagnostic. Dependencies on the D 2 injection rate from the dedicated gas valve, the LH power and the LH launcher position were analysed. SOL density modifications due to LH were modelled by the EDGE 2 D code assuming SOL heating by collisional dissipation of the LH wave and/or possible E¥B drifts in the SOL. The simulations matched reasonably well the measured SOL <b>profiles.</b> <b>Observations</b> of arcs and hotspots with visible and IR cameras viewing the LH launcher are presented...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{suggests}} a methodological framework for evaluating adequacy and usability of soil maps {{by analyzing the}} following 10 aspects: lineage, consistency, completeness, effective scale, attribute accuracy, thematic contrast, accuracy of legends, integrity, popularity, and accessibility. This framework {{was used to evaluate}} the national soil resource inventory in Croatia and to find out why the maps are not used to the full potential. Six 1 : 50 K map sheets (of 185 in total), 3 control surveys, and 10 full profile descriptions in the main landscape regions of Croatia were used to estimate the effective map scale and thematic accuracy of <b>profile</b> <b>observations.</b> In addition, the existing digital data sets (digital soil map and database with 2198 profiles) were evaluated for thematic purity and contrast. The results show that the soil maps are of lower quality than planned and that their usability for spatial planning is limited. The average polygon size and the positiona...|$|R

40|$|Work {{supported}} by CNRS-CEA-MENESR. A new 500 MHz fifth harmonic RF system {{has recently been}} installed on the Super-ACO storage ring {{with the goal of}} reducing bunch-length for Free electron laser (FEL) and time-resolved synchrotron radiation experiments. Bunches have been shortened by factors between 2 and 3. 5. This is accompanied by several new coherent instabilities. In particular, a single-bunch transverse instability causing vertical beam dimension blow-up occurs for positive chromaticity at around 10 mA. This instability is highly sensitive to lattice non-linearity’s but rather insensitive to chromaticity although very strong vertical chromaticity does at least partially cure it. Longitudinal coherent instabilities begin at less than 2 mA per bunch. They are manifested by complex bunch phase and shape oscillations at frequencies close to the synchrotron frequency and its harmonics as well as by low frequency (several hundred Hz) phase and length variations. We describe various experimental results concerning these phenomena, including double sweep streak camera bunch <b>profile</b> <b>observations,</b> as well as our attempts to understand them in terms of collective effects theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of winds {{throughout}} the atmosphere are crucial for both {{numerical weather prediction}} NWP and climate studies. Nevertheless <b>observations</b> of height <b>profiles</b> of the global wind field are outstanding and profile measurements of wind are prioritized by WMO Expert Teams for global NWP. Recently the positive impact of airborne wind lidar observations from the Atlantic THORPEX Regional Campaign on numerical weather prediction was demonstrated. For the first time airborne wind lidar observations were assimilated into a global model at ECMWF. These results give further confidence {{in the importance of}} wind <b>profile</b> <b>observations</b> and support the high expectations on ESA´s wind lidar mission ADM-Aeolus, which will be the first lidar mission to sense the global wind field from space. The results of the impact studies for airborne wind lidar observations on ECMWF model analyses and forecast skills will be presented. The conclusions from the assimilation experiments with real airborne observations add further confidence to the impact studies using simulated ADM-Aeolus wind lidar observations. The findings from these ADM-Aeolus impact studies will be discussed. 1...|$|R
