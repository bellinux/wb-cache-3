5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure {{and led to a}} decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was Vietnamese <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{admission}} to the New York Bar, MacMurray sought a career in government. A letter of commendation from Woodrow Wilson helped MacMurray secure {{an opportunity to take}} the foreign service examination. In 1907, he was appointed as Consul-General and Secretary of Legation in Bangkok, Siam, and then became second secretary at the U.S. embassy in St. Petersburg. There he worked under ambassador William Woodville Rockhill, who was credited with helping to shape the United States’ open door <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> China.|$|E

In 2011, he declined to accept the Lithuanian highest order, citing his displeasure at Lithuania's <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> the Polish diaspora. In 2008, he established the Lech Wałęsa Award.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement with Washington over U.S. <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{election campaign}} began in late September 2007. The campaigns {{of the three}} front runners were based mostly on the personal appeal of the candidates, with few concrete statements about political issues. Zmago Jelinčič led an aggressive campaign, focusing on denouncing the three front runners, the Government, the ethnic and religious minorities, the Roman Catholic Church, and demanding an aggressive <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> neighbouring Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford.

Walsingham may {{have been aware of}} Stafford's duplicity, as he fed the ambassador false information, presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, {{as part of}} the {{changing}} Soviet <b>policy</b> <b>towards</b> its ethnic territories, a decision was made to increase the proportion of ethnic Russians in the autonomous oblast. On April10, 1936, the predominantly Russian city of Maykop, as well as Giaginsky District and Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District, became a part of the autonomous oblast (with the selsoviet having been incorporated into Giaginsky District). At the same time, the administrative center of the autonomous oblast was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized {{the hardships of}} Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society.
