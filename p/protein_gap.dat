25|$|Importin {{proteins}} bind their cargo in the cytoplasm, {{after which}} {{they are able to}} interact with the nuclear pore complex and pass through its channel. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin that causes it to dissociate from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP then translocates to the cytoplasm, where a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates Ran-GTP from importin. Separation allows access to a GTPase activating <b>protein</b> (<b>GAP)</b> that binds Ran-GTP and induces the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The Ran-GDP produced from this process now binds the nuclear transport factor NUTF2 which returns it to the nucleoplasm. Now in the nucleus, the Ran-GDP interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which replaces the GDP with GTP, resulting again in Ran-GTP, and beginning the cycle anew.|$|E

2500|$|The binding of an aa-tRNA to EF-Tu • GTP {{allows for}} the ternary complex to be {{translocated}} to the A-site of an active ribosome, in which the anticodon of the tRNA binds to the codon of the mRNA. [...] If the correct anticodon binds to the mRNA codon, the ribosome changes configuration and alters the geometry of the GTPase domain of EF-Tu, resulting in the hydrolysis of the GTP associated with the EF-Tu to GDP and Pi. [...] As such, the ribosome functions as a GTPase-activating <b>protein</b> (<b>GAP)</b> for EF-Tu. [...] Upon GTP hydrolysis, the conformation of EF-Tu changes drastically and dissociates from the aa-tRNA and ribosome complex. [...] The aa-tRNA then fully enters the A-site, where its amino acid is brought near the P-site's polypeptide and the ribosome catalyzes the covalent transfer of the polypeptide onto the amino acid.|$|E
