Experiment 1 is repeated considering, however, filters having 10 sec per-tuple <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> (see Table 2). We can see that the mean overall cost improvement of A-greedy* is somewhat lower, while when A-greedy* employs the Meta-algorithm we have performance loss, i.e., the mean overall cost is higher than that of A-greedy by 1 %. The reason behind that phenomenon is the following: as the per-tuple filter <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> increases, the data <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> dominates over the runtime overhead.

40|$|This article {{presents}} two reading comprehension experiments, using the sentence correctness decision task, that explore {{the causes of}} <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> of Japanese sentences with SnomOaccV, StopOaccV, OaccSnomV, and OtopSnomV word orders. The first experiment was conducted {{in order to see}} if either syntax or frequency plays {{a significant role in the}} processing of these sentences. The results of the first experiment have shown that both the structure-building process and frequency directly affect processing load. We observed that there was no difference in <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> between SnomnOaccV and StopOaccV, both of which are easier to process than OACCSNOMV, which is in turn easier to process than OtopSnomV: SnomOaccV = StopOaccV < OaccSnomV < OtopSnomV. This result is the mixture of the two positions. Specifically, the structure building cost of StopOaccV was neutralized by its high frequency. The aim of the second experiment was to investigate the interaction between syntactic structure, frequency, and information structure. The results showed that the <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> of OaccSnomV was facilitated by given-new ordering, but SnomOaccV, StopOaccV, and OtopSnomV were not. Thus, we can conclude that information structure also influences <b>processing</b> <b>cost.</b> In addition, the distribution of informational effects can be accounted for by Kuno’s (1987 : 212) Markedness Principle for Discourse Rule Violations: SnomOaccV and StopOaccV are unmarked/canonical options, and as such are not penalized even when they violate given-new ordering, OaccSnomV is penalized when it does not maintain given-new ordering because it is a marked/non-canonical option, and OtopSnomV is penalized even when it obeys given-new ordering possibly because more specific contexts are needed. Another reason for the increased <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> of OtopSnomV is a garden path effect; upon encountering Otop of OtopSnomV, the parser preferentially (mis) interpreted it as Stop due to a subject-before-object preference. The revision of the interpretation may be the cause of the high <b>processing</b> <b>cost</b> observed in OtopSnomV...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{concern is}} that monopolistic {{competition}} fosters advertising {{and the creation of}} brand names. Advertising induces customers into spending more on products because of the name associated with them rather than because of rational factors. Defenders of advertising dispute this, arguing that brand names can represent a guarantee of quality and that advertising helps reduce the cost to consumers of weighing the tradeoffs of numerous competing brands. [...] There are unique information and information <b>processing</b> <b>costs</b> associated with selecting a brand in a monopolistically competitive environment. In a monopoly market, the consumer is faced with a single brand, making information gathering relatively inexpensive. In a perfectly competitive industry, the consumer is faced with many brands, but because the brands are virtually identical information gathering is also relatively inexpensive. In a monopolistically competitive market, the consumer must collect and process information on a large number of different brands to be able to select the best of them. In many cases, the cost of gathering information necessary to selecting the best brand can exceed the benefit of consuming the best brand instead of a randomly selected brand. The result is that the consumer is confused. Some brands gain prestige value and can extract an additional price for that.|$|E
