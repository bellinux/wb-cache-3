40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{synthesize}} {{and critically}} evaluate all available evidence investigating whether localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia {{is associated with}} a specific inflammatory profile at both a local and a systemic level. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Collaboration databases, and ClinicalTrials. gov. The search strategy was developed using MeSH terms related to localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia, and inflammatory markers. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Two independent investigators screened titles and abstracts and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments. Studies were included if they reported at least one baseline inflammatory marker in women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia and compared them with healthy women. Reference lists from published reviews on localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia were screened for additional studies. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: There were 1, 619 studies identified. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 400 women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia and 212 healthy women in a control group. Risk of bias assessment revealed that the methodologic quality was generally low. Fifteen studies investigated local inflammation and three studies investigated systemic inflammation. On a local level, the number of mast cells expressed in vestibular tissues was greater in women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia expressed than in women in the control group. Several studies reported undefined inflammatory infiltrate in vestibular tissues to a greater level in women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia than in women in the control group. Systemically, levels of natural killer cells were lower in women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia than in women in the control group. There were no systemic differences in systemic interferon- a and interferon-ϒ levels between groups. CONCLUSION: There is limited and contradictory evidence regarding the characteristics of local and systemic inflammation in women with localized, <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia. K.

40|$|Abstract: Background: <b>Provoked</b> vestibulodynia is {{the most}} common form of vulvodynia. Despite its high {{prevalence}} and deleterious sexual, conjugal, and psychological repercussions, effective evidence-based interventions for <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia remain limited. For a high proportion of women, significant pain persists despite the currently available treatments. Growing evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) could play a key role in <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia; thus, treatment targeting the CNS, rather than localized dysfunctions, may be beneficial for women suffering from <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia. In this study, we aim to build on the promising results of a previous case report and evaluate whether transcranial direct-current stimulation, a non-invasive brain stimulation technique targeting the CNS, could be an effective treatment option for women with <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia. Methods/design: This single-center, triple-blind, parallel group, randomized, controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of transcranial direct-current stimulation with sham transcranial direct-current stimulation in women with <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia. Forty women diagnosed with <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia by a gynecologist, following a standardized treatment protocol, are randomized to either active transcranial direct-current stimulation treatment for ten sessions of 20 minutes at an intensity of 2 mA or sham transcranial direct-current stimulation over a 2 -week period. Outcome measures are collected at baseline, 2 weeks after treatment and at 3 -month follow-up. The primary outcome is pain during intercourse, assessed with a numerical rating scale. Secondary measurements focus on the sexual function, vestibular pain sensitivity, psychological distress, treatment satisfaction, and the patient’s global impression of change. Discussion: To our knowledge, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of transcranial direct-current stimulation in women with <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia. Findings from this trial are expected to provide significant information about a promising intervention targeting the centralization of pain in women with <b>provoked</b> vestibulodynia...|$|R
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: estrogen receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and estrogen receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of estradiol can <b>provoke</b> abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to <b>provoke</b> the LH surge.|$|E

Patients for whom an exogenous <b>provoking</b> factor was recorded were sent a questionnaire.

A total of 300 out of the 1264 patients indicated that <b>provoking</b> factors had played a role in their disease. Two hundred and forty-six patients were sent a questionnaire, which was returned by 177 (response rate of 72 %).
