5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted <b>police</b> <b>to</b> investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the violence of the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion <b>Police,</b> <b>to</b> form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E

5|$|In response, Prime Minister Borden {{amended the}} {{policing}} legislation in November 1919, bringing together the Royal North-West Mounted Police and the Dominion <b>Police</b> <b>to</b> form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{with the new}} force responsible for federal law enforcement and national security across Canada {{under the command of}} Perry. The legislation came into effect on 1 February 1920, officially marking the end of the older force.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State <b>Police</b> <b>to</b> {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State <b>Police</b> <b>to</b> hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a political football between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city <b>police</b> <b>to</b> battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to such legislation in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in county <b>police</b> <b>to</b> reestablish order.|$|E

All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School.
