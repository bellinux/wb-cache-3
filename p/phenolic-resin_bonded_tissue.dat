40|$|This chapter deals {{initially}} {{with the}} underlying principles of adhesion and adhesives and {{the understanding of}} interfacial behaviour. This provides a basis upon which to understand biological interactions (. Chapter 12). The two broad types of adhesive materials encountered in wound healing are pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) and tissue sealants. The function of pressure-sensitive adhesives is to form an adhesive <b>bond</b> between <b>tissue</b> and biomaterial {{under the influence of}} pressure. Tissue sealants are liquids that convert to solid form at the tissue surface and in so doing form either an effective seal against fluid leakage or a <b>bond</b> between adjacent <b>tissue</b> surfaces. The different requirements and characteristics of these systems are discussed. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The human transglutaminases (TGases) are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and peculiar group of enzymes that catalyze the posttranslational modification of proteins by {{the formation of}} isopeptide <b>bonds.</b> <b>Tissue</b> or type 2 transglutaminase (TG 2) represents the most ubiquitous isoform belonging to TGases family. The vast array of biochemical functions catalyzed by TG 2 distinguishes it from {{the other members of}} the TGase family. In the presence of high calcium levels TG 2 catalyzes a vast array of protein posttranslational modifications, including protein-protein cross-linking, incorporation of primary amines into proteins, as well as glutamine deamination. In the last few years, it has become evident that TG 2 is involved in the final maturation of autolysosomes. The TG 2 regulation of autophagy occurs by its transamidating activity and its inhibition results in the intracellular increase of ubiquitinated protein aggregates.

The advantages of photo-bonding include reduced inflammation and less scarring. However, the materials currently used for light-activated wound closure allow {{for only a}} limited, if any, ability to modulate the biological and mechanical properties of the resulting <b>bonded</b> <b>tissue.</b> Particularly, the micrometric void within dermal wounds presents another obstacle for the photo-bonding materials, since collagen structures are required for the photobonding to occur.

The first empirical treatment of non-union, fresh fractures and osteonecroses allowed the observation of several effects which, without justifying a systematic clinical application, encouraged further fundamental research. The results of this work realized during 35 years are summarized in the present article. After exposure to specific electromagnetic fields, we observed a modification of the DNA activity and an increased production of RNA. During enchondral ossification, the amount of acid GAGS increased faster and the ossification of the primary ossification point is accelerated. On fresh fractures, the rigidity of the callus increased faster. Finally, the microarrays analyses show an upregulation of mRNA involved in cellular differentiation and proliferation. The mRNA responsible of the production of BMP- 2 is significantly increased, explaining the main results observed after the expense of experimental models of the <b>bond</b> <b>tissues.</b> All the observed results are in favour of an acceleration of the cellular differentiation {{at the expense of the}} proliferation.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} coatings {{have been}} applied {{to the surface of}} metallic prostheses to mediate hard and soft tissue attachment for more than 40 years. Most coatings are formed of high purity hydroxyapatite, and coating methods are often designed to produce highly crystalline surfaces. It is likely however, that coatings of lower crystallinity can facilitate more rapid tissue attachment since the surface will exhibit a higher specific surface area and will be considerably more reactive than a comparable highly crystalline surface. Here we test this hypothesis by growing a population of MC 3 T 3 osteoblast-like cells on the surface of two types of hip prosthesis with similar composition, but with differing crystallinity. The surfaces with lower crystallinity facilitated more rapid cell attachment and increased proliferation rate, despite having a less heterogeneous surface topography. This work highlights that the influence of the crystallinity of HA at the nano-scale is dominant over macroscale topography for cell adhesion and growth. Furthermore, crystallinity could be easily adjusted by without compromising coating purity. These findings could facilitate designing novel coated calcium phosphate surfaces that more rapidly <b>bond</b> <b>tissue</b> following implantation...|$|R

40|$|A {{surgical}} adhesive {{that can}} be used in different surgical situations with or without sutures is a surgeons' dream and yet none has been able to fulfill many such demanding requirements. It was therefore a major challenge to develop an adhesive biomaterial that stops bleeding and <b>bond</b> <b>tissues</b> well, which at the same time is non-toxic, biocompatible and yet biodegradable, economically viable and appealing to the surgeon in terms of the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. With this aim, we developed an in situ setting adhesive based on biopolymers such as chitosan and dextran. Dextran was oxidized using periodate to generate aldehyde functions on the biopolymer and then reacted with chitosan hydrochloride. Gelation occurred instantaneously upon mixing these components and the resulting gel showed good tissue adhesive properties with negligible cytotoxicity and minimal swelling in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Rheology analysis confirmed the gelation process by demonstrating storage modulus having value higher than loss modulus. Adhesive strength was in the range 200 - 400 gf/cm(2) which is about 4 - 5 times more than that of fibrin glue at comparable setting times. The adhesive showed burst strength in the range of 400 - 410 mm of Hg which should make the same suitable as a sealant for controlling bleeding in many surgical situations even at high blood pressure. Efficacy of the adhesive as a hemostat was demonstrated in a rabbit liver injury model. Histological features after two weeks were comparable to that of commercially available BioGlue (R). The adhesive also demonstrated its efficacy as a drug delivery vehicle. The present adhesive could function without the many toxicity and biocompatibility issues associated with such products. Statement of Significance Though there are many tissue adhesives available in market, none are free of shortcomings. The newly developed surgical adhesive is a 2 -component adhesive system based on time-tested, naturally occurring polysaccharides such as chitosan and dextran which are both biocompatible and biodegradable. Simple polymer modification has been carried out on both polysaccharides so that when aqueous solutions of both are mixed, the solutions gel in less than 10 s and forms an adhesive that seals a variety of incisions. The strength of the adhesive is over 5 -times the strength of commercially available Fibrin glue and is more tissue compliant than BioGlue. This adhesive biomaterial showed excellent <b>tissue</b> <b>bonding,</b> was hemostatic, biocompatible and biodegradable. The significance of this work lies on the features of the developed tissue adhesive that it stops bleeding, <b>bond</b> the <b>tissues</b> well, can act as a drug delivery vehicle and would appeal to the surgeon in terms of the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. There is no need for special delivery systems for application of this adhesive. The two-component adhesive can be applied one over the other using syringes. There is also no need for light curing with UV or visible light and the gelation between the two components spontaneously takes place on application leading to excellent <b>tissue</b> <b>bonding.</b> (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Glues and {{adhesives}} {{attach to}} a surface principally involving molecular attraction, whereas cements mostly work through mechanical interlocking. The adhesive and its degradation products must be biocompatible: chemical, clinical, legal, physical aspects are considered; the toxicity of even minor components must be extremely reduced. The idea of bone bonding using biological materials {{has been proposed}} by Gluck, in Berlin, {{more than a century}} ago. Cements and adhesives have been used for the fixation of fractures, the repair of defects and the fixation of prostheses. The cements are initially liquid or plastic and conform with the irregularities in the substratum, producing better bonding on rough surfaces. Developed during the early 1950 s, cyanocrylate adhesives attracted the medical community by their bonding strength and ability to bond in wet environments but reports of displacement of the fracture ends were followed by reports of high infection rates, nonunion, and severe local reactions. Polymethylmethacrylate does not form a chemical bond with bone but a mechanical bond, a weak bone-polymer joint. Charnley used self-curing acrylic cement to bond a femoral head prosthesis into a femur. When adhesives are used to <b>bond</b> <b>tissues,</b> the polymer acts as a barrier between the growing edges and delay healing; the adhesive tends to be rapidly isolated from the bone by a fibrotic, non-adhesive capsule. No proof exists concerning the osteogenic potential of fibrin sealing (FS); its beneficial effect on bone formation has been questioned even if {{there is some evidence that}} FS should influence the early phases of bone repair and may help to solve the problem of reattachment of small osteocartilagenous fragments following joint trauma.

In cartilage repair, initial integration between the host tissue and repair site is desirable to allow for nutrient transport, molecular deposition to enhance fixation, and eventual stress transmission across the interface. It has been postulated that effective transport and crosslinking of newly synthesized collagen molecules across a repair site may be vital {{to the process of}} integrative repair, and recent experiments have correlated collagen deposition with the strength of such repair. Other investigations have shown that enzymatic degradation of the cartilage surface may enhance integrative repair and can increase bond strength of an adhesive to cartilage. 	This study explored a novel approach involving photochemical <b>bonding</b> of cartilage <b>tissue</b> samples through collagen crosslinking as a means to achieve rapid and effective initial fixation, with the goal of enhancing biological integration. Photosensitized collagen gels were first analyzed via FTIR to determine the crosslinking effects with respect to collagen type and photochemical mechanism.

Photochemical <b>tissue</b> <b>bonding</b> (PTB) is an {{emerging}} technique for <b>bonding</b> or sealing <b>tissue</b> surfaces that requires {{light and a}} photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration {{as a function of}} wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0. 68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm 2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0. 04) but not 14 days (p = 0. 75) post-repair.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{production}} and characterisation of sol-gel coatings for protection and bioactivation of metals used as standard surgical implant materials, such as stainless steel 316 L (ASTM F 138), Co based alloys (ASTM F 75) and titanium alloy Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V (ASTM F 67). These films should both prevent degradation of the substrates by wear or corrosion, and bioactivate the material for inducing {{the formation of a}} hydroxyapatite (HA) rich layer onto the material surface, thereby permitting a natural <b>bonding</b> to living <b>tissues.</b> Formation of HA layers can be observed on performing in vitro tests by soaking the material in simulated body solutions. The work describes the development of coatings containing bioactive glass and glass-ceramic particles in hybrid methyl-triethoxysilane (MTES) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) acidic sol, applied by dip-coating to surgical alloys, AISI 316 L, ASTM F 75 and ASTM 67, with the aim of accomplishing both high corrosion resistance of the metal in the body environment and adhesion of the implant to the surrounding tissue. The performance of the coated metal was evaluated in vitro by electrochemical techniques including potentiodynamic polarisation curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, to follow the formation of hydroxyapatite on the surface, as well as the in vitro release of ions by plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-MS) after up to one year of immersion. In vivo behaviour was evaluated by subcutaneous tests and endomedullar implantation in Hokaido rats to study possible rejection reactions and natural <b>bonding</b> to living <b>tissue.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
