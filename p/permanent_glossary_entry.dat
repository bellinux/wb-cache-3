40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel application of automatic summarisation methods for producing <b>glossary</b> <b>entries.</b> The proposed methodology {{is motivated by}} two observations: 1) <b>glossary</b> <b>entries</b> are increasingly used, especially on the Internet; and 2) information contained in a <b>glossary</b> <b>entry</b> is, in fact, a summary {{of information about the}} concept. From these two observations, we develop a method to automatically summarise contexts of a term 1 into a short text which can serve as a <b>glossary</b> <b>entry.</b> The method uses term-based and indicating phrase-based scoring methods to rank and select important contexts. A comparison of the similarity among the concept-centred summaries produced by our method, random baselines, and <b>glossary</b> <b>entries</b> produced by human shows that our summaries are better than the baselines used in this experiment. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree {{types of}} {{information}} categories are proposed in a learner‟s glossary entry: conceptual, lexical and pragmatic. The glossary is envisaged as a knowledge-oriented terminological collection which provides quick access to the conceptual structure of a narrow domain, the head terms functioning in it, their definitions, collocations, translations and contextual use. The conceptual information is identified by analyzing the conceptual relations using a classification scheme of the general aspects of the basic concept (top term). The top-down procedure continues with establishing the system-structuring characteristics with possible graphic representation of types. The lexical information refers to terminological collocations identified by a lexico-semantic analysis. The pragmatic information is provided by corpusextracted contexts and translation equivalents specified by a systematicity-based terminological contrastive analysis. A model is proposed for organizing the data obtained in a learner‟s <b>glossary</b> <b>entry.</b> It is concluded that the proposed model allows maximum concentration of terminological knowledge applicable in technical translation...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: The blossoming {{of sexual}} subcultures {{in the last}} hundred years has seen the {{development}} of a vast new sexual terminology. And as academic research has grasped the challenge of understanding sexuality in the modern world, it has generated its own analytical vocabulary to accompany it. For readers uncertain about some or all of this field, or who want precise definitions of contested terms, A 'Sexuality: The Essential Glossary A' guides its reader through this maze. The glossary covers: key academic concepts - including performance, heteropatriarchy, scripting, and male lesbians. the central debates in sexual politics - including pornography, bisexuality, and the Aids crisis. an analysis of everyday sexual culture - including honeymoon, sex manuals, date rape, cosmetic surgery. slang from a range of sexual subcultures - from daisy chain and switch to lesbian boy and heteroflexible. <b>Glossary</b> <b>entries</b> give the necessary background to understand the key political and academic debates around each term, including selected references and suggested further reading.

40|$|Our {{study is}} meant {{to point out the}} main {{methodology}} used by authors in creating the English-Romanian/Romanian-English legal dictionaries/glossaries which exist on the book market in our country. The research worker who is interested in studying the content and structure of such dictionaries immediately notices the small number of these books on the Romanian market in comparison with, for example, the economic ones. At the same time, the research workers and also the users of legal dictionaries quite easily identify the frequent scarcity and the simple structure of the entries included by lexicographers. Our study will analyze the criteria used by the authors of these dictionaries for selecting the terms included in their books, as well as the structure of the selected entries (phonetic script, contextualization, identification of uncountable/countable nouns, indication of special plural forms, such as the foreign plural, references made to synonyms for disambiguation etc.). Finally, the aim of our paper is to offer several suggestions for improving the quality of these indispensable linguistic instruments (dictionaries and glossaries) and for encouraging lexicographers to invest energy in creating better and well-conceived specialized legal dictionaries and glossaries.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} developing methods {{to be used in}} the identification and extraction of meaningful semantic components from large online glossaries. We present two sets of results. First, we report on the algorithm, ParseGloss, which was used to analyze definitions, and extract the main concept, or genus phrase. We ran the system on over 12, 000 online <b>glossary</b> <b>entries.</b> Second, we present a method to evaluate our results, using human judgments on a collection of definitions from six different sources. This paper discusses our approach to the evaluation process, since the creation of a standard for evaluation is in itself a contribution to the field. The methods we have developed have required addressing the significant challenges of abstracting a single gold standard from multiple naive, human judgments on a highly subjective task. Once the method for creating the standard was developed, we then established the gold standard data. We report on our performance in running ParseGloss over this controlled collection of definitions. Our first set of results presents precision and recall on system performance. Our second results are presented in terms of techniques for determining agreement between human subjects. Success in the ParseGloss algorithm will contribute to the automatic creation of ontologies...|$|R

The main point {{of this article is}} that apart from the scarcity of these books on the Romanian market in comparison with, for example, the economic ones, the legal researcher, professional or translator faces the challenge of providing not only an accurate translation but also a comprehensible one for certain target reader whose expectancies relate to the system of law he comes from. It is true that English has become a lingua franca, especially for the world of business, yet as regards the area of law the differences imposed by the various legal systems make the job of the translator in this domain even more difficult as the translation is supposed to mediate a comprehensible communication between two systems of law: that of the original text and its translated version. The aim {{of this study is to}} offer several suggestions for improving the quality of these indispensable linguistic instruments (dictionaries and glossaries) as well as to suggest some ways of coping with the translation in the field of law. legal dictionaries and <b>glossaries,</b> <b>entry</b> structure, contextualization, entry selection criteria, legal translation...|$|R
