5|$|A katipo bite <b>produces</b> <b>the</b> toxic {{syndrome}} latrodectism; {{symptoms include}} extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that <b>produces</b> <b>the</b> heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of indium with the pnictogens <b>produces</b> <b>the</b> gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors.

5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.

5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy.

5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead.

Selenium <b>produces</b> <b>the</b> same machinability improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
