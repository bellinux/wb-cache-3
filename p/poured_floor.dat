5000|$|In 2010 the VRA {{undertook}} a massive fund raising {{needed to move}} the station. The move of just 75 feet within the same plot away from the corner was to alleviate the nearly monthly truck strikes to the southeast roof corner. As {{a part of this}} move a concrete brick and <b>poured</b> <b>floor</b> foundation was constructed. The move contractor hired made the move of the station onto the new foundation on September 20, 2010. After the move the areas of deteriorated siding were replaced and adding a new coat of paint was begun. Also added was a deck with safety railing, a fence between the station & the railroad and a garden area in the location of the old station footing.|$|E

40|$|Six Asian {{elephants}} at the Oregon Zoo {{were observed}} {{to determine the}} effects of a <b>poured</b> rubber <b>flooring</b> substrate on captive Asian elephant behavior. Room utilization also was evaluated in seven rooms used for indoor housing, including Front and Back observation areas. Data were collected in three phases. Phase I (Baseline Phase) examined elephant behavior on old concrete floors. In Phase II (Choice Phase), elephant behavior was observed in the Back observation area where room sizes were comparable and when a choice of flooring substrates was available. Phase III (Final Phase) examined elephant behavior when all rooms in both observation areas, Front and Back, were converted to rubberized flooring. Room use in both observation areas remained stable throughout the study, suggesting that flooring substrate did not affect room use choice. However, there was a clear pattern of decreased discomfort behaviors on the new rubber flooring. Normal locomotion as well as stereotypic locomotion increased on the new rubber flooring. In addition, resting behavior changed to more closely reflect the resting behavior of wild elephants, which typically sleep standing up, and spend very little time in lateral recumbence. Overall, these findings suggest that the rubber flooring may have provided a more comfortable surface for locomotion as well as standing resting behavior. It is suggested that <b>poured</b> rubber <b>flooring</b> may be a beneficial addition to similar animal facilities. Zoo Biol 26 : 51 – 61, 2007...|$|R
50|$|The Avalon Theater is a Historic Art Deco style Movie theater {{located in}} the {{commercial}} district of Larimore, North Dakota, United States. Built in 1938 as a 350-seat theater, the Avalon's most significant feature is its Art Deco detailing, especially the marquee, box office, and entry doors and continuing with simple Art Deco geometry motifs in the interior, all of which has survived. The building is constructed of brick with a parabolic <b>poured</b> concrete <b>floor</b> in the seating area to ensure a good view for all. The building still functions as a movie theater, with its original projectors, and also is home to local live theater groups.|$|R

50|$|Constructing {{the units}} in two stages {{balanced}} affordability and quality. The new Polish immigrants, {{as soon as}} they could afford to do so, would purchase a small one-story or story-and-a-half cottage, or sometimes build one on a vacant lot with minimum cost, with modest Victorian Gothic or Queen Anne façade. When they saved again, they would then raise the frame up on jacks creating a partially sunken basement, excavate the area underneath, <b>pour</b> concrete <b>floor,</b> build foundation walls with masonry (usually concrete blocks), then set the old frame back down over the new apartment. While highly unorthodox, it was an ingenious technique of building new accommodations without disrupting family life, in line with their growing wealth.|$|R
50|$|The former Rutland Railroad Pumping Station {{stands on}} the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, at the western end of Lake Street. It is a modest {{rectangular}} brick building, with a gabled roof and stone foundation. The north-facing front is three bays wide, with a doorway in the left bay and rectangular window openings to the right. All of the building openings have been boarded over. The window openings are set in what were once round openings for pipes, as evidenced by infill brickwork. The interior of the building is single open space with a <b>poured</b> concrete <b>floor.</b> Equipment, most dating to the mid-20th century, is located at the southern end. It includes a gasoline motor, electric motor, and water pump.|$|R
50|$|The Harpring Storage Warehouse {{features}} a steel frame and <b>poured</b> concrete <b>floor.</b> The steel supports provide a very open floor plan, ideal for {{the storage of}} thousands of hogsheads. Each section is 190 feet long and 110 feet wide. In some of the warehouse sections, the corrugated metal siding has been sprayed with insulation. Sections of walls feature fiberglass instead of metal cladding; this additional light complemented the skylights present in each section. Five of the warehouse sections contain four large skylights each. A one-story, shed roofed detached brick boiler room {{is located at the}} west end of the warehouse and {{on the east side of}} the warehouse, the property {{features a}} freestanding 1000 square foot building used as a former guard house. This building housed two full-time security guards. The guard house is made exclusively of brick and a concrete ceiling/roof.|$|R
50|$|In {{northern}} cities, gutted skyscrapers {{and buildings}} {{are filled with}} rainwater and snow. Rain <b>pours</b> through <b>floors</b> and rots ceilings. The changing seasons only adds pressure to the buildings. Rainwater seeps into cracks in concrete columns, pillars, and walls, and then it freezes in winter before thawing again in spring. These repeated freeze-thaw cycles split and crack concrete. Metal bars inside concrete gave it its strength, but when water reaches the bars, they expand and crack the concrete. Finally, the support columns give way and the buildings topple. The upper floors rain down, smashing lower floors until the buildings crumble to the ground. Most buildings suffer the same fate. Skyscrapers around the world begin to collapse. Concrete structures such as train stations begin to fall down as the roofs give way and the support columns break.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{anchor bolt}} is a cast-in-place anchor. As {{seen in the}} figure, most designs consist of a standard bolt with a hexagonal head, which is cast in the wet concrete before it sets. There are other designs, some consisting of a bent bolt with a hook on the end, or some other sort of bending. Cast-in-place anchor bolts are the strongest type of fastener, but the casting is difficult, and they are usually only used for heavy machines mounted on <b>poured</b> concrete <b>floors.</b> Another use of this anchor bolt is to connect the concrete foundation of a building to its wall. With this, the building is more resistant to earthquakes. Currently there are several devices to assist in holding and in placing anchor bolt to set in the concrete. These devices are mostly made from composite plastic.|$|R

25|$|The funding request {{fared better}} in 1966. Once again, the House Appropriations Committee cut the administration's $45.7 million funding request in May. But {{with the land}} for the {{structure}} almost completely cleared, GSA would be left holding an empty lot if funding was not forthcoming. This prompted Congress to act. In October, a House-Senate budget conference committee recommended spending $11.3 million to excavate and build the foundation and to <b>pour</b> the first <b>floor's</b> concrete slab.

Integrated counts were taken with the FIDLER probes fixed in place on a systematic grid across the area to be evaluated. The results were then superimposed on a drawing of the area of evaluation. This approach allowed the boundaries of the regions with subsurface contamination to be resolved much better than by using standard survey techniques and decreased the number of borehole samples and subsequent analyses. The study demonstrated that this survey technique provides rapid and essential characterization information and reduces sampling, analytical, and remediation costs. 1...|$|R
