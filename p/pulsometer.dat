40|$|Abstract Background Very {{few studies}} have {{analysed}} heart rate (HR) with regard to music playing, and the scarce evidence available is controversial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse the HR response of professional musicians during their real-work activity. Methods Sixty-two voluntary professional musicians (20 women, 42 men), whose ages ranged between 15 and 71 years old, underwent the test while playing their instruments in real life scenarios, i. e. rehearsals, practice and public concerts. The musicians carried Sport Tester PE 4000 (Polar ®, Finland) <b>pulsometers</b> to record their HR. In order to compare data from differently aged subjects we calculated their Maximum Theoretical Heart Rate (MTHR). Later on we found out the MTHR percentages (%MTHR) corresponding to the registered HR of each subject in different situations. The value of the MTHR for every musician was obtained by means of the 220 – age (in years) formula. Results Throughout the HR recordings, we have observed that musicians present a heightened HR while playing (in soloists, mean and maximum HR were 72 % and 85 %MTHR, respectively). Cardiac demand is significantly higher in concerts than in rehearsals while performing the same musical piece. The HR curves corresponding to the same musician playing in repeated concerts (with the same programme) were similar. Conclusion The cardiac demand of a professional instrument player is higher than previously described, much greater than what would be expected from a supposedly sedentary activity. </p...|$|R

In Central America, manual {{sugarcane}} cutting is exhausting work {{known to}} have a high metabolic load and to be associated with many occupational hazards including insect bites, snake bites, inhalation of particulate matter, pesticide exposure, physical violence and eye injuries resulting from a number of factors including sudden and repetitive body movements, intense work pace and extreme physical exertion. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of acelerometer methodologies for upper limb postures and the calculation of metabolic rate from heartrate as an assessment of manual cane cutting during the pilot phase of the “Worker Health and Efficiency” (WE) program in El Salvador. This was done through 1) a description of relevant working conditions for the use of assessment methodologies or designing experiments in cane cutters during the WE program; 2) analysis of accelerometers to determine positions of the upper extremity work of cane cutters and 3) evaluation of a methodology for determining metabolic rate from the heart rate measurement. The WE Program includes, among other components: water supply through use of water “backpacks”, programed breaks in the shade during the shift, supervised food (lunch) and replacing the cutting technique with a methodology used in Australia. A total of 52 people were observed, of which 12 were evaluated for working postures. Of these, 8 were part of the posture sample together with 42 other workers. A description of working conditions included clothing, footwear, personal protective equipment, transport, rest, water, and land conditions. Given the high loss of accelerometer data, {{it was not possible to}} complete the analysis of postures. However, the data obtained is reported to guide the next steps of the project. According to data obtained, personal factors (examples: fitness, productivity) or environmental (examples: soil type, growth parameters cane, high temperature) may be affecting the metabolic rate of workers, possibly explaining or producing considerable variation in metabolic rates in the task of cutting sugarcane. The qualitative description of working conditions was insufficient to create exposure indicators. Heartrate measurements taken with <b>pulsometers</b> for estimating metabolic rate may be an appropriate technique given the working conditions. Finally, specific changes are recommended for experimental design and data collection protocol for the estimation of working postures using the accelerometer methodology.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} of external and internal training load (TL) indicators with the objective and subjective fatigue experienced by 15 semi-professional football players, over eight complete weeks of the competition period in the 2015 – 2016 season, which covered microcycles from 34 th to 41 st. The maximum heart rate (HRmax) and maximum speed (Vmax) of all the players were previously measured in specific tests. The TL was monitored via questionnaires on rating of perceived exertion (RPE), <b>pulsometers</b> and GPS devices, registering the variables: total distance (TD), player load 2 D (PL 2 D), TD at > 80 % of the Vmax (TD 80), TD in deceleration at 2 m⋅sec- 2 (TDA > 2), Edwards (ED), time spent at between 50 and 80 % (50 – 80 % HRmax), 80 – 90 % (80 – 90 % HRmax), and > 90 % of the HRmax (> 90 % HRmax), and RPE both respiratory/thoracic (RPEres) and leg/muscular (RPEmus). All the variables were analyzed taking into account both the absolute values accumulated over the week and the normalized values in relation to individual mean competition values. Neuromuscular fatigue was measured objectively using the countermovement jump test and subjectively via the Total Quality Recovery (TQR) scale questionnaire. Analytical correlation techniques were later applied within the general linear model. There is a correlation between the fatigue experienced by the player, assessed objectively and subjectively, and the load accumulated over the week, this being assessed in absolute and relative terms. Specifically, the load relative to competition correlated with the physical variables TD (- 0. 279), PL 2 D (- 0. 272), TDD 2 (- 0. 309), and sRPEmus (- 0. 287). The variables related to heart rate produced a higher correlation with TQR. There is a correlation between objectively and subjectively assessed fatigue and the accumulated TL of a player over the week, with a higher sensitivity being shown when compared to the values related to the demands of competition. Monitoring load and assessing fatigue, we are closer to knowing what the prescription of an adequate dose of training should be in order for a player to be as fresh as possible and in top condition for a match. Normalizing training demands with respect to competition could be an appropriate strategy for individualizing player TL...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pulsometer</b> {{steam pump}} is a pistonless pump which was {{patented}} in 1872 by American Charles Henry Hall. In 1875 a British engineer bought the patent {{rights of the}} <b>Pulsometer</b> and it {{was introduced to the}} market soon thereafter. The invention was inspired by the Savery steam pump invented by Thomas Savery. Around the turn of the century, it was a popular and effective pump for quarry pumping.|$|E
50|$|Several later pumping {{systems may}} {{be based on}} Savery's pump. For example, the twin-chamber <b>pulsometer</b> steam pump was a {{successful}} development of it.|$|E

5000|$|The Norcot Water Tower, {{built at}} the end of the 19th century, is {{somewhat}} older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the <b>Pulsometer</b> Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road.|$|E
5000|$|Kellow {{was known}} as a [...] "fearless innovator", and set about modernising the quarry operation. The first problem that he faced was that the quarry below the level of the main adit had filled with water in the 17 years that it had been closed. Twelve {{chambers}} were submerged, and there were two sumps each holding some [...] of water. Local opinion was that a new tunnel, {{at the level of the}} lowest chamber, would need to be cut, and a London-based engineer had calculated that <b>pulsometer</b> pumps could empty it in about six months. As the rails on the main incline to the lower chambers were still in place, Kellow mounted a large centrifugal pump on a platform, which he lowered down the rails as water levels fell. It could pump 340000 imp gal per hour, and he drained the entire quarry in around a week. His innovation also covered working practices. Traditionally, Welsh slate mines were worked by teams of four men, consisting of two rockmen, who worked in a chamber below ground, and two mill men, who processed the slate blocks produced by the rockmen. Kellow introduced a new system, in which two-man teams of rockmen supplied slabs to the mill, where independent two-man teams worked, who were allocated slabs by ballot. This enabled the mill to be run at full capacity most of the time, with productivity rising by 25 per cent in the first month after it was introduced. Initial resistance from the quarrymen was overcome as they saw their wages rising significantly.|$|E
50|$|A good {{explanation}} can {{be found}} in the 1901 article referenced below: The operation of the <b>pulsometer</b> is as follows: The ball being at the entrance of the left-hand chamber, and the right-hand being full of water, steam enters, pressing on the surface of the water, and forcing it out through the discharge passage. A rapid condensation of steam occurs from contact with the water and with the walls of the chamber, previously cooled by the water. When the water level has reached the horizontal edge of the discharge passage, a large volume of steam suddenly escapes and is at once condensed by the relatively cold water between the chamber and the discharge valve. The pressure in the chamber quickly decreases; it cannot be sustained by steam from the boiler, for, in accordance with the inventor's first specifications, the steam pipe is small. If now the pressure in the left chamber is equal, or nearly equal, to that in the right, friction caused by the rapid flow of steam past the ball will draw the ball over and close the right-hand chamber. Cut off from further supply, the steam, in contact with water, begins to condense; a jet of cold water from the discharge pipe spurts up through the injection tube, and by breaking into spray against the side of the steam space, completes the condensation. The partial vacuum produced brings water through the suction valve to fill the chamber; but at the same time the air valve admits a little air, which passes up ahead of the water and forms an elastic cushion to prevent the water from striking violently against the steam ball. The air chamber is for the purpose of preventing water-hammer in the suction pipe.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 July 1891, Wolfratshausen {{station was}} opened as the {{terminus}} of the Isar Valley Railway. The reception building {{was built to}} the west of the tracks. Opposite the station building, on the other side of the station forecourt, there was a station restaurant. As the terminus of the line, a depot with three track was built to the north of the station. To the west of the depot there was a roundhouse with one stall. This had a <b>Pulsometer</b> steam pump for lifting water. Shortly before the roundhouse there was a coal shed, where coal was stored for the steam locomotives. The station had three platform tracks and another, which was intended for the carriage of freight. The freight facilities were at the southern end of the fourth track. There was a freight shed, with ramps at the side and at the front for loading freight, and a weighbridge with a capacity of 20 tonnes. Construction began on 25 August 1896 on the extension of the Isar Valley Railway to Bichl. The line to Eurasburg was opened on 1 June 1897 and it extended to Bichl to connect with the State Railway from Tutzing to Kochel on 23 May 1898. Wolfratshausen station continued to be significant for railway operations, since carriages were detached from trains coming from Munich and added to trains returning to Munich. The extension of the line to Eurasburg also led to the development of the tracks within the station area. So an additional siding was built {{to the west of}} the freight shed. No later than 1909, a turntable with a diameter of 6.5 metres was built on the first track from the carriage house. In addition, the capacity of the carriage weighbridge in front of the freight shed was raised from 20 to 30 tons. Also later than 1909 a watering point was established, which was connected at both ends to allow the operation of through passenger trains; this was supplied from the local water supply. East of the wagon shed, a rail connection was built to the icehouse of the Eberl-Faber brewery. From 1909, track 3 was no longer used for passenger trains, but on the Munich side of the station building an additional bay track was built. [...] Wolfratshausen station had no importance in the First World War and so it was not damaged. Only the ever-increasing losses of the LAG after 1915 affected operations on the Isar Valley Railway. Thus from 1915 fewer trains were run on the railway and only third class accommodation was offered between Wolfratshausen and Munich. Eleven pairs of trains did not run each day between Munich and Wolfratshausen again until the end of 1933; this was made possible by financial support from the municipalities and the reduction the parallel bus services. On 1 August 1938, the nationalisation of the LAG was agreed and it was then acquired by Deutsche Reichsbahn.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} is to define the effects of external (gravitational field) and internal factors on {{the functioning of the}} “shooter-weapons-aim” system. Materials and methods: the paper studied the shooters’ motor actions during the execution of exercises in trainings and at competitions. To characterize the shooter’s functional state, the study analyzed the work of the cardiovascular system, which was quantitatively characterized of the heart beat rate dynamically recorded on a Polar RS 800 <b>pulsometer</b> with second-by-second time discretization. Results: The paper reviews the shooters’ complex coordination movements with regard to the systems within which energy and information exchange takes place against gravitational interactions. It used the relation between the system entropy variable and data entry. The increase in the information volume entered in the system from complementary sources conditions the decrease in the system uncertainty.   Conclusions: the proposed approach allows to apply the general methods of research to studies of the “shooter-weapons-aim” system functioning with regard to energy-information and gravitational interaction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: High {{intensity}} {{interval training}} (HIIT) effects on {{heart rate and}} lactate concentration have been widely documented in male and female athletes. However, there few reports focused to study the dynamics of these cardiac and metabolic markers during the different phases of the menstrual cycle. PURPOSE: The aim of this studywas analyze the dynamics of heart rate and lactate concentration during a HIIT protocol in the different phases of the menstrual cycle (MC) in young eumenorrheic athletes women. METHODS: Two young skater athletes (14. 5 ± 0. 7 yrs.) with regular menstrual cycles were recruited. The normality of the cycle was measured with a menstrual calendar. The estimated VO 2 max was assessed in an electrically braked cycle ergometer (Lode) using a graded exercise test. The HIIT protocol consisted of 12 sessions of 6 high intensity intervals at 80 % VO 2 max, and 6 rest intervals at 40 % VO 2 max. Basal and post-exercice heart rate (HR) and lactate concentrations (LC) were measured with a <b>pulsometer</b> (polar FT 1) or test strips (Nova Biomedical), respectively. The MC was divided in six phases: Early follicular (EF), Mid follicular (MF), Late follicular (LF), Early luteal (EL), Mid luteal (ML) and Late luteal (LL), using the date since their first menstrual discharge as {{the start of the}} EF phase. RESULTS: There was a significative correlation between HR and LC (r: 0. 37, p: 0. 0034) throughout the 12 HIIT sessions, but this was not statistically significant in EF (r: 0. 36, p: 0. 21), MF (r: 0. 86, p: 0. 12), LF (r: 0. 14, p: 0. 68), ML (r: 0. 04, p: 0. 92) and LL (r: 0. 67, p: 0. 06). Interestingly, we did observe a highly significant correlation between HR and LC (r = 0. 68, p = 0. 0033) in the EL phase, characterized by rising progesterone levels and a transient decrease of estradiol concentrations. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that the normal fluctuation of steroid hormone levels during the menstrual cycle can affect the dynamics of HR and LC in eumenorrheic athletes...|$|E
