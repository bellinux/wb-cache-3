5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each press stroke. On the press downstroke the automation which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the bottom of the stroke the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the press cycles upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the <b>press</b> <b>ram,</b> then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the top of its stroke, the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|E

50|$|Vegetable {{fats and}} oils are what are most {{commonly}} called vegetable oils. These are triglyceride-based, and include cooking oils like canola oil, solid oils like cocoa butter, oils used in paint like linseed oil and oils used for industrial purposes. Pressed vegetable oils are extracted from the plant containing the oil (usually the seed), using one of two types of oil press. The most common is the screw press, which consists of a large-diameter metal screw inside a metal housing. Oil seeds are fed into the housing, where the screws mash the seeds, and create pressure which forces the oil out through small holes {{in the side of}} the press. The remaining solids, called seed cake, are either discarded or used for other purposes. Oil presses can be either manual or powered.
