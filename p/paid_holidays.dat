5|$|As senator, Ford has {{introduced}} many bills {{with only a}} small number becoming law, but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as <b>paid</b> <b>holidays.</b> Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve race relations in South Carolina.|$|E

The most obvious change was in the political arena. A considerable degree of press freedom was restored, the PLH and other groups were allowed to organize, and even some labor organization was permitted. Labor also benefited from legislation during this period.

25|$|United Kingdom {{labour law}} regulates the {{relations}} between workers, employers and trade unions.

The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days <b>paid</b> <b>holidays,</b> breaks from work, and attempts to limit excessively long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the right to leave for child care, and the right to request flexible working patterns.

40|$|I {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the UK Working Time Regulations 1998, which introduced mandatory <b>paid</b> <b>holiday</b> entitlement. The regulation gave (nearly) all workers the right to a minimum of 4 weeks of <b>paid</b> <b>holiday</b> per a year. With constant weekly pay this change amounts effectively to an increase in the real hourly wage of about 8. 5 % for someone going from 0 to 4 weeks <b>paid</b> <b>holiday</b> per year, which should lead to adjustments in employment. For employees I use complementary log-log regression to account for right-censoring of employment spells. I find no increase in the hazard to exit employment within a year after treatment. Adjustments in wages cannot explain this result as they are increasing for the treated groups relative to the control. I also {{evaluate the}} long run trend in aggregate employment, using the predicted treatment probabilities in a difference-in-difference framework. Here I find a small and statistically significant decrease in employment. This effect is driven by a trend reversal in employment, coinciding with the treatment.

25|$|In April 1982, UAW members {{approved}} the concessionary contract Bieber negotiated. Initially, GM agreed to link wage concessions to {{reductions in the}} price of its vehicles, but this {{was not part of the}} eventual agreement. The contract concessions were (at the time) the largest ever made to GM. The workers agreed to forgo an annual 3 percent wage increase, eliminated nine <b>paid</b> <b>holidays</b> over the next two years, deferred cost of living adjustments in the first three months of the contract to the final three quarters of the contract, established a wage tier that paid new employees 20 percent less, and implemented fines for chronic absenteeism. The union also agreed to negotiate over work rules at the local level. In return, GM agreed to keep four plants open which it had planned to close, agreed to a two-year moratorium on plant closings, established profit sharing, established a prepaid legal service program for its employees, and promised that if it laid off workers with 15 years or more of job experience it would pay them 50 percent of their annual salary. The pact was only narrowly approved, however (114,468 for and 105,090 against), even though UAW members at Ford Motor Company had approved a similar pact by a 3-to-1 margin.|$|E

A [...] "Hop Control Centre" [...] was set up at Paddock Wood to organise these services, ensuring that hoppers could alight at London Bridge and be taken directly to the nearest hop farm. Since the hopping season generally coincided {{with the end of}} the holiday season, most serviceable trains were already in use elsewhere, so spare rolling stock would be brought out of storage and pressed into service for just three weeks; sometimes carriages had to be borrowed from other parts of the country. The carriages tended to be old or in poor condition, since the hoppers had a reputation for drunkenness and violence. This traffic was however already in decline as rising living standards and <b>paid</b> <b>holidays</b> led to a decline in the hop-picker workforce, and many of those who remained chose to travel by car or van. By 1959 the Sunday service consisted of a single two-coach unit, with an evening working to London Bridge. As mechanical pickers gradually replaced the human workforce, hop-picking had become a memory by the time the branch closed in 1961.|$|E
