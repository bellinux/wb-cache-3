The next day it moved to Google which almost immediately cancelled its registration for violation of terms, also terminating the website's YouTube account. The following day, the website registered with Tucows, who canceled it hours later for regularly inciting violence. On August 15, it was announced by weev that the site {{had moved to the}} dark web, and that it was now only accessible via Tor, while Facebook banned links to the site and Discord banned its channel. On August 16, Cloudflare, the DNS provider and <b>proxy</b> <b>service</b> used to protect The Daily Stormer also terminated their service. Cloudflare had traditionally refused to terminate sites based on their content, but CEO Matthew Prince made an exception, posting a public announcement and explanation on the company blog. The Daily Stormer now receives DDoS protection from a content distribution network set up in March 2017, BitMitigate. The company's founder, Nick Lim, said that he found The Daily Stormer to be [...] "stupid" [...] but believed in freedom of expression.|$|E

This paper describes an experimental study in the design of adaptive <b>proxy</b> <b>services</b> for resource-limited mobile hosts. The approach is based on detachable Java I/O streams, which enable proxy filters and transcoders to be dynamically inserted, deleted, and reordered on a given data stream. Unlike conventional Java I/O streams, detachable streams can be stopped, disconnected, reconnected, and restarted. As such, they provide the "glue" needed to to support the dynamic composition of <b>proxy</b> <b>services.</b> The operation and implementation of detachable streams are described, followed by a discussion of their use in demand-driven forward error correction services for wireless hosts...|$|R
40|$|When Internet domain {{names are}} {{registered}} for malicious purposes the registrants {{are unlikely to}} want their identity {{to be published in}} the Whois system.

We also show that there is substantial use of privacy and <b>proxy</b> <b>services</b> for domain names registered for several types of lawful and harmless activity, but once again there are wide variations in the percentages involved. Our study is by far the largest to look at Whois information, making our results robust and giving a sound basis for our suggestions as to why the differences we measure may be occurring. ...|$|R

The piece on a stationary computer is called a <b>service</b> <b>proxy.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>proxy</b> filters or caches data from servers before transmitting the data to the piece on a mobile computer. These two pieces are constructed by composing small objects whose composition can be dynamically reconfigured by adding or removing replaceable devices.
