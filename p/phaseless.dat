60|$|DURING {{the fall}} of the year 1827, while {{residing}} near Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. I found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his age--although I call him a young gentleman--there was something which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed young--and he made a point of speaking about his youth--yet there were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and low. His complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy--of a <b>phaseless</b> and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.|$|E

Important applications of phase retrieval include X-ray crystallography, transmission electron microscopy and coherent diffractive imaging, for which [...] (Fienup 1982:2759) Uniqueness theorems for both 1-D and 2-D cases of the phase retrieval problem, including the <b>phaseless</b> 1-D inverse scattering problem, were proved by Klibanov and his collaborators (see References).|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we shall review the (phased) inverse {{scattering}} problem and then pursue the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction from far-field data {{with the help}} of the concept of scattering coefficients. We perform sensitivity, resolution and stability analysis of both phased and <b>phaseless</b> problems and compare the degree of ill-posedness of the phased and <b>phaseless</b> reconstructions. The <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction is highly nonlinear and much more severely ill-posed. Algorithms are provided to solve both the phased and <b>phaseless</b> reconstructions in the linearized case. Stability is studied by estimating the condition number of the inversion process for both the phased and <b>phaseless</b> cases. An optimal strategy is suggested to attain the infimum of the condition numbers of the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction, which may provide an important guidance for efficient <b>phaseless</b> measurements in practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, the stability analysis in terms of condition numbers are new for the phased and <b>phaseless</b> inverse scattering problems, and are very important to help us understand the degree of ill-posedness of these inverse problems. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical asymptotic behavior, as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction algorithm...|$|E

Over the years, many people have replaced the term <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction with phase retrieval. Casazza then asked: Are these really the same? In this paper, we will show that phase retrieval is equivalent to <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction. We then show, more generally, that phase retrieval by projections is equivalent to <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction by projections. Finally, we study weak phase retrieval and discover that it is very different from <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction...|$|E

In this paper, we consider the <b>phaseless</b> super-resolution problem of recovering a sum of sparse Dirac delta functions which can be located anywhere in the continuous time-domain. For such signals in the continuous domain, we propose a novel Semidefinite Programming (SDP) based signal recovery method to achieve the <b>phaseless</b> superresolution.

40|$|Phase {{retrieval}} and <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction for Hilbert space frames is a {{very active}} area of research. Recently, it was shown that these concepts are equivalent. In this paper, we make a detailed study of a weakening of these concepts to weak phase retrieval and weak <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction. We will give several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for frames to have these weak properties. We will prove three surprising results: (1) Weak <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction is equivalent to <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction. I. e. It never was "weak"; (2) Weak phase retrieval is not equivalent to weak <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction; (3) Weak phase retrieval requires at least $ 2 m- 2 $ vectors in an m-dimensional Hilbert space. We also gives several examples illustrating {{the relationship between these}} concepts...|$|E

40|$|The pressure-induced {{structural}} {{phase transition}} from diamond to beta-tin in silicon {{is an excellent}} test for theoretical total energy methods. The transition pressure provides a sensitive measure of small relative energy changes between the two phases (one a semiconductor {{and the other a}} semimetal). Experimentally, the transition pressure is well characterized. Density-functional results have been unsatisfactory. Even the generally much more accurate diffusion Monte Carlo method has shown a noticeable fixed-node error. We use the recently developed <b>phaseless</b> auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to calculate the relative energy differences in the two phases. In this method, all but the error due to the <b>phaseless</b> constraint can be controlled systematically and driven to zero. In both structural phases we were able to benchmark the error of the <b>phaseless</b> constraint by carrying out exact unconstrained AFQMC calculations for small supercells. Comparison between the two shows that the systematic error in the absolute total energies due to the <b>phaseless</b> constraint is well within 0. 5 mHa/atom. Consistent with these internal benchmarks, the transition pressure obtained by the <b>phaseless</b> AFQMC from large supercells is in very good agreement with experiment.

40|$|Sampling in shift-invariant spaces is a {{realistic}} model for signals with smooth spectrum. In this paper, we consider <b>phaseless</b> sampling and reconstruction of real-valued signals in a shift-invariant space from their magnitude measurements {{on the whole}} Euclidean space and from their <b>phaseless</b> samples taken on a discrete set with finite sampling density. We introduce an undirected graph to a signal and use connectivity of the graph to characterize whether the signal can be determined, up to a sign, from its magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space. Under the local complement property assumption on a shift-invariant space, we find a discrete set with finite sampling density such that signals in the shift-invariant space, that are determined from their magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space, can be reconstructed in a stable way from their <b>phaseless</b> samples taken on that discrete set. In this paper, we also propose a reconstruction algorithm which provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal when its noisy <b>phaseless</b> samples are available only. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the robust reconstruction of box spline signals from their noisy <b>phaseless</b> samples...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the modulus of the {{far-field}} pattern (or <b>phaseless</b> far-field pattern) is invariant under translations of the scattering obstacle if only one plane wave is used as the incident field, so the shape but not the location of the obstacle can be recovered from the <b>phaseless</b> far-field data. In this paper, it is proved that the translation invariance property of the <b>phaseless</b> far-field pattern can be broken if superpositions of two plane waves are used as the incident fields for all wave numbers in a finite interval. Based on this, a recursive Newton-type iteration algorithm in frequencies is then developed to recover both the location and the shape of the obstacle simultaneously from multi-frequency <b>phaseless</b> far-field data. Numerical examples are also carried out to illustrate the validity of the approach and the effectiveness of the inversion algorithm.

40|$|We {{consider}} faithfully combining phase retrieval with classical compressed sensing. Inspired by {{the recent}} novel formulation for phase retrieval called PhaseMax, we present and analyze SparsePhaseMax, a linear program for <b>phaseless</b> compressed sensing in the natural parameter space. We establish that when provided with an initialization that correlates with an arbitrary k-sparse n-vector, SparsePhaseMax recovers this vector up to global sign with high probability from O(k n/k) magnitude measurements against i. i. d. Gaussian random vectors. Our proof of this fact exploits a curious newfound connection between <b>phaseless</b> and 1 -bit compressed sensing. This is the first result to establish bootstrapped compressed sensing from <b>phaseless</b> Gaussian measurements under optimal sample complexity...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{retrieval}} is {{to recover}} the signals from <b>phaseless</b> measurements which is raised in many areas. A fundamental problem in phase retrieval {{is to determine the}} minimal measurement number $m$ so that one can recover $d$-dimensional signals from $m$ <b>phaseless</b> measurements. This problem attracts much attention of experts from different areas. In this paper, we review the recent development on the minimal measurement number and also raise many interesting open questions...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{recently}} developed <b>phaseless</b> auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method {{can be used to}} study excited states, providing an alternative to standard quantum chemistry methods. The <b>phaseless</b> AFQMC approach, whose computational cost scales as M^ 3 -M^ 4 with system size M, {{has been shown to be}} among the most accurate many-body methods in ground state calculations. For excited states, prevention of collapse into the ground state and control of the Fermion sign/phase problem are accomplished by the approximate <b>phaseless</b> constraint with a trial wave function. Using the challenging C 2 molecule as a test case, we calculate the potential energy curves of the ground and two low-lying singlet excited states. The trial wave function is obtained by truncating complete active space wave functions, with no further optimization. The <b>phaseless</b> AFQMC results using a small basis set are in good agreement with exact full configuration interaction calculations, while those using large basis sets are in good agreement with experimental spectroscopic constants.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of signal {{reconstruction}} from intensity measurements with respect to a measurement frame. This non-convex inverse problem is known as phase retrieval. The case considered in this paper concerns <b>phaseless</b> measurements taken with respect to a Gabor frame. It arises naturally in many practical applications, such as diffraction imaging and speech recognition. We present a reconstruction algorithm that uses a nearly optimal number of <b>phaseless</b> time-frequency structured measurements and discuss its robustness in the case when the measurements are corrupted by noise. We show how geometric properties of the measurement frame are related to the robustness of the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction. The presented algorithm is based on the idea of polarization as proposed by Alexeev, Bandeira, Fickus, and Mixon. Comment: 28 pager, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|We study <b>phaseless</b> {{sampling}} in spline spaces {{generated by}} B-splines with arbitrary knots. For real spline spaces, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for {{a sequence of}} sampling points to admit a local phase retrieval of any nonseparable function. We also study <b>phaseless</b> sampling in complex spline spaces and illustrate that phase retrieval is impossible in this case. Nevertheless, we show that <b>phaseless</b> sampling is possible. For any function $f$ in a complex spline space, no mater it is separable or not, we show that $|f(x) |^ 2 $ is uniquely determined and can be recovered linearly from its sampled values at a well chosen sequence of sampling points. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for such sequences. Comment: 24 page...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{stability}} of the ℓ_ 1 minimization for the compressive phase retrieval and to extend the instance-optimality in compressed sensing to the real phase retrieval setting. We first show that the m= O(k(N/k)) measurements is enough to guarantee the ℓ_ 1 minimization to recover k-sparse signals stably provided the measurement matrix A satisfies the strong RIP property. We second investigate the <b>phaseless</b> instance-optimality with presenting a null space property of the measurement matrix A under which there exists a decoder Δ so that the <b>phaseless</b> instance-optimality holds. We use the result to study the <b>phaseless</b> instance-optimality for the ℓ_ 1 norm. The results build a parallel for compressive phase retrieval with the classical compressive sensing...|$|E

Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phaseless</b> super-resolution is {{the problem}} of reconstructing a signal from its low-frequency Fourier {{magnitude}} measurements. It is the combination of two classic signal processing problems: phase retrieval and super-resolution. Due to the absence of phase and high-frequency measurements, additional information is required {{in order to be able}} to uniquely reconstruct the signal of interest. In this work, we use masks to introduce redundancy in the <b>phaseless</b> measurements. We develop an analysis framework for this setup, and use it to show that any super-resolution algorithm can be seamlessly extended to solve <b>phaseless</b> superresolution (up to a global phase), when measurements are obtained using a certain set of masks. In particular, we focus our attention on a robust semidefinite relaxation-based algorithm, and provide reconstruction guarantees. Numerical simulations complement our theoretical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinearity causes {{information}} loss. The phase retrieval problem, or the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction problem, {{seeks to}} reconstruct {{a signal from}} the magnitudes of linear measurements. With a more complicated design, convolutional neural networks use nonlinearity to extract useful features. We can model both problems in a frame-theoretic setting. With {{the existence of a}} noise, it is important to study the stability of the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction and the feature extraction part of the convolutional neural networks. We prove the Lipschitz properties in both cases. In the <b>phaseless</b> reconstruction problem, we show that phase retrievability implies a bi-Lipschitz reconstruction map, which can be extended to the Euclidean space to accommodate noises while remaining to be stable. In the deep learning problem, we set up a general framework for the convolutional neural networks and provide an approach for computing the Lipschitz constants...|$|E

They include the transition state of H+H$_ 2 $ near the equilibrium geometry and in the van der Walls limit, as well as H$_ 2 $O, OH, and H$_ 2 $O$_ 2 $ molecules. Most of these systems present significant challenges for traditional independent-particle electronic structure approaches, and many also have exact results available.

For some systems, calculations are done with both to compare and characterize the performance of AF QMC under different basis sets and different Hubbard-Stratonovich decompositions. Excellent results are obtained using as input single Slater determinant wave functions taken from independent-particle calculations.

40|$|Phase {{retrieval}} {{arises in}} various fields {{of science and}} engineering and it is well studied in a finite-dimensional setting. In this paper, we consider an infinite-dimensional phase retrieval problem to reconstruct real-valued signals living in a shift-invariant space from its <b>phaseless</b> samples taken either on the whole line or on a set with finite sampling rate. We find the equivalence between nonseparability of signals in a linear space and its phase retrievability with <b>phaseless</b> samples taken on the whole line. For a spline signal of order $N$, we show {{that it can be}} well approximated, up to a sign, from its noisy <b>phaseless</b> samples taken on a set with sampling rate $ 2 N- 1 $.

40|$|The many {{variants}} of the restricted isometry property (RIP) {{have proven to}} be crucial theoretical tools in the fields of compressed sensing and matrix completion. The study of extending compressed sensing to accommodate <b>phaseless</b> measurements naturally motivates a strong notion of restricted isometry property (SRIP), which we develop in this paper. We show that if A ∈R^m× n satisfies SRIP and <b>phaseless</b> measurements |Ax_ 0 | = b are observed about a k-sparse signal x_ 0 ∈R^n, then minimizing the ℓ_ 1 norm subject to |Ax| = b recovers x_ 0 up to multiplication by a global sign. Moreover, we establish that the SRIP holds for the random Gaussian matrices typically used for standard compressed sensing, implying that <b>phaseless</b> compressed sensing is possible from O(k (n/k)) measurements with these matrices via ℓ_ 1 minimization over |Ax| = b.

Two methods of synthesizing complex antenna patterns are also discussed and their performances are evaluated.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with uniqueness in inverse acoustic scattering with <b>phaseless</b> far-field data at a fixed frequency. The main difficulty of this problem is the so-called translation invariance property of the modulus of the far-field pattern generated by one plane wave as the incident field. Based on our previous work (J. Comput. Phys. 345 (2017), 58 - 73), the translation invariance property of the <b>phaseless</b> far-field pattern can be broken by using infinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves as the incident fields at a fixed frequency. In this paper, we prove that the obstacle and the index of refraction of an inhomogeneous medium can be uniquely determined by the <b>phaseless</b> far-field patterns generated by infinitely many sets of superpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a fixed frequency {{under the condition that}} the obstacle is a priori known to be a sound-soft or non-absorbing impedance obstacle and the index of refraction n of the inhomogeneous medium is real-valued and satisfies that either n- 1 > c_ 1 or n- 1 <-c_ 1 in the support of n- 1 for some positive constant c_ 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first uniqueness result in inverse scattering with <b>phaseless</b> far-field data. Our proofs are based essentially on the limit of the normalized eigenvalues of the far-field operators which is also established in this paper by using a factorization of the far-field operators...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phaseless</b> {{diffraction}} measurements {{recorded by}} a CCD detector are often affected by Poisson noise. In this paper, we propose a dictionary learning model by employing patches based sparsity to denoise Poisson <b>phaseless</b> measurement. The model {{consists of three}} terms: (i) A representation term by an orthogonal dictionary, (ii) an $L^ 0 $ pseudo norm of coefficient matrix, and (iii) a Kullback-Leibler divergence to fit <b>phaseless</b> Poisson data. Fast Alternating Minimization Method (AMM) and Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) are adopted to solve the established model with convergence guarantee, and especially global convergence for PALM is derived. The subproblems for two algorithms have fast solvers, and indeed, the solutions for the sparse coding and dictionary updating both have closed forms due to the orthogonality of learned dictionaries. Numerical experiments for phase retrieval using coded diffraction and ptychographic patterns are performed to show the efficiency and robustness of proposed methods, which, by preserving texture features, produce visually and quantitatively improved denoised images compared with other phase retrieval algorithms without regularization and local sparsity promoting algorithms.
