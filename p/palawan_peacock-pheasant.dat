In {{the forests and}} grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of {{butterflies}} flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches. Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than {{any other part of}} the country and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron napoleonis) is a {{medium-sized}} (up to 50 cm long) {{bird in the}} family Phasianidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasants</b> {{are strong}} fliers. Their flight is swift, direct and sustained.|$|R
50|$|In captivity, hooded pittas {{mix well}} with other species {{although}} they may be aggressive toward other pittas when breeding. In London Zoo they are kept in a large walk-through aviary in the restored Blackburn Pavilion bird house, while at the Durrell Wildlife Park {{they are in a}} large walk-through exhibit with birds such as <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasants</b> and white-rumped shamas.|$|R
25|$|Dragons in Danger also houses various Indonesian and Philippine {{rainforest}} birds, such as <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasants,</b> pheasant pigeons, Montserrat orioles and Visayan tarictic hornbills. Recently added {{was a pair}} of Philippine mouse deer {{which have}} successfully bred. Also housed here are Ploughshare tortoises, collared iguanas and Montserrat Tarantulas which Chester bred in 2016 {{for the first time in}} captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include Socorro doves, Mindanao bleeding-hearts, Papuan lorikeets and Saint Lucia parrots.|$|R
50|$|Endemic to the Philippines, the <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> {{is found}} in the humid forests of Palawan Island in the {{southern}} part of the Philippine archipelago.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} culture of the indigenous peoples of Palawan. The bird is also depicted in the official seal of the city of Puerto Princesa.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{at the zoo}} include African red-billed hornbill, bald eagle, black-throated magpie-jay, blue-bellied roller, green-winged macaw, guira cuckoo, king vulture, kookaburra, <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> Panama yellow-crowned amazon, silvery-cheeked hornbill, spotted thick-knee, tawny frogmouth, wreathed hornbill, violaceous turaco.|$|E
25|$|Aviaries and vivaria are {{arranged}} around {{the sides of}} the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for birds of paradise and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one pure-bred and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasants,</b> Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, Mindanao bleeding-hearts Green Aracari and Luzon Scops Owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbird.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>peacock-pheasants,</b> <b>Palawan</b> {{males and}} some females exhibit {{multiple}} spurs on the metatarsus. These {{are used in}} anti-predator defense, foraging in leaf litter and contests with other males. The male Palawan excavates slight depressions in which it orients its body during postural display behaviors. The bird vibrates loudly via stridulation of retrice quills. This communicative signal is both audible and {{as a form of}} seismic communication.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} phenotypically similar Malayan peacock-pheasant and -Palawan peacock-pheasant it {{represents}} a basal group in its genus; their radiation probably {{took place during the}} PlioceneBeing very poorly known, the Bornean peacock-pheasant was long considered to be a subspecies of the Malayan peacock-pheasant, but the two species are well-isolated geographically. The highly specialised anterior breast and upper neck plumage of male Bornean peacock-pheasant males are quite distinctive. Females of the two species are more difficult to distinguish. The retrices of the Bornean species are morphologically and patterned intermediate between <b>Palawan</b> and Malayan <b>peacock-pheasants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size and limited range {{as well as}} hunting and capture for trade, the <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is classified as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
5000|$|... mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G sequence data places the Malayan peacock-pheasant within the basal radiation of its genus, together with the even more elusive Bornean peacock-pheasant (P. schleiermacheri) [...] - [...] and <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (P. napoleonis). The common ancestor of the Malay peacock-pheasants probably diverged from its relatives during the Pliocene or maybe Late Miocene, about 5 million years ago (Ma) perhaps.|$|E
50|$|The {{surrounding}} forested landscape {{consists of}} primarily dipterocarp trees such as narra, ipil, apitong, dao, kamagong and mancono. It is inhabited by several animal species unique to Palawan, including the Palawan binturong, Palawan pangolin, Palawan stink badger, Palawan treeshrew and Palawan porcupine. A number of endemic bird species {{are also found}} in the protected area like the <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> Palawan hornbill, Tabon scrubfowl, talking myna and Philippine cockatoo. Its forest also hosts the Philippine long-tailed macaque, Asian palm civet and the critically endangered Philippine forest turtle.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Palawan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> {{with its}} unique male plumage and distant range, {{represents}} a basal (Early? Pliocene, c.5-4 mya) {{offshoot of the}} genus Polyplectron (Kimball et al. 2001). The species is widely accepted to be monotypic, but while some males have white supercillia, giving a [...] "double-barred" [...] or masked appearance, others lack this trait, exhibiting dark faces, taller, denser crests and prominent white cheek spots. The birds with white supercillia are sometimes classified as a distinct subspecies, nehrkornae. The white-cheeked form may inhabit deep forest habitat with low ambient light in rolling terrain whilst the masked form appears to inhabit taller, more open forest on flatter terrain with higher ambient light. This masked form exhibits an abbreviated, more tightly compacted and highly iridescent crest. Females of the two respective forms exhibit analogous differentiation. The female of the masked form is more prominently patterned and densely crested with paler contour plumage.|$|E
