5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the <b>pie</b> <b>crust</b> to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large fat crystals found in lard, it is extremely effective as a shortening in baking. <b>Pie</b> <b>crusts</b> made with lard tend to be flakier than those made with butter. Many cooks employ both types of fat in their pastries to combine the shortening properties of lard with the flavor of butter.|$|R

6000|$|For the Bumpus family, supper {{that evening}} was an unusually {{harmonious}} meal. Hannah's satisfaction {{over the new}} stove had by no means subsided, and Edward ventured, without reproof, to praise the restored quality of the <b>pie</b> <b>crust.</b> And in contrast to her usual moroseness and self-absorption, even Lise was gay--largely because her pet aversion, the dignified and allegedly amorous Mr. Waiters, floor-walker at the Bagatelle, had fallen {{down the length of}} the narrow stairway leading from the cashier's cage. She became almost hysterical with glee as she pictured him lying prone beneath the counter dedicated to lingerie, draped with various garments from the pile that toppled over on him. [...] "Ruby Nash picked a brassiere off his whiskers!" [...] Lise shrieked. [...] "She gave the pile a shove when he landed. He's got her number all right. But say, it was worth the price of admission to see that old mutt when he got up, he looked like Santa Claus. All the girls in the floor were there we nearly split trying to keep from giving him the ha-ha. And Ruby says, sympathetic, as she brushed him off, 'I hope you ain't hurt, Mr. Waiters.' He was sore! He went around all afternoon with a bunch on his coco as big as a potato." [...] So vivid was Lise's account of this affair which apparently she regarded as compensation for many days of drudgery-that even Hannah laughed, though deploring a choice of language symbolic of a world she feared and detested.|$|E

50|$|Baking blind (sometimes called pre-baking) is {{the process}} of baking a <b>pie</b> <b>crust</b> or other pastry without the filling.

It is also called for if the filling has a shorter bake time than the crust, in which case the crust is partly baked. Blind baking is also used to keep <b>pie</b> <b>crust</b> from becoming soggy due to a wet filling.|$|E

5000|$|Lard can be {{obtained}} from any part of the pig where there is a high concentration of fatty tissue. The highest grade of lard, known as leaf lard, is obtained from the [...] "flare" [...] visceral fat deposit surrounding the kidneys and inside the loin. Leaf lard has little pork flavor, making it ideal for use in baked goods, where it is valued for its ability to produce flaky, moist <b>pie</b> <b>crusts.</b> The next-highest grade is obtained from fatback, the hard subcutaneous fat between the back skin and muscle of the pig. The lowest grade (for purposes of rendering into lard) is obtained from the soft caul fat surrounding digestive organs, such as small intestines, though caul fat is often used directly as a wrapping for roasting lean meats or in the manufacture of pâtés.|$|R
