40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the possibility to}} use ground sensing technologies that can be employed directly in vineyards. The aim of this work is to evaluate contemporarely the canopy health and vigour status of vines {{through the use of}} a mobile monitoring system; this, in order to investigate the possibility to realize a pathological diagnosis in vineyards. To achieve this objective optical and analogue devices were tested: a) GreenSeeker RT 100, a commercial optical device calculating NDVI in real time; b) ultrasonic sensors for canopy thickness estimation. A DGPS receiver was employed for geo-reference data collected while travelling in the vineyards. Tests were conducted in a commercial vineyard which included rows treated and non-treated with agrochemicals. Data coming from the automatic monitoring were compared to manual morphological and physiological observations carried out to characterize the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of the canopy. Optical data were processed in order to obtain NDVI maps. They clearly showed differences in canopy vigour evolution in the two examined groups, and low vegetative vigour in areas infected by Plasmopara viticola (as confirmed by manual assessment). Maps of percentage infection index (I%I) were produced according to pathological manual survey results. The comparison between I%I and NDVI maps confirmed, at a qualitative level, the real vine <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status.</b> The integration of UCT and NDVI values allows the identification of diseased vineyard areas among zones presenting critical vegetation conditions...|$|E

40|$|With a {{management}} {{in accordance with}} the EU minimum requirements, the number of fire blight outbreaks will probably increase over a five year period.

It is also likely that outbreaks of fire blight could become present in all regions of the country where host plants are cultivated. VKM estimate that the uncertainty in this assessment is low. VKM is of the opinion that the frequency of fire blight attacks in commercial fruit production will be limited under the current climate conditions, perhaps in line with the extent of damage caused by the fungal diseases scab and fruit tree canker. Consequences for nurseries, parks, private gardens, etc: If implementing the EU minimum requirements for domestic management of fire blight in Norway, the corresponding management action to be taken against a disease outbreak is estimated to have low efficacy.

40|$|These {{guidelines}} describe technical {{procedures that}} {{minimize the risk}} of pest introductions with movement of cacao germplasm for research, crop improvement, plant breeding, exploration or conservation. The recommendations made in these guidelines are intended for small, specialized consignments used in research programmes, e. g. for collection, conservation and utilization for breeding of plant genetic resources. These guidelines are not meant for trade and commercial consignments concerning export and import of germplasm or cocoa beans. The conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources and their global distribution are essential components of research activities underpinning improvement programmes. Inevitably, the movement of germplasm involves a risk of accidentally introducing pests along with the host plant. To minimize such risks, preventive measures and effective testing procedures are required to ensure that distributed material is free of pests of potential phytosanitary importance. The international, and inter-regional, movement of germplasm for research, conservation and breeding requires complete and up to date information concerning the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of the plant germplasm.

40|$|Increasing {{international}} trade and tourism have led {{to an increase in}} the introduction of exotic pests that pose a considerable economic threat to the agro-ecosystems of importing countries. Scale insects (Sternorryncha: Coccoidea) may be contaminants of export consignments from the South African deciduous fruit industry to the European Union, Israel, United Kingdom and the United States, for example. Infestations of immature scale insects found on South African fruit destined for export have resulted in increasing rates of rejection of such consignments. To identify the risk posed by scale insect species listed as phytosanitary pests on table grapes to the abovementioned importing countries, a field survey was undertaken in 2004 – 2005 in vineyards throughout all grape-producing regions in South Africa. Coccoidea species found during the current field survey were Planococcus ficus (Signoret), Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti), Coccus hesperidum L. and Nipaecoccus viridis (Newstead). With the exception of Pl. ficus, which has only been collected from Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae) and Ficus carica (Moraceae) in South Africa, these species are polyphagous and have a wide host range. None of the scale insect species found to occur in vineyards in South Africa pose a phytosanitary risk to countries where fruit are exported except for Ferrisia malvastra (McDaniel) and N. viridis that have not been recorded in the USA.

Some of these pests have threatened even the viability of citrus in Sao Paulo State, like Huanglongbing (HLB) that was responsible for eradicating 18 million plants between January 2005 and July 2012. This requires development of new methods to control the disease and ensure the economic viability of the activity. This study aimed to analyze {{costs and benefits of}} a broad control of HLB in the state (66 % of orchards are inspected and have HLB-symptomatic trees eradicated) and compare this scenario to another one representing a lower level of control (reference scenario, considering that only 26 % of orchards manage HLB and proceed the eradication). We chose the Benefit-Cost Analysis to evaluate the differences between scenarios.   Losses caused by HLB comprised a reduction in productivity, elimination of infected plants and increase in production costs (due to inspections, insecticide applications, tree elimination and replanting). Costs and benefits were calculated according to state’s <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> in 2010. The epidemiological model proposed by Bassanezi & Bassanezi (2008) was used to project the disease progress, crop loss damage, the citrus orchard size, orange production and producers’ costs of production to control the disease over 20 years. The ratio B/C was estimated at 4. 07 accumulated for the whole period.

40|$|Rhagoletis completa Cresson (Diptera: Tephritidae) is {{native to}} North America and invaded Western Europe in the late 1980 s, causing {{important}} damage to its principal host, walnut (Juglans spp.). In this review, we summarize the important elements of R. completa’s biology, <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> and methods used in Europe for its control, and then present the main conclusions associated with a completed risk analysis performed in 2014 to evaluate the dispersion and establishment potential of R. completa in Europe. The walnut husk fly was initially identified in Switzerland (1988) and Italy (1991), from where it spread to at least seven additional countries: France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary. R. completa has not reached the limits of its potential distribution. The main dissemination pathways within Europe include: (1) natural adult dissemination; (2) adult hitchhiker behaviour; and, to a lesser extent, (3) transportation of larvae in fresh fruits. R. completa host plants are widely distributed in Europe, either as isolated wild trees or in orchards, favouring the probability of fly establishment in currently fly-free areas. In addition, the European territories where Juglans species are present share biogeographic similarities. In orchards where R. completa is present and uncontrolled, 100 % of walnut trees can be infested, causing losses in walnut yields of up to 80 %. The negative effect is low (< 10 % yield loss) under phytosanitary control, although additional costs {{must also be considered}} to support specific monitoring for R. completa. The information presented here underlines a strong need for better walnut husk fly monitoring across European countries, as well as for increasing efforts to develop biological methods to control this emerging pest.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Phialophora cinerescens (Wollenweber) van Beyma (the causal agent of Phialophora carnation wilt) for the EU territory, identified risk management options and evaluated their effectiveness. The risk assessment was conducted {{taking into account}} current EU legislation. The Panel also provided an opinion {{on the effectiveness of}} the present EU requirements against this organism, listed in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Four pathways for entry were identified. Plants for propagation (rooted and unrooted cuttings of host plants) were considered as a major pathway. Entry via this pathway was rated as unlikely because of the effective disease prevention techniques for cuttings now in place in places of production. P. cinerescens has been found in most Member States but with few occurrences or restricted distribution. In some Member States the pest was eradicated. Owing to current cultural practices and control measures, establishment in areas in which the pest was not previously present is considered very unlikely. For the same reasons, the probability of infection of crops is strongly reduced and hence the probability of spread to areas where the pest was not previously present is very unlikely. Similarly, the impact on carnation is at the moment minimal and unlikely to increase in the future. Risk reduction options to reduce the probability of entry and spread and mitigate the impact were evaluated; those addressing the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of the propagation material were considered to be the most effective and feasible (e. g., the officially accepted carnation certification system for source planting material), including the current regulations laid down in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC.

The bulk of these accessions were requested after 2005 and the majority of respondents found it from very easy to easy to access germplasm. Desirable traits most sought by users are high yield and resistance to pests and diseases. Major constraints associated with the distributed accessions were their <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> and the limited number of seeds provided by GRC. Recommendations were made to upgrade the genebank infrastructure in order to respond to high demand and address the quality issue of accessions. The capital cost represented the big share of the total cost for both cowpea and wild Vigna. Yearly activities of regeneration of accessions and distribution were the major components of operational costs. Increasing the number of accessions {{in order to reduce the}} unit cost and upgrading and expanding the current infrastructure would contribute to the efficiency of the IITA genebank. A World Bank funded project aiming at the rehabilitation of the CGIAR’s genebank has initiated such changes...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that organic amendments may reduce crop losses caused by soil borne plant pathogens. Most {{of the studies}} conducted so far were related to short term effects observed in vegetable cropping systems. The long term effects of compost or manure amendments in field cropping systems has been investigated in Australia and, concerning Rhizoctonia solani diseases on wheat, inconsistent results were reported. Two large field experiments were set up in 1996, at Le Rheu and la Jaillière (France), to {{study the effects of}} organic fertilization in wheat and maize production. In 2006, {{at the end of the}} experiments, soil was sampled to assess the effects of the organic matter fertilization on the soil inoculum potential and soil suppressiveness to diseases caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt, take all) and R. solani. Bioassays were set up in growth chamber, using wheat and carrots to measure soil inoculum potential and soil suppressiveness to Ggt and R. solani, respectively. A pathological index was used to evaluate the disease severity caused by Ggt on wheat and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated to quantify the disease severity caused by R. solani. ANOVA was used to compare the data. At both locations, the inoculum potential of the soils naturally infested by Ggt was low and similar in plots amended with different organic matters and mineral fertilization. The level of soil suppressiveness to take-all was high in plots amended with organic matter compared to the low level after mineral fertilisation. This suggests that organic amendments preserved the suppressive ability of the soil towards take all when a wheat/maize rotation is performed. Concerning R. solani, the soil inoculum potential was reduced in plots amended with organic matters, but only at La Jaillière not at Le Rheu. At both 2 locations, soil suppressiveness to R. solani damping-off was not affected by organic amendments. There were neither clear positive nor detrimental effects of organic fertilisation in a wheat/maize rotation. Therefore organic matter can be used to improve soil fertility without any negative effects on the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of soil...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is a soil-borne {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} crown and root rot of many horticultural, ornamental and forestry crops. It preferentially attacks 'feeder' roots. The geographical origin of P. cinnamomi is not clearly established. It was first described on Cinnamonum burmannii (Lauraceae) in Sumatra (ID) in 1922, but {{now has a}} nearly worldwide distribution, including most of Europe (CABI. 1991). The pathogen is found in tropical and subtropical countries and in the Mediterranean and some mild, temperate regions where it has almost certainly been introduced (EPPO/CABI, l 998). P. cinnamomi is the most widely distributed Phytophthora species, with over 1000 host species (Zentmeyer, 1983). The most significant food-crop losses due to P. cinnamomi root rot occur in avocado but the pathogen also attacks Ananas comosus, Castanea dentata and C. sativa, Cinchona spp., Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Cinnamomum spp., conifers, Ericaceae (including Rhododendron spp.), Eucalyptus spp., especially E. marginata. Fagus spp., Juglans spp., Pinus spp., Prunus spp., Quercus spp. and many ornamental trees and shrubs, including Vaccinium macrocarpon. It has caused extensive damage to natural Eucalyptus Forest in Western Australia. The recorded host range includes most of the temperate fruit trees, {{but these are not}} relevant hosts in practice. In the EPPO region, the most significant hosts are nursery stock of ornamental and amenity trees and avocados, in the limited areas where they are grown. It has been reported to be the main causal agent of ink disease of C. sativa in southern France and has been indicated as a possible causal agent of oak decline in the Iberian Peninsula. Propagules are spread by soil movement, including wind-blow or debris, or by water flow and run-off in drainage/irrigation ditches. Control is complicated by the very wide host range {{as well as by the}} longevity (often many years) of propagules (mainly sporangia and encysted zoospores) in nonsterile moist soil and root debris at depths at which soil fumigation is not always effective (Munnecke, 1984). Symptomless plants are a major means of spreading the pathogen to disease-free areas and this is the main problem for intensive production systems in the nursery industry. The first line of control is therefore planting disease-free stock. Imported plants for planting should be kept well separated in nurseries and preferably grown in containers for several months until their <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> has been checked.

40|$|Control of {{the citrus}} pest, false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) {{is crucial for}} the South African citrus industry. The {{economic}} losses and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of this pest, coupled with increased consumer awareness and demands, has created a need for effective, IPM-compatible control measures for use against the soil-dwelling life stages of FCM. Promising developments {{in the field of}} microbial control through the use of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) have highlighted the need for research regarding pupation biology, behaviour and survival of FCM, as a good understanding of biology of the target organism is an important component of any biological control programme. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the current understanding of FCM pupation habits through the manipulation of soil texture class, ground cover, shading, soil compaction, air temperature, and soil moisture in the laboratory. These findings would then be used to aid the biological control programmes using EPF and EPNs against FCM in the soil. Three soil texture classes (sandy loam, silt loam and silty clay loam) were obtained from orchards for use in the study. FCM larvae were allowed to drop into the soil of their own accord and the pupation behaviour that followed was then captured on film with pupae formed in the soil being kept in order to measure adult eclosion. In general, very few abiotic factors had a clear influence on FCM pupation. Larval wandering time and distance was short, but also variable between individuals. Distance did increase when soils were moist. Pupation depth was shallow, with pupal cocoons generally being formed on the soil surface. Depth of pupation was less than one centimetre for all abiotic conditions, with little burrowing into soil. Eclosion success was higher for sandier soils when these were dry and uncompacted, but the addition of both moisture and soil compaction increased FCM eclosion success. FCM was sensitive to desiccation when the soils were dry and temperature limits of 15 °C and 32 °C had a strongly negative impact on eclosion success. Preferences for particular abiotic conditions were limited to only certain moisture conditions when interacting with soil texture class and a preference for pupating in soil when it is available. Limited preference was found for particular soil textures despite this having a strong influence on eclosion success, but individuals did appear to pupate in close proximity to one another. Viable direct habitat manipulation for FCM control could not be identified. These results and all of the abiotic variables measured have important implications for EPF and EPN application, survival and persistence in the soil in order to improve the ability of these biological control agents to control FCM. These are discussed in each chapter...|$|E
40|$|Ponencia presentada en el 11 th International Verticillium Symposium, celebrado en Göttingen (Alemania) del 5 al 8 de mayo de 2013. Plants {{have evolved}} {{strategies}} of stimulating and supporting specific groups of antagonistic microorganisms in the rhizosphere {{as a defense}} against diseases caused by soilborne plant pathogens. Disease suppressive soils provide {{the best examples of}} this strategy. Suppressive soils have been described worldwide for many different pathogens, however for the fungal pathogen Verticillum dahliae the information is very scarce. Olive (Olea europaea L.) {{is one of the most}} important crops in Spain with > 2. 4 million ha. During the last two decades the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of olive orchards is being threatened mainly due to Verticillium wilt. In previous studies a collection of rhizosphere soils from 90 olive orchards under different management systems and three rhizosphere soils from wild olive havens in Andalusia were characterized by their level of suppressiveness to Verticillium wilt. Results indicated that at least 25 % of soils showed a high level of suppressiveness to Verticillium wilt. The objective of this study was to unravel the biotic and abiotic factors that may be associated with this phenomenon. For that purpose we selected a set of suppressive and conducive soils and have performed some “Classical” approaches to identify the biotic factors (microorganisms) involved in this specific suppression that included: 1) Transferring suppressiveness by adding small amounts of suppressive soil to conducive soil which have confirmed its biological nature. 2) Treating suppressive soil with heat to eliminate specific groups of microorganism which have demonstrated loss of suppressiveness at a certain level. 3) Isolating different microbial groups and correlating their presence with suppressiveness. 4) Screening representatives of microbial groups for in vitro and biocontrol activity against the target pathogen. In a second step using molecular approaches such as bar-coded pyrosequencing we have characterized all bacterial communities associated to the rhizosphere of plants growing in those selected soils. Sequences generated from pyrosequencing of rRNA gene amplicons with the GS Junior system (Roche) were processed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME 1. 6. 0) pipeline. Flowgrams were clustered into OTUs at 97 % pairwise identity using the seed-based UCLUST algorithm, and representative sequences from each OTU were aligned to the Greengenes bacteria database using PyNAST. In addition, α diversity and β diversity metrics together with rarefaction plots were also calculated to determine the bacterial population structure in those soils. Different multivariate analyses have allowed identifying some climatic parameters and physicochemical soil characteristics that are differentially associated to the level of suppressiveness of those soils as well as to determine which OTUs are specially enriched in the suppressive soils. Furthermore, specific OTUs have been identified as being transferred from the suppressive into the conducive soils in the ‘transferability experiment’ which might be associated as the OTUs being responsible of this transferable suppressive effect. Finally, experiments are being conducted to determine the influence of the indigenous microbiota on inducing plant defense mechanisms in olive plants grown in those suppressive soils. For that purpose both microarray and metagenomic sequencing of total DNA will be used to unravel genes differentially expressed or present under the suppressive conditions. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In July 2011, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L.) in an orchard in Binissalem (Mallorca Island, Spain). Fungal isolation was performed on a 40 -year-old apricot trees (cv. Galta Vermella, double-grafted onto bitter almond and Japanese plum) showing a collapse of branches, chlorosis of leaves, and shoot dieback. These symptoms appeared in approximately 10 % of the trees. Black spots and dark streaking of the xylem vessels were observed in cross- or longitudinal sections of the branches. Symptomatic branches were collected and wood sections (10 cm long) were cut, washed under running tap water, surface-disinfested for 1 min in a 1. 5 % sodium hypochlorite solution, and washed twice with sterile distilled water. The sections were split longitudinally, and small pieces of discolored tissues were plated onto malt extract agar (MEA) supplemented with 0. 5 g liter− 1 of streptomycin sulfate. Dishes were incubated at 25 °C {{in the dark for}} 14 to 21 days, and all colonies were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA). A Phaeoacremonium sp. was consistently isolated from necrotic tissues (more than 50 % of the isolations). Single conidial isolates were obtained and grown on PDA and MEA in the dark at 25 °C for 2 to 3 weeks until colonies produced spores (3). Colonies were brownish orange on PDA and MEA. Conidiophores were short and occasionally branched, and 26 to 35 (avg. 29) μm long. Phialides were terminal or lateral, mostly monophialidic. Conidia were hyaline, oblong-ellipsoidal or fusiform-ellipsoidal, 3 to 4 (avg. 3. 9) μm long, and 1 to 1. 5 (avg. 1. 2) μm wide. Based on these characters, the isolates were identified as Phaeoacremonium venezuelense L. Mostert, Summerb. & Crous (2, 3). DNA sequencing of a fragment of the beta-tubulin gene of the isolate 9. 3 using primers T 1 and Bt 2 b (GenBank Accession No. KF 765487) matched P. venezuelense GenBank accession HQ 605026. Pathogenicity tests were conducted using isolate 9. 3. Ten 2 -year-old apricot trees of cv. Galta Rotja grown in pots were wounded in two branches with a 8 -mm cork borer. A 5 -mm mycelium PDA plug from a 2 -week-old culture was placed in the wound before being wrapped with Parafilm. Ten control plants were inoculated with 5 -mm non-colonized PDA plugs. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25 to 30 °C. Within 5 months, shoots on all Phaeoacremonium-inoculated branches had weak growth with chlorosis of leaves and there were black streaks in the xylem vessels. The vascular necroses that developed on the inoculated plants were 5. 5 ± 0. 6 cm long, significantly greater than those on the control plants (P < 0. 01). Control plants did not show any symptoms. The fungus was re-isolated from discolored tissue of all inoculated cuttings, completing Koch's postulates. P. venezuelense was reported as a pathogen of grapevines in Algeria (1) and South Africa (2) and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of P. venezuelense associated with wood decay of apricot trees in Spain or any country in the world.

40|$|Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) was {{described}} {{for the first}} time in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) about seven decades ago. Tanganyika (now Tanzania) about seven decades ago. It was endemic in the lowland areas of East Africa and inland parts of Malawi and caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV; genus Ipomovirus; Potyviridae). However, in 1990 s CBSD was observed at high altitude areas in Uganda. The causes for spread to new locations were not known. The present work was thus initiated to generate information on genetic variability, clarify the taxonomy of the virus or viruses associated with CBSD in Eastern Africa as well as to understand the evolutionary forces acting on their genes. It also sought to develop a molecular based diagnostic tool for detection of CBSD-associated virus isolates. Comparison of the CP-encoding sequences of CBSD-associated virus isolates collected from Uganda and north-western Tanzania in 2007 and the partial sequences available in Genbank revealed occurrence of two genetically distinct groups of isolates. Two isolates were selected to represent the two groups. The complete genomes of isolates MLB 3 (TZ:Mlb 3 : 07) and Kor 6 (TZ:Kor 6 : 08) obtained from North-Western (Kagera) and North-Eastern (Tanga) Tanzania, respectively, were sequenced. The genomes were 9069 and 8995 nucleotides (nt), respectively. They translated into polyproteins that were predicted to yield ten mature proteins after cleavage. Nine proteins were typical in the family Potyviridae, namely P 1, P 3, 6 K 1, CI, 6 K 2, VPg, NIa-Pro, NIb and CP, but the viruses did not contain HC-Pro. Interestingly, genomes of both isolates contained a Maf/HAM 1 -like sequence (HAM 1 h; 678 nucleotides, 25 kDa) recombined between the NIb and CP domains in the 3 ’-proximal part of the genomes. HAM 1 h was also identified in Euphorbia ringspot virus (EuRSV) whose sequence was in GenBank. The HAM 1 gene is widely spread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) it is known to be a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) pyrophosphatase. Novel information was obtained on the structural variation at the N-termini of polyproteins of viruses in the genus Ipomovirus. Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) and Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV) contain a duplicated P 1 (P 1 a and P 1 b) but lack the HC-Pro. On the other hand, Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV), has a single but large P 1 and has HC-Pro. Both virus isolates (TZ:Mlb 3 : 07 & TZ:Kor 6 : 08) characterized in this study contained a single P 1 and lacked the HC-Pro which indicates unique evolution in the family Potyviridae. Comparison of 12 complete genomes of CBSD-associated viruses which included two genomes characterized in this study, revealed genetic identity of 69. 0 – 70. 3 % (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities of 73. 6 – 74. 4 % at polyprotein level. Comparison was also made among 68 complete CP sequences, which indicated 69. 0 - 70. 3 and 73. 6 - 74. 4 % identity at nt and aa levels, respectively. The genetic variation was large enough for dermacation of CBSD-associated virus isolates into two distinct species. The name CBSV was retained for isolates that were related to CBSV isolates available in database whereas the new virus described {{for the first time}} in this study was named Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV) by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV). The isolates TZ:Mlb 3 : 07 and TZ:Kor 6 : 08 belong to UCBSV and CBSV, respectively. The isolates of CBSV and UCBSV were 79. 3 - 95. 5 % and 86. 3 - 99. 3 % identitical at nt level, respectively, suggesting more variation amongst CBSV isolates. The main sources of variation in plant viruses are mutations and recombination. Signals for recombination events were detected in 50 % of isolates of each virus. Recombination events were detected in coding and non-coding (3 ’-UTR) sequences except in the 5 ’UTR and P 3. There was no evidence for recombination between isolates of CBSV and UCBSV. The non-synonomous (dN) to synonomous (dS) nucleotide substitution ratio (ω) for the HAM 1 h and CP domains of both viruses were ≤ 0. 184 suggesting that most sites of these proteins were evolving under strong purifying selection. However, there were individual amino acid sites that were submitted to adaptive evolution. For instance, adaptive evolution was detected in the HAM 1 h of UCBSV (n= 15) where 12 aa sites were under positive selection (P< 0. 05) but not in CBSV (n= 12). The CP of CBSV (n= 23) contained 12 aa sites (p< 0. 01) while only 5 aa sites in the CP gene of UCBSV were predicted to be submitted to positive selection pressure (p< 0. 01). The advantages offered by the aa sites under positive selection could not be established but occurrence of such sites in the terminal ends of UCBSV-HAMIh, for example, was interpreted as a requirement for proteolysis during polyprotein processing. Two different primer pairs that simultaneously detect UCBSV and CBSV isolates were developed in this study. They were used successfully to study distribution of CBSV, UCBSV and their mixed infections in Tanzania and Uganda. It was established that the two viruses co-infect cassava and that incidences of co-infection could be as high as 50 % around Lake Victoria on the Tanzanian side. Furthermore, it was revealed for the first time that both UCBSV and CBSV were widely distributed in Eastern Africa. The primer pair was also used to confirm infection in a close relative of cassava, Manihot glaziovii (Müller Arg.) with CBSV. DNA barcoding of M. glaziovii was done by sequencing the matK gene. Two out of seven M. glaziovii from the coastal areas of Korogwe and Kibaha in north eastern Tanzania were shown to be infected by CBSV but not UCBSV isolates. Detection in M. glaziovii has an implication in control and management of CBSD as it is likely to serve as virus reservoir. This study has contributed to the understanding of evolution of CBSV and UCBSV, which cause CBSD epidemic in Eastern Africa. The detection tools developed in this work will be useful in plant breeding, verification of the <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>status</b> of materials in regional and international movement of germplasm, and in all diagnostic activities related to management of CBSD. Whereas there are still many issues to be resolved such as the function and biological significance of HAM 1 h and its origin, this work has laid a foundation upon which the studies on these aspects can be based. Kassava on trooppisten alueiden merkittävimpiä ruokaturvakasveja. Kassavan ruskoviirutauti on levinnyt 2000 -luvulla Intian valtameren rannikkoalueilta sisämaan ja ylänköjen kassavaviljelmille Itä-Afrikassa. Tauti pilaa ravinnoksi käytettävät varastojuuret aiheuttaen niissä kuivamätää. Tässä tutkimuksessa havaittiin, että tauti liittyy kahden toisilleen lähisukuisen viruksen tartuntaan. Taudin aiheuttajina toimivien ipomovirusten genomien havaittiin olevan rakenteeltaan poikkeuksellisia muihin Potyviridae-ryhmään kuuluviin viruksiin verrattuna. Lisäksi virukset sisältävät todennäköisesti kasvisolusta kaapatun geenin. Sen toiminta saattaa liittyä viruksen tarpeeseen suojata genominsa hajotukselta kasveissa, jotka kärsivät esimerkiksi kuumuuden aiheuttamasta stressistä. Toinen viruksista havaittiin kassavalle lähisukuisessa, villinä kasvavassa lajissa, joka sekin on tuotu Afrikkaan Etelä-Amerikasta. Ruskoviirutautia aiheuttavien virusten diagnostiikkaa varten kehitettiin PCR-testi, joka tunnistaa molemmat virukset samanaikaisesti, mutta pystyy myös erottelemaan ne.

Molemmat virukset ja niiden sekainfektiot kassavassa havaittiin yleisiksi niin Ugandan kuin Tansaniankin viljelmillä. Tulokset tuottivat uutta tietoa virusten evoluutiosta. Tulokset edistävät myös merkittävästi kassavan ruskoviirutaudin leviämisen estämiseen tarvittavaa kasvintarkastustoimintaa, sillä toinen viruksista oli aiemmin tuntematon eikä kummallekaan virukselle ole ollut helppokäyttöistä testausmenetelmää...|$|E
