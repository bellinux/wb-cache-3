50|$|A {{clinician}} is {{a health}} care professional that works as a primary care giver of a patient in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, clinic, or patient's home.

40|$|Advancements in {{computer}} technology {{over the past twenty}} years have created ethical dilemmas and raised questions, some similar to other professions and some unique to the computer field. Therefore we think {{there is a need to}} reevaluate the application of ethical principles and establish new guidelines on ethical practices for the computer science profession. Because of the questions that have been raised&mdash;and, in some in-stances, sensational news accounts of computer irregularities, including fraud&mdash;there is a growing perception that self-regulation may be the only means by which the com-puter professional associations will prevent governments from stepping in and regu-lating the computer profession. This paper discusses the problem from two perspec-tives. First, the inadequacy <b>of</b> ethical <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> developed by computer professionals is assessed in light of recent reports of computer abuse. Second, the rela-tionship between the <b>professional</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and computer ethics education is examined.

To this end he established a propaganda section of the press office.

40|$|This {{research}} paper is meant as an exploratory empirical research project. The {{objective was to}} query {{a small sample of}} active community interpreters on a limited set of key dimensions concerning their own perception of the profession. Sixty anonymous self-report questionnaires were sent out via 12 interpreting agencies, generating nineteen responses. Because of its exploratory nature, the questionnaire was mainly made up of open-ended questions. These were subsequently conceptualized through content analysis by post-categorization. Three main themes were explored: the perception of the professional image and role of community interpreters, their views on quality and their views on a <b>professional</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and, specifically, on impartiality. The interpreters perceive themselves as having an important role in society and also as being perceived as such by others. But as yet that reality is not translated into due respect and appreciation, proper remuneration and legal recognition of the profession. Training, of community interpreters as well as of social workers, is seen as the most important and effective factor of a quality label for community interpreting, more so than the more formal elements of certification and registration. Formal education at Master’s level was deemed less important by our respondents. Supervision is seen as a valuable means of in-service training and general quality improvement. The respondents who already had some form of (basic or introductory) training were convinced that above all training and external assessment are necessary for quality improvement. The Flemish community interpreters seem to perceive of a <b>professional</b> <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> as mainly externally motivated: it is imposed and assessed by the interpreting agencies, through the evaluations of the other parties in the triad.
