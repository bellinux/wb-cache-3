5|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>ecology</b> is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time. The goals of <b>plant</b> <b>ecology</b> are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of <b>plant</b> <b>ecology.</b> Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early <b>plant</b> <b>ecology.</b> Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E

40|$|Ecology {{security}} {{is the basis}} of regional sustainable development. The authors constructed planting eco-security evaluation indicator system, which included resources, environment, social and economic. Based on standardization of method, weighted function method and obstacle degree method, using analytic hierarchy process (AHP), this paper conformed the weighted coefficient comprehensive analyzed planting eco-security degree of Shapingba District in Chongqing. The results are following: 1) from 1995 to 2010, the comprehensive index of <b>planting</b> <b>ecology</b> security increased from 0. 272 2 to 0. 647 7. 2) from 1995 to 2010, the obstacle degree of resources increased from 28. 83 % to 34. 39 %, but obstacle degree of environment declined from 46. 37 % to 21. 78 %, obstacle degree of eco-security declined from 24. 80 % to 9. 68 %. 3) to the <b>ecology</b> security of <b>planting,</b> there are some major limiting factors such as plough per capita, intensity of fertilizer using, intensity of pesticide using, intensity of film using and frequency of acid rain. Thus {{it can be seen that}} the security level of <b>planting</b> <b>ecology</b> is ascending year by year in Shapingba District since 1995.

5|$|The {{discipline}} of <b>plant</b> <b>ecology</b> was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{physiology}} is a subdiscipline of botany {{concerned with}} the functioning, or physiology, of plants. Closely related fields include plant morphology (structure of plants), <b>plant</b> <b>ecology</b> (interactions with the environment), phytochemistry (biochemistry of plants), cell biology, genetics, biophysics and molecular biology.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of {{environmental}} physiology {{is on the}} one hand a recent field of study in <b>plant</b> <b>ecology</b> {{and on the other hand}} one of the oldest. Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology, crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 Tansley, in {{conjunction}} with the British Vegetation Committee, organised the first International Phytogeographic Excursion (IPE). He was inspired by a plant geography tour of Switzerland organised by Swiss botanist Carl Schröter in 1908, which introduced him not only to vegetation types, but also to botanists from other countries. The connections made between Tansley and American ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements helped build a philosophical and methodological link between British and American <b>plant</b> <b>ecology.</b> Other attendees included Schröter, Swedish botanist Carl Lindman, and German botanists Oscar Drude and Paul Graebner. Tansley's book Types of British Vegetation was prepared with an eye to serving as a guide to the vegetation for the attendees of the first IPE. The second IPE in 1913 was hosted by Cowles. This brought Tansley to America.|$|E
500|$|... 20th century science {{grew out}} of the solid {{foundations}} laid by the breadth of vision and detailed experimental observations of the 19th century. A vastly increased research force was now rapidly extending the horizons of botanical knowledge at all levels of plant organization from molecules to global <b>plant</b> <b>ecology.</b> There was now an awareness of the unity of biological structure and function at the cellular and biochemical levels of organisation. Botanical advance was closely associated with advances in physics and chemistry with the greatest advances in the 20th century mainly relating to the penetration of molecular organization. However, at the level of plant communities it would take until mid century to consolidate work on ecology and population genetics.|$|E
