5|$|In February 2007, during {{pre-production}} for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros. hired {{husband and}} wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise. George Miller was hired to direct the following September, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later and Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul. Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed back over the Writer's Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> rebate over lack of Australian actors in the film. Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, but Warner Bros. ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight. Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's {{administration}} {{was confronted by}} the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional interest-bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, and it showed little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 <b>percent</b> <b>tax.</b> The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reviews the}} {{incidence}} of income taxation in Bangladesh tax system. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to determine how the burden of personal and corporation income taxes is allocated among taxpayers of different income groups. In case of personal income taxes it shows that only 13 percent taxpayers paying around 73 <b>percent</b> of <b>tax</b> revenue collected through personal income taxes and interestingly about 53 percent taxpayers pay only 0. 08 <b>percent</b> <b>taxes.</b> In case of corporation income taxes the study shows similar results. For privately owned unlisted companies only 25 percent of them bears about 84 <b>percent</b> <b>taxes</b> earned through this sector and about 13 percent corporations pay nothing to the exchequer in the form of income taxes. Among the listed companies only 1. 15 percent of them pay about 53. 28 <b>percent</b> <b>taxes</b> and top 40 percent of them pay the entire taxes collected from this sector. The reasons identified behind such eccentric burden of taxes are, unlimited tax exemptions and tax holidays, poor tax base, inequality of taxing urban and rural sectors, special privileges to the public sectors, repeated tax amnesty etc. This study gives some recommendations, which could act as remedies for a better income tax system in Bangladesh and would relevant to other developing countries as well...|$|R
25|$|On July 9, 2000, while {{speaking}} to the Russian Parliament, Putin advocated an economy policy which would have introduced a flat tax rate of 13% {{and a reduction in}} the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 24 percent. Putin also intended for small businesses to get better treatment under this economic reform package. Under Putin, the old system which included high tax rates has been replaced with a new system where companies can choose either a 6 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on gross revenue or a 15 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on profits.|$|E
25|$|In March 1965, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Oregon House of Representatives which would fund the Delta Dome by imposing a three <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on hotels {{and other forms of}} lodgings to out-of-state residents.

25|$|Again in 1967, President Johnson urged {{postponement}} of scheduled {{reductions in}} telephone excise taxes {{as part of}} his tax program designed to meet the rising cost of the war and increasing domestic needs. A joint Congressional resolution was approved which temporarily extended the 10 percent rate from March 31, 1968 until April 30, 1968. This temporary extension provided Congress time to complete action on the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968. The 1968 Act continued the 10 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> retroactively from April 30, 1968, until December 31, 1969, with provision for its subsequent reduction and repeal by calendar year 1973.|$|E

The 2.00 <b>percent</b> local <b>tax</b> rate cap is exceeded in any city with a combined sales tax rate in excess of 9.25% (7.25% statewide tax rate plus the 2.00% tax rate cap).

25|$|The Jesuits {{engaged in}} {{conflict}} with the episcopal hierarchy over the question of payment of tithes, the ten <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on agriculture levied on landed estates for support of the church hierarchy from bishops and cathedral chapters to parish priests. Since the Jesuits were the largest religious order holding real estate, surpassing the Dominicans and Augustinians who had accumulated significant property, this was no small matter. They argued that they were exempt, due to special pontifical privileges. In the mid-seventeenth century, bishop of Puebla, Don Juan de Palafox took on the Jesuits over this matter and was so soundly defeated that he was recalled to Spain, where he became the bishop of the minor diocese of Osma.|$|E
25|$|Following the undoing of the National Recovery Administration by the Schechter decision, Congress {{attempted}} {{to salvage the}} coal industry code promulgated under the National Industrial Recovery Act in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935. The act, closely following the criteria of the Schechter ruling, declared a public interest in coal production and found it so integrated into interstate commerce as to warrant federal regulation. The code subjected the coal industry to labor, price, and practice regulations, levying a 15 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on all producers with a provision to refund {{a significant portion of}} the tax for those adhering to the legislation's dictates. James Carter, shareholder and president of the Carter Coal Co., filed suit against the board of directors when they voted to pay the tax.|$|E

25|$|This 1863 act {{required}} nationally chartered {{banks to}} hold {{one third of}} the capital of the bank in US Treasury bonds. It allowed them in return to issue a uniform bank note backed by the bonds. The amount of the notes not to exceed 90 percent {{of the value of the}} bonds. It was intended to make banking safer and guarantee the value of bank notes to in effect create a nationwide currency. In 1865 the U.S. Congress enacted a 10 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on any bank or individual using state bank notes. As a result, a number of banks converted to national charters, but many simply stopped issuing notes. Instead, they began to issue demand deposit money—checking accounts. There was no state-banking act in Oregon until 1907 so other banks at the time (like the Ladd and Tilton) were strictly private proprietorships, without a board, taking deposits and lending money without regulation. The First National Bank in Portland was the exception.|$|E
25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you want to change the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E
25|$|Extending {{the earlier}} {{conscription}} of whites into the Confederate States Army, Congress now allowed impressment of slaves as military laborers. Army quartermaster and commissary officers were authorized to seize private property for army use, compensated at below market prices with depreciated currency. Not {{only did the}} Confederate States Congress anticipate the U.S. initiating a draft to conscript a mass army, it began an income tax fifty years before the U.S. Government, both monetary and in kind. A graduated income tax spanned one percent for monetary incomes under $500, to 15 percent for those over $1500, a 10 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> was levied on all profit from sale of foodstuffs, clothing and iron, and all agriculture and livestock were taxed 10 percent of everything grown or slaughtered. Congress authorized $500 million in bonds {{in an effort to}} stem inflation. But in a wartime economy, inflation went from 300 percent for a gold dollar to 2000 percent from January 1863 to January 1864, an inflation rate of over 600 percent in one year. The inflation rate discouraged investment in bonds, and only $21 million was retired from circulation.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Cunningham was {{challenged}} in his re-election campaign by Scott Ott, a Republican political newcomer {{associated with the}} conservative Tea Party movement. Ott accused Cunningham of avoiding a county tax increase only by depleting a tax relief fund established during Jane Ervin's administration, leaving the county {{in a position where}} future tax hikes would be necessary. For his part, Cunningham accused Ott of using scare tactics in his campaign and said he lacked the experience to lead the county. He also argued Republican county commissioners had actually increased spending. Cunningham defeated Ott in the general election by a voter count of 21,063 to 20,201, capturing 51 percent of the vote to Ott's 49 percent. In 2010, a 16.1 <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> increase was proposed as part of the county budget, with Cunningham said was necessary due to difficult financial times, but would avoid the need to sell assets, deplete savings, impose massive layoffs, or reduce government services {{to the point that the}} problem would grow worse in subsequent years. It was the first county tax increase since 2003. The budget was ultimately passed. In 2011, Ott was elected to the county's board of commissioners in 2011, along with a slate of fellow conservatives who ran together on a ticket of reform, which heavily criticized the 16 percent county tax increase during their campaigns.|$|E

500|$|As governor, Clements {{enjoyed a}} three-to-one Democratic {{majority}} {{in both houses}} of the state legislature. As a result, much of his proposed legislative agenda was passed. In the 1948 legislative session, the General Assembly attracted new businesses by lowering taxes on stocks and bonds and the inheritance tax, but offset these cuts by approving Clements' proposals to increase taxes on gasoline and distilled spirits. Clements also reversed his campaign stance against a tax on parimutuel betting, reportedly proposing a three <b>percent</b> <b>tax</b> because he feared a higher rate would be proposed if he did not take the initiative. With this new revenue, Clements authorized $6million to improve and expand the state park system. The improvement program included twelve large parks and several smaller ones, with Kentucky Dam Park being the centerpiece. To oversee the developments, he appointed Henry Ward as commissioner of conservation. Between 1948 and 1950, New York was the only state that spent more than Kentucky on its park system. Clements was one of several people who have been referred to as the [...] "father of Kentucky's state parks". Although the park system was started in 1926 by Willard Rouse Jillson, Clements did much to develop them during his administration.|$|E
