25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is when I began to write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{particularly}} virulent {{territorial dispute}} {{revolved around the}} final status of Jerusalem. [...] Leaders were ill-prepared for the central role the Jerusalem issue {{in general and the}} Temple Mount dispute in particular would play in the negotiations. Barak instructed his delegates to treat the dispute as [...] "the central issue that will decide the destiny of the negotiations" [...] whereas Arafat admonished his delegation to [...] "not budge on this one thing: [...] the Haram (the Temple Mount) is more <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than everything else." [...] At the opening of Camp David, Barak warned the Americans he could not accept giving the Palestinians more than a purely symbolic sovereignty over any part of East Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{position}} of the Socialist Party of New York, as voiced in the present [...] campaign, makes it a plain matter of duty on my part to resign my membership at once. The party is opposed to the conduct of war. I am whole-heartedly supporting {{the cause of the}} Allies against Germany. It was my hope that the party might not make the war a primary issue here or throughout the nation; in that case I might have honorably retained my membership. But the campaign here is to be waged directly and solely upon the issue of the war. ... The social ideals I have had the privilege of advancing among you are now more <b>precious</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than ever before. But I am positive in my belief that even a partial victory of German militarism would institute militarism and the servile state throughout the world and thus make an end of political democracy and of the great hope he have of industrial democracy in our generation." ...|$|E
