5|$|Kirsten Klein (born 1945) studied {{portrait}} {{and museum}} photography before specializing in landscapes. Her black-and-white photographs often {{make use of}} older techniques such as cyanotype and platinum printing.

Since 1976, she has lived on the Danish island of Mors where she has <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> ever-changing countryside and coastline.|$|E

5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business.

His first photograph {{is believed to be}} Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912. His photographs were first published in 1917 in the magazine Érdekes Újság, during World War I, while Kertész was serving in the Austro-Hungarian army. As early as 1914 (for example, Eugene, 1914), his distinctive and mature style was already evident.|$|E

Underwater photograph work with Otis Barton involved making a camera enclosure suitable for <b>photographing</b> <b>the</b> depths. Eyerman also utilized a concave mirror to <b>photograph</b> <b>the</b> aurora borealis. He covered World War II for Life on the European and Pacific fronts.|$|R

Komisarjevsky, who had <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> sexual assault of the girl on his cell phone, then provoked Hayes into raping Jennifer. While Hayes was raping her {{on the floor of}} the living room, Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E

5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Christian Palmer, known professionally as Fred C. Palmer, was {{the main}} public {{photographer}} of Herne Bay {{in the early years}} of the 20th century.

Palmer, Surveyor to Herne Bay Urban District Council 1891–1915, designed both phases of The King's Hall in 1904 and 1913. Gabrielle Davis was Sheriff of Canterbury 2009–2010 and helped to save local museums from closure in 2010. William Matthew Scott (1893–1964) was a local author living at High View Avenue, and architect Ernest Trevor Spashett lived next door to him between 1959 and 1965. William Sidney Cooper painted local scenes and is buried at Eddington cemetery. H. Kempton Dyson designed the Central Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530.

The image {{caught the attention of}} the project's science team, so the team followed up on its initial observations. HIP 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association. The planet itself is over twenty-three times more massive than Jupiter, orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than Pluto does from the Sun by the estimates published in its discovery paper. In this predicted orbit, HIP 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He also <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism. Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E
5|$|In {{early modern}} coronations, the events inside the abbey were usually {{recorded}} by artists {{and published in}} elaborate folio books of engravings, the last of these was published in 1905 depicting the coronation which had taken place three years earlier. Re-enactments of the ceremony were staged at London and provincial theatres; in 1761, a production featuring the Westminster Abbey choir at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden ran for {{three months after the}} real event. In 1902, a request to record the ceremony on a gramophone record was rejected, but SirBenjamin Stone <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> procession into the abbey.

5|$|In the 18th century Pedro Montañés {{passed through}} the site and left {{graffiti}} with his name and the year 1752.

Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis.|$|E

5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> Carin II, a yacht that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E

In 1858 or 1859 Rossier travelled to the Philippines where he visited and <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> Taal Volcano. Rossier was in Japan by 1859, producing photographs first in Nagasaki, then in Kanagawa, Yokohama and Edo (now Tokyo); {{he was the first}} professional photographer to arrive in Japan.

5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of Oberon {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest approach of Voyager 2 to Oberon was 470,600km, the best images of this moon have spatial resolution of about 6km. The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 25% of the surface was imaged with a resolution that allows geological mapping. At {{the time of the}} flyby the southern hemisphere of Oberon was pointed towards the Sun, so the dark northern hemisphere could not be studied.
