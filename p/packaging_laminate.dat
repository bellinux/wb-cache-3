40|$|A common {{flexible}} <b>packaging</b> <b>laminate</b> {{is comprised}} of five constructs in sequence: printing layer, adhesive, barrier layer, adhesive, and sealing layer. Aluminum foil and metallized polymer films are commonly used gas barrier layers in flexible packaging, but their true environmental impacts are not well-represented. This study investigated the potential environmental impacts of three widely-used, five layer laminates, namely polyethylene terephthalate/aluminum foil/linear low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate/metallized polypropylene/linear low density polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate/metallized polyethylene terephthalate/linear low density polyethylene in which the barrier layers are aluminum foil, metallized oriented polypropylene, and metallized polyethylene terephthalate. This study, {{with the use of}} SimaPro 8, was conducted to assess the total environmental impact, global warming potential, and embodied energy of these packaging alternatives across the life cycle. Compared to the aluminum foil laminate, the metallized polymer laminates offer reduced environmental impacts, though not as substantial as often cited. The results show that the MOPP laminate offers a 43 % lower total impact and the MPET laminate offers a 40 % lower total impact. Global warming potential is reduced by around 50 % for both metallized polymer laminates, and a non-renewable embodied energy is 25 - 26 % lower compared to the aluminum foil laminate...|$|E

Moisture content remained practically unchanged during storage, and water activity showed a rising trend in the plastic package. In both packages, the powder showed low hygroscopicity and high caking formation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a method to measure damage to <b>packaging</b> <b>laminates</b> by penetration. A hemispherical probe was shown to provide the most reproducible results and the rate of loading was found to be a small factor. The puncture mechanism for different types of laminates was examined. It was shown that the presence of paper in the structure has a decisive effect on puncture resistance. For paper-based laminates, the paper layer limits the strength by rupturing first and then producing premature rupture of the other layers; the result is a 4 – 10 -fold improvement in strength by eliminating paper as an outer layer. For laminates without paper, all layers rupture together so changing the composition of the non-paper layers has a direct influence on the puncture resistance. The direction of the penetration through the laminate usually has an effect on the energy to puncture...|$|R

40|$|Green {{additives}} such as prodegradants {{based on}} natural fatty acids and iron {{can improve the}} environmental profile of thermoplastic packaging materials. We present two studies in which this is demonstrated. In the first study, {{the addition of a}} green prodegradant to a 5 -layer gas barrier laminate during processing provided a laminate with significantly reduced oxygen transmission due to the resulting oxygen-consuming degradation process. The result shows that material reduction and cost efficiency of <b>packaging</b> <b>laminates</b> can be combined, since 5 -layer laminates with reduced oxygen barrier layer thickness and retained gas barrier properties are feasible. The products are interesting from an ecological and economic aspect. In the second study, the addition of a green prodegradant to several qualities of polypropylene that are used in packaging applications leads to materials that are readily degraded in accelerated weathering. The molecular weight of the modified polypropylenes after 830 hours of accelerated weathering is reduced from typically 80. 000 [*]g/mole to 1. 500 – 2. 500 [*]g/mole. At such molecular weight levels, digestion by microorganisms is feasible. The mild prodegradant used in the study does not lead to degradation during processing.

40|$|Plasma {{treatment}} and vacuum Al deposition on films from biaxially oriented polypropylene is a multistep large scale industrial process, mainly {{ending up in}} <b>packaging</b> film <b>laminates.</b> As atmospheric plasma treatment processes suffer from lack of reproducibility, low pressure plasma treatment processes that can be operated in-line with the metal deposition are being developed. Process development is difficult, because the final <b>packaging</b> film <b>laminate</b> has to deliver optimum properties of adhesion {{as well as of}} the barrier against oxygen and water vapor permeation. As a typical production run involves tens of thousands to up to one hundred thousand square meters of film, experiments on an industrial scale are expensive, so smaller scale experimental processes are needed, which so far do not match well enough with industrial process characteristics. Moreover, bonding mechanisms between the treated substrate film and the deposited Al layer are not sufficiently understood. This paper describes the sequence in development and optimization of substrate films and plasma treatment that has been performed on an experimental as well as on an industrial scale. A sufficient correlation between experimental and industrial scales was achieved, which helps to perform development and optimization on a small scale before scaling up to industrial processes.

Reliable and calibrated numerical material models describing thin layers of packaging materials are needed. Selection of appropriate constitutive models for the continuum material models and how to address the progressive damage modeling in various loading scenarios is also of great importance. The inverse modeling technique combined with video recording of the involved deformation mechanisms is utilized for identification of the material parameters. Large deformation, anisotropic non-linear material behavior, adhesion and fracture mechanics are all identified effects that are needed {{to be included in the}} virtual opening model. The results presented in this paper shows that it is possible to select material models in conjunction with continuum material damage models, adequately predicting the mechanical behavior of failure in thin <b>laminated</b> <b>packaging</b> materials. Already available techniques and functionalities in the commercial finite element software Abaqus are used. Furthermore, accurate descriptions of the included geometrical features are important. Advancements have therefore also been made within the experimental techniques utilizing a combination of μCT-scan, SEM and photoelasticity enabling extraction of geometries and additional information from ordinary experimental tests and broken specimens. Finally, comparison of the experimental opening and the virtual opening, showed a good correlation with the developed finite element modeling technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the possibility of utilization of waste residues (pomace) obtained during carrot juice extraction for the preparation of a value added product viz. carrot based condensed milk product (gazrella, an Indian sweetmeat). The carrot pomace was treated osmotically in two ways: Firstly, dipping in 65 °Brix sucrose syrup, secondly, by adding 35 % sucrose (dry powder) to the pomace. The product was further dehydrated convectively at 60 °C temperature up to 4 - 5 % moisture content (wet basis) and packaged under vacuum in aluminum <b>laminated</b> <b>package</b> (100 gauge). The dehydrated product was stored at ambient temperature (28 - 42 °C) for 6 months and was utilized for preparation of carrot based condensed milk product. After conducting preliminary trials, a new method was adopted for the preparation of carrot based condensed milk product. The product prepared from osmo-convectively dehydrated pomace had moderate to excellent overall acceptability.
