40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{order flow}} competition and institutional trading in modern global financial markets. It {{consists of three}} essays addressing issues on the performance drivers of an alternative trading platform, the impact of HFT activity on institutional execution cost, and broker trading behaviour and market share in the primary market. The empirical findings in these essays provide valuable insights {{into a number of}} market participants, such as sophisticated and institutional investors, brokers, regulators, exchange market operators and academics. The first essay, presented in Chapter 4, examines the determinants of Chi-X’s market share in a global context. The introduction of alternative trading venues that compete with listing exchanges has been brought about by regulatory reform and technological advances over the past decade. This essay is the first study into the performance drivers of a prominent alterative trading venue (Chi-X) in an international context. The findings in this essay contribute to the understanding of factors that influence a trader’s order routing decision and ultimately a venue’s market share. The results indicate that Chi-X's market share is negatively related to trading fees and latency relative to the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange,</b> while differences in adverse selection risk have an immaterial effect. Chi-X's market share is found to be positively related to liquidity relative to the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange,</b> measured by bid-ask spread, depth and percentage time that it displays best bid or offer. Venue market share is negatively related to order-to-trade ratio and positively related to average trade size, which suggests a trader’s preference to interact with natural and accessible liquidity. Furthermore, trading tends to concentrate on the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange</b> during market downturns and when volatility is high, while tick constraint stocks tend to trade more on Chi-X to avoid queuing at the touch on the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange.</b> Moreover, there is an improvement in market liquidity in regions where Chi-X was introduced during relatively normal market conditions. The second essay, presented in Chapter 5, examines the presence of High Frequency Trading (HFT) around large institutional trades and their price impact on NASDAQ and NYSE. The findings contribute to the understanding of HFT around institutional trades and its effect on realised execution costs. The focus on institutional price impact adds to the current literature around HFT's impact on conventional market quality metrics, such as spreads and depth, while addressing concerns that HFT adds to the difficulty of executing institutional orders, despite its perceived association with liquidity provision. The results in this chapter indicate that the impact of HFT participation on institutional execution costs vary between buy trades and sell trades. This essay also documents that institutional buy trades present higher execution costs, when the level of HFT participation is high. In contrast, institutional sell trades could be executed at better prices {{with a high level of}} HFT participation. The contrasting results can be attributable to the difference in the nature of HFTs and their respective ability and costs to short sell. Moreover, there is no evidence that HFT activities are beneficial or detrimental for the largest five percent of institutional trades. The third essay, presented in Chapter 6, studies the trading volume and market shares of brokers surrounding Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs) in the Australian primary market based on a unique broker ID dataset provided by ASX. Further regression analysis is conducted in this essay to examine the key determinants of the behaviour of affiliated and unaffiliated brokers around SEOs. The findings contribute to the understanding of broker affiliation around SEOs as well as providing insights into the key factors that influence a broker’s market share. The results suggest that broker affiliation has a significant impact on broker trading volume and market share on both the announcement days and issuance days. However, there is no significant evidence showing that lead managers or co-managers outperform other underwriters. Rather, the results indicate that co-managers are not expected to gain any abnormal volume or market share. Moreover, broker reputation, market capitalisation and relative offer size of the offering firm are shown as the primary characteristics influencing broker performance.

40|$|Radon- 222 and 226 Ra {{activities}} were {{measured in the}} waters and sediment of the southeastern Bering Sea shelf {{to evaluate the use}} of radon as a tracer of gas exchange, water column mixing and sediment-water exchange. Cross-shelf distributions of 222 Rn and 226 Ra are presented. Gas transfer coefficients were estimated using near-surface 222 Rn deficiency measurements. A statistically significant linear relationship between averaged wind speed and transfer coefficient was found. Vertical eddy diffusivities were evaluated by applying a one-dimensional model to near-bottom excess 222 Rn distributions; these diffusivities were compared to independently determined values. The one-dimensional model applied to the near-bottom 222 Rn data was found to be inadequate and a two-dimensional model was applied to improve the fit between model and data. Exchange across the sediment-water interface was computed from the deficiency of 222 Rn measured in sediment cores, standing crop estimates of excess 222 Rn in the water column and 222 Rn production rates of sediment surface grab samples. Biological irrigation of the sediments appeared to be the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange</b> mechanism between the sediment and water columns.

40|$|In the {{agricultural}} products wholesale market a wholesaler typically {{acts as an}} intermediary between producers and retailers in a distribution system. This is particularly evident for small individual producers {{who do not have}} a direct access to retail chains. In doing so, the wholesaler provides an intermediary role, {{but at the same time}} this also increases considerably the price of agricultural products. Due to the lack of linkages between agricultural producers and the inability to access directly to end buyers, producers are in an unfavourable position by comparison with the wholesaler. Small producers often have to accept the offered price and payment terms required by the wholesaler. Such unequal conditions result in the decreasing number of domestic agricultural producers and the difficult economic situation they are facing. Although fruit and vegetables (F&V) do not belong to <b>primary</b> <b>exchange</b> items, by applying quality standards for F&V production and e-business it is possible to distribute agricultural products from producers to retailers or end buyers in a quicker, easier and safer way. The paper deals with the experiences of the F&V market operating in Osijek. By including a large number of agricultural producers and buyers in market business it is possible to achieve significant financial effects, producers’ security, as well as security with respect to price and quality for the buyer of agricultural products. exchange, agricultural products, competitiveness...|$|E

40|$|Iron (Fe) is an {{important}} micronutrient for primary productivity in the ocean. The Fe cycle in the ocean is relatively unconstrained, {{especially when it comes}} to quantifying sources and sinks related to exchange with particulate matter. This thesis attempts to constrain some of the kinetic and equilibrium particle interactions with Fe bound to the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB). Out of five inorganic particle types investigated, ferrihydrite, goethite, opal, foraminifera, and montmorillonite, ferrihydrite has the largest, extended impact on dissolved FeDFB. From experimental and modeling results, ferrihydrite has two <b>primary</b> <b>exchange</b> pathways, absorption, with a rate of 3 to 5 (x 10 ^(- 4)) per (mg/L) per day, and dissolution, with a rate of 0. 005 to 0. 025 per day. Uptake appears irreversible and follows a colloidal pumping model. Isotopic fractionation is also the greatest in the presence of ferrihydrite with signals up to + 1 permil or higher with excess ligand. Dry montmorillonite has the biggest initial impact on FeDFB, resulting in a nearly instantaneous equilibrium and little isotopic fractionation. Goethite, opal, and foraminifera all have a minimal impact on FeDFB and show slight enriched isotopic fractionation, + 0. 15 permil, in the presence of large particle concentrations. DFB seems to induce heavy Fe desorption or dissolution, while particle uptake seems to favor transfer of lighter Fe. These isotopic and kinetic parameters are important constraints on the ability of particles to control dissolved Fe, since they fall through the water column faster than equilibrium will be obtained...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an illiquid financial market where a risk averse investor has to liquidate a portfolio within a finite time horizon [0, T] and can trade continuously at a traditional exchange (the “primary venue”) {{and in a}} dark pool. At the primary venue, trading yields a linear price impact. In the dark pool, no price impact costs arise but order execution is uncertain, modeled by a multi-dimensional Poisson process. We characterize the costs of trading by a linear-quadratic functional which incorporates both the price impact costs of trading at the <b>primary</b> <b>exchange</b> and the market risk of the position. The liquidation constraint implies a singularity of the value function of the resulting minimization problem at the terminal time T. Via the HJB equation and a quadratic ansatz, we obtain {{a candidate for the}} value function which is the limit of a sequence of solutions of initial value problems for a matrix differential equation. We show that this limit exists by using an appropriate matrix inequality and a comparison result for Riccati matrix equations. Additionally, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the solutions of the initial value problems, which allow us to prove a verification theorem. If a single asset position is to be liquidated, the investor slowly trades out of her position at the primary venue, with the remainder being placed in the dark pool at any point in time. For multi-asset liquidations this is generally not the case; it can, e. g., be optimal to oversize orders in the dark pool in order to turn a poorly balanced portfolio into a portfolio bearing less risk. ...|$|E
