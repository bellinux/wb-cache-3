They came close to yet another <b>promotion</b> in 2007, {{when they reached the}} League One playoff final, but lost to Blackpool at the newly reopened Wembley Stadium.

50|$|Sales <b>promotions</b> can be {{directed}} at either the customer, sales staff, or distribution channel members (such as retailers). Sales <b>promotions</b> targeted at the consumer are called consumer sales <b>promotions.</b> Sales <b>promotions</b> targeted at retailers and wholesale are called trade sales <b>promotions.</b> Some sale <b>promotions,</b> particularly ones with unusual methods, are considered gimmicks by many.|$|R
40|$|Price <b>promotions</b> (also called {{discount}} <b>promotions),</b> i. e. short-term temporary price reductions {{for selected}} items (Hermann 1989), are frequently used in sales <b>promotions.</b> The main objective of price <b>promotions</b> is to boost sales and increase profits. Quantitative {{evaluation of the}} effects of price <b>promotions</b> (QEEPP) is essential and important for sales managers to analyse historical price <b>promotions</b> and informative for devising more effective promotional strategies in the future. However, most previous studies only provide insights into the effects of discount <b>promotions</b> from some specific prospectives, and no approaches have been proposed for comprehensive evaluation {{of the effects of}} discount <b>promotions.</b> For example, Hinkle [1965] discovered that price <b>promotions</b> in the off-season are more favourable, and the effects of price <b>promotions</b> are stronger for new products. Peckham [1973] found that price <b>promotions</b> have no impact on long-term trend. Blattberg et al. [1978] identified that different segments respond to price <b>promotions</b> in different ways. Rockney [1991] discovered three basic types of effects: effects on discounted items, effects on substitutes and effects on complementary items...|$|R

However, concern has grown among researchers and managers regarding the cost effectiveness and profitability of casino <b>promotions.</b> This paper proposes a model for examining the effects of casino <b>promotions</b> on gaming volumes.

40|$|Little {{research}} has examined how consumers respond to sales <b>promotions</b> in new product categories. This article fills this gap by integrating research on reference prices with literature on sales <b>promotions</b> for new product categories. Existing {{research suggests that}} consumers respond more favourably to non-monetary <b>promotions</b> (e. g. extra free <b>promotions)</b> than monetary <b>promotions</b> (e. g. price discounts) because non-monetary <b>promotions</b> are framed as segregated gains rather than reduced losses. However, both kinds of <b>promotions</b> are widely used in practice, suggesting the importance of other contributory factors. With a consumer experiment on a national panel of consumers, this research demonstrates that extra free product <b>promotions</b> are most preferred for existing products, and introductory low-price <b>promotions</b> are preferred for innovative products. The moderating effect of a product's innovativeness is explained via a new relationship in the marketing literature, whereby perceived risk mediates the relationship between perceived innovativeness and a consumer's tendency to stockpile...|$|R

5|$|Sunderland's {{absence from}} the top flight lasted six years. The club came within one game of <b>promotion</b> back to the First Division in the 1962–63 season. Sunderland {{required}} only a draw in their final game against <b>promotion</b> rivals Chelsea, who had another game left to play after this match, to secure <b>promotion.</b> However, they were defeated, and Chelsea won their last game 7–0 to clinch <b>promotion,</b> finishing ahead of Sunderland on goal average. After the close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. Sunderland beat Charlton Athletic {{in the final stages}} of the season, where they clinched <b>promotion</b> with a game to spare. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.|$|E

40|$|I {{received}} {{very positive}} {{comments and suggestions}} on how this work could be expanded, including empirical validations in Africa. The long-term effects of <b>promotions</b> on sales are increasingly linked to the supposed shift of economic power within channels from manufacturers to retailers. However, formal knowledge about how they influence channel decisions under different promotional arrangements {{and the distribution of}} channel profits remains very sparse. In this paper, I develop two 2 -period models to investigate the impact on channel decisions and profits of manufacturer-controlled and retailer-controlled <b>promotions</b> targeted at consumers. My findings indicate that retailers always invest in retailer <b>promotions,</b> while manufacturers may find it optimal to not invest in consumer <b>promotions.</b> Additionally, the distribution of channel profits is based on who undertakes <b>promotions</b> and the long-term effects of these <b>promotions.</b> Trade <b>promotions</b> or other forms of profit transfer mechanisms may be indispensable in easing conflicts over who should undertake <b>promotions,</b> especially when these <b>promotions</b> substantially increase future sales.

50|$|Trade <b>Promotions</b> {{can offer}} several {{benefits}} to businesses. Retail stores {{can be an}} extremely competitive environment; trade <b>promotions</b> can help companies differentiate their products from the competition. Companies can utilize Trade <b>Promotions</b> to increase product visibility and brand awareness with consumers. Trade <b>Promotions</b> can also increase a product’s consumption rate, or the average quantity of a product used by consumers in a given time period. Furthermore, effective Trade <b>Promotions</b> can enlarge a product’s market segment penetration, or the product’s total sales {{in proportion to the}} category’s competition. Moreover, companies use Trade <b>Promotions</b> to improve distribution of their product(s) at retailers and strengthen relationships with retailers. Lastly, Trade <b>Promotions</b> can be leveraged to introduce new product launches into retail stores.|$|R

5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 <b>promotion</b> that was almost exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 <b>promotion</b> was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich <b>promotion</b> ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E

From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of <b>promotion</b> of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who had enjoyed faster <b>promotion.</b>|$|E

In OMEGA, each of the brothers portrayed several different characters; Hardy portrayed such characters as Willow the Wisp, Iceman, Mean Jimmy Jack Tomkins, and The Masked Mountain. While there, Hardy held the New Frontier Championship as a singles competitor and the Tag Team Championship with Matt. The <b>promotion</b> folded in April 1998 when they signed contracts with the WWF.|$|E
