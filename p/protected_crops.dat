40|$|Crops grown under plastic-clad {{structures}} or in greenhouses may be {{prone to}} an increased frequency of pesticide residue detections and higher concentrations of pesticides relative to equivalent crops grown in the open field. To test this we examined pesticide data for crops selected from the quarterly reports (2004 – 2009) of the UK’s Pesticide Residue Committee. Five comparison crop pairs were identified whereby one crop of each pair was assumed to have been grown primarily under some form of physical protection (‘protected’) and the other grown primarily in open field conditions (‘open’). For each pair, the number of detectable pesticide residues {{and the proportion of}} crop samples containing pesticides were statistically compared (n = 100 s samples for each crop). The mean concentrations of selected photolabile pesticides were also compared. For the crop pairings of cabbage (‘open’) vs. lettuce (‘protected’) and ‘berries’ (‘open’) vs. strawberries (‘protected’) there was a significantly higher number of pesticides and proportion of samples with multiple residues for the <b>protected</b> <b>crops.</b> Statistically higher concentrations of pesticides, including cypermethrin, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, boscalid and iprodione were also found in the <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> compared to the open crops. The evidence here demonstrates that, in general, the <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> possess a higher number of detectable pesticides compared to analogous crops grown in the open. This may be due to different pesticide-use regimes, but also due to slower rates of pesticide removal in protected systems. The findings of this study raise implications for pesticide management in protected-crop systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{trend was}} observed {{over the last}} years in the modelling of soil-plant-management interactions of <b>protected</b> <b>crops,</b> mainly as an adaptation of approaches originally developed for field crops. The variety of modelling approaches used world-wide reflects the difficulty of unifying physiological principles across various crops (plant types). The heterogeneity of software development techniques (typically based on procedural principles) has been another obstacle to the progress of research in this field, since it hampered model extension and re-usability. This paper describes and discusses the scientific basis, the design, implementation and perspectives in modelling greenhouse crops. Generic modular architectures developed according to up to date software technologies (. NET, Java) were identified and proposed as valuable for the design, implementation, verification and comparison of process-based modelling approaches. On this basis, the authors argue that the combination of good software engineering with sound crop science can enhance the rate of advance in crop modelling for <b>protected</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the lessons learnt during the {{development}} of a new robotic harvester (Harvey) that can autonomously harvest sweet pepper (capsicum) in <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environments. Robotic harvesting offers an attractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more regular and selective harvesting, optimising crop quality, scheduling and therefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a grasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To reduce complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on picking sweet peppers in a <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environment where plants are grown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and detach crop from the plant within a real <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> system. The novel contributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging improvements in sweet pepper picking success rates compared with the state-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting sweet pepper peduncles and improving the total harvesting cycle time for each sweet pepper. The methods presented in this paper provide steps towards the goal of fully autonomous and reliable crop picking systems that will revolutionise the horticulture industry by reducing labour costs, maximising the quality of produce, and ultimately improving the sustainability of farming enterprises...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConservation {{biological}} control of crop pests {{is considered a}} promising strategy in protected horticultural cropping systems. In Mediterranean regions, crop colonization by native predatory mirid bugs is frequent but highly heterogeneous among crop production sites. The contribution of landscape heterogeneity to the variability in colonization levels remains little explored, although {{it is a major}} driver of the abundance of natural enemies of pests in open field cropping systems. The goal of our study was to assess whether landscape heterogeneity (land-cover diversity, percent cover, and spatial configuration) at a local scale (up to 300 m) affects colonization of <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> by Macrolophus and Dicyphus mirids, and whether these effects are significantly greater or lower than those of crop management practices. In southern France (Roussillon) in 2010 and 2011, we collected data on mirid populations, pest infestation levels, crop management practices, and landscape heterogeneity within 300 m buffers. We investigated relationships between natural enemies, farming practices, and landscape metrics using an algorithm for random forests combined with GLM analyses. Tomato crops were colonized the most by Macrolophus mirids in landscapes with fallow, suggesting that these semi-natural habitats contribute to mirid movements between <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> and the surrounding landscape. In contrast, crop colonization by mirids was reduced by nearby orchard, which reflected either sink effects due to intensive management practices or dilution effects linked to herbaceous resources. Landscape composition and configuration had similar effects on mirid populations. Macrolophus and Dicyphus mirids responded the most to lanscape heterogeneity at different spatial scales (200 – 300 and 100 m scales, respectively), possibly reflecting different dispersal abilities. However, effects of landscape heterogeneity on mirids were lower than those of crop management practices. Our study suggests that maintaining large areas of semi-natural habitats with ruderal vegetation typical of fallow is important to ensure colonization of <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> by natural enemies of pests. Our findings emphasize that converting farms from conventional to organic production systems and adopting integrated plant management practices remain the most promising strategies to enhance populations of natural enemies in protected horticultural crops in Mediterranean regions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{methodology}} {{was applied to}} evaluate the energy consumption and environmental burdens associated with the production of <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> in an agricultural district in the Mediterranean region. In this study, LCA {{was used as a}} ‘support tool’, to address local policies for sustainable production and consumption patterns, and to create a ‘knowledge base’ for environmental assessment of an extended agricultural production area. The proposed approach combines organisation-specific tools, such as Environmental Management Systems and Environmental Product Declarations, with the environmental management of the district. Questionnaires were distributed to producers to determine the life cycle of different <b>protected</b> <b>crops</b> (tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, peppers, melons and zucchinis), and obtain information on greenhouse usage (e. g. tunnel vs. pavilion). Ecoprofiles of products in the district were also estimated, to identify supply chain elements with the highest impact in terms of global energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, water consumption and waste production. These results of this study enable selection of the ‘best practices’ and ecodesign solutions, to reduce the environmental impact of these products. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key LCA issues was performed, to assess the variability associated with different parameters: vegetable production; water usage; fertiliser and pesticide usage; shared greenhouse use; substitution of plastics coverings; and waste recycling...|$|E
