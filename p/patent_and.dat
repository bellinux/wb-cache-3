40|$|<b>Patents</b> <b>and</b> {{published}} <b>patent</b> {{applications are}} valuable resources to students, engineers, and researchers for learning about technology. This thesis investigated {{the ability to}} learn about a technology through the disclosures that are made in published <b>patent</b> applications <b>and</b> issued <b>patents.</b> This thesis first {{provides an overview of}} U. S. <b>patent</b> law, system, <b>and</b> resources that are available to the public. It is through an understanding of U. S. <b>patent</b> law <b>and</b> system that one can appreciate that <b>patents</b> <b>and</b> <b>patent</b> applications are a resource for learning about technology. By providing the basic building blocks of LED lighting technology as learned through the teachings of <b>patents</b> <b>and</b> <b>patent</b> applications, this thesis proves that <b>patents</b> <b>and</b> <b>patent</b> applications are valuable resources for learning about technology. The <b>patents</b> <b>and</b> <b>patent</b> applications relied upon for this thesis teach that the basic building blocks of LED lighting technology include: LED device; Color management; and Heat management...|$|R

5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets {{of the drug}} to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure <b>patent</b> <b>and</b> trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area.

A concurrent use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{found himself}} in battles to protect his {{intellectual}} property many times throughout his career, but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years. His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired <b>patent</b> <b>and</b> giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's patent to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 <b>patent</b> <b>and</b> the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
