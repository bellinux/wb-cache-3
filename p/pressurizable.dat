50|$|The {{atmosphere}} within waveguide assemblies {{is often}} pressurized, either {{to prevent the}} ingress of moisture, or to raise the breakdown voltage in the guide and hence increase the power that it can carry. Pressurization requires that all joints in the waveguide be airtight. This is usually achieved {{by means of a}} rubber O-ring seated in a groove in the face of at least one of flanges forming each join. Gasket, gasket/cover or <b>pressurizable</b> flanges (such as that on the right of figure 2), are identifiable by the single circular groove which accommodates the O-ring. It is only necessary for one of the flanges in each <b>pressurizable</b> connection to be of this type; the other may have a plain flat face (like that in figure 1). This ungrooved type is known as a cover, plain or unpressurizable flange.|$|E

50|$|A choke {{connection}} is formed by mating one choke flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} choke flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep choke trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. Choke flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably <b>pressurizable,</b> having a gasket groove encircling the choke ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes choke flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a choke flange.|$|E
50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), <b>Pressurizable</b> (with a gasket groove) and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are round flanges, B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover flange for R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular gasket flange for R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a round choke flange for R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|E

40|$|ISHM {{capability}} includes: {{detection of}} anomalies, diagnosis of causes of anomalies, prediction of future anomalies, and user interfaces that enable integrated awareness (past, present, and future) by users. This {{is achieved by}} focused management of data, information and knowledge (DIaK) that will likely be distributed across networks. Management of DIaK implies storage, sharing (timely availability), maintaining, evolving, and processing. Processing of DIaK encapsulates strategies, methodologies, algorithms, etc. focused on achieving high ISHM Functional Capability Level (FCL). High FCL means {{a high degree of}} success in detecting anomalies, diagnosing causes, predicting future anomalies, and enabling health integrated awareness by the user. A model that enables ISHM capability, and hence, DIaK management, is denominated the ISHM Model of the System (IMS). We describe aspects of the IMS that focus on processing of DIaK. Strategies, methodologies, and algorithms require proper context. We describe an approach to define and use contexts, implementation in an object-oriented software environment (G 2), and validation using actual test data from a methane thruster test program at NASA SSC. Context is linked to existence of relationships among elements of a system. For example, the context to use a strategy to detect leak is to identify closed subsystems (e. g. bounded by closed valves and by tanks) that include pressure sensors, and check if the pressure is changing. We call these subsystems <b>Pressurizable</b> Subsystems. If pressure changes are detected, then all members of the closed subsystem become suspect of leakage. In this case, the context is defined by identifying a subsystem that is suitable for applying a strategy. Contexts are defined in many ways. Often, a context is defined by relationships of function (e. g. liquid flow, maintaining pressure, etc.), form (e. g. part of the same component, connected to other components, etc.), or space (e. g. physically close, touching the same common element, etc.). The context might be defined dynamically (if conditions for the context appear and disappear dynamically) or statically. Although this approach is akin to case-based reasoning, we are implementing it using a software environment that embodies tools to define and manage relationships (of any nature) among objects in a very intuitive manner. Context for higher level inferences (that use detected anomalies or events), primarily for diagnosis and prognosis, are related to causal relationships. This is useful to develop root-cause analysis trees showing an event linked to its possible causes and effects. The innovation pertaining to RCA trees encompasses use of previously defined subsystems as well as individual elements in the tree. This approach allows more powerful implementations of RCA capability in object-oriented environments. For example, if a <b>pressurizable</b> subsystem is leaking, its root-cause representation within an RCA tree will show that the cause is that all elements of that subsystem are suspect of leak. Such a tree would apply to all instances of leak-events detected and all elements in all <b>pressurizable</b> subsystems in the system. Example subsystems in our environment to build IMS include: <b>Pressurizable</b> Subsystem, Fluid-Fill Subsystem, Flow-Thru-Valve Subsystem, and Fluid Supply Subsystem. The software environment for IMS is designed to potentially allow definition of any relationship suitable to create a context to achieve ISHM capability...|$|E

Furthermore when applied for cryogenic medium storage the heat transfer between different bodies and generation of respective thermal stresses in such vessels makes the solution more complicated.

Microbial cells were inoculated onto a solid hydrophilic medium and treated at room temperature; their sensitivities to inactivation varied greatly. The CO 2 treatment had an enhanced efficiency in cell destruction when the pressure and the duration of exposure were increased.

The classical bubble resonance frequency is known to vary with ambient pressure. Experiments were conducted with a driven bubble in a <b>pressurizable</b> tank with a signal processing system designed to extract the resonant peak.

When the gloves are pressurized, they restrict movement and create pressure points during tasks, sometimes resulting in pain, muscle fatigue, abrasions, and occasionally more severe injuries such as onycholysis. A {{brief review of}} the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health's injury database reveals that 58 % of total astronaut hand and arm injuries from NBL training between 1993 and 2010 occurred either to the fingernail, MCP, or fingertip.

Tasks were performed gloved and ungloved in a <b>pressurizable</b> glove box. The test demonstrated that fingernails saw greater transverse strain levels for tension or compression than for longitudinal strain, even during axial fingertip loading. Blood perfusion peaked and dropped as the finger deformed during finger presses, indicating an initial dispersion and decrease of blood perfusion levels.

Off-world scientist astronauts will be faced with space suit limitations in vision, human sense perception, mobility, dexterity, the space suit fit, time limitations, and the psychological fear of death from accidents, causing physical fatigue reducing field science performance. Finding evidence of visible biosignatures for past life such as stromatolite fossils, on Mars, is a very significant discovery. Our preliminary overview trials showed that when in simulated EVAs, 25 % stromatolite fossil evidence is missed with more incorrect identifications compared to ground truth surveys but providing quality characterization descriptions becomes less affected by simulated EVA limitations as the science importance of the features increases. Field scientists focused more on capturing high value characterization detail from the rock features whereas non-field scientists focused more on finding many features.

With neural input, these structures coordinate the delivery, collection, and, ultimately, expulsion of urine. Despite large osmotic and chemical gradients in this waste fluid, the bladder maintains a highly impermeable surface {{in the face of a}} physically demanding biomechanical environment, which mandates recurring cycles of surface area expansion and increased wall tension during filling, followed by rapid wall compression during voiding. Afferent neuronal inflow from mucosa and submucosa communicates sensory information about bladder fullness, and voiding is initiated consciously through coordinated central and spinal efferent outflow to the detrusor, trigonal internal sphincter, and external urethral sphincter after periods of relative quiescence. Provocative new findings suggest that in some cases, lower urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence, urgency, frequency, overactivity, and pain may be viewed as a consequence of urothelial defects (either urothelial barrier breakdown or inappropriate signaling from urothelial cells to underlying sensory afferents and potentially interstitial cells).

Through subsequent rounds of site-saturation and random mutagenesis, multiple variants supporting 1, 700 – 4, 000 ethane TONs were identified. Recombination of the identified mutations generated variant E 31 -D 140 E-L 215 P-T 436 R supporting 5, 800 ethane TON.

The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and uncoated fabric layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility.
