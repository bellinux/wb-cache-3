5|$|Lights and Sounds debuted {{at number}} five on the Billboard 200 and Top Internet Albums' charts, and sold over 95,000 copies {{in its first}} week of release. Since June 2006, Lights and Sounds has sold over 315,000 copies in the United States. The album did not exceed the {{expectations}} of Ocean Avenue, which approached 2million in record sales. Internationally, Lights and Sounds peaked at number four on the Canadian Top Album Chart, making it Yellowcard's highest debut in Canada. It also debuted at number six in the Australian chart, in which it spent six weeks, before retiring in the number 49 position. In the New Zealand chart it peaked in the number 11 <b>position.</b> <b>Lights</b> and Sounds charted on the number 59 spot in the United Kingdom and spent one week on the chart. In the United States, the album was certified gold by the RIAA on March 15, 2006, indicating shipment of 500,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} {{who shot}} down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained {{convinced that they}} were shot down by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos, two Serrate-equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF, participated in the attacks on Magdeburg. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito F.II, DZ303, piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23:15south of Brandenburg. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88with its <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> on. They attacked the Ju 88and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit, {{but they did not}} claim a victory. This encounter exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and turn signal lights.|$|E

5000|$|A {{standard}} high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{consists of}} two heads; the bottom head can remain dark unless it is needed. In addition to the high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals the PRR developed a dwarf <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> as with many railroads, these dwarf signals are {{also referred to as}} a [...] "pot," [...] a tradition carried over from the 19th century revolving [...] "Pot Type Signal." [...] Four plain white lamps are able to display four low-speed aspects each with two lamps. In 1930, close clearances of the Philadelphia Suburban Station complex spurred development of the pedestal-type position, which consisted of two position dwarf signals in a common cast backing.|$|R

2500|$|The chassis is {{made from}} carbon fiber {{reinforced}} with kevlar and aluminium honeycomb like previous models and while the body keeps the targa top body style and the [...] "dihedral synchro-helix" [...] actuation doors [...] it is completely reworked. There is a new front bumper design, enhanced brake cooling, fog lamps, US <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> a new fresh air intake on the bonnet that acts as ram air booster, air intakes behind the front wheels to enhance airflow and a glass window over the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Weatherspoon, {{one of the}} Tomcat {{fighter pilots}} later {{recalled}} that the nighttime intercepts were not overly difficult [...] "It wasn't a big deal. We got a good radar picture which safely controlled the intercept, and pulled close {{enough to get a}} visual identification. As we slowly closed, either we illuminated the aircraft with he glow of our exterior <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> or tried to make out a silhouette by starlight. If its shape was similar to a 737, we had to get closer to see the carrier or national markings." ...|$|E

The warm air was laden {{with the scent of}} flowers, and nothing stirred with the exception of Mr. Tasker’s shadow on the blind of the kitchen window. The clock in the neighbouring church chimed the three-quarters, and in due time boomed out the hour of ten. Mr. Tredgold knocked the ashes from his pipe and began seriously to consider his <b>position.</b> <b>Lights</b> went out in the next house. Huge shadows appeared on the kitchen blind and the light gradually faded, to reappear triumphantly in the room above. Anon the shadow of Mr. Tasker’s head was seen wrestling fiercely with its back collar-stud.|$|E

50|$|North American {{railroad}} signals generally {{fall into}} the category of multi-headed electrically lit units displaying speed-based or weak route signaling. Signals may be of the searchlight, color <b>light,</b> <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> or color <b>position</b> <b>light</b> types, each displaying a variety of aspects which inform the locomotive engineer of track conditions so that he or she may keep their train under control and able to stop short of any obstruction or dangerous condition.|$|R
50|$|New PRR type <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> {{continued}} to be installed up until the 1980s on former Conrail systems. Today most of the old PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are slowly being replaced by modern color lights, but Amtrak, SEPTA and the LIRR continue to install new <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> (Amtrak's being of the colorized variety). US&S no longer manufactures position light equipment, but updated models from Safetran continue to be available.|$|E

5000|$|On the Pennsylvania Railroad, phase breaks were {{indicated}} by a <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light. When the phase break was active (the catenary sections out of phase), all lights were lit.

50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads. Internally referred to as position color lights, these are {{not to be confused with}} color <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> described below, which while functionally similar are structurally considerably different.|$|E

50|$|A {{navigation}} light, {{also known}} as a running light, is a colored source of illumination on a waterborne vessel, aircraft and some spacecraft, used to signal a craft's position, heading, and status. Commonly, their placement is mandated by international conventions or civil authorities. Contrary to the name, these lights are not used for navigating. They indicate the craft's relative position and are thus often called <b>position</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Since Conrail {{acquired}} many separate railways, and the North American railway {{signalling system}} is not standardized, operators needed to qualify on {{as many as seven}} different signalling systems. The varying systems include, but are not limited to, the PRR <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals, the NYC searchlight signals and tri-light signals, and the EL tri-light signals. The NYC tri-light was adopted as Conrail's systemwide standard for new signal installations. Most of the existing technologies were defined by the Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC). Conrail had its own, unique tri-light signal modernization program that was applied to many routes. Today, most Northeastern railroads associated with former Conrail assets are working towards standardization of all systems as vertical color light signals. Meanwhile, Amtrak uses {{a modified version of the}} PRR <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals called [...] "Position Color Lights".|$|R
