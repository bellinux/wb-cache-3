5|$|From 78 to 76BC, the Romans led an {{expedition}} to an area north of the Danube, then the Iazyges' territory, because the Iazyges had allied with Mithridates VI of Pontus, with whom the Romans were at war.

The Iazyges encountered the Basternae and Getae along their migration path sometime around 20AD, and turned southward, following the coast of the Black Sea until they settled in the Danube Delta.

40|$|The Carpathians-Pannonian Basin system {{provides}} a natural laboratory for analysing lithospheric to surface controls on tectonic topography {{development in a}} coupled source-to-sink environment. To link processes taking place at depth and at the surface, recent research focused on the interplay between basin evolution, active tectonics, topography evolution and intraplate folding mechanisms. Neotectonic processes control landscape development and natural hazards, in particular the seismicity, during the late-stage (Late Neogene-Quaternary) evolution of both the Carpathians-Pannonian Basin system and its interaction with the adjacent Dinarides and Balkans. The deep structure of the SE Carpathians exerts a strong control on the post-collisional evolution of the system. New constraints are available from seismic tomography, deep seismic reflection and refraction profiling and detailed studies of the Vreancea seismicity. Inherited orogenic fabric {{and structure of the}} active Black Sea sink has a strong influence on the localisation of the Neogene sediment pathways. A close relationship has been established between the timing and mechanisms of stress changes in the <b>Pannonian</b> and Transylvania <b>basins</b> and structural episodes in the surrounding thrust belts, pointing to an intrinsic mechanical coupling with these basins, the orogen and its foredeep. Basin inversion taking place during the Pliocene-Quaternary times in the entire Carpathians-Pannonian system is related to changes in the regional stress field leading to differential vertical movements associated with a laterally variable folding mechanism active in the entire system. Short, crustal folding patterns alternate with lithospheric wavelengths in the SE Carpathians foreland, East and South Carpathians, Transylvania and <b>Pannonian</b> <b>basins.</b> The lateral variability {{is the result of a}} marked contrast in rheology between these areas, directly related to the crustal configuration, thermal properties and late-stage collision kinematics with the Carpathians foreland. Lateral variations in the properties of the downgoing plates largely control the collision mode in the Carpathias and the post-collisional evolution of the entire system. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

The deviations of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in the samples from the well-constrained seawater curve are interpreted as due to local input of terrestrially-derived Sr. Contribution of local sources is also reflected in the ?Nd values, consistent with input from ancient crystalline rocks (e. g., Bohemian Massif) and/or Mesozoic sediments with ?Nd ? 7. Excluding samples showing local influence on the water column, an average ?Nd value of ? 7. 9 ± 0. 5 may be inferred for the Miocene Paratethys.

5|$|In 567 {{the allies}} made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the {{northwest}} while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the Tibiscus and Danube rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the Origo. The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars. Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids.

40|$|We {{present a}} geodynamic {{reconstruction}} of the Central-Western Mediterranean and neighboring areas during the last 50 Myr, including magmatological and tectonic observations. This area was interested by different styles of evolution and polarity of subduction zones influenced by the fragmented Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic paleogeography between Africa and Eurasia. Both oceanic and continental lithospheric plates were diachronously consumed along plate boundaries. The hinge of subducting slabs converged toward the upper plate in the double-vergent thick-skinned Alps-Betics and Dinarides, characterized by two slowly-subsiding foredeeps. The hinge diverged from the upper plate in the single-vergent thin-skinned Apennines-Maghrebides and Carpathians orogens, characterized by a single fast-subsiding foredeep. The retreating lithosphere deficit was compensated by asthenosphere upwelling and by the opening of several back-arc basins (the Ligurian-Provencal, Valencia Trough, Northern Algerian, Tyrrhenian and <b>Pannonian</b> <b>basins).</b> In our reconstruction, the W-directed Apennines-Maghrebides and Carpathians subductions nucleated along the retro-belt of the Alps and the Dinarides, respectively. The wide chemical composition of the igneous rocks emplaced during this tectonic evolution confirms a strong heterogeneity of the Mediterranean upper mantle and of the subducting plates. In the Apennine-Maghrebide and Carpathian systems the subduction-related igneous activity (mostly medium- to high-K calcalkaline melts) is commonly followed in time by mildly sodic alkaline and tholeiitic melts. The magmatic evolution of the Mediterranean area cannot be easily reconciled with simple magmatological models proposed for the Pacific subductions. This is most probably due to synchronous occurrence of several subduction zones that strongly perturbed the chemical composition of the upper mantle in the Mediterranean region and, above all, {{to the presence of}} ancient modifications related to past orogeneses. The classical approach of using the geochemical composition of igneous rocks to infer the coeval tectonic setting characteristics cannot be used in geologically complex systems like the Mediterranean area.

40|$|The potassic (K) to ultrapotassic (UK) {{volcanic}} rocks cropping {{out in the}} Vardar Zone of Macedonia {{and southern}} Serbia span in age from Late Miocene (6. 57 Ма) to Pleistocene (1. 47 Ма). The main identified outcrops are in the Kumanovo, Sveti Nikole, Shtip and Demir Kapia areas; the southernmost occurrences of these volcanic rocks {{are located in the}} large Kozuf Massif (Voras Massif in Greece) at the Macedonia–Greek border. Three distinct groups may be distinguished. The first group has a shoshonitic affinity and occurs in the Kozuf Massif (LMg-K group); it includes shoshonites to rare rhyolites, with latites and trachytes being the most widespread products. The second group consists of potassic rocks (HMg-K group, K 2 O/Na 2 O between 1. 0 and 1. 8) occurring in both southern Serbia (Cer and Slavujevci) and Macedonia (Djuristhe, near Sveti Nikole). The third group, present only in Macedonia, consists of ultrapotassic rocks (UK group, K 2 O/Na 2 O > 1. 8, Mg# > 71) classified as UK shoshonites, UK latites and UK phonotephrites; overall, they show a “Roman Province type” affinity (Group III of Foley, Venturelli, Green, Toscani, Earth Sci Rev 24 : 81 – 134, 1987). Geochemically, the studied rocks exhibit strong enrichment in LILE, Th and Pb, as well as relative depletion in Ta–Nb and Hf; such signatures are typical of magmas generated in convergent geotectonic settings. In the HMg-K and UK rocks, Sr and Nd isotopic ratios vary from 0. 70768 to 0. 71040, and 0. 51243 to 0. 512149, respectively. The rocks of the LMg-K group show relatively limited Sr and Nd isotope variations (0. 7087 – 0. 7093 and 0. 51233 – 0. 51229), which correlate with a decrease in MgO and increase in SiO 2 contents. The geochemical features of the LMg-K volcanic rocks indicate that their evolution was mainly driven by fractional crystallization coupled with contamination by feldspar-rich crustal materials. In contrast, the HMg-K and UK rocks have not been significantly modified by crustal contamination, and their geochemical features are considered to reflect lithospheric mantle heterogeneity acquired during the subduction of the Western Vardar Ocean and the Apulian plate. The metasomatizing agent was apparently more enriched in Zr, Th, Ta and Ce than in fluid-mobile elements, such as Pb and Cs, suggesting that it was characterized by a high melt/fluid ratio.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of sedimentary basins reflects {{the relationship between}} accommodation space and sediment supply, their rates and localization being variable during basin evolution. The mechanisms driving the interplay between tectonics and sedimentation in extensional back-arc basins overlying rheological weak zones inherited from an earlier orogenic evolution are less understood. A typical example is the <b>Pannonian</b> back-arc <b>basin</b> of Central Europe. It is floored by continental lithosphere and was affected by large amounts of extension driven by the subduction rollback {{that took place in}} the Carpathians and/or Dinarides. A novel kinematic and seismic sequence stratigraphic interpretation calibrated by wells allows the quantification of the link between the formation of half grabens and coeval sedimentation in the Great Hungarian Plain part of the basin. While the lower order tectonic-induced cycles characterize the main phases of extension in various subbasins, the higher-order cyclicity and associated unconformities define individual moments of fault (re) activation. Our novel interpretation of a temporal and spatial migration of extension during Miocene times explains the contrasting present-day strike of various subbasins as a result of their gradual clockwise rotation. Incorporating the observed asymmetry, in particular the associated footwall exhumation, infers that the amount of extension is much larger than previously thought. The quantitative link between tectonics and sedimentation has allowed the definition of a novel model of sedimentation in asymmetric basins that can be ported to other natural scenarios of similarly hyperextended back-arc basins observed elsewhere. © 2016.

40|$|In this thesis, the 3 D {{structure}} and kinematics of the locally and mildly inverted Lower Austria Mesozoic Basin beneath the Alpine-Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt is described. This {{study has been}} carried out by the integrative interpretation of 2 D and 3 D seismic surveys, well and geophysical logs data and gravity maps. A basin-scale, 3 D structural model {{has been carried out}}, focused on the sub-thrust and foreland zones. The Late Eocene to Early Miocene Alpine–Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt resulted from the subduction of the European plate beneath the Adriatic one, and the subsequent continental collision between both plates. The Alpine–Carpathian foredeep and fold-and-thrust belt recorded the long-lasting involvement of the European crystalline basement in several deformation events: from late Variscan transtension, to Jurassic rifting, and Cretaceous to Neogene shortening. In this thesis, two additional basement fault reactivation events have been defined in relation to the Alpine-Carpathian Cenozoic shortening: an extensional reactivation event related to the bending of the European plate coeval with Egerian to Karpatian (ca. 28 – 16 Ma) thin-skinned thrusting; followed by the selective positive inversion of the basement faults in the sub-thrust and in the foreland during Karpatian to Badenian times (ca. 16 - 12. 5 Ma). The flexural bending of the European plate and the associated extensional fault reactivation were promoted by high lateral gradients of lithospheric strength in addition to the slab pull forces associated with subduction. Delamination of the European lithosphere during the final stages of collision around Karpatian times (ca. 16 Ma) promoted a large-wavelength uplift and an excessive topographic load. This topographic load was compensated by broadening the orogenic wedge through the compressional reactivation of the inherited fault array in the Euroepan plate beneath and ahead of the thin-skinned thrust system. Ultimately, collapse and deep burial of the Alpine-Carpathian tectonic wedge took place by the formation of the <b>Pannonian</b> <b>basins</b> system. To gain further insights in the deformational processes in sub-thrust and foreland settings, sandbox analogue models of brittle and brittle-viscous sand wedges have been carried out. The models aimed testing the influence of different topographic loads (i. e., thrust wedges) on the sub-thrust inversion of extensional basins, as well as the influence of the initial orientation of the extensional basins, and {{the presence or absence of}} weak detachment layers. Segmented half-graben basins -striking at 90 º, 45 º and 15 º to the extension direction- were created first, and then shortened using different angles for the basal detachment and topographic slope. A shallow layer of viscous polymer over the half- graben basin was included in one of the models. The experiments were analysed using time-lapse photography, topography laser scans and image-based 3 D voxels. The modelling results indicate a deformation sequence characterised by layer-parallel compaction, fault reactivation, thrust propagation and related folding. Fault reactivation and basin inversion were associated with layer-parallel compaction accomplished by slip along the basal detachment, prior to and in between pulses of thrusting. The results of the sandbox analogue models reveal a fundamental control imposed by the vertical load of the tectonic wedge and its integrated strength profile in the inversion of sub-thrust basins. Small vertical loads or strong gradients of vertical load have revealed as fundamental factors aiding in the inversion of buried, sub-thrust basins. The integrated strength profile resulted from the combination of inherited, strain-softened fault zones, as well as the presence or absence and distribution of weak, viscous horizons. The results of the sandbox models carried out indicate that the vertical load, its gradient over the sub-thrust basins and the inherited, strain-softened faults, are more important than the obliquity between the direction of shortening and the orientation of pre-existing fault systems. As indicated by the results of sandbox analogue models, the recurrent and long-lasting frictional reactivation of the Lower Austria basement fault array may have been favoured by fault-weakening mechanisms, as well as by steep gradients of vertical loads generated by thin-skinned out- of-sequence stacking of the Rhenodanubian Flysch located south of the inverted basement fault array...|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} of tectonic {{units of the}} Alpine-Carpathian-Dinaridic system of orogens, including the substrate of the <b>Pannonian</b> and Transylvanian <b>basins,</b> {{is presented in the}} form of a map. Combined with a series of crustal-scale cross sections this {{correlation of}} tectonic units yields a clearer picture of the threedimensional architecture of this system of orogens that owes its considerable complexity to multiple overprinting of earlier by younger deformations. The synthesis advanced here indicates that none of the branches of the Alpine Tethys and Neotethys extended eastward into the Dobrogea Orogen. Instead, the main branch of the Alpine Tethys linked up with the Meliata- Maliac-Vardar branch of the Neotethys into the area of the present-day Inner Dinarides. More easterly and subsidiary branches of the Alpine Tethys separated Tisza completely, and Dacia partially, from the European continent. Remnants of the Triassic parts of Neotethys (Meliata-Maliac) are preserved only as ophiolitic mélanges present below obducted Jurassic Neotethyan (Vardar) ophiolites. The opening of the Alpine Tethys was largely contemporaneous with the Latest Jurassic to Early Cretaceous obduction of parts of the Jurassic Vardar ophiolites. Closure of the Meliata-Maliac Ocean in the Alps and West Carpathians led to Cretaceous-age orogeny associated with an eclogitic overprint of the adjacent continental margin. The Triassic Meliata- Maliac and Jurassic Western and Eastern Vardar ophiolites were derived from one single branch of Neotethys: the Meliata-Maliac-Vardar Ocean. Complex geometries resulting from out-of-sequence thrusting during Cretaceous and Cenozoic orogenic phases underlay a variety of multi-ocean hypotheses, that were advanced in the literature and that we regard as incompatible with the field evidence. The present-day configuration of tectonic units suggests that a former connection between ophiolitic units in West Carpathians and Dinarides was disrupted by substantial Miocene-age dislocations along the Mid-Hungarian Fault Zone, hiding a former lateral change in subduction polarity between West Carpathians and Dinarides. The SW-facing Dinaridic Orogen, mainly structured in Cretaceous and Palaeogene times, was juxtaposed with the Tisza and Dacia Mega-Units along a NW-dipping suture (Sava Zone) in latest Cretaceous to Palaeogene times. The Dacia Mega-Unit (East and South Carpathian Orogen, including the Carpatho-Balkan Orogen and the Biharia nappe system of the Apuseni Mountains), was essentially consolidated by E-facing nappe stacking during an Early Cretaceous orogeny, while the adjacent Tisza Mega-Unit formed by NW-directed thrusting (in present-day coordinates) in Late Cretaceous times. The polyphase and multi-directional Cretaceous to Neogene deformation history of the Dinarides was preceded by the obduction of Vardar ophiolites onto to the Adriatic margin (Western Vardar Ophiolitic Unit) and parts of the European margin (Eastern Vardar Ophiolitic Unit) during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times...|$|R
