5|$|After Lee's surrender, {{a public}} meeting {{was held in}} Shreveport, Louisiana, at which many {{speakers}} supported continuation of the war. Plans were developed for the Davis government to flee to Havana, Cuba. There, the leaders would regroup and head to the Confederate-controlled Trans-Mississippi area {{by way of the}} Rio Grande.

5|$|Deception {{contributed to}} major Soviet {{victories}} including the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and Operation Bagration (in Belarus): in these cases, surprise was achieved despite very large concentrations of force, both in attack and in defence.

5|$|The {{capture of}} Primosole Bridge {{did not lead}} to the {{expected}} rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> in Allied airborne operations.|$|E
5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice,</b> but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of insects}} for warfare {{may have been}} {{attempted}} in the Middle Ages or earlier, but was first systematically researched by several nations during the twentieth century. It was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> by the Japanese army's Unit 731 in attacks on China during the Second World War, killing almost 500,000 Chinese people with fleas infected with plague and flies infected with cholera. Also in the Second World War, the Germans explored the use of Colorado beetles to destroy enemy potato crops. During the Cold War, the US Army considered using yellow fever mosquitoes to attack Soviet cities.|$|E
5|$|When the French Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these early overtures failed and the custody of the metric system remained {{in the hands of the}} French government until 1875.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice.</b> Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Jones's {{recommendations}} were immediately accepted and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice.</b> A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of}} the peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolence is an {{overriding}} theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.|$|E
