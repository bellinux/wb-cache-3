50|$|Because N-terminal deprotection occurs {{repeatedly}} during peptide synthesis, <b>protecting</b> schemes {{are established}} such that {{different types of}} side chain <b>protecting</b> groups (e.g., Bzl, tBu, etc.) are matched to either Boc or Fmoc, respectively, for ultimate deprotection that is optimized. Because multiple <b>protecting</b> groups are normally used during peptide synthesis of peptides greater in length than oligomers, {{care must be taken}} such that all side chain <b>protecting</b> groups are compatible, so that when deprotection of individual <b>protecting</b> groups is required (e.g., to selectively modify the side chain of one amino acid of a synthetic peptide), the one deprotection step does not affect other side chains. <b>Protecting</b> schemes are therefore developed in each particular case of a peptide synthesis to assign <b>protecting</b> groups to each amino acid residue.|$|R
