5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> only 7).|$|E

5|$|There is {{discussion}} among both scholars and <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> regarding the best or most appropriate name {{to use for}} many of the people groups and their languages, as well as the proper romanization of that name. Commonly cited examples of this ambiguity include (Seediq/Sediq/Truku/Taroko) and (Tao/Yami).|$|E
5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and <b>political</b> <b>groups.</b> Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the events in Final Fantasy X, in Final Fantasy X-2 the teachings of Yevon were no longer deemed valid, and {{association}} with machina and the Al Bhed people no longer sacrilegious. Spirans in general had a positive outlook with the onset of the Eternal Calm. New <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> fought for power the largest being the Youth League, the New Yevon Party, the Machine Faction.

5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity within the group.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E

5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|The Picts {{were one}} of four <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> in north Britain in the early 8th century. Pictland ran from the River Forth northwards, {{including}} Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles. Prior to the Viking Age, the main power in Pictland {{appears to have been}} the kingdom of Fortriu. Known high-status sites in Fortriu include Burghead and Craig Phádraig by Inverness. Pictland appears to have had only one bishop with his seat at Rosemarkie.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Leopold II saw {{the rise of}} {{organized}} socialist <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> and parties, most notably among the industrial workers in Wallonia. The early socialist movement was characterized by a successful co-operative movement in Flanders. Trade unions were legalized in 1866, opening the way to organized labor politics. The International Workingmen's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism, under figures such as César De Paepe, expanded dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} in Wales {{has historically}} been marginalised due to the prominence of societies and <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> in England which led the reform for women throughout the United Kingdom. Due to differing social structures and a heavily industrialised working-class society, {{the growth of a}} national movement in Wales grew but then stuttered {{in the late nineteenth century}} in comparison with that of England. Nevertheless, distinct Welsh groups and individuals rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage in Wales and the rest of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia ruled {{an empire}} of {{different}} peoples; as a Palmyrene, she {{was accustomed to}} dealing with multilingual and multicultural diversity since she hailed from a city which embraced many cults. The queen's realm was culturally divided into eastern-Semitic and Hellenistic zones; Zenobia tried to appease both, and seems to have successfully appealed to the region's ethnic, cultural and <b>political</b> <b>groups.</b> The queen projected {{an image of a}} Syrian monarch, a Hellenistic queen and a Roman empress, which gained broad support for her cause.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections procedures were offered, the process of selecting the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some of the delegates came from areas that are now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as from areas that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, <b>political</b> <b>groups,</b> government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E

5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals {{were opposed to}} the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Civil War (1917–21) {{began after}} the {{provisional}} government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in Russia in October 1917. The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army {{and the forces}} of the White Army, being a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war a number of foreign armies also took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army—including the Western allies—whilst many foreign volunteers also fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. Despite some pressure from Britain, the Australian Prime Minister, William Hughes, had refused to commit forces to Russia following the end of World War I in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{president}} of Slovenia is mainly ceremonial. One of {{the president}}'s duties is to nominate the Prime Minister, after consulting with <b>political</b> <b>groups</b> represented in the National Assembly. The president also proposes candidates for various state offices, as well as judicial appointments to the Constitutional and Supreme Court, which must be approved by the National Assembly. In rare circumstances, the president possesses the power to pass laws and dissolve the National Assembly. The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Unlike the majority of the government, which is chosen by the National Assembly and elected through proportional representation, the president is directly elected by the majority of Slovenian voters.|$|E
