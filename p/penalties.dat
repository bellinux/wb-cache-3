5|$|Despite his decisive penalty miss in the 1994 World Cup final shoot-out, Baggio is {{statistically}} {{one of the}} greatest penalty kick specialists in Italian football history. Baggio scored 85% of his career <b>penalties</b> with only 19 misses, scoring 108 out of 127 <b>penalties</b> in official matches, the most in Italian football history. He scored 10 with Vicenza, 25 with Fiorentina, 38 with Juventus, 5 with Milan, 11 with Bologna, 1 with Inter, 11 with Brescia and 7 with Italy (from 7 attempts, the most goals scored from the spot {{by a member of the}} national team.) 68 of his <b>penalties</b> were scored in Serie A, from 83 attempts, with an 82% conversion rate, one of the best records in Serie A history. In Serie A, Baggio scored 17 <b>penalties</b> for Fiorentina (from 19 attempts), 25 for Juventus (from 28 attempts), 3 for Milan (from 5 attempts), 11 for Bologna (from 11 attempts), 1 for Inter (from 2 attempts), and 11 for Brescia (from 18 attempts). Baggio has scored <b>penalties</b> for six different Serie A clubs. Four of his fifteen misses in Serie A were then scored on rebounds. Behind Totti, Baggio has scored the most <b>penalties</b> in Serie A history. Of his other <b>penalties,</b> 8 were scored in Serie C (from 8 attempts), 8 in European competitions (from 9 attempts), and 17 in the Coppa Italia (from 20 attempts). In shootouts, Baggio has converted three of four career penalties; in World Cup shootouts, Baggio scored twice (1990 and 1998), with his only miss in 1994.|$|E

5|$|For most <b>penalties,</b> the {{offending}} player {{is sent to}} the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time.

40|$|Under {{the rules}} of NCAA Hockey and USA hockey, when a <b>penalty</b> shot is awarded, the nonoffending team has the choice of taking the <b>penalty</b> shot or having a minor <b>penalty</b> {{assessed}} to the offending team. Since the chance of scoring on a <b>penalty</b> shot normally exceeds the chance of scoring during the minor <b>penalty,</b> most teams will accept the <b>penalty</b> shot. We show, however, that {{there are times when}} selecting the minor <b>penalty</b> in lieu of the <b>penalty</b> shot is optimal. We show that when the nonoffending team is ahead {{near the end of the}} game, the optimal choice is the minor <b>penalty.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>penalty</b> area or 18-yard box (also known less {{formally}} as [...] "the <b>penalty</b> box" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "the box") {{is an area}} of an association football pitch. It is rectangular and extends 16.5m (18 yd) to each side of the goal and 16.5m (18 yd) in front of it. Within the <b>penalty</b> area is the <b>penalty</b> spot (or <b>penalty</b> mark), which is 11 m or 12 yards from the goal line, directly in-line with the centre of the goal. A <b>penalty</b> arc adjoins the <b>penalty</b> area, and encloses the area within 9.15m (10 yd) from the <b>penalty</b> spot; it does not form part of the <b>penalty</b> area and is only of relevance during the taking of a <b>penalty</b> kick.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{team with}} a player already in the <b>penalty</b> box has a delayed <b>penalty</b> and the {{opposing}} team scores, the player already in the box will exit and the player with the delayed <b>penalty</b> will serve his <b>penalty.</b> Previously, the goal would negate the delayed <b>penalty.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sanctions {{for such}} infractions may be levied on {{individuals}} or on to clubs as a whole. <b>Penalties</b> may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions.

Among other administrative sanctions are <b>penalties</b> against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{theoretical}} model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three <b>penalty</b> types: the fixed <b>penalty</b> rate, {{which uses a}} constant marginal financial penalty; the make-good provision (quantity <b>penalty),</b> where each missing permit {{in the current period}} is to be offset with a ratio (restoration rate) in the following period; and a mixed <b>penalty,</b> which combines the two <b>penalty</b> types. Using a simple two-period model of firm‟s profit maximisation, we analyse compliance decisions and the efficient <b>penalty</b> level under each <b>penalty</b> type. Firms‟ compliance strategies are modelled as an irreversible investment in abatement measures and permit buying in the market. Our findings indicate that the <b>penalty</b> type does not affect compliance decisions provided that the efficient <b>penalty</b> level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of <b>penalty</b> types. Nevertheless, the mixed <b>penalty</b> design provides the strongest compliance incentives. Hence this finding supports the practice in which this <b>penalty</b> design is widely used in the existing and the proposed trading schemes. Furthermore, we discuss the policy implications of the findings with regard to permit price discovery process and the Australian proposal of tying the <b>penalty</b> level to the permit price. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1963, the <b>penalty</b> stroke {{replaced}} the <b>penalty</b> bully and was awarded for deliberately stopping a certain goal. Then the <b>penalty</b> spot was 8 yd from goal. In 1973, a stroke {{could also be}} awarded for a deliberate foul in the circle. The <b>penalty</b> spot was moved to its current position in 1974. <b>Penalty</b> goals could also be awarded for intentional fouls during a <b>penalty</b> stroke until 2009.|$|R

5|$|The game {{descended into}} a scrappy affair {{in the last}} few minutes, with few clear cut chances for either side. With no further goals, it was decided by <b>penalties.</b> Scholes, Edu and Ferdinand {{converted}} their kicks, before Howard saved Van Bronkhorst's effort. Van Nistelrooy missed his and Wiltord scored to level the tally at 2–2 in the shoot-out. Solskjær, Lauren and Forlán scored, but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield, 4–3 on <b>penalties.</b>|$|E

An assumption {{of this study is}} that the public is made conscious of the death <b>penalty</b> as a salient issue through the popular media, e. g., newspaper stories, magazine articles, movies, television programs, and music. Results of this study support the hypotheses that public consciousness about the death <b>penalty</b> as well as changes in aggregate death <b>penalty</b> opinion are associated with the content of popular media in the form of death <b>penalty</b> songs. As the number of death <b>penalty</b> songs increases in a year, death <b>penalty</b> support decreases two years later...|$|R
