2500|$|The {{remedy for}} {{conversion}} is {{usually in the}} form of damages equal to the fair market value <b>of</b> the <b>chattel</b> at the time of conversion. The converter can offer to return possession <b>of</b> the <b>chattel</b> to the complainant, but the complainant is not obligated to accept. If the complainant wants the chattel returned without any additional monetary damages, they can claim a related tort, detinue. One may use force in order to recover a chattel only if the wrongdoer is either in the process <b>of</b> taking the <b>chattel</b> or the owner <b>of</b> the <b>chattel</b> is in [...] "hot pursuit" [...] <b>of</b> the <b>chattel.</b> This is because a victim of conversion should use the legal remedies available as opposed to [...] "self-help" [...] or violence. Deadly force may never be used in the recovery <b>of</b> <b>chattels.</b>|$|R

25|$|Chattel {{property}} {{may also}} be adversely possessed, but owing to {{the differences in the}} nature <b>of</b> real and <b>chattel</b> property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, favoring the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> often involve works of art.|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of tenure {{did not apply}} to personalty (personal property). However, the relationship of bailment in the case <b>of</b> <b>chattels</b> closely resembles the landlord-tenant relationship that can be created in land.|$|R
50|$|Chattel {{slavery is}} a {{specific}} servitude relationship where the slave is treated as {{the property of the}} owner. As such, the owner is free to sell, trade, or treat the slave as he would other pieces of property and the children of the slave often are retained as the property of the master. There is evidence of long histories <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> slavery in the Nile river valley and Northern Africa, but evidence is incomplete about the extent and practices <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> slavery throughout {{much of the rest of}} the continent prior to written records by Arab or European traders.|$|R

50|$|The use of banausos follows an {{economic}} transition in Greece: {{the use of}} coinage, {{the invention of the}} trireme and of hoplite armor, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> slavery permitted the rise of a new hoplite class, who used the term to distance themselves from the artisans.|$|R
5000|$|Some libertarians in the USA {{consider}} {{that the end of}} slavery coincided with the start of a regime [...] "tainted" [...] by aggressive corporate nationalism, or government intervention into the economy.

50|$|Replevin {{remains the}} modern action, albeit defined by statute, for {{recovery}} <b>of</b> <b>chattels</b> pending a {{decision of the}} right of possession.

50|$|The {{selling of}} one's own child into slavery is likely {{in most cases}} to have {{resulted}} from extreme poverty or debt, but strictly speaking is a form <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> slavery, not debt bondage.

50|$|Pre-contact {{forms of}} slavery were {{generally}} {{distinct from the}} form <b>of</b> <b>chattel</b> slavery developed by Europeans in North America during the colonial period.
