The population fluctuation and spatial distribution of the Alphitobius diaperinus in a <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> in Cascavel, {{in the state of}} Parana, Brazil, was studied between October, 2001 and October 2002. Larvae and adults of the lesser mealworm were sampled weekly using Arends tube traps (n = 22) for six consecutive flock grow-outs. The temperature of the litter and of the <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> was measured at the same locations of the tube traps. Beetle numbers increased continuously throughout all the sampling dates (average 5, 137 in the first week and 18, 494 insects on the sixth week). Significantly greater numbers of larvae were collected than adults (1 to 20 times in 95 % of the sampling points). There was no correlation between temperature and the number of larvae and adults collected, therefore no fluctuation was observed during the sampling period.

40|$|ABSTRACT Distribution of {{inorganic}} elements {{was measured}} in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust from five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> during either winter, spring, or summer. With varied environmental condi-tions {{at the time of}} sampling, the levels of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum were higher than the other elements found in dust samples from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> The most abundant element in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust was calcium. The level of this element in dust samples from the mechanically ventilated house used for research purposes corresponded closely to the level found in the feed fed at sampling time. High zinc levels in layer houses may be attributed to either the abrasive actions of feathers and feet of layers against the galvanized wire cages on the high zinc content in feathers. The ash content of dust from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> ranged from. 31 to 3. 54 %. Air particulate counts for particles ranging in size from. 5 to 10 jum were much higher in the layer house used for commercial purposes (ranged from 34. 9 to 66. 3 X 106 /m 3) than in the layer houses used for research purposes (ranged from 5. 8 to 9. 8 X 106 /m 3). During winter, air particulate levels in the layer house used for commercial purposes were lower (34. 9 X 106 /m 3) than the level during summer (66. 3 X 106 /m 3).

40|$|In the {{organization}} and management of poultry farming many problems arise which call for a solution. Among such problems are the following: The amount of floor space per hen which will prove the most economical, the value of electric lights in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses,</b> amount of labor which can be profitably invested in a poultry flock, {{and the amount of}} feed which can be economically fed to poultry. There are many influences which determine poultry profits that cannot be controlled directly, but the factors mentioned here are largely within the control of the poultryman. He should, therefore, direct them as far as possible so as to increase his net returns. Each hen should be provided with floor space necessary for most efficient production. The poultryman, however, does not know the amount of space that will bring the greatest returns. If the net income from each hen is just as high with two square feet of floor space per hen as where each hen has six square feet, then it is not economical to have six square feet of floor space per hen. If this is the case, it would be advisable for the poultryman to increase the size of his flock so as to obtain the fullest returns from his investment in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> and <b>equipment.</b> A <b>poultry</b> farmer should know if there are any advantages derived from the use of electric lights. If it is an advantage to use lights, the poultryman desires to know how many hours they should be used each day. If, through the use of lights, production is increased {{to such an extent that}} gross returns more than pay for wiring, cost of electricity, and other incidental expenses, lights will prove a profitable investment. A poultryman must give time and labor to his flock in feeding, cleaning coops and gathering eggs. When this work has been efficiently done, extra time and labor is not likely to increase profits. The poultry farmer wants to know the point where increased labor fails to increase profits. This same principle applies to the amount of feed given to poultry. Up to a certain point production may be increased as the amount of feed is increased, but before this point is reached, the extra eggs may not pay for the additional feed costs. The poultry farmer should know the limits of poultry feeding which will prove profitable. whether or not the poultryman solves these problems determines to a considerable degree his success or failure. This study is an attempt to point out the relationship existing between several of these factors which pertain to {{the organization}}, management, and profitableness of poultry farm...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{volatilization}} from poultry litter commonly {{causes a}} buildup of ammonia in the atmosphere of chicken houses that can {{have a negative impact}} on both farm workers and birds. The release of ammonia from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> can also contribute to environmental problems such as atmospheric haze. The most widely accepted management strategy to control ammonia volatilization from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> is the use of litter amendments that are added to the litter. The poultry industry routinely uses dry acids such as aluminum sulfate and sodium bisulfate to reduce ammonia emissions inside the <b>poultry</b> <b>house.</b> Although these products are very effective in controlling ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses,</b> they typically only work for about the first three weeks of the grow-out period, after which time litter pH and ammonia levels will begin to rise. As a result, these litter amendments must be reapplied prior to the placement of new chicks in order for ammonia levels to continually remain low. Therefore this research was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative product for long-term control of ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> This research investigated the efficacy of a single application of superabsorbent polymers to poultry litter for long term in-house ammonia control which could reduce the negative impacts of ammonia on bird health and performance and potentially the environment...|$|R
