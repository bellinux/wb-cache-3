The objective of technical {{education is}} to prepare the youth to be technically competent in {{a broad range of}} occupations and to produce trained manpower commensurate with the needs of the industry, to improve its quality to enhance the employment chances of graduates by moving from a static, supply-based system to a demand driven one. All this depends on the polytechnic teachers if they are competent, knowledgeable and satisfied in their profession. This study examined the various factors affecting the performance of polytechnic teachers and their continuation in teaching profession in Pakistan. This study was descriptive in nature and survey format used to gather information. The objectives of this study were to (a) identify the factors which affect the performance of the polytechnic teachers as perceived by principals, teachers and students. (b) determine the relationship among the factors (perceived intrinsic and extrinsic factors) and performance. (c) get opinion of teachers about the factors which cause to leave or continue teaching profession. (d) determine the relationship between performance of polytechnic teachers and their continuation in teaching profession. (e) find out the difference in the performance and continuation of male and female polytechnic teachers in teaching profession. There were 125 colleges of technology; polytechnic and monotechnic institutes functioning in the country. The population of this study consists of the technology teachers working in these institutions. Six male (6 x 111 = 666 male teachers), ten female (10 x 14 = 140) teachers from each institution, 10 students from each institution (10 Ã— 125 = 1250 students) and 125 principals were included in the sample of this study. In order to measure the variables the research instruments (questionnaires) for principals, teachers and students were developed [...] Data were collected through questionnaires and collected data were tabulated, analyzed and interpreted by using SPSS by applying chi square, percentages, correlation and t-test in the light of objectives of the study. Findings revealed that factors like working conditions, equipment, policies, curriculum, examinations, remuneration, service rules, insufficient funds, facilities, student teacher ratio, fringe benefits, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting</b> affect performance of polytechnic teachers. Majority of polytechnic teachers felt that teaching is low paid profession and opportunities for promotion were inadequate.

50|$|Crownlays are {{typically}} used in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>post</b> and core restorations.

The post and core buildup serve to aid in retention of a traditional crown but increase the likelihood of root fracture because chewing forces are directed vertically along the hollowed out and subsequent weaker remnants of the internal surfaces of an endodontically-treated (root-canal-treated) tooth. Crownlays {{are typically}} constructed from milled, monolithic blocks of solid porcelain which not only very intimately fit the prepared tooth, but are acid etched and bonded into place using very strong resin materials, decreasing the need for physical retention.|$|R
