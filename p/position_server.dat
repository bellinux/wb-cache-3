40|$|Abstract-The {{correctness}} of {{the position}} is fundamental for position-based services. Previously proposed position verification schemes require an infrastructure, or {{the existence of a}} one-hop direct communication between the prover and the verifier. These schemes are less feasible in infrastructure-less networks where communication is achieved via multiple hops, such as mobile ad hoc networks. In this work we propose PO'V, a lightweight, network layer position verification scheme for distributed position services in mobile ad hoc networks, under which a <b>position</b> <b>server</b> can verify whether a user has reported a correct position. We use adaptive transmitting power and multi-path polling to improve verification accuracy.

40|$|Abstract — Position-based ad hoc routing {{algorithms}} {{have proved}} to have decent performance in delivery ratio and endto-end delay. Position service is essential for such algorithms. In this paper, a distributed position service system, named VDPS, is proposed and evaluated. In the system, each node has a virtual home region (VHR), which is a geographic area. Nodes residing in a node’s VHR will act as its <b>position</b> <b>servers.</b> A node updates its <b>position</b> to the <b>servers,</b> through which other nodes can obtain its position. To reduce the overhead on position management and simplify the operation, in VDPS, a VHR is divided into subregions. A region-based broadcast is used for position update, and a sequential searching is used for position retrieving. Different mechanisms for improving system robustness have been proposed. Mathematical models are built for analyzing system robustness and control overhead. Illustrated results show that VDPS can maintain a high system robustness at a relatively low control overhead.

40|$|As {{portable}} computers and wireless networks are becoming ubiquitous, {{it is natural}} to consider the user’s position as yet another aspect {{to take into account}} when providing services that are tailored {{to meet the needs of}} the consumers. Location aware systems could guide persons through buildings, to a particular bookshelf in a library or assist in a vast variety of other applications that can benefit from knowing the user’s position. In indoor positioning systems, the most commonly used method for determining the location is to collect samples of the strength of the received signal from each base station that is audible at the client’s position and then pass the signal strength data on to a <b>positioning</b> <b>server</b> that has been previously fed with example signal strength data from a set of reference points where the position is known. From this set of reference points, the <b>positioning</b> <b>server</b> can interpolate the client’s current location by comparing the signal strength data it has collected with the signal strength data associated with every reference point. Our work proposes the use of multiple successive received signal strength samples in order to capture periodic signal strength variations that are the result of effects such as multi-path propagation, reflections and other types of radio interference. We believe that, by capturing these variations, it is possible to more easily identify a particular point; this is due to the fact that the signal strength fluctuations should be rather constant at every position, since they are the result of for example reflections on the fixed surfaces of the building’s interior. For the purpose of investigating our assumptions, we conducted measurements at a site at Växjö university, where we collected signal strength samples at known points. With the data collected, we performed two different experiments: one with a neural network and one where the k-nearest-neighbor method was used for position approximation. For each of the methods, we performed the same set of tests with single signal strength samples and with multiple successive signal strength samples, to evaluate their respective performances. We concluded that the k-nearest-neighbor method does not seem to benefit from multiple successive signal strength samples, at least not in our setup, compared to when using single signal strength samples. However, the neural network performed about 17 % better when multiple successive signal strength samples were used...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{positioning}} {{services are}} getting more attention not only within research community but also from service providers. From the service providers point of view positioning service that {{will be able to}} work seamlessly in all environments, for example, indoor, dense urban, and rural, has a huge potential to open new markets. However, such system does not only need to provide accurate position estimates but have to be scalable and resistant to fake positioning requests. In the previous works we have proposed a modular system, which is able to provide seamless positioning in various environments. The system automatically selects optimal positioning module based on available radio signals. The system currently consists of three positioning modules—GPS, GSM based positioning, and Wi-Fi based positioning. In this paper we will propose algorithm which will reduce time needed for position estimation and thus allow higher scalability of the modular system and thus allow providing positioning services to higher amount of users. Such improvement is extremely important, for real world application where large number of users will require position estimates, since positioning error is affected by response time of the <b>positioning</b> <b>server...</b>|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of WIFI technology, WIFI-based indoor positioning {{technology has been}} widely studied for location-based services. To solve the problems related to the signal strength database adopted in the widely used fingerprint positioning technology, we first introduce a new system framework in this paper, which includes a modified AP firmware and some cheap self-made WIFI sensor anchors. The periodically scanned reports regarding the neighboring APs and sensor anchors are sent to the <b>positioning</b> <b>server</b> and serve as the calibration points. Besides the calculation of correlations between the target points and the neighboring calibration points, we {{take full advantage of}} the important but easily overlooked feature that the signal attenuation model varies in different regions in the regression algorithm to get more accurate results. Thus, a novel method called RSSI Geography Weighted Regression (RGWR) is proposed to solve the fingerprint database construction problem. The average error of all the calibration points’ self-localization results will help to make the final decision of whether the database is the latest or has to be updated automatically. The effects of anchors on system performance are further researched to conclude that the anchors should be deployed at the locations that stand for the features of RSSI distributions. The proposed system is convenient for the establishment of practical positioning system and extensive experiments have been performed to validate that the proposed method is robust and manpower efficient...|$|R
