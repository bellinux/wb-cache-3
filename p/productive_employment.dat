And yet it is precisely in the most [...] productive industries that higher wages and profits can be, and [...] are, paid. Although each article is sold at a low price, the great [...] quantity produced makes the total sum, or value, out of which the [...] industrial rewards, profits, and wages, are paid, large.

Consequently, although wages and profits may be [...] very high (relatively to older countries) in those industries of [...] the United States whose productiveness is great, yet the very fact [...] of this low cost, and consequently this low price (where [...] competition is effective), is that which fits the commodity for [...] exportation.

This is obviously beneficial to the country. An increase in the funds expended in employing labour, whether that labour be productive or unproductive, tends equally to raise wages. The condition of the whole labouring class is, so far, benefited. It is true that the labourers thus employed by sojourners are probably, in part or altogether, withdrawn from <b>productive</b> <b>employment.</b> But this is far from being an evil; for either the situation of the labouring classes is improved, which is far more than an equivalent for a diminution in mere production, or the rise of wages acts as a stimulus to population, and then the number of productive labourers becomes as great as before.|$|E

The capital, therefore, of the country, is this year diminished by so much.

The loan can not have been taken from that portion of the capital of the country which consists of tools, machinery, and buildings. It must have been wholly drawn from the portion employed in paying laborers: and the laborers will suffer accordingly. But if none of them are starved, if their wages can bear such an amount of reduction, or if charity interposes between them and absolute destitution, there is no reason that their labor should produce less in the next year than in the year before. If they produce as much as usual, having been paid less by so many millions sterling, these millions are gained by their employers. The breach made in the capital of the country is thus instantly repaired, but repaired by the privations and often the real misery of the laboring-class.|$|E

The shortage of collateral creates a binding credit constraint on borrowing by SMEs and hence private sector growth and employment, even though the banking sectors have ample liquidity, {{as is the case in}} many African countries. The model is tested using a sample of 20 African countries over the period 2005 - 09.
