5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as mandated by the Act. <b>Press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> {{the concept}} XJ220 in 1988 was {{overwhelmingly}} positive {{and contributed to}} the decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production. The production version of the car was first shown to the public in October 1991, at the Tokyo Motor Show. The first car was released for press review in autumn 1991.|$|E
5|$|Lu {{attended}} the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, {{where he was}} the senior news editor of the Daily Princetonian. Lu's ambition for a political career developed at Princeton, particularly during his internship in the Capitol Hill office of Senator Charles Mathias. He graduated magna cum laude in 1988, after writing a senior thesis on <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> presidential campaigns. After graduating from Princeton, Lu attended Harvard Law School, where he was one of Barack Obama's classmates from 1988 to 1991.|$|E

The magazine released a cover spoofing the popular <b>press's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> this disaster, headlined [...] "Tragic Ball at Colombey, one dead." [...] As a result, the weekly was banned.|$|R
5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and was evidently {{one of the first}} men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> Custer and his men {{in the days leading up}} to the battle. As {{a newspaper}} stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its Broadway debut, preview {{performances}} of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in Pittsburgh, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921. It was closed early {{on the last day}} by the local Director of Public Safety, who objected to some of the dialogue. Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the closure. The tryouts then moved to Stamford, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was at the Times Square Theatre on October 18, 1921. It ran there for a few weeks until Woods transferred it to his own Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on November 7.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread <b>press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. <b>Press</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
