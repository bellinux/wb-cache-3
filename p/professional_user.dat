In this paper we aim at characterizing the cross-posting activity of <b>professional</b> OSN <b>users</b> across three major OSNs, Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{large scale}} field tests at Davos (Switzerland) and on Col du Lautaret (France) {{focusing}} {{on the performance of}} avalanche rescue transceivers in multiple burial accidents have been conducted in winter 2011 - 2012. Whereas in the Swiss test beginners were searching with low-end transceivers, the French test focused on the advanced and <b>professional</b> <b>user</b> groups who used top-end transceivers. The complexity of the search scenarios has been adapted to the respective user groups. In both tests we measured search time for locating the first, second and third (in some scenarios the fourth) search target. In the test at Davos with 4 out 5 transceivers the novice/average users were unable to locate the third target in about 30 % of the cases on average. This failure was mainly due the malfunctioning of the mark-ing function. In the second test with the advanced and <b>professional</b> <b>user</b> group the number of not-found targets was considerable lower as this user group successfully applied backup search strategies. Test results clearly indicate that even with modern transceivers with digital signal processing the presence of multiple signals during search may still lead to a challenging and problematic situation for the rescuer. Backup search strategies are essential for handling complex rescue scenarios and need to be taught...|$|E
