The {{objective was}} to develop a method for determination and mathematical characterization of <b>P(el)</b> /V and <b>P(el)</b> /R relationships, simultaneously studied at sinusoidal flow-modulated vital capacity expirations in a body plethysmograph. Analysis was carried out by iterative parameter estimation based on a composite mathematical model describing a three-segment <b>P(el)</b> /V curve and a hyperbolic <b>P(el)</b> /R curve. The hypothesis was tested that the sigmoid <b>P(el)</b> /V curve is non-symmetric. Thirty healthy subjects were studied. The hypothesis of a non-symmetric <b>P(el)</b> /V curve was verified. Its upper volume asymptote was nearly equal to total lung capacity (TLC), indicating lung stiffness increasing at high lung volume as the main factor limiting TLC at health. The asymptotic minimal resistance of the hyperbolic <b>P(el)</b> /R relationship reflected lung size. A detailed description of both <b>P(el)</b> /V and <b>P(el)</b> /R relationships was simultaneously derived from sinusoidal flow-modulated vital capacity expirations. The nature of the <b>P(el)</b> /V curve merits the use of a non-symmetric <b>P(el)</b> /V model...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{effusion}} lymphoma (<b>PEL)</b> is a fatal malignancy, {{which typically}} presents as a lymphomatous effusion that later disseminates. Rapamycin (Rapa), which targets mTOR (mammalian target of Rapa), is currently evaluated {{as a treatment}} for <b>PEL,</b> but the recent development of <b>PEL</b> in Rapa-treated post-transplant recipients questions the drug's use in <b>PEL.</b> Here, we used a murine model of <b>PEL</b> effusion that mimics the human disease to investigate the anti-PEL activity of Rapa. We found that Rapa reduces ascites accumulation and extends mouse survival. Initially, Rapa reduced <b>PEL</b> load compared to control mice, but most mice rapidly showed <b>PEL</b> progression. Levels of VEGF, which promotes vascular permeability contributing to effusion formation, were significantly reduced in ascites of Rapa-treated mice compared to controls. Expression of IL- 10, the principal autocrine growth factor for <b>PEL,</b> was initially reduced in <b>PEL</b> from Rapa-treated mice but rapidly increased despite treatment. We found that the hypoxic environment of ascites and Rapa cooperate in stimulating IL- 10 expression in <b>PEL,</b> which likely contributes to the emergence of drug resistance. These results identify Rapa an effective drug to reduce <b>PEL</b> effusions but illustrate the rapid development of drug resistance, which likely limits the efficacy of Rapa in <b>PEL...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Primary {{effusion}} lymphoma (<b>PEL)</b> {{is a rare}} B-cell lymphoid neoplasm mainly {{associated with}} HIV infection, presenting as pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial effusions. A defining property of <b>PEL</b> is its consistent association with Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, and, in most cases, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) co-infection. On these grounds, {{a review of the}} literature related to viral cooperation and lymphomagenesis can help to understand the complex interplay between KSHV and EBV in <b>PEL</b> pathogenesis. Areas covered: In this review, the authors highlight clinical, pathologic, genetic and proteomic features of <b>PEL,</b> in the context of viral cooperation in <b>PEL</b> lymphomagenesis. Expert commentary: Tumour cells are characterized by the overexpression of genes that are involved in inflammation and invasion. Coherently, <b>PEL</b> secretomes are enriched in proteins probably responsible for the particular tropism (cell adhesion and migration) of <b>PEL</b> cells. The development of <b>PEL</b> in HIV+ patients is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay among co-infection with oncogenic viruses (EBV and KSHV), inflammatory factors, and environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{effusion}} lymphoma (<b>PEL)</b> selectively {{involves the}} serous body cavities, occurs predominantly in immunodeficient patients and is infected consistently by human herpesvirus type- 8. <b>PEL</b> is also frequently infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The precise pathogenetic role of EBV coinfection in <b>PEL</b> {{is not fully}} understood. The lymphoma fails to express the EBV transforming proteins EBNA- 2 and LMP- 1, whereas it expresses EBNA- 1 (latency I phenotype). Some studies have hypothesized that other EBV-positive lymphomas expressing the latency I phenotype may associate with specific molecular variants of EBNA- 1, although this issue has not been addressed in <b>PEL.</b> On this basis, this study is aimed at a detailed molecular characterization of EBV in <b>PEL.</b> Fifteen EBV positive <b>PEL</b> (12 AIDS-related, one post-transplant, two arising in immunocompetent hosts) were subjected to molecular characterization of the viral genes EBNA- 1 and LMP- 1, as well as definition of EBV type- 1 /type- 2. The EBNA- 1 gene displayed {{a high degree of}} heterogeneity in different cases of <b>PEL,</b> with seven distinct recognizable variants and subvariants. A wild-type LMP- 1 gene was detected in 10 / 15 cases, whereas in 5 / 15 cases the LMP- 1 gene harbored a deletion spanning codons 346 - 355. EBV type- 1 occurred in 11 / 15 <b>PEL</b> whereas EBV type- 2 occurred in 4 / 15 cases. Despite a high degree of genetic variability of the virus in different <b>PEL</b> cases, each single <b>PEL</b> harbored only one EBV variant, consistent with monoclonality of infection and suggesting that infection preceded clonal expansion. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) individual <b>PEL</b> cases consistently harbor a single EBV strain; (2) EBNA- 1 displays a high degree of heterogeneity in different <b>PEL</b> cases; (3) no specific EBV genotype preferentially associates with <b>PEL...</b>|$|R

The 4,000 foot climb from that direction was very steep, but would bring the attacking force straight to the Israeli outpost without fighting on the ridge. The Golani commander, Amir Drori, concurred. Peled's 51st battalion was therefore posted in an abandoned Syrian village at the foot of the eastern side of the Hermon. For three nights, the battalion practiced a quick climb with full gear, and <b>Peled</b> concluded that the mission was possible. Elazar ordered him to take the entire crest, including the Syrian Hermon.

40|$|After binding {{to their}} targets, {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTL) deliver a lethal hit signal, ultimately leading to target cell lysis, and then can recycle to lyse additional targets, without themselves being destroyed. If non-specific secreted lytic mediators {{are involved in}} such lysis. CTL survival would not be expected unless the effectors are immune to CTL-mediated lysis. Therefore the lytic susceptibilities of alloimmune peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (<b>PEL),</b> containing up to 50 % CTL, and of the cytolytic <b>PEL</b> blasts (PEB), obtained by culturing with interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), were examined. 51 Cr-labelled BALB/c (H- 2 d) anti-EL 4 (H- 2 b) (d alpha b) <b>PEL</b> were lysed 88 %, 78 %, and 48 % by C 3 H/eb (H- 2 k) anti-P 815 (H- 2 d) (k alpha d) <b>PEL,</b> C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) anti-P 815 (b alpha d) <b>PEL</b> and b alpha d PEB, respectively. Similarly, b alpha d <b>PEL</b> were lysed 82 % and 21 % by d alpha b <b>PEL</b> and PEB, respectively. b alpha d PEB were lysed 82 %, 28 - 39 % and 39 - 51 % by k alpha d <b>PEL,</b> b alpha d <b>PEL</b> and b alpha d PEB, respectively, b alpha d PEB were lysed 29 - 55 % by d alpha b <b>PEL.</b> Furthermore, the CTL-containing populations were no less susceptible to lysis than normal lymphocytes. Since the majority (80 - 90 %) of cells in {{these two types of}} CTL-containing populations can be directly and specifically lysed by appropriately immunized <b>PEL</b> CTL, we conclude that both the lytic granule and perforin lacking (<b>PEL)</b> and containing (PEB) CTL are not a priori immune to CTL-mediated lysis. These findings are in accord with theories proposing lysis to be induced by receptor-mediated contact between effector CTL and target cells, and challenge those suggesting the involvement of secreted lytic mediators...|$|R

Five pectolytic genes <b>pel</b> 1, <b>pel</b> 2, <b>pel</b> 3, peh 1, and peh 2 from strains XW 19 (a typical canker lesion-producing strain) and XW 121 (a strain of A(r) type) were PCR-amplified, cloned and characterized. Only the 1. 2 -kb <b>pel</b> 1 gene from XW 19 expressed pectolytic activity.

40|$|The total {{electricity}} consumption of plugged-in electric loads (<b>PELs)</b> currently {{accounts for more}} usage {{than any other single}} end-use service in residential and commercial buildings. Compared with other categories of electric loads, <b>PELs</b> possess significant potential to be efficiently controlled and managed in buildings. Therefore, accurate and reliable <b>PEL</b> identification methods that are used to collect identity and performance information are desired for many purposes. However, few existing electric load identification methods are designed for <b>PELs</b> to handle unique challenges such as the diversity within each type of <b>PEL</b> and similarity between different types of <b>PELs</b> equipped by similar front-end power supply units. The objective of this dissertation is to develop non-intrusive, accurate, robust, and applicable <b>PEL</b> identification algorithms utilizing voltage and current measurements. Based on the literature review of almost all existing features that describe electric loads and five types of existing methods for electric load identification, a two-level framework for <b>PELs</b> classification and identification is proposed. First, the supervised self-organizing map (SSOM) is adopted to classify a large number of <b>PELs</b> of different models and brands into several groups by their inherent similarities. Therefore, <b>PELs</b> with similar front-end power supply units or characteristics fall into the same group. The partitioned groups are verified by their power supply unit topology. That is, different groups should have different topologies. This dissertation proposes a novel combination of the SSOM framework and the Bayesian framework. Such a hybrid identifier can provide the probability of an unknown <b>PEL</b> belonging to a specific type of load. Within each classified group by the SSOM, both static and dynamic methods are proposed to distinguish <b>PELs</b> with similar characteristics. Static methods extract steady-state features from the voltage and current waveforms to train different computational intelligence algorithms such as the SSOM itself and the support vector machine (SVM). An unknown <b>PEL</b> is then presented to the trained algorithm for identification. In contrast to static methods, dynamic methods take into consideration the dynamics of long-term (minutes instead of milliseconds) waveforms of <b>PELs</b> and extract elements such as spikes, oscillations, steady-state operations, as well as similarly repeated patterns.
