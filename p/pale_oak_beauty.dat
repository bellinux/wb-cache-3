50|$|The pale eggar or <b>pale</b> <b>oak</b> eggar (Trichiura crataegi) is a moth of the Lasiocampidae family. It {{is found}} in all of Europe (except Iceland), east to Anatolia.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> has white {{forewings}} {{with two}} irregular broad brown bands along each wing. The first band is short, {{located near the}} base of the wing, and surrounded with a black border. The second band is located near the outer margin with a black border surrounding the inner edge. Between these two bands is a white space sprinkled with black dots as well as a crescent-shaped black mark near the middle. The overall appearance gives the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> a mottled look. B. strataria‘s forewings are [...] in diameter, while its wingspan ranges from [...] The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty’s</b> hind wings are paler than its fore wings and have transverse black bands. The forehead and the front of the thorax are white while its sides are a white-grey blend. Its body is covered with many hairs. The back of the thorax and the body are a darker shade of brown.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty’s</b> {{distribution}} {{stretches from}} {{central and southern}} Europe to Asia Minor, the moth is primarily confined to England and Wales and is occasionally spotted in Scotland and Ireland. Within the UK, the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{has been found in}} western counties including Crom and Garvary. A few discoveries have been made in Argory and Peatlands in the late 1990s. They have also been rediscovered at Rostrevor Before this time the moth had not been seen since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century and sightings still remain relatively rare.|$|R
50|$|Phaeoura quernaria, the <b>Oak</b> <b>Beauty,</b> is a moth of the Geometridae family. It {{is found}} in eastern North America, {{occurring}} as far west as east-central Alberta. The habitat consists of aspen-cherry shrubland.|$|R
5000|$|B. strataria {{demonstrates}} coincident coloration. [...] A cryptic {{disruptive pattern}} on the wings breaks up the outline, while the coloration blends well with the tree bark on which the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> rests.|$|R
50|$|Dymock Forest is {{important}} for butterflies and moths. The pearl-bordered fritillary and wood white occur {{as well as the}} uncommon white admiral. Other recordings include great <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> and satin lutestring. Other scarce moths are associated with particular woodland herbs.|$|R
60|$|And again, from above, how {{beautiful}} {{it is in}} the sharp morning! The whole village lies in bluish shadow, the hills with their thin <b>pale</b> <b>oak</b> trees are in bluish shadow still, only in the distance the frost-glowing sun makes a wonderful, jewel-like radiance on the pleasant hills, wild and thinly-wooded, of this interior region. Real fresh wonder-beauty all around. And such humanity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{caterpillar}} is brown, marbled with white, and has {{two small}} red lumps {{on the back of}} its eighth, ninth and twelfth segments and a small lump on the belly on the seventh, eighth and ninth segments. The caterpillar’s head is slightly notched in the middle, possibly due to evolutionary pressures to resemble twigs in appearance.|$|R
60|$|He led {{me through}} a wide parquet-floored hall {{furnished}} in pale lemon, with huge Cloisonnee vases, an ebonized and gold grand piano, and banks of pot flowers in Benares brass bowls, up a <b>pale</b> <b>oak</b> staircase to a spacious landing, {{where there was a}} green velvet settee trimmed with silver. The blinds were down, and the light lay in parallel lines on the floors.|$|R
60|$|Normally {{he admired}} the office, with a pleased {{surprise}} {{that he should}} have created this sure lovely thing; normally he was stimulated by the clean newness of it and the air of bustle; but to-day it seemed flat--the tiled floor, like a bathroom, the ocher-colored metal ceiling, the faded maps on the hard plaster walls, the chairs of varnished <b>pale</b> <b>oak,</b> the desks and filing-cabinets of steel painted in olive drab. It was a vault, a steel chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin.|$|R
5000|$|Biston strataria, the <b>oak</b> <b>beauty,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is native to Europe, but is {{primarily}} found in the United Kingdom. B. strataria is found {{in a variety of}} habitats, but is mostly found in woodlands where it rests on the bark of trees, camouflaged by its mottled black and grey wings. The male has feather-like antennae while those of the female are more thread-like. The moth has a wingspan of [...]|$|R
60|$|Solemnly he {{came forward}} and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the {{surrounding}} land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms {{on the top of}} the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like <b>pale</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|R
5|$|The north {{transept}} fittings {{are from}} 1936 and are by Caroe & Passmore. They include a finely carved reredos with panelling each side, the altar, rails (in {{the form of}} a long kneeler), a lectern, pews and kneelers, all in <b>pale</b> <b>oak.</b> The reredos has a carved Crucifixion, with St Mary and St John. There is a small Orthodox icon, a Theotokos, or Virgin and Child, {{to the right of the}} reredos. It is a reproduction of an early icon, printed on paper mounted on wood, from Stylite Icons, Welshpool, and probably dates from the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>beauty</b> {{exhibits}} melanism {{and comes}} in two different variations; a dark (melanic) form and light (typica) form. The melanic form is prevalent in the Netherlands, but this form has not been observed in Britain. Details explaining this discrepancy are not yet known. The closest relative to B. strataria is the peppered moth (Biston betularia), which also has two forms. The proportion of melanics is higher in B. betularia compared to B. strataria. This is unusual since, between the two species, it is B. strataria that should have a greater evolutionary selection for the prevalence of melanic individuals due to the higher pollution concentrations in the area.|$|R
25|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} enclosed using {{a bank and}} ditch topped by vertical <b>pales</b> of <b>oak.</b> These first ditchworks cross the River Lyn east of the Little Matlock Gorge. A parker, living in a moated house, was the only occupant, maintaining stocks of deer for the lord of Groby Manor to hunt. The park was greatly extended by the first marquis in the late 15th century, to occupy land previously farmed by both Newtown Linford and the now lost village of Bradgate. Lichen dating of the dry-stone walls suggest that {{the north and west}} boundary walls were built in the 17th and early 18th centuries, when Bradgate was still occupied by the earls of Stamford. The walled spinneys are a later feature, built and planted in the early 19th century as coverts for shooting. The park still has herds of red and fallow deer, which probably have an unbroken occupancy since medieval times.|$|R
50|$|After some {{experience}} of repertory companies, Munden {{was engaged to}} play old men at Leatherhead. He began to make his mark at Canterbury under the manager Hurst, where in 1780 he was the original Faddle in Mrs. Burgess's comedy, The <b>Oaks,</b> or the <b>Beauties</b> of Canterbury. In the company of Joseph Austin and Charles Edward Whitlock in Chester he held a recognised position, and he toured the country. Munden was then able to borrow money purchase the share of Austin {{in the management of}} northern theatres. Here he played the leading comic business, rising in reputation and fortune.|$|R
60|$|Round {{the roadway}} between the entrances of Diana's Grove and Lesser Hill were many trees, with not much foliage {{except at the}} top. In the dusk this place was shadowy, and the view was {{hampered}} by the clustering trunks. In the uncertain, tremulous light which fell through the tree- tops, {{it was hard to}} distinguish anything clearly, and at last, somehow, he lost sight of her altogether, and turned back on his track to find her. Presently he came across her close to her own gate. She was leaning over the <b>paling</b> of split <b>oak</b> branches which formed the paling of the avenue. He could not see the mongoose, so he asked her where it had gone.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{elevated}} strawberry beds, facetiously termed ‘twin strawberry [...] hills,’ rear themselves {{between the}} vase {{and the back}} lawn, the [...] further corners of which are respectively protected from wheelbarrow [...] intrusion by an Irish Quern and a Capsular Stone, venerated in Irish [...] tradition—the former a remarkably perfect, the latter an exceedingly [...] compact specimen, having on one side a double, {{and on the other}} a [...] single hollow. [...] . The remaining points of interest in my garden [...] may be noticed in a very few words. It gradually decreases in [...] breadth, and is fenced off on one side from the garden of a very kind [...] neighbour (which contains two of the finest walnut trees in the [...] parish) by an <b>oak</b> <b>paling</b> partially covered with broad, or Irish, and [...] embellished by the picturesque narrow-leaved ivy.|$|R
50|$|Possibly {{as early}} as the 13th century, Ashdown Forest was {{enclosed}} as a hunting park, mainly for deer, by a 24 mi long pale. This consisted of an earth bank 4-5 feet high surmounted by an <b>oak</b> <b>paling</b> fence with a deep ditch on the forest side that allowed deer to enter but not to leave. It enclosed an area of over 20½ square miles (5,300 hectares). Entry was via 34 gates and hatches, gates being used for access by wheeled vehicles, commoners' animals and mounted groups, hatches by pedestrians. These names survive in local place-names such as Chuck Hatch and Chelwood Gate. Some of these entrances were, and still are, marked by pubs, for example the 18th-century Hatch Inn at Coleman's Hatch, which occupies three former cottages believed to date to 1430 that later may have housed ironworkers from the nearby blast furnace at Newbridge.|$|R
30|$|The nine trialled {{species were}} {{a mix of}} {{evergreen}} and deciduous trees and exhibited a range of tree form. Canopy shape and density were variable with some species having a bushy shrub-like appearance and others more streamlined canopies and forms. In a similar manner, the below-ground appearance of the root systems was also variable. Several species had low root density (i.e. low numbers of roots per m 2 of soil) and elongated “spidery” lateral roots with few small side branches (low root branching order) (blackwood, eucalypt, oak) (Fig.  3). Alder and cherry had dense branching lateral root systems with high root numbers (high root density and high root order) while redwood and cypress had similar dense root systems, but many fine long branching roots. Radiata had long laterals with limited branching order, similar to blackwood but with {{a greater number of}} short branch roots on the main laterals. Alder, redwood and cypress roots were reddish in colour, radiata orange, blackwood and <b>oak</b> <b>pale</b> brown, cherry pale brown to white, and eucalypt dark brown.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} let us {{return to the}} little lord himself. Having secured {{the advantage of a}} long start, by the device of turning the key of his chamber, he repaired to the stables, and finding no one to observe him, saddled his pony and galloped away without plan or purpose. An instinctive love of novelty and adventure induced him to direct his course by a road which he had never before pursued; and, after two or three miles progress through a wild open country of brushwood, he found that he had entered that considerable forest which formed the boundary of many of the views from Cadurcis. The afternoon was clear and still, the sun shining in the light blue sky, and the wind altogether hushed. On each side of the winding road spread the bright green turf, occasionally shaded by picturesque groups of doddered <b>oaks.</b> The calm <b>beauty</b> of the sylvan scene wonderfully touched the fancy of the youthful fugitive; it soothed and gratified him. He pulled up his pony; patted its lively neck, as if in gratitude for its good service, and, confident that he could not be successfully pursued, indulged in a thousand dreams of Robin Hood and his merry men. As for his own position and prospects, he gave himself no anxiety about them: satisfied with his escape from a revolting thraldom, his mind seemed to take a bound from the difficulty of his situation and the wildness of the scene, and he felt himself a man, and one, too, whom nothing could daunt or appal.|$|R
