5|$|Type C: This Mini {{connector}} {{is smaller}} than the type A plug, measuring 10.42mm × 2.42mm but has the same 19-pin configuration. It is intended for portable devices. The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield, the DDC/CEC Ground is assigned to <b>pin</b> 13 instead of <b>pin</b> 17, the CEC is assigned to <b>pin</b> 14 instead of <b>pin</b> 13, and the reserved <b>pin</b> is 17 instead of <b>pin</b> 14. The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A-to-type C cable.|$|E

5|$|USB is {{a serial}} bus, using four {{shielded}} wires for the USB2.0 variant: two for power (VBUS and GND), and two for differential data signals (labelled as D+ and D− in pinouts).

D+ and D− signals are transmitted on a differential pair, providing half-duplex data transfers for USB2.0.

5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing <b>pin</b> microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing <b>pin</b> and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process.

40|$|Superconducting {{critical}} current density was measured {{as a function}} of a perpendicular applied magnetic field in glassy (Mo 0. 6 Ru 0. 4) 82 B 18. The <b>pinning</b> force density was observed to depend linearly on 1 /w, where w is the sample width measured perpendicular to both the current and field. This dependence is attributed to <b>pinning</b> by the sample edges. The bulk <b>pinning</b> contribution can be separated from the edge <b>pinning</b> contribution by extrapolation of the Fp vs 1 /w curve. The edge contribution of the flux <b>pinning</b> was nearly eliminated by electrolytically polishing the sample.
