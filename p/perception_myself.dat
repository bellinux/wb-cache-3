60|$|Talking of a {{taste for}} {{painting}} and sculpture, Powers observed {{that it was something}} very different and quite apart from the moral sense, and that it was often, perhaps generally, possessed by unprincipled men of ability and cultivation. I have had this <b>perception</b> <b>myself.</b> A genuine love of painting and sculpture, and perhaps of music, seems often to have distinguished men capable of every social crime, and to have formed a fine and hard enamel over their characters. Perhaps it is because such tastes are artificial, the product of cultivation, and, when highly developed, imply a great remove from natural simplicity.|$|E

But...when I applied my increased <b>perception</b> to <b>myself,</b> I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for...To put it romantically, I was completely free." [...] Finkel compared this observation to similar statements by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles de Foucauld, and Thomas Merton.|$|R

This study will explore my own personal transformation in becoming a writer, how I found the writer within me, and how it changed my <b>perception</b> of <b>myself</b> as a writer, as I experienced writing {{in the same way}} that professional writers do. As a result of this transformation I began to reflect on my current instructional practices and incorporated changes to move away from ''teaching writing" toward a new direction of "developing writers" in the classroom. This study chronicles the experiences that students and I had, using writing workshop and how my perceptions and changes in writing instruction impacted student learning...|$|R

His mother, Dorothy (née Rosen), was a {{municipal}} employee, and his father, Bertram [...] "Bert" [...] Perlman, was a jazz drummer and television repairman. Perlman said in 1988, [...] "It was not a bad childhood but I had a <b>perception</b> of <b>myself</b> that was ... I was terribly overweight as a young kid, and {{it was sort of}} a low self image."

After the summer project had ended a SNCC staff meeting was called to discuss {{the future of the}} organization. For this meeting King wrote two papers. One paper she wrote {{reflected}} on SNCC's need for a better communication system and how that need interfered with SNCC's lack of bureaucracy. The second paper King wrote was co-written with fellow SNCC staff member, Casey Hayden. This paper addressed {{what it meant to be}} a woman SNCC staff member and the unequal treatment that resulted because of the patriarchal system. In King's words, it addressed the issue [...] "of how my growing <b>perception</b> of <b>myself</b> as a woman might affect the structure and program of SNCC." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{draws on}} the metaphor of ‘a crucible’ to {{describe}} the tertiary classroom context, where I work in initial teacher education with early childhood education (ECE) student teachers. Stories are told about the classroom participants (students and an educator) {{in an attempt to}} find meaning in terms of development, both the students and mine. This storytelling highlights ongoing questions for me about the impact of what happens in the classroom we bring our selves to, and the significance of informed actions for social justice for teachers and teaching. In telling these stories I highlight my deepening understanding of education pedagogy, and <b>perception</b> of <b>myself</b> as a teacher, a practitioner of human influence and change. I hope that these stories echo and illuminate the experiences of other educators as they too seek to understand their practice...|$|R

He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a [...] "personal encounter with God."

60|$|How long I {{remained}} insensible, I know not. I had {{a confused}} notion of being moved and tossed about, and of hearing strange beings and strange voices around me; {{but all this}} was like a hideous dream. When I at length recovered full consciousness and <b>perception,</b> I found <b>myself</b> in bed in a spacious chamber, furnished with more taste than I had been accustomed to. The bright rays of a morning sun were intercepted by curtains of a delicate rose color, that gave a soft, voluptuous tinge to every object. Not far from my bed, on a classic tripod, was a basket of beautiful exotic flowers, breathing the sweetest fragrance.|$|R

The university panel considered it noteworthy and thoughtful, but too informal and witty for a serious academic thesis. The thesis dealt with irony and Schelling's 1841 lectures, which Kierkegaard had attended with Mikhail Bakunin, Jacob Burckhardt, and Friedrich Engels; each had come away with a different perspective. Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium. He was able to fund his education, his living, and several publications of his early works with his family's inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler.|$|R
40|$|In 2007 the Curriculum Council of Western Australia (CCWA) {{introduced}} a new Visual Arts Course of Study (2007), which contains a postmodern perspective and is inclusive of social criticism, multiculturalism, feminism and non-Western art forms. In keeping with the new Visual Arts Course of Study in this Creative Visual Arts Project, I have used the CCWA course outcomes as a framework to develop a visual arts program that is a vehicle for exploring individual personal identity, and {{has the potential to}} increase self-esteem in students in Western Australian secondary schools. The research stems from my personal view that students can benefit significantly from investigating their identity, enabling them to situate their self in a stronger position in their present day life-world when they have a more definite sense of who they are and where they come from. I have placed myself in the position of ‘the subject’ in order to transfer the process into a visual art program that can be utilised within the classroom. The visual arts program is underpinned by Efland’s expressive psychoanalytic model for aesthetic learning, which posits that art is self-expression, a form of learning that contributes to emotional growth. Visual art awakens intellectual inquiry in an individual, increases cognitive potential through enabling personal liberation, and is an adjunct to informing society and culture. The research project culminates in an exegesis and an exhibition of artworks that communicate personal memories and significant historical events exclusive to my whakapapa (Maori genealogy). The artworks are a vehicle for exploring my individual self-identity, enabling me to connect more deeply with my Maori cultural roots. The research paradigm utilised is narrative inquiry, a process of collecting and structuring stories that is characteristic of the traditional Maori practice of storytelling. This project has resulted in a reinterpretation of the <b>perception</b> of <b>myself</b> within my personal life-world. I have a deeper understanding of my cross-cultural roots, a stronger sense of who I am, and a sense of empowerment. I believe Year 11 students can also achieve this outcome through the visual arts program, using it as a tool for investigating their own identity, challenging cultural, social and gender limitations that impact on them, and ultimately empowering their personal life-world...|$|R
40|$|This practice-based {{research}} {{explores the}} notion of Iranian cultural identity as reflected in artworks exhibited in the Tehran Biennials (1958 - 1966) and in a particular individual practice. This research uses the five Tehran Biennales and their national and international context {{as a tool to}} reveal the development of their influence on the construction of new images of Iranian identity. The research frames these national exhibitions within the influence of Western modernism and Western critique of orientalism. It frames its enquiry in historical and theoretical research and my studio practice as a contemporary Iranian artist. It constructs a methodology appropriate for visual analysis across the five events and for examination and comparison of individual artists and artworks. A core aim of the enquiry is gaining better understanding of the tensions between Iranian-Islamic and pre-Islamic traditions and of the changing national sentiment and the influence of Western modernism in the arts. My method includes ‘action research’ that juxtaposes the theoretic, historic, and artistic aspects based on a ‘self-observer’ and ‘observer of others’. By its cycling of studio production and reflection through critical and visual analysis, this method has enabled me to explore theoretical and historical contexts in my works. The research also examines the motivations and influence of Iranian state ideology on the formation and discontinuation of the biennales as instruments for cultural innovation and internationalisation. As all biennales by their nature seek to survey a field of activity, the research has remained sensitive {{to a wide range of}} artists engaged across a spectrum of practices between 1958 and 1966. For some, the period marked a return to their traditions and heritage to recognise and distinguish their national identity from Western art. For others, the new challenges enabled new representations relevant to Iran in the twentieth century. Between these poles, there were many types of ‘return’ and re-emergence, some to Iranian and Islamic heritage, others to an earlier hospitality for international influence. This ten-year period holds the key to my own understanding of my studio practice and the emergence of collage as a technique central to my work. Collage and mixing media have become powerfully associated with the challenges I face in negotiating between East and West, old and new values, and my changing <b>perceptions</b> of <b>myself.</b> The different layers in collage and its variety of media metaphorically suggest the concept of Iranian identity as a layered and collective identity. While my practice comprises autobiographical elements, it is nonetheless analytical in that it draws on the history of the Biennial period. The Tehran Biennials and their attempts to form a new Iranian art provide the background against which I project my conceptions of identity and memory. They are part of the legacy that enables me, a contemporary Iranian woman artist, to explore the various perspectives regarding Iranian identity and the means by which artists visualise it. Moreover, the practice-based method adapted in this research has enabled me to combine historical overview, visual analysis of modern art in Iran, and contemporary insights to offer new an understanding of how art reflects changing identities. This study defines identity, in a personal level, as a multi-layered identity, including fragmented and fragile layers that form within socio-cultural and individual values...|$|R
