25|$|Recyclate is a raw {{material}} that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which {{will be used to}} form new products. The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re-manufacturing {{so that it can be}} used in the production of new materials or products. For example, plastic bottles that are collected can be re-used and made into <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets,</b> a new product.|$|E
25|$|After the sorting of {{materials}} is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, {{in the creation}} of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, {{is one of the most}} highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b> From these <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets,</b> a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.|$|E
25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun in his direction (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets).</b> Gelhaus told investigators {{that he could not}} remember if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} ten years of production, Ensign {{manufactured}} iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden freight cars in the early 1880s, selling {{a large portion of}} its inventory to the Chesapeake and Ohio, Southern Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington. In 1962, the Huntington ACF plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow covered hopper car, was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b> By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.|$|E
25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b> Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. Currently, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, a full tumble polish from rough rock {{to polish}} takes between 3–5 weeks, and {{is done in}} a minimum of 3 steps. Initially, the rocks are {{smoothed}} with a coarse grit (such as 60-90 mesh). The idea behind {{the first step is}} to take rough rock or stone and grind it (tumble it) down into a form which is indistinguishable (in shape) from the final product. [...] This is followed by washing and then a stage of finer grits (120-220 then 400-600 mesh), before the (optional) use of a pre-polishing compound (1200 grit), a washing cycle with detergent to remove any grit on the stones. [...] The final step is a polishing stage using powdered polish, (such as cerium oxide or tin oxide), water, and often small <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> that are designed to cushion the stones as they tumble (so as not to cause chipping) and carry the polish evenly across the stones.|$|E

[...] saw a black gun sitting on the table, and he saw the boy pick up the gun and put it in his waistband." [...] Also on that date, Cleveland Deputy Chief Tomba stated, [...] "The officer got out of the car and told the boy to put his hands up. The boy reached into his waistband, pulled out the gun and [...] fired two shots." [...] According to Chief Tomba, [...] "the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically." [...] On November 26, the day a video of the shooting was released, Chief Tomba is quoted as saying, [...] "Loehmann shouted from the car three times at Tamir to show his hands as he approached the car." [...] The entire incident happened in less than two seconds. The officers later found that the gun was an Airsoft gun which had had its orange safety tip removed. [...] These weapons are actual size replicas of real guns, designed to shoot non-lethal <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{clean-up}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> {{was still}} incomplete. Typhoon Kai-tak hit waters over two hundred-kilometer south to Hong Kong on 16 August, washing up {{a great number}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> as well as litters to the shore, leaving the cleaned beaches messed up again. The sixth container with <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> was found outside the harbor of Hei Ling Chau on 7 September. Besides, as the <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> scattering all over the beaches, grass and nooks and crannies in the rocks were difficult to clean with hands, Sinopec and some volunteers used electric generator and vacuum cleaner to improve efficiency. Institute of Space and Earth Information Science of Chinese University of Hong Kong designed a new system to aid the government and NGOs in monitoring water flow to predict the flow of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b> Some Hong Kong young people even made a plastic pellet cleaner, called Plastic Cleaner No.1, by themselves, which was ordered by Sinopec for the clean-up.|$|E

50|$|Polypropylene pellets do {{not have}} acute toxicity.

The citizens, however, may hardly hear of such things, which accounts for the strong repercussions upon the plastic disaster. After the exposure, distributors once worried that fish eating <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> might have been poisoned and stopped buying local fish. Hong Kong citizens also lost confidence in local fish, {{which led to a}} dramatic drop in local fish sales. The fishermen, consequently, suffered a loss.|$|E

5000|$|... "Plastic Pickup" [...] {{action on}} the shore was {{enhanced}} in early August with more organisations joining in the nongovernmental clean-ups. Ocean Park Conservation Foundation Hong Kong called upon NGOs to offer assistance and organize clean-up groups on 2 August. The Hong Kong government sent a special team to clean up <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> in the Discovery Bay the next day. Under {{the pressure of the}} public, Hong Kong mainstream media eventually put the incident in the front page on 4 August, focusing on how the government withheld information and the possible hazard of the <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets.</b> The exposure of the incident caused strong response from the public. Many Hong Kong citizens went to the beaches to clean up <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> when they were free on weekends. NGOs, such as World Wide Fund for Nature, Lamma Corner, Green Sense, Keyboard Frontline and Hong Kong Society of Herpetology Foundation, organized volunteers to do clean-ups on the beaches.

30|$|Samples from subtidal {{sediment}}s {{are taken}} with sediment sampling equipment, e.g. grab samplers [6, 11, 22]. For coastal sediments, direct sampling of visually identified microplastics (e.g. by hand or using tweezers) has been used. This method {{can be employed}} to sample larger microplastics such as <b>plastic</b> resin <b>pellets</b> (typical diameter: 3.5  mm [23]) {{from the surface of}} sandy beaches. However, it is not suitable for sampling microplastics that do not have a characteristic shape, are smaller than <b>plastic</b> resin <b>pellets</b> or are mixed with other debris [6, 11]. In these cases, bulk sampling is required to avoid an underrepresentation of small microplastics. As the distribution of microplastics on beaches is often heterogeneous, attention needs to be paid to sample size, replication and the location of the sampling sites on the beach [8].|$|R

Since its debut, the only hybrid guns seen on the market are TOP M4A1, as well as M1 Garand, Kar98, and other rifle models. These guns are the least common type of gun on the market today and are generally used by collectors and re-enactors rather than skirmishers.|$|R
40|$|Plastic is {{a common}} item in marine environments. Studies {{assessing}} seabird ingestion of plastics have focused on species that ingest plastics mistaken for prey items. Few studies have examined a scavenger and predatory species {{that are likely to}} ingest plastics indirectly through their prey items, such as the great skua (Stercorarius skua). We examined 1034 regurgitated pellets from a great skua colony in the Faroe Islands for plastics and found approximately 6 % contained <b>plastics.</b> <b>Pellets</b> containing remains of Northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) had the highest prevalence of plastic. Our findings support previous work showing that Northern fulmars have higher loads of plastics than other sympatric species. This study demonstrates that marine plastic debris is transferred from surface feeding seabird species to predatory great skuas. Examination of plastic ingestion in species that do not ingest plastics directly can provide insights into how plastic particles transfer vertically within the food web...|$|R

Sinopec allowed citizens to go to Kwai Tsing Container Terminals to compute the loss of containers in order to estimate the quantity of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> crashed into the sea. Only at that time did the public learn that there were altogether six containers loaded with <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> falling into the sea, four of which {{were found in the}} waters of the east, north and northwest of Lamma Island and the east of Tai A Chau by the MD and CSCL. One and one-fifth containers of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellets</b> were released out of four containers and two containers were still missing.

50|$|This process starts {{by feeding}} <b>plastic</b> {{material}} (<b>pellets,</b> granules, flakes or powders) from a hopper into {{the barrel of}} the extruder.

The molten polymer is then forced into a die, which shapes the polymer into apipe that hardens during cooling.|$|R
40|$|Plastic is the {{dominant}} form of debris in the marine environment, with microplastics of particular concern due to their wide distribution and impact. Microplastics contain catalyst residues and additives such as plasticisers and fillers. They can absorb hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the surrounding environment. Recent evidence indicates {{they can also be}} a vector for potentially toxic elements (PTE). <b>Plastic</b> resin <b>pellets</b> were collected from the foreshore at Limekilns, Scotland, UK and from Shuwaikh Port, Kuwait. They were air-dried, sieved, rinsed with deionised water and then classified using FTIR analysis. Examples of each type of <b>plastic</b> <b>pellet</b> were subjected to a two-step extraction procedure: cold leaching for 24 h in 20 % aqua regia followed by microwave-assisted digestion in nitric acid. Aluminium, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Na, Pb, V, and Zn were measured in the extracts by ICP-MS using an Agilent 7700 x instrument. Pellets collected from Limekilns were 68 % polyethylene and 32 % polypropylene, while samples from Kuwait were 45 % polyethylene and 45 % polypropylene. Analyte concentrations were higher in polyethylene than in polypropylene pellets at both locations, and concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Ni, and V are significantly higher in Kuwait than in the UK samples. Larger amounts of PTE were released in the first step of the extraction than in the second step, except for Ca, Mg and Na. The latter were also detected in virgin pellets, suggesting they were incorporated during pellet manufacture rather than sorbed from the marine environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{final two}} steps are the polish {{and in some}} cases the burnishing.
