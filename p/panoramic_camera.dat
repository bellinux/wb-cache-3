5|$|In a <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera,</b> the {{focal-plane shutter}} was {{replaced}} by a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport <b>Panoramic</b> <b>Camera,</b> which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured a panoramic view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Neubronner {{found that}} {{ten years of}} hard work and {{considerable}} expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described below), had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> is displayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E

As the <b>panoramic</b> <b>cameras</b> see {{a large part of the}} scene around them in each image, they can provide more complete reconstructions from fewer image [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The epipolar {{geometry}} of central <b>panoramic</b> catadioptric <b>cameras</b> is presented. Firstly, {{we show that}} central <b>panoramic</b> catadioptric <b>cameras</b> are obtained {{by a combination of}} (i) a conventional perspective camera with a hyperbolic mirror or (ii) an orthographic camera with a parabolic mirror. Secondly, a complete characterization of the epipolar {{geometry of}} central <b>panoramic</b> catadioptric <b>cameras</b> is given as the hyperbolic and the parabolic catadioptric cameras are the only <b>panoramic</b> catadioptric <b>cameras</b> with a single mirror which have a single viewpoint. It is shown that epipolar curves in image become (i) general conics for the hyperbolic camera (ii) ellipses or lines for the parabolic camera. It is advocated that the difference in the estimation of epipolar geometry for conventional and central <b>panoramic</b> <b>cameras</b> consists in image data normalization. A normalization suitable for <b>panoramic</b> <b>cameras</b> is proposed. The effect of normalization is demonstrated for the hyperbolic camera...|$|R
5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much more {{is known about the}} pigeon cameras developed {{at about the same time}} by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} begins with <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> shots of a {{helicopter}} flying over Los Angeles, at night. Then during Rick Ross's verse the female {{members of the group}} appear posing in the background while Ross raps for the camera. Swizz Beatz and Rico Love make cameos alongside Ross. In a third scene, Diddy can be seen driving through the city at night in a black Bugatti Veyron. For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar and enjoying the night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading two women in an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of the video, and during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside against a backdrop of thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E

25|$|T-55 Fire Support - Uralvagonzavod is {{offering}} the Peruvian Army an upgrade for its T-55s {{as an alternative}} to replacement with new tanks. The proposal is to replace the turret of their current tanks with the turret of the BMPT. The BMPT turret is equipped with two 2A42 30 mm autocannons, two AGS-17 grenade launchers, four 9M120 Ataka-V ATGMs, and a PKTM machine gun. Every operator in the turret has a scope, and the main armament operator has a thermal camera, an optical sight, and a <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera.</b> It is also equipped with a laser detection system. Although the BMPT design fits onto a T-72 tank chassis, it can be adapted to fit on a T-55.|$|E
500|$|Over {{several days}} in December 1986, U2 {{travelled}} with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert for a photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at Reno, Nevada, before moving to locations in California such as the ghost town of Bodie, the Harmony Hotel in Twentynine Palms, Zabriskie Point, Death Valley Junction, and other sites in Death Valley. Corbijn rented a <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, [...] "Fortunately {{there was a lot}} of light." [...] Averill filmed portions of the trip with an 8 mm film camera. The photo shoots took place in the mornings and evenings, with mid-days spent travelling and on preparation. Corbijn later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose [...] "man and environment, the Irish in America". Averill said of their photographic approach, [...] "What I was trying to do with the way we shot the pictures and framed the cover was to suggest the landscape vision and cinematic approach that was taken to the recording." ...|$|E

2500|$|The round, shallow {{depression}} {{in this image}} resulted from the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars. The Rock Abrasion Tool (aka [...] "RAT") on NASA's Spirit rover ground off {{the surface of a}} patch [...] in diameter on a rock called Adirondack during sol [...] (February 6, 2004). The hole is [...] deep, exposing fresh interior material of the rock for close inspection with the rover's microscopic imager and two spectrometers on the robotic arm.

Mimi's flaky appearance leads scientists to a number of hypotheses. Mimi could have been subjected to pressure either through burial or impact, or may have once been a dune that was cemented into flaky layers, a process that sometimes involves the action of water.|$|E

50|$|For Panoramas of English Gardens, {{depicting}} twenty gardens, he used several <b>panoramic</b> <b>cameras,</b> {{one of them}} home-made, which necessitated composing {{the views}} both upside down and back to front with his head underneath a traditional black cloth.

The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 pixels. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [...]) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} aircraft were further modified with new TF33-P-11A engines that delivered even greater thrust {{than those of}} the prototypes. Foil systems developed in 1962 for the WC-130B to collect particulate debris from nuclear tests were installed in the bomb bay and the fuselage beside the cockpit. The wings had four hard points on which to mount the J60 engines and air particulate sampling pods, a gaseous sampling system was housed in the fuselage, and a KA-56 downward-looking <b>panoramic</b> <b>camera</b> mounted in the nose. Two aircraft were additionally modified to carry the Bulova 707-1000 long range camera, which had a 240-inch (608mm) focal length that resulted in its reference designation of Big Item. These high-altitude side-looking cameras, secured by a roll-stabilized mount, could take oblique shots at 5 to 15 degrees below the horizon up to [...] range from the aircraft and provide 30-inch (76cm) high resolution images. The electronics were also updated on the standard F model. The nose of the aircraft was lengthened to house sophisticated navigational equipment along with sensitive detection equipment for gathering SIGINT/ELINT intelligence. The cockpit was provided with a modified Lear MC-1 autopilot. [...] The average cost of each RB-57F conversion approximated $1.5 million.|$|E
