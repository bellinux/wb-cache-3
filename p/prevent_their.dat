Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} most modern units of the High Seas Fleet, Brummer and Bremse were {{included}} in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers. The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 in single file, commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. They were met at sea by a combined fleet of 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet arrived in the Firth of Forth later that day, and between 25 and 27 November, they were escorted to Scapa Flow. Upon arrival, all wireless equipment was removed from the ships and the breech blocks of their heavy guns taken to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> use. Crews were reduced to minimum levels.|$|E
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E

Moltke {{participated in}} several major battles {{with the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea. At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> seizure by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} Experiment was escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{the castle}} was {{involved}} in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had {{made their way to}} British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> departure; one gun, albeit not ready for action, was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.|$|E

If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to <b>prevent</b> <b>their</b> risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
