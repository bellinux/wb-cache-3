50|$|A dough <b>proofer</b> is {{a warming}} chamber used in baking that {{encourages}} fermentation of dough by yeast through warm temperatures and controlled humidity. It is also called a proofing box, proofing oven or proofing cabinet. The warm temperatures increase {{the activity of}} the yeast, resulting in increased carbon dioxide production and a higher, faster rise. Dough is typically allowed to rise in the <b>proofer</b> before baking, but can also be used for the first rise, or bulk fermentation. Desired <b>proofer</b> temperatures can range from around 70F / 21C up to about 115F / 46C (cooler temperatures are achieved in a dough retarder, see below). Commercial bakers typically use large, temperature- and humidity-controlled proofers, whereas home bakers employ a variety of methods to create a warm, humid environment for dough rising. Examples include a home oven with a bowl of water and the pilot light on, a box with a bowl of hot water in it (the water is replaced periodically to maintain warmth), or a counter top <b>proofer</b> (an electric appliance) designed for home use.|$|E

40|$|Digital color proofs and pre-proofs {{are used}} by graphic artists and {{commercial}} printers throughout the prepress process. However the prepress process has undergone radical changes {{over the past decade}} due to the introduction of desk top publishing and desktop prepress. Alongside of the desktop publishing revo lution has come a multitude of new digital proofing technologies for use in this ever changing environment. Technologies including, but not limited to, liquid inkjet, dye sublimation, continuous inkjet, color laser, and thermal wax transfer printers have provided an entire range of color accuracy and price suitability to many of their users. However one {{needs to be able to}} understand the practical applications and limitations of these technologies to make a suitable choice for a specific prepress operation or design process. Therefore a handbook for the users of digital proofs has been created for their benefit. The underlying structure of this handbook is based on the following six chap ters. The first chapter, entitled Communicating with Prepress and the Attributes of Digital Proofing, contains multiple parts. Firstly, it contains information for the designer in regards to the advantages and disadvantages of all types of digital output devices. It discusses the advantages which digital output devices may or may not have over conventional proofing systems. Additionally, ideas such as the vantages and drawbacks of preproofers and <b>proofers</b> is elaborated upon. Information for this part of the chapter was obtained through questionnaires completed by, and interviews with print buyers, art directors, and production managers from advertising agencies and prepress providers in the Rochester area. More information for this section of the first chapter was obtained through various manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s literature, printing industry reports and various periodi cals. Chapter One also discusses ideas behind the application of color printers (preproofers) and digital <b>proofers.</b> These ideas address issues which pertain to the application of specific printing and proofing processes to specific phases of the creative and production processes. Additionally, discussions regarding proof ing costs, qualities, and production turnaround time may be found in this part of the first chapter. Information for this section of Chapter One was obtained through information found in printing and publishing related periodicals, as well as in manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 literature. Finally, the first chapter develops a system for the correction of digital preproofs and proofs. Multiple groups of ideas pertaining to the correction of digital output are discussed. Some of these include sections entitled Digital File Tracking and Identification, Evaluation of Design Elements, Evaluating Colors, Element Positioning, and Element Dimension Adjustments. Information for this part of the chapter was obtained through the evaluation of previously corrected digital con tract proofs and preproofs, as well as the interviews and questionnaires men tioned above. The second chapter, entitled Proofing Typography, displays the many different ways that printing and proofing technologies affect text type and display typog raphy. Using the CD-Rom included in the back of the book, one may view on screen how the following technologies affect type ranging from 3 points to 72 points in size: liquid inkjet, large format liquid inkjet, phase-change inkjet, ther mal wax transfer, dye sublimation, continuous inkjet, and dye ablation. Information and samples for this chapter were obtained through printing and proofing system manufacturers and advertising agencies in the Rochester area. The Color Primer and Chapter Three: Proofing for Imagery and Color, contain information for the designer which may be applied to proper evaluation of color on color prints and digital proofs. The Color Primer discusses subjects such as color space, the additive and subtractive color theories, and common color mea surement tools. Chapter Three then applies some of this knowledge in its discus sions of proper lighting conditions for viewing prints and proofs, and different human factors which influence the highly subjective evaluation of all digital color output. Information for this chapter was gathered using graphic arts and printing industry related periodicals and industry-wide books related to color and its reproduction. The fourth chapter, entitled Substrates and Digital Output, educates the design er about the effects on text, imagery, and graphics which occur when creating digital prints and proofs on a variety of papers. Various paper surfaces such as gloss, semi-gloss and matte surfaces are addressed. The affects of colored paper on imagery and graphics are also elaborated upon. Additionally, printing and proofing processes are discussed in regards to the substrates that they accept for output. Information for this chapter was gathered through manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 litera ture and various industry related books and periodical articles. The Proofing Process Supplement was created to familiarize the designer with all currently popular forms of digital output technology. The process supplement discusses the imaging processes used by the following digital output technolo gies: liquid inkjet, phase-change inkjet, thermal wax transfer, dye sublimation, continuous inkjet, and dye ablation. Additionally, the supplement contains brief explanations regarding screening technologies. Information for the process sup plement was gathered through manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 literature, interviews with pre press providers in the Rochester area, and interviews with technical representa tives from the manufacturers of devices which use the above digital, color out put technologies. Chapter Five, entitled Image Fidelity, simply illustrates how all of the current ly popular printing and proofing technologies affect graphics and imagery. Using the CD-Rom included with the guidebook, the reader may view magni fied and normal views of printing and proof sample imagery. Information noted by the reader in the proofing process supplement may then be actively applied when viewing these samples. Information and sample prints for the fifth chapter were gathered from several manufacturers and advertising agencies in the Rochester area. The sixth chapter, entitled The Acceptance of Digital Contract Proofing, discusses a new definition of the contract proof in regards to the evolution of digital proof ing. This chapter provides ideas for the designer, art director, and print buyer to realize when considering the use of digital contract proofing. Several questions are raised concerning what requirements a digital contract proof must fulfill depending upon the areas of its application and any agreements between the designer and prepress provider regarding their specific definition of a digital contract proof. Additionally, specific advantages of digital contract proofs, such as their ability to fingerprint a press and/or press run, are discussed. Finally, a discussion pertaining to the education of all users of digital proofing technolo gies is presented to aid the overall acceptance of digital contract proofing. Information for this chapter was obtained through the extensive interviews of leading technical and product oriented representatives from the manufacturers of currently used digital contract proofing systems. Many conclusions have been reached with the completion of this guidebook. In brief, the first and most prominent conclusion which may be reached states that the acceptance of digital contract proofing lies within the education of all designers, art directors and print buyers about digital printing and proofing technologies. As the use of digital contract proofing grows, education and inter est by all creative professionals will orient them towards their use of digital proofing systems. The next conclusion which has been reached is that the proper application of color printers and digital <b>proofers</b> is of major importance for the designer due to the added flexibility and rewards which result from the use of digital color out put devices throughout the creative and production processes. Another conclu sion which may be reached is that the display of proofing and printing process effects on text, graphics, and imagery serves to directly inform the creative pro fessional how these elements may be distorted by the utilized output device. Knowledge gained by the creative professional in regards to these effects helps to answer many questions regarding print or proof quality and proper output device application. Finally, additional knowledge gained by designers which pertains to proper viewing of all color output, color theories, color measurement, and proofing sub strates helps them to better communicate with those prepress and print professionals involved in the production process...|$|R

50|$|In Australia, plaster or cement render that {{is applied}} to {{external}} brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12 mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one {{at the base of}} the wall and one around chest height) which are screed plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screed off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be applied with the plasterer using a t-bar to screed the final coat until it is plumb straight and square. The first method is generally used where quality of finish is at a premium. The second method is quicker but can be several millimeters out of plumb. The second coat can be a slightly weaker mix 5/1/1, or the same as the base coat with maybe a water <b>proofer</b> in the mix added to the water to minimize efflorescence (rising of salts). Some plasterers used lime putty in second coat instead of dehydrated lime in the render. The mortar {{is applied to}} about 5 mm thick and when the render hardens is screeded off straight. A wood float or plastic float is used to rub down the walls. Traditionally, water is splashed on walls using a coarse horsehair plasterers brush followed by immediately rubbing the float in a circular or figure 8 motion although a figure of 8 can leave marks. Many modern plasterers use a hose with a special nozzle with a fine mist spray to dampen walls when rubbing up (using a wood float to bring a consistent finish). Using a hose brings a superior finish and is more consistent in colour as there is more chance in catching the render before it has a chance to harden too much. After the work area is floated, the surface is finished with a wet sponge using the same method as floating with a wood float, bringing sand to the surface to give a smooth consistent finish.|$|E

The performance of these tests for type-specific identification of HPV was assessed with cervical specimens from 192 cases of cervical cancer in comparison with consensus MY 09 /MY 11 PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing (consensus PCR). The overall HPV detection rates were 94. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 91. 7, 97. 9), 83. 3 % (95 % CI, 78. 1, 88. 5), and 86. 5 % (95 % CI, 81. 7, 91. 3) for MassARRAY, <b>Proofer,</b> and consensus PCR, respectively. All tests were negative in six (3. 1 %) of the 192 cases. Considering only the specimens that contained {{at least one of}} the five types targeted by <b>Proofer,</b> the detection rates were 96. 6 %, 91. 4 %, and 86. 9 % for MassARRAY, <b>Proofer,</b> and consensus PCR, respectively. MassARRAY detected multiple infections in 14. 1 %, <b>Proofer</b> detected multiple infections in 3. 6 %, and consensus PCR failed to detect any multiple infections. The agreement was highest at 86. 0 % (kappa = 0. 76) between MassARRAY and <b>Proofer</b> and lowest at 81. 8 % (kappa = 0. 69) between <b>Proofer</b> and consensus PCR.

40|$|Abstract: Color {{matching}} between proofs {{and press}} sheets {{has not been}} a trivial task. Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between hard copy output devices are some of the reasons that proofs and press sheets don’t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color <b>proofer,</b> and a thermal dye transfer process. Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color <b>proofer</b> and a continuous-tone digital color <b>proofer</b> improve its color matching to a reference press sheet.

40|$|Just as the {{invention}} of photography challenged the world's visual literacy {{at the turn of}} the century, so has computer graphics begun to reshape visual communication. Although still in its infancy, recently developed tools for visual communication have made computer graphics and electronic imaging accessible to a much larger number of artists and other professionals. The use of these systems has emphasized a new need for an automatic color image proofing system combining text and images in variable size. Such a system would ease the distribution of and accessibility to digital images with high quality and low cost. This thesis describes the Color <b>Proofer,</b> a system that has been designed to meet these needs. This system includes a software package that performs basic image processing functions similar to basic darkroom manipulations, designed for color hardcopy. It also includes a system for creating halftone dot fonts to aid in the production of high quality color proofs. A typesetter capable of producing magazine quality color images and text is an integral component of the Color <b>Proofer.</b> The Color <b>Proofer</b> is designed for photographers and graphic designers who want high quality proofs of computer generated images. by Elizabeth Rosenzweig.

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) DNA {{testing has}} a higher clinical sensitivity than cytology {{for the detection of}} high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN 2 +). However, an improvement in specificity would be desirable. As malignant transformation is induced by HPV E 6 /E 7 oncogenes, detection of E 6 /E 7 oncogene activity may improve specificity and be more predictive of cervical cancer risk. The PreTect HPV-Proofer assay (Proofer; Norchip) detects E 6 /E 7 mRNA transcripts from HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 with simultaneous genotype-specific identification. The clinical performance of this assay was assessed in a cross-sectional study of women referred for colposcopy in comparison with the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2; Qiagen) test, which detects DNA of 13 high-risk oncogenic HPV types collectively. Cervical specimens were collected in PreservCyt, and cytology was performed using the ThinPrep method (Hologic). The samples were processed for HPV detection with <b>Proofer</b> and HC 2 and genotyping with the Linear Array method (Roche Molecular Systems). Histology-confirmed CIN 2 + served as the disease endpoint to assess the clinical performance of the tests. A total of 1, 551 women were studied, and of these, 402 (25. 9 %) were diagnosed with CIN 2 + on histology. The <b>Proofer</b> assay showed a sensitivity of 78. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 74. 1 to 82. 1) versus 95. 8 % (95 % CI, 93. 8 to 97. 8) for HC 2 (P < 0. 05) and a specificity of 75. 5 % (95 % CI, 73. 0 to 78. 0) versus 39. 6 % (95 % CI, 36. 8 to 42. 4), respectively (P < 0. 05). The lower sensitivity and higher specificity of <b>Proofer</b> for detection of CIN 2 + {{can be attributed to the}} fact that this test detects the expression of E 6 /E 7 genes beyond a threshold from a limited number of oncogenic HPV types. In conclusion, <b>Proofer</b> is more specific than HC 2 in identifying women with CIN 2 + but has a lower sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|ICC color {{management}} system (CMS) {{has become a}} major tool for color image rendering and color matching in the printing and publishing industry. It attempts to automate color management functions, e. g., from scan to print, and from press sheet to proof, with the use of device profiles, a CMM, and an application programming interface. Earlier studies, conducted at RIT, showed that ICC-based digital proofing did not perform better than a well calibrated film-based proofing system. Specifically, the average AE between ICC color managed proofs and a reference press sheet was found to be 6 - 9 while the average AE between a film based proof and its correspondence press sheet was 5. Realizing that sources of AE errors exist in many places, e. g., printing consistency, <b>proofer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s color gamut, proofing consistency, measurement conditions, this paper discussed an improved methodology for testing the performance of color matching in a digital proofing workflow. The source profile was a SWOP press profile, supplied by Kodak, which characterizes the ANSI CGATS TR 001 - 1995 - Type 1 Printing condition. The destination profile was built from an Epson SC 3000 ink jet printer using the Kodak Colorflow ProfileEditor at the printer 2 ̆ 7 s default color gamut. The IT 8. 7 / 3 basic (CMYK) target was transformed {{with the use of the}} Mac OS, ColorSync 2. 5, Kodak CMM, and Adobe Photoshop 5. 0. 2, and output to the Epson SC 3000 ink jet printer. The IT 8. 7 / 3 basic target, containing 182 patches, was measured colorimetrically (D 50, 2) and compared to ANSI CGATS TR 001 - 1995 -Type 1 Printing (SWOP) data. The average AE between an ICC color managed Epson proof and the CGATS TR 00 1 data set was 3. 7 AE. This represents a significant improvement over previous research findings. The improved color matching performance was due to the following: (1) an accurate press profile, (2) no printing inconsistency in the experiment since no press run was conducted, (3) EPSON SC 3000 being a very stable device after the first two hours of the print out, and (4) improved profiling software. Like most color proofing systems, the Epson SC 3000 <b>proofer</b> has a larger color gamut than that of SWOP. This researcher was curious if the color matching can be improved if the Epson profile was built under the condition where its color gamut is only slightly larger than SWOP as indicated by solid ink densities. Reducing color gamut of the Epson printer was implemented by means of transfer curves in software. The results showed that there is no improvement whatsoever in color matching. Two reasons shed light on the subject: (1) only hardware adjustments can change the behavior of the proofer; software adjustments only clip its color gamut, and the overall color gamut of the <b>proofer</b> stays unchanged; (2) While solid ink density of the adjusted CMY showed larger a*b*plot in the <b>proofer,</b> it does not assure that the C* of these inks remains to be larger as L* decreases. In other words, a <b>proofer</b> with a wider a*b*plot than a printer does not necessarily have a larger gamut slice in the L*C* dimension. These are the reasons why reducing color gamut as a part of the <b>proofer</b> calibration did not improve its color matching performance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} the second most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as a necessary but not sufficient cause in almost all invasive cervical cancer cases and recent attention has focused on the ability to detect the overexpression of HPV E 6 and E 7 oncogenes through mRNA testing. This study systematically reviews the literature on the accuracy of HPV mRNA testing and compares the test s performance to HPV DNA testing on the same patient samples. The Pre Tect <b>Proofer</b> (Norchip) /NucliSENS Easy Q (bioMérieux) and the APTIMA HPV assay (Gen-Probe) were identified as two commercial mRNA tests. Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched from January 1996 through March 2010 which returned 2953 potentially relevant citations. Two reviewers assessed the references for relevance and selected ten manuscripts (nine studies) which met our inclusion criteria. Six studies investigated the performance of the Pre Tect Proofer/NucliSENS EasyQ, two studies investigated the performance of the APTIMA assay and one study investigated both mRNA tests on the same patient samples. The reference standard used to diagnose precancerous lesions was histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 + (CIN 2 +). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed in duplicate using QUADAS. Raw data was extracted independently and used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic odds ratios. Review Manager 5. 0 software was used to fit a series of summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curves. Results: The sensitivities ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 86 and from 0. 90 to 0. 95 for the Pre Tect <b>Proofer</b> and APTIMA assay, respectively. The specificities ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 97 and from 0. 42 to 0. 61 for the Pre Tect <b>Proofer</b> and APTIMA assay, respectively. The SROC curves for both mRNA tests were {{to the left of the}} diagonal and the APTIMA assay performed closest to the DNA tests. Limitations include few primary studies, considerable heterogeneity and varying methodological quality of the included studies. Conclusion: The synthesized evidence suggests that mRNA tests have diagnostic relevance, but additional studies and economic evaluations must be conducted in order to make a solid conclusion regarding the clinical applicability of HPV mRNA testing...|$|E

40|$|Direct Digital Color Proofing (DDCP) {{significantly}} improves {{quality control}} {{when compared to}} traditional analog systems. This thesis project investigated the accuracy of a DDCP. In addition, {{the advantages of the}} digital proofing process versus traditional analog systems are discussed. The major advantages of DDCP are that it is less expensive and less time consuming than traditional analog proofing methods. Direct digital color proofs are not widely accepted by the graphic arts industry. The reason for part of this problem is that in the past midrange digital proofers have not been accurately calibrated to SWOP specifications. In this project, the author tested to see how well two different midrange proofers could be calibrated to meet SWOP specifications. Two midrange digital proofers were used to demonstrate how accurately the proofs can match the press sheet. After calibrating the <b>proofer</b> to match the press sheet as closely as possible two experiments were conducted. The first was an objective test which required solid ink density readings to be measured, calculations performed and the results plotted on the GATF color hexagon. The plots of the press sheet, 3 M rainbow proof and the Tektronix Phaser 300 were analyzed to see how well they aligned. The second experiment was subjective. This experiment entailed designing a survey form, enlisting the cooperation of industry experts to participate in the survey. The experts were asked to visually analyze the proofs and determine whether or not they could serve a useful purpose. Their comments were recorded on a survey questionnaire and finally, the results were analyzed.

Aptima was also compared with the PreTect HPV-Proofer E 6 /E 7 mRNA assay (Proofer; Norchip) in the referral population. Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt (Hologic Inc.) were processed for HPV detection and genotyping with the Linear Array (LA) method (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Histology-confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2) or worse (CIN 2 +) served as the disease endpoint. On the basis of 1, 418 referral cases (CIN 2 +, n = 401), the sensitivity of Aptima was 96. 3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 94. 4, 98. 2), whereas it was 94. 3 % (95 % CI, 92. 0, 96. 6) for HC 2. The specificities were 43. 2 % (95 % CI, 40. 2, 46. 2) and 38. 7 % (95 % CI, 35. 7, 41. 7), respectively (P < 0. 05). In 1, 373 women undergoing routine screening (CIN 2 +, n = 7), both Aptima and HC 2 showed 100 % sensitivity, and the specificities were 88. 3 % (95 % CI, 86. 6, 90. 0) and 85. 3 % (95 % CI, 83. 5, 87. 3), respectively (P < 0. 05); for women ≥ 30 years of age (n = 845), the specificities were 93. 9 % (95 % CI, 92. 3, 95. 5) and 92. 1 % (95 % CI, 90. 3, 93. 9), respectively (P < 0. 05). On the basis of 818 referral cases (CIN 2 +, n = 235), the sensitivity of Aptima was 94. 9 % (95 % CI, 92. 1, 97. 7) and that of <b>Proofer</b> was 79. 1 % (95 % CI, 73. 9, 84. 3), and the specificities were 45. 8 % (95 % CI, 41. 8, 49. 8) and 75. 1 % (95 % CI, 71. 6, 78. 6), respectively (P < 0. 05). Both Aptima and <b>Proofer</b> showed a higher degree of agreement with LA genotyping than HC 2. In conclusion, the Aptima test is as sensitive as HC 2 but more specific for detecting CIN 2 + and can serve as a reliable test for both primary cervical cancer screening and the triage of borderline cytological abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} intent {{of this research}} was to verify that a new method - called the Little Joe method in this report - could be used to verify that CMY offset inks conform to ISO 2846. This method would use less time to generate multiple ink film thicknesses (IFTs) than the traditionally used ISO 2834 method. With a graduated gage, a Little Joe <b>proofer</b> can be used to produce multiple IFTs on a single sample. However, the absolute thickness values for those IFTs are unknown. Therefore, to calibrate these unknown IFTs, a calibration curve that relates IFT and optical density should be used. Such a curve would have to be built based on samples produced by the method described in ISO 2834 using an IGT printability tester. The question is: will both methods (the traditional ISO 2834 method and the Little Joe method), either accept or reject a given sample? This research found that the same IFTs on both samples {{do not have the same}} colorimetric values. The ink film was not as smooth on the Little Joe prints as it was on the IGT prints. The presence of tiny white spots throughout the Little Joe sample add a gray component to the color. The difference in smoothness of the ink layer on the Little Joe <b>proofer</b> comes from the ink not being 2 ̆ 2 worked 2 ̆ 2 as much as it is on the distribution rollers of the IGT printer. Therefore, the ink is less liquid and not able to completely spread out and cover the paper. The answer to the research question is that the two methods do not both either accept or reject a given sample. Towards the conclusion of this research, Professor Franz Sigg and the researcher made some improvement to the traditional ISO 2834 method and eventually invented a more efficient method: the modified ISO 2834 method. A high input volume of ink (0. 1 cc) was applied to the IGT inking unit. Then, while the inking unit was kept running without adding new ink, the disc was weighed before and after each print and was then re-inked to made another print. As samples were printed, the ink on the inking unit was reduced, producing prints with progressively thinner ink film thicknesses in rapid progression since no cleaning was needed between prints. This allowed the prints to be produced in a much shorter time than with the original ISO 2834 method. The result of the modified ISO 2834 method agreed with that of the original method within a tolerance of 1 DeltaE. Therefore, both methods can accept or reject a given sample at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Hymenoptera, {{the insect}} order that {{includes}} sawflies, bees, wasps, and ants, exhibits an incredible diversity of phenotypes, with over 145, 000 species {{described in a}} corpus of textual knowledge since Carolus Linnaeus. In the absence of specialized training, often spanning decades, however, these articles can be challenging to decipher. Much of the vocabulary is domain-specific (e. g., Hymenoptera biology), historically without a comprehensive glossary, and contains much homonymous and synonymous terminology. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology was developed to surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to hymenopteran anatomy, {{as well as provide}} support for domain experts so they may actively benefit from the anatomy ontology development. As part of HAO development, an active learning, dictionary-based, natural language recognition tool was implemented to facilitate Hymenoptera anatomy term discovery in literature. We present this tool, referred to as the ‘Proofer’, as part of an iterative approach to growing phenotype-relevant ontologies, regardless of domain. The process of ontology development results in a critical mass of terms that is applied as a filter to the source collection of articles in order to reveal term occurrence and biases in natural language species descriptions. Our results indicate that taxonomists use domain-specific terminology that follows taxonomic specialization, particularly at superfamily and family level groupings and that the developed <b>Proofer</b> tool is effective for term discovery, facilitatin...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use of HPV-mRNA {{test in the}} {{follow-up}} after LEEP is still matter of debate, with regard to its capacity of prediction relapse. Objective: The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the reliability of HPV-mRNA test to predict the residual and recurrent disease, and its accuracy in {{the follow-up}} of patients treated for CIN 2 / 3. Study design: Multicenter prospective cohort study. Patients who underwent LEEP after a biopsy diagnosing CIN 2 / 3 were followed at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Each check up included cytology, colposcopy, HPV-DNA test (LiPA) and HPV-mRNA test (PreTect HPV <b>Proofer</b> Kit NorChip). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), of HPV-DNA test and HPV-mRNA test to predict relapse, recurrent and residual disease. Using multiple logistic regression, the statistical significant variables as assessed in univariate analysis were entered and investigated as predictors of relapse disease. Results: The mRNA-test in predicting a residual disease had a sensitivity of 52 % and a NPV of 91 %, whereas DNA-test had 100 % and 100 %, respectively. On the contrary in the prediction of recurrent disease mRNAtest had a sensitivity and a NPV of 73. 5 % and 97 %, whereas DNA-test had 44 % and 93 %. On the multivariate analysis, age, cytology, HPV DNA and mRNA test achieved the role of independent predictors of relapse. Conclusion: HPV-mRNA test has a higher sensitivity and a higher NPV in predicting recurrent disease, for this reason it should be used in the follow-up of patients treated with LEEP for CIN 213 in order to individualize the timing of check up.

40|$|Colour {{management}} {{technology has}} reached {{a high level of}} maturity. Only ten years after it first appeared on the market, ICC colour profiles have become indispensable in modern premedia. It can be said without exaggeration that colour management has revolutionised digital proof printing. A whole range of newcomers in the print industry supplier community offer an intelligent combination of a PostScript RIP with integral colour management functions. The quality of these low-priced proofing systems has now reached such a high level that even discerning customers accept such digital proofs as contract proofs. Modular proofing solutions are regularly to be found among the leaders in the digital <b>proofer</b> tests. Working with colour profiles and profiled workflows is still a major problem area. It is no mere chance that notably digital proofing is the field in which users work with colour profiles in virtually all systems, since applications here are locally limited. An important step for the widespread use of colour management technology is the now very extensive implementation of ICC mechanisms in application programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Version 7 is regarded as a model of well thought-out ICC-based colour management implementation. As Microsoft has neglected the ICC standard in recent years, Adobe has created its own colour management interface, called ACE. Based on the ICC standard, it is regarded by many experts as a reference implementation. Adobe products, which are so important for the graphic arts industry, now contain a standard colour management platform across all supported operating systems. Incompatibilities at system level can now be virtually ruled out, at least across the Adobe product line, including the important interfaces with PostScript and PDF. Modern prepress technology is set to move ever further away from exclusive print production for standardised offset print. Multiple use of production data is still at an early stage. Numerous large and small production jobs are being run at customer request from media- or process-neutral data files. Colour management is a key technology, and its importance is set to increase further. </p...|$|E
