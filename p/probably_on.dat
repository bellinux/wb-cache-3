5|$|Bach led {{the first}} performance, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 9 February 1727.|$|E
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata at the Thomaskirche on 10 April 1724. He cantata again in Leipzig, on 26 March 1731 and <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 11 April 1735.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata {{at least three}} times, first on 8 October 1724, a second time <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 24 October 1734 when the sopranino {{was replaced by a}} violino piccolo, and a third time <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 1 October 1740. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff suggested performances in 1744/47, Klaus Hofmann in 1747, when the corno part was given to a trombone.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of ssp. tigrina <b>probably</b> feed <b>on</b> Ocotea veraguensis, Ocotea atirrensis, Ocotea {{sarah and}} Ocotea dendrodaphne. The larvae of ssp. coronata <b>probably</b> feed <b>on</b> Ocotea veraguensis, Ocotea atirrensis and Ocotea dendrodaphne.|$|R

5|$|Church of the Holy Archangels (Սրբոց Հրեշտակապետաց եկեղեցի, Srbots Hreštakapetats yekeğetsi; Deir Al Zeitoun) {{was founded}} in the 12th century <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the ruins of an ancient church in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was active}} in his diocese; more than 240documents {{relating}} to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney {{bought a house in}} London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Mapenor died in April 1219, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the 16th, {{although}} older sources give a {{date of the}} 13th. He {{had issued}} a charter as recently as 14 April 1219. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. One of his surviving charters documents a licence given to Leominster Priory as alms for the souls of his parents and his predecessor as bishop, Giles de Braose.|$|E

5|$|The {{brothers}} {{flew the}} glider {{for only a}} few days in the early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> October 3, Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes. Most of the kite tests were unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|Bloet was a royal {{clerk in}} the {{household}} of King William I of England. He accompanied William I's son, William Rufus, when Rufus traveled to England to claim the throne after William I's death. Rufus named Bloet as chancellor by January 1091, but then named Bloet to the See of Lincoln in March 1093 {{after the death of}} Remigius de Fécamp. Bloet was appointed {{at the same time that}} Anselm was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, during a severe illness when Rufus feared he was dying. Bloet was consecrated at Hastings not long before 22 February 1094, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 12 February the day after the dedication of the church at Battle Abbey. By 19 March 1094 he had been replaced as chancellor by William Giffard.|$|E

50|$|The larvae <b>probably</b> feed <b>on</b> Acacia arabica.|$|R
5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Henry invaded {{again in}} July 1106, hoping {{to provoke a}} decisive battle. After some initial {{tactical}} successes, he turned south-west towards the castle of Tinchebray. He besieged the castle and Duke Robert, supported by Robert of Bellême, advanced from Falaise to relieve it. After attempts at negotiation failed, the Battle of Tinchebray took place, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 28 September. The battle lasted around an hour, and began with a charge by Duke Robert's cavalry; the infantry and dismounted knights of both sides then joined the battle. Henry's reserves, led by Elias, the Count of Maine and Alan, the Duke of Brittany, attacked the enemy's flanks, routing first Bellême's troops and then {{the bulk of the}} ducal forces. Duke Robert was taken prisoner, but Bellême escaped.|$|E
5|$|His lands, though {{primarily}} {{centred on}} Warwickshire and Worcestershire, were spread over nineteen counties {{as well as}} Scotland and the Welsh Marches. His heir was his eldest son, whom he had named Thomas after the earl of Lancaster. Thomas, born <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> 14 February 1314, did not succeed to his father's title until 1326, as Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick. In the meanwhile Warwick's possessions went {{into the hands of}} the king, who donated Warwick's hunting dogs to the earl of Pembroke. A younger son, named John, also became a peer, as John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp. Like his elder brother, he distinguished himself in the French wars, and was a founding member of the Order of the Garter.|$|E

5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the one at Forceville that {{was selected as the}} prototype for all that followed.|$|E
5|$|Medina {{surrendered}} peacefully to Roger I of Sicily {{after a short}} siege in 1091, and Malta {{was subsequently}} incorporated into the County and later the Kingdom of Sicily, being dominated by a succession of feudal lords. The fortifications of Mdina were rebuilt and modified {{a number of times}} over the following centuries. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati or the castrum civitas was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>probably</b> feed <b>on</b> Apiaceae species.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>probably</b> feed <b>on</b> Arundinaria appalachiana.|$|R

5|$|On 9 January 1610, {{works on}} the {{aqueduct}} continued {{under the direction of}} another Jesuit called Padre Natale Tomasucci. By this time, Garzez had died and was succeeded as Grand Master by Alof de Wignacourt. In July 1612, the Bolognese hydraulic expert Bontadino de Bontadini took over the project, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> the recommendation of Inquisitor Evangelista Carbonesi. Bontadini designed a new watercourse with water being carried through underwater pipes, and over stone arches when there were depressions in the ground. Bontadini was assisted by a Maltese capomastro Giovanni Attard and several other engineers. 600 local workers were employed {{in the construction of the}} aqueduct, which was completed in 1614 and inaugurated on 21 April 1615. The aqueduct cost a total of 434,605 scudi, most of which were paid by Grand Master Wignacourt. The aqueduct was therefore named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details.|$|E
5|$|St Columba was {{probably}} a disciple of Finnian. He left Ireland after being exiled, and founded the monastery at Iona off {{the west coast of}} Scotland in 563, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> land granted from a Christian king. From there missions were carried out to western Argyll and the islands around Mull. Later the influence of Iona would extend to the Hebrides. Iona emerged as the most important religious centre in the north of Britain, {{partly as a result of}} the work of Adomnan, who was abbot there from 679 to 704. Although it is unclear whether the historic Columba did conduct missions outside of a small part of Dál Riata, Adoman's Life of St. Columba elevated him to become the apostle of North Britain in general.|$|E
