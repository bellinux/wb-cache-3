Various families of heterogeneities according to their geometrical or mechanical properties are progressively introduced into a volume of matrix. At each step, the behavior of intermediate medium is obtained by any analytical homogenization method and is used as matrix of the following step. All homogenization methods, like dilute strain or stress approximations, Hashin’s bounds, three phases method, Mori–Tanaka’s approach or for example the N-layered inclusions method lead to the same effective behavior for the <b>polydispersed</b> material after convergence of the iterative process. Moreover, this convergence is obtained even for significant fractions of heterogeneities and for highly contrasted or <b>polydispersed</b> materials.

40|$|An {{efficient}} numerical {{framework for}} the macroscale simulation of three-phase <b>polydispersed</b> flows is presented in this thesis. The primary focus {{of this research is}} on modelling the polydispersity in multiphase flows ensuring the tractability of the solution framework. Fluidity, an open-source adaptive-mesh finite element code, has been used for solving the coupled equations efficiently. Froth flotation {{is one of the most}} widely used mineral processing operations. The multiphase, turbulent and <b>polydispersed</b> nature of flow in the pulp phase in froth flotation makes it all the more challenging to model this process. Considering that two of the three phases in froth flotation are <b>polydispersed,</b> modelling this polydispersity is particularly important for an accurate prediction of the overall process. The direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is implemented in the Fluidity code to solve the population balance equation (PBE) for modelling the polydispersity of the gas bubbles. The PBE is coupled to the Eulerian [...] Eulerian flow equations for the liquid and gas phases. <b>Polydispersed</b> solids are modelled using separate transport equations for the free and attached mineral particles for each size class. The PBE has been solved using DQMOM in a finite element {{framework for the}} first time in this work. The behaviour of various finite element and control volume discretisation schemes in the solution of the PBE is analysed. Rigorous verification and benchmarking is presented along with model validation on turbulent gravity-driven flow in a bubble column. This research also establishes the importance of modelling the polydispersity of solids in flotation columns, which is undertaken for the first time, for an accurate prediction of the flotation rate. The application of fully-unstructured anisotropic mesh adaptivity to the <b>polydispersed</b> framework is also analysed for the first time. Significant improvement in the solution efficiency is reported through its use. Open Acces...|$|R
2500|$|For a {{monodisperse}} aerosol, {{a single}} number—the particle diameter—suffices {{to describe the}} size of the particles. However, more complicated particle-size distributions describe the sizes of the particles in a <b>polydisperse</b> aerosol. This distribution defines the relative amounts of particles, sorted according to size. One approach to defining the particle size distribution uses a list of the sizes of every particle in a sample. However, this approach proves tedious to ascertain in aerosols with millions of particles and awkward to use. Another approach splits the complete size range into intervals and finds the number (or proportion) of particles in each interval. One then can visualize these data in a histogram with the area of each bar representing the proportion of particles in that size bin, usually normalised by dividing the number of particles in a bin by the width of the interval so that the area of each bar is proportionate to the number of particles in the size range that it represents.

High-order finite-difference methods {{have been used to}} solve the compressible gas equations along with a Lagrangian solver for the <b>polydispersed</b> spray to produce a reliable reference solution. The key and novel point in this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis from an Eulerian {{point of view of the}} turbulent dispersion of evaporating <b>polydispersed</b> sprays with various mean Stokes numbers. For this purpose, our work focuses on simplified evaporation laws and one-way coupling to isolate some of the key physical phenomena to be captured by an Eulerian description, which would be hidden by the intricacy of the numerous couplings occurring with more complex models. A special emphasis is laid on the <b>polydispersed</b> character of the spray in the particular chosen configuration. It is shown that the dynamics of the droplets at the given streamwise directions are conditioned by their size. It appears that the dispersion follows a Gaussian behaviour but around the conditioned droplets' mean velocity and not around the mean velocity of the carrier phase, both of them being distinct. A last set of analyses is dedicated to the characteristics of the carrier phase sampled by the dispersed phase. The dependence of droplet behaviour on the Stokes number is detaile...|$|R
