5000|$|The {{convention}} missed some sessions {{during the}} American Civil War. As Thurman (1952/2002, 34) states, [...] "the <b>progress</b> of the <b>Convention</b> was greatly disrupted by the war.

[...] At {{the end of the war}} in 1865 the Convention met again at Mount Zion in Carroll County, Georgia to begin anew; B. F. White and other Sacred Harp luminaries were in attendance. [...] That year, the Chattahoochee Convention began keeping written records of its proceedings, records which have survived to the present time and serve as a historical resource for Sacred Harp scholarship. In 1866, the Convention adopted a written constitution.|$|R

The UDP's Ousainou Darboe said that the ruling party was [...] "using government resources. They operate from {{the offices of the}} regional governors and from the offices of the various local authorities to operate." [...] The grouping also called for ECOWAS to intervene. The grouping said that APR had [...] "an abuse of incumbency as complete merger between party and state" [...] allowed for the ruling party to use state resources such as the media for [...] "political advantage." [...] However, Hamat Bah's yet unrepresented National Reconciliation Party (NRP) decided to participate in the election. He made the decision on the premise that he could win back the seat lost after the founding of the National Alliance for Democracy and Development and was subsequently barred by a court ruling.|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the <b>progress</b> of the <b>convention.</b> On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|R
