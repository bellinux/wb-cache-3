It was last dedicated to the Siding Spring Survey. The telescope had a field of view of just over 6° {{through the use of a}} correcting plate, making its field three times as large as that of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. It used a spherical rather than a parabolic mirror with 0.6 m correcting plate to achieve this. Photographic <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>film</b> were used as detectors.|$|E

50|$|The first radiographs (X-ray images) {{were made}} by the action of X-rays on {{sensitized}} glass photographic plates. X-ray film (photographic film) soon replaced the glass <b>plates,</b> <b>and</b> <b>film</b> has been used for decades to acquire (and display) medical and industrial images. Gradually, digital computers gained the ability to store and display enough data to make digital imaging possible. Since the 1990s, computerized radiography and digital radiography have been replacing photographic film in medical and dental applications, though film technology remains in widespread use in industrial radiography processes (e.g. to inspect welded seams). The metal silver (formerly necessary to the radiographic & photographic industries) is a non-renewable resource although silver can easily be reclaimed from spent X-ray film. Where X-ray films required wet processing facilities, newer digital technologies do not. Digital archiving of images also saves physical storage space.|$|E
5000|$|A plate burner {{is part of}} the CTF print workflow. In a CTF workflow, a {{sheet of}} light {{sensitive}} film is imaged directly from a RIP. The film must then be developed immediately afterwards. This film is then placed onto a printing plate, on the plate burner. Registration of the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>film</b> is controlled by a pin grid. After securing the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>film</b> to the grid, a glass cover is lowered upon the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>film.</b> The <b>film</b> <b>and</b> <b>plate</b> are placed into a vacuum on the plate burner to remove any pockets of air <b>and</b> ensure the <b>film</b> is in close contact with the surface of the printing plate.

40|$|Abstract: Although Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have {{demonstrated}} their potential in simple academic combustion chambers, their application to real gas turbine chambers requires specific developments and validations. In this study, three {{specific aspects of}} such chambers are discussed: multiple inlets, multi-perforated <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>film</b> cooling. LES is used in an industry-like chamber and results are compared with predictions provided by Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations and experimental measurements. Multi-perforation is handled using a simplified effusive wall law while film cooling makes use of low resolution influx conditions (’coarse LES’). Experimental results are well reproduced and qualitatively improved when compared to RANS predictions. LES results underline {{the potential of the}} approach for industrial use...|$|E

Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments.

5000|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} black-and-white plates, the Autochrome {{was loaded}} into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens, so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion. The use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light, parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive. Because of the light loss due to all the filtering, Autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films,</b> which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used {{and that it was}} not practical to photograph moving subjects.
