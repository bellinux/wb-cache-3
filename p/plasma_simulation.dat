40|$|The Particle-in-Cell (PIC) {{method is}} a Particle-Mesh {{technique}} that allows to efficiently simulate kinetic models. Among others applications, space weather simulations could be tackled by massively parallel Particle-in-Cell codes, {{to model the}} dynamics of space plasma disturbances. However, realistic Particle-Mesh <b>plasma</b> <b>simulations</b> require huge data sets and are computationally expensive. This is why high scalability must be achieved in order to perform the massively parallel <b>plasma</b> <b>simulations</b> required for space weather purposes. In Particle-Mesh techniques such as PIC simulations, computational particles are free to move on a fixed grid mesh and can show important inhomogeneity during computation. This results in an imbalanced work load between different threads that must be tackled. This paper reports on a 2 D electrostatic PIC code in Unified Parallel C, developed for both <b>plasma</b> and gravitational <b>simulations.</b> The algorithm includes dynamic load-balancing capabilities. We compare different load-balancing strategies: one based on the particle distribution, and one based on computation time.
