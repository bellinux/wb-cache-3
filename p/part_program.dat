50|$|Wireless DNC {{is a form}} of {{wireless}} data transfer, known as Direct Numerical Control, performed between a computer numerical control (CNC) machine and the computer controlling it. These are very widely used in the automobile, engineering, sheet metal and aeronautic industries. These machines are capable of producing different parts. For each type of part, a sequence of instructions is needed. This list of instructions is stored in a computer script, a computer file written in a programming language, such as G-code. This script is commonly referred to as a <b>part</b> <b>program.</b> When a part is to be produced this <b>part</b> <b>program</b> is uploaded to a CNC machine by RS-232 link.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of computer numerical controlled machines has seen a plethora of <b>part</b> <b>programming</b> languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between computer numerical controlled machines and also from computer numerical controlled machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing <b>part</b> <b>programs</b> cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of computer numerical controlled <b>part</b> <b>programming</b> languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of computer numerical controlled machine activities and interpret/represent process information within computer numerical controlled <b>part</b> <b>programs</b> written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different <b>part</b> <b>programming</b> languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from computer numerical controlled machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the <b>part</b> <b>programs</b> and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years the {{development}} of CNC machines has seen a plethora of <b>part</b> <b>programming</b> languages. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of information between CNC machines and Computer-aided (CAx) systems.

In fact, the process knowledge in the existing <b>part</b> <b>programs</b> is vital to develop process plans for new products, reduce leading time, and accumulate knowledge to enhance the product quality based on previous knowledge. In this paper, a STEP standard compliant method is proposed to recycle manufacturing knowledge from shopfloor in a universal manner. An EXPRESS model of CNC programming languages has been developed, though which different programing dialects can be translated into neutral data model. Based on the neutral data, a process comprehension method was used to capture process knowledge from CNC <b>part</b> <b>programs</b> and represent the knowledge in a standardised format. The EXPRESS model also forms a basis for a comprehensive machine tool modelling to assistant process planning activities.

40|$|Abstract- By {{implementing}} feature-based CAM {{software from}} Delcam and investing in CNC mills, the industries can {{be able to}} reduce machining time and <b>part</b> <b>programming</b> time. Determined to be competitive not only in quality but also in manufacturing methods, the manufacturing companies are upgrading their capability {{with the help of}} Delcam software to take models of their components from 3 D modeling software’s to production quickly. Typical machining tolerances in the specified range can be consistently achieved. In this thesis, the time taken to manufacture the main housing used in weighing machine is estimated.

40|$|Automation of {{engineering}} {{procedures for the}} development of new manufacturing processes is of great importance in modern competitive conditions. For example, metalworking companies would greatly benefit from the development of methods for automatic generation, testing and optimization of part programs for machining operations. Indeed, the generation of part programs-even by using CAM software-does still require strong human intervention and it is basically a best guess approach with minimum optimization. Moreover, further refinement and correction of the <b>part</b> <b>program</b> on the machine tool is often necessary. Machining operations are generally based on a large number of parameters and therefore optimization strategies should {{be able to deal with}} high-dimensional spaces and disjoint domains. In this paper, two swarm intelligence optimization algorithms-particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) -have been applied for optimizating the <b>part</b> <b>program</b> of a complex turning part. The optimizers were implemented in a framework for automatic <b>part</b> <b>program</b> generation, realistic simulation, and feasibility analysis.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a novel software system for excimer laser ablation machining processes. The system's algorithms use the 3 D geometry of a microstructure, defined in a CAD model, and parameters that influence the process (etch rate, wall angle, stitching errors, etc) to automatically generate a precise NC <b>part</b> <b>program</b> for the excimer laser machine. The algorithms and a prototype software system have been developed for the step-and-repeat laser ablation technique and extended to include the workpiecedragging technique. The latter, achieves both higher surface accuracy and smoothness within the sub-micron range. The algorithm enables various mask sizes to be used to control accuracy of the machined part and development includes tool path optimisation and processing time reduction. The software simplifies <b>part</b> <b>program</b> creation and is useful for excimer laser operators who currently use a tedious trial and error process to generate microstructure parts. The benefits of the software include more accurate microstructures and reduced overall costs of the process itself. The performance of the system has been verified by NC <b>part</b> <b>program</b> generation for several 3 D microstructures and subsequent machining trials. The analysis of stitching and edge errors is reported, and comparisons of 3 D models with the machined surfaces are given.
