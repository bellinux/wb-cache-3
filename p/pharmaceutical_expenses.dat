40|$|Abstract Background There are {{few studies}} {{comparing}} pharmaceutical {{costs and the}} use of medications between immigrants and the autochthonous population in Spain. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether there are differences in pharmaceutical consumption and expenses between immigrant and Spanish-born populations. Methods Prospective observational study in 1, 630 immigrants and 4, 154 Spanish-born individuals visited by fifteen primary care physicians at five public Primary Care Clinics (PCC) during 2005 in the city of Lleida, Catalonia (Spain). Data on pharmaceutical consumption and expenses was obtained from a comprehensive computerized data-collection system. Multinomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks and confidence intervals of pharmaceutical expenditure, adjusting for age and sex. Results The percentage of individuals that purchased medications during a six-month period was 53. 7 % in the immigrant group and 79. 2 % in the autochthonous group. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> and consumption were lower in immigrants than in autochthonous patients in all age groups and both genders. The relative risks of being in the highest quartile of expenditure, for Spanish-born versus immigrants, were 6. 9, 95 % CI = (4. 2, 11. 5) in men and 5. 3, 95 % CI = (3. 5, 8. 0) in women, with the reference category being not having any pharmaceutical expenditure. Conclusion <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> are much lower for immigrants with respect to autochthonous patients, both in the percentage of prescriptions filled at pharmacies and the number of containers of medication obtained, as well as the prices of the medications used. Future studies should explore which factors explain the observed differences in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> and if these disparities produce health inequalities. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Most European {{health care}} systems are {{suffering}} from the impact of demographic change. In short, aging of society is leading to higher costs of treatment per capita, while reproduction rates below 2. 1 children per woman lead to a reduced number of younger people {{to provide for the}} necessary contributions into the health insurance system. This research paper addresses the questions what impact the demographic development will have on one particular spending area, what are pharmaceutical expenditure in two of Europe’s largest {{health care systems}}, Germany and France, and what the implications are for pharmaceutical companies. Methods The research is based on publicly available data from German and French health ministries, the OECD, and institutes which focus on projection of demographic development in those countries. In a first step, data was clustered into age groups, and average spending on pharmaceuticals was allocated to that. In the second step, these figures were extrapolated, based on the projected change in the demographic structure of the countries from 2004 until 2050. This leads to a deeper understanding of demand for pharmaceutical products in the future due to the demographic development as a single driving factor. Results <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> per head (patient) will grow only slightly until 2050 (0. 5 % p. a. in both countries). Demographic change alone only provides for a slowly growing market for pharmaceutical companies both in Germany and in France, but for a relevant change in the consumption mix of pharmaceutical products, based on a shift of relevance of different age groups. Conclusions Despite demographic changes <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> per head (patient) and the overall pharmaceutical markets will grow only slightly until 2050 in Germany as well as in France. Nevertheless, the aging of society implies different challenges for pharmaceutical companies and also for the health care system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate whether the Chinese govern-ment’s pricing policies have reduced <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses.</b> The pur-chasing records for systemic antibacterial drugs of 12 hospitals in Beijing from 1996 to 2005 were analyzed by separating the expenditure growth into three components: the price change, the volume change, and the struc-ture change. Our results reveal that the structure change is the dominant determinant of drug expenditure growth. Despite lowered prices, the anti-bacterial drug expenditure was raised because more expensive drugs in the same therapeutic category were prescribed. It is insufficient to rely only on pricing policies to reduce drug expenses, given that physicians could circumvent the policy by prescribing more expensive drugs. In addition, physician behaviors need to be regulated to eliminate unneces-sary overprescribing. One of the most serious challenges facing China’s health care system is soaring pharmaceutical expenditures (1). This problem originates from the unique com-pensation mechanisms for hospitals. In China, public hospitals ’ income has three sources: government investments, medical services, and pharmaceutical sales. During the planned economy era, prices of medical service and pharma-ceuticals were strictly controlled by the government.

40|$|Chronic {{heart failure}} (CHF) {{is the final}} phase of many common {{cardiovascular}} diseases. Consequently, it represents a frequent clinical condition: it’s estimated that in developed countries, Italy included, its prevalence exceeds 3 %. CHF is also burdensome from an economical point of view, as it absorbs more than 2 % of the Italian total health care budget. The main cost driver in CHF, accounting for approximately two thirds of its total expense, is represented by hospital admissions for relapse. The most frequent reason for relapse, in turn, is inadequate treatment, intended both as low patient compliance to prescribed drug regimens and as inappropriate prescribing. Evidence-based guidelines for the optimal pharmacological treatment of CHF have been developed and are constantly updated, and it’s demonstrated that the stricter the adherence to these recommendations, the better the clinical and economic outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic studies conducted on the use of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers, in particular, have shown that correct therapeutic strategies can be cost-saving in CHF management, besides providing important clinical benefits. The expansion of generic drug market has brought by a reduction in pharmaceutical prices, allowing to offer the benefits of these highly effective, and cost-effective, treatments for CHF to a larger number of patients, without increasing the global <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expense,</b> but probably reducing the total economical burden of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Within the Italian federalist framework, {{national}} and regional governance tools for pharmaceutical care have been developed in recent years. From a financial perspective, the pharmaceutical outpatient expenditure has already been put under control and this has markedly contributed to reducing the overall costs. The hospital <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> instead have grown. On this last element bears how innovative and expensive drugs are introduced and managed; among these drugs, cancer drugs have a decisive role. In the last years the AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – Italian Drugs Agency) policies regarding the adoption process of new drugs have stressed the concept of value for money: any innovative and expensive drug is linked to a web-based control register in order to monitor outcomes. The aim is to relate the drug price to the obtained results (payment by result and risk-sharing) {{or at least to}} institute simple financial agreements (cost-sharing) that can be defined as managed entry agreements (MEA). The critical point that can cause equity problems is the way these national governance tools are applied in different regional contexts. There are in fact marked differences among Italian regions.

The health sector of the Slovak Republic is plagued by financial problems. To turn around health system finances and achieve larger gains in health outcomes, the efficiency of health spending needs to increase and the mix and quality of real health resources need to be improved. Although Slovak''s overall health spending efficiency is on par with that of the OECD, substantial inefficiencies occur in the process of transforming intermediate health inputs into health outcomes. Efficiency may be enhanced by containing the cost of drugs and reducing reliance on hospital care.

The present article presents some recent epidemiological data, the natural development of the allergic inflammation and its pathophysiology, focusing on the recent concept of a “minimal persistent inflammation”, with particular regard to its long term treatment with antiallergic drugs. In fact, {{according to the most recent}} interpretations, allergy has to be considered as a complex phenomenon, characterized by a inflammatory response to allergenic stimuli. The complicated interrelation between cells, cytokines and affected structures is described. Very often allergic diseases of the upper airways are associated with and complicate asthma, and data that support the benefits of treating these diseases as a whole are presented. Long-term treatment of allergies with antiflogistic/antiallergic molecules is capable of reducing tissutal damage, besides improving the quality of life of the patient and lowering the frequency of acute episodes. The chronic treatment with antiallergic drugs appears to be favorable also from a pharmacoeconomical point of view, as it is associated with a reduction of overall <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> and of lost working/school days, as well as determining an improved quality of life for the patient and its relatives, particularly in pediatric age.

40|$|Co-payments are {{a common}} {{instrument}} of health insurers to lower their <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> and to share costs with consumers, the pa- tients. Tiered drug co-payments, e. g. lower co-payments for generic drugs, incentivize patients to buy certain products and, hence, steer drug con- sumption patterns. Since 2007, the German Statutory Health Insurance follows an innovative and unique regulation by dierentiating drug co- payments by the drug's price relative to its reference price. Co-payment exemption thresholds have been introduced in 185 out of 281 therapeutic clusters since 2007. We answer how eective this co-payment exemption policy is {{in order to reduce}} overall prices for pharmaceutical products. We analyze prices of all drugs marketed in reference price clusters and be- ing subject to the policy in Germany using quarterly data from January 2007 to October 2010 published by the Federal Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds in Germany. We nd empirical evidence of dffer- entiated price setting strategies by different rm types ranging from price decreases of - 8 % to increases of + 1. 3 % (innovators) following the intro- duction of co-payment exemption threshold. We refer to the latter case as the co-payment paradox. Furthermore, prices of generic and branded generic rms and reference prices tend to converge. The results are robust when we estimate static and dynamic linear panel data models and con- trol for the heterogeneity of active ingredient's clusters, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity. Our competition proxies (no. of rms and ratio products/rm in the same market) suggest a signicant negative impact of competition on prices and, thereby, question whether more competition may be an alternative way to lower pharmaceutical prices. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cost of the}} {{development}} of a new pharmaceutical product from its conception and synthesis through to the regulatory approval process has more than quadrupled in the last 20 years. Both clinical and total development times have increased substantially. To amortize the costs incurred, the pharmaceutical industry has taken an international dimension. The incentives for pharmaceutical firms to discover and develop new drugs depend on the length of {{the development}} and regulatory review process plus the potential market size. Recent regulatory, economic and political changes may have significant implications for the future of new drug developments in Europe. The European Union industrial policy felt that there is a need for convergence in the area of pricing. It is recommended that the policy should aim to contain growth in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> by means specific to reimbursement rather than direct price controls. By encouraging doctors to prescribe and customers to use generics, competition is enhanced to bring down drug prices. More emphasis is being laid by government in educating customers to cost-awareness and cost-benefit ratios with regard to pharmaceuticals. Concerning clinical trials, European harmonization has been achieved by significant developments: the rights and integrity of the trial subjects are protected; the credibility of the data is established; and the ethical, scientific and technical quality of the trials has improved. Future European health care forecasts a whole change in the pharmaceutical business. Important issues in cost and outcome measurement should be carefully planned and considered in drug development. Due to important mergers and acquisitions, the pharmaceutical sector will consist mainly of important multinational corporations.

All patients who received enteral nutrition support between January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999 at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, TX were evaluated in a retrospective chart review. Malnutrition- and disease-matched patients who received oral nutrition support were selected from the hospital's patient database. Of a total of 276 patients; 189 received enteral nutrition and 87 received oral nutrition. Admission and discharge laboratory values, functional ability, LOS, total medical expenses, and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>expenses</b> were compared between groups. Statistical analyses included Student's t-test, Chi-Square, and the General Linear Model. Results included the following: at admission enteral nutrition patients weighed significantly more (P < 0. 001) and had an increased body mass index (BMI) (P < 0. 01) compared to oral nutrition patients. Change between admission and discharge parameters related to nutrition were not significantly different between the two groups. Values at discharge for prealbumin, albumin, and total lymphocyte count were within ranges considered malnourished as they had been at admission. Initial financial analysis indicated that enteral nutrition patients had a significantly longer LOS and greater medical expenses. Both groups of surgical patients had increased total cost (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 01 for enteral and oral nutrition groups, respectively) as compared to medical patients. Additionally, the enteral and oral nutrition groups were not significantly different for LOS or medical expenses for head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation treatment or chemotherapy. Results of this study have demonstrated several points. First, appropriate nutrition intervention, both through enteral or oral nutrition, may maintain a patient's nutritional status; and even if outcomes are not significantly improved, nutrition support may prevent further nutritional decline during the hospital stay. Secondly, based on laboratory values, patients may not have made a full nutritional recovery by discharge. Finally, malnourished head and neck cancer patients should receive nutrition intervention based on individual needs; according to our data, providing enteral nutrition does not increase LOS or medical expenses...|$|E
