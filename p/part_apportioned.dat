40|$|The {{development}} of complex systems involves a multi-tier supply chain, with each organisation allocated a reliability target for their sub-system or component <b>part</b> <b>apportioned</b> from system requirements. Agreements about targets are made {{early in the}} system lifecycle when considerable uncertainty exists about the design detail and potential failure modes. Hence resources required to achieve reliability are unpredictable. Some types of contracts provide incentives for organisations to negotiate targets so that system reliability requirements are met, but at minimum cost to the supply chain. This paper proposes a mechanism for deriving a fair price for trading reliability targets between suppliers using information gained about potential failure modes through development {{and the costs of}} activities required to generate such information. The approach is based upon Shapley's value and is illustrated through examples for a particular reliability growth model, and associated empirical cost model, developed for problems motivated by the aerospace industry. The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and discuss how it could be extended to other reliability allocation models...|$|E

At issue was requiring Ready, Willing & Able facility residents to <b>apportion</b> <b>part</b> of their earnings to support program expenses, a policy which the Coalition called exploitation but McDonald believed helped prepare them for self-sustaining life outside the program.|$|R
50|$|At common law, {{there was}} no {{apportionment}} of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment was, however, in certain cases allowed in England by the Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the Apportionment Act 1834, and is now allowed generally. Under that statute (§2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other periodical payments {{in the nature of}} income are to be considered as accruing from day to day and to be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of such rents, etc., shall only be payable or recoverable {{in the case of a}} continuing payment, when the entire portion of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had not so determined (§ 3). Persons entitled to <b>apportioned</b> <b>parts</b> of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee is not to be liable for any <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> specifically. The rent is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it subject to distribution (§ 4). The Apportionment Act 1870 extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing (§2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance (§ 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express stipulation.|$|R
50|$|Where a lessee is evicted from, or surrenders or forfeits {{possession}} {{of part of}} the property leased to him, he becomes liable at common law to pay only a rent apportioned {{to the value of}} the interest which he still retains. So where the person entitled to the reversion of an estate assigns part of it, the right to an <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of the rent incident to the England, and in many of the British colonies. In the cases just mentioned there is apportionment in respect of estate by act of the parties.|$|R
40|$|A {{field effect}} {{transistor}} channel charge partitioning scheme is proposed that explains small-signal port parameters associated with the source and drain terminals. The scheme starts with the channel charge, that can be readily extracted from measurement, and defines source charge as that for a drainless channel. The drain charge is the difference required for neutrality. This new approach is a contrast to alternative schemes that <b>apportion</b> <b>part</b> of the channel charge to the source. A significant outcome is the insight that the drain and source charges are larger in magnitude than the channel charge. This is an essential requirement for the correct modelling of reactive parameters not associated with the gate, such as drain-source capacitance, transcapacitance, or transconductance delay. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of the international scope {{and nature of the}} problem of refugees, which induced the establishment of UNHCR and the adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, did not result in shared responsibility for the protection of refugees but rather in a strict apportioning of responsibilities between UNHCR on the one hand, and states on the other. Rather than sharing the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> as a collective responsibility, states become individually responsible for refugees who seek refuge in their respective territories, and hence only for part of the problem of refugees. This individual responsibility is triggered by observing the prohibition of refoulement. Since this prohibition is not coupled to a distributive mechanism, its observance may cause huge disparities in terms of numbers of refugees, and hence in the extent of responsibility individual states incur. Remedying these indiscriminate effects would require taking collective responsibility for the problem of refugees, more in particular, a system that would secure joint and several responsibility whereby individual states have the right of recourse to other states to recover ‘overpayment’, in short: a non-discretionary burden sharing mechanism that involves all states...|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} the former of these classes, it may be noticed that {{although}} apportioned rent becomes payable only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, {{in the case of}} the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of that half-year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If you pay a ground rent on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, you can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an ‘order of apportionment’ that legally separates your share of the ground rent or rentcharge.|$|R
5000|$|In {{approximately}} half of the states it operates in, contracts between the various state prison systems or individual prisons and JPay include an agreement to <b>apportion</b> <b>part</b> of the fees, collected from those sending money to the prisoners, back to the prison operators in exchange for giving JPay a monopoly over financial transfers to inmates. According to state mandated disclosures in Illinois, correctional institution operators there received approximately $48,000 for 2013 in what company founder Shapiro prefers to call [...] "commissions". One prisoner, released in 2010 following a 28-year incarceration for murder, identified the potential hardship on the poorest families, leaving a mother of three with a husband in jail to decide: [...] "Do I send money to him so he can afford {{to stay in touch with}} the kids, or do I feed the kids?" [...] Meanwhile, JPay funds lavish parties for corrections institute bureaucrats during the American Correctional Association's annual convention, providing [...] "tequila, hand-rolled cigars" [...] and [...] "live mariachi band" [...] as well as sponsoring an award, including a trip, presented by the Association of State Correctional Administrators to former state corrections directors.|$|R
40|$|The Polish {{cooperative}} law of 1982 introduces new institutions, among others it is a partition of the already existing cooperative. It {{can be performed}} in that manner that a new cooperative is created from the <b>apportioned</b> <b>part</b> of the existing one while the latter is acting from then on in a curtailed structure. Any cooperative can be divided unless it is in liquidation or in bankruptcy. The cooperative is divided subject {{to the will of}} at least two thirds of its members. Consequently the grounds for division are formed by the decision of the general meeting of the cooperative members taken by the majority of two thirds of votes. In course of the partition the new cooperative is being established. Its activity is regulated by the general rules of {{cooperative law}}. It is the new particular mode of forming a cooperative. Its main characteristic trait {{lies in the fact that}} the cooperative is constituted by members of other cooperative and such will can also be manifested by persons who are not becoming members of the cooperative being established in course of the division of existing one. The decision of general meeting made in case of the cooperatives partition must include: a) denomination of the cooperative being partitioned and the cooperative being formed in course of the partition, b) the list of members leaving the partitioned cooperative for the newly created one, c) approval of the balance- -sheet of the partitioned cooperative and a draft of distribution of property elements and d) a date of the cooperative's division. Provisions of the statute of cooperative formed in course of the partition cannot curtail the property rights of its members. The decision of the general meeting concerning the partition can be appealed against according to the general rules known in the cooperative law. A right to lay an action against such decision is granted to members of that cooperative and to managing board of the competent central union. Decisions of the meeting of members moving from the partitioned cooperative to the one formed in course of the partition can also be appealed against in court. A date of cooperative partition in a legal meaning is the date of entering that event in the register. If the records of partition and of establishing new cooperatives were entered by two courts at different time, then the date of registering the forming of new cooperative is decisive in the aspect the cooperatives partition. In the effect of the partition part of members of the previously existing cooperative moves to the newly created one. The property elements indicated in the „draft of distribution" are also moved for the new cooperative, they include mobilities and immobilities, technical equipement and means of production. By virtue of the law the new cooperative takes over the duties and rights of the previous one, mentioned in the „draft of distribution". It is a case of the cumamilative transfers of debts. Two cooperatives are joint and several liable for these debts. The cooperative created in course of the division takes over the employees as well. It enters into the legal relations effected by the labor contracts concluded between those employees and the cooperative which was partitioned.
