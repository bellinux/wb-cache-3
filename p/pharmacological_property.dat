40|$|P- 450 metabolites, {{including}} the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, are likely candidates for endothelial derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF). In the present study, we {{confirm that the}} stable analogue 11 -nonyloxyundec- 8 (Z) -enoic acid is a vasodilator of murine vessels. However, we also show that the ???epoxyeicosatrienoic acid receptor??? antagonist 14, 15 EEZE similarly dilates murine vessels contracted with U 46619, prostaglandin F 2 ?? or methoxamine, but not with endothelin- 1 or potassium. We suggest that 14, 15 EEZE is a partial agonist for the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids/EDHF receptor.

40|$|Drugs {{currently}} {{known as}} calcium channel blockers (CCB) were initially called calcium antagonists {{because of their}} ability to inhibit calcium-evoked contractions in depolarized smooth muscles.

40|$|There are {{direct and}} {{indirect}} indications that PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), a widely used anticancer nanomedicine, has a subclinical immune suppressive effect. As {{an example of a}} seemingly bad <b>pharmacological</b> <b>property</b> turning out to be “not-so-ugly”, but actually beneficial, the authors highlight the potential benefits of Doxil's immune suppressive effect. These include (1) the decreased uptake of the drug by the MPS which may entail enhanced tumor uptake, and, hence, improved therapeutic efficacy; (2) the use of slow infusion protocols in reducing the risk of hypersensitivity (infusion) reactions; and (3), possible protection against hypersensitivity reactions to co-administered reactogenic drugs.

This may be in part attributable to the lack of additional benefits by treatments ’ options used as standard care of systolic HF.

30|$|In summary, CGA has an anti-oxidation <b>pharmacological</b> <b>property,</b> {{but it has}} {{no effect}} in {{inhibiting}} Aβ fibrillation. Surface modification of CGA on SeNPs gives it a new anti-aggregation property. Aβ 40 could bind {{on the surface of}} CGA@SeNPs, which results in unfavorable conditions for nucleation and fibril growth through the blocking of direct contact between monomers. In that case, CGA@SeNPs inhibited Aβ 40 aggregation, cleared the ROS, and protected PC 12 cells from the cell membrane disruption and ROS-mediated apoptosis induced by Aβ 40 aggregates. However, in CGA group, the Aβ aggregates immobilized on the cell surface and caused the cell membrane damage, which also result in cell death. Overall, CGA@SeNPs are more efficient than CGA in reducing Aβ 40 toxic in long-term use.|$|E

40|$|A {{morphological}} {{method has}} been developed allowing measurement of the effect on intestinal epithelia of vincristine. In routinely prepared tissue sections the proportion of mitotic events progressing beyond metaphase is counted by microscopy.

Intestinal tumours were induced in rats by chemical carcinogenesis. Administration of vincristine in {{the presence or absence of}} verapamil was performed in these tumour-bearing animals.

40|$|Aloe vera {{belongs to}} a group of Liliaceae family plant and {{cultivated}} worldwide. It possesses acemannan (acetylated mannan), which has a significant <b>pharmacological</b> <b>property.</b> The acemannan has an immunomodulatory activity when administered to animals. The major immunomodulating effect includes the activation of immune effector cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in the production of cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, IL- 12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). In particular, this extract can modulate the differentiation capacity of CD 4 +T cells to mature into Th 1 subsets and enhance the innate cytokine response. As a consequence, this extract will have a profound effect in controlling disease, caused by intracellular infectious agents (bacteria and viruses).
