40|$|Abstract Background Glioblastoma is {{the most}} common and most {{aggressive}} form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat. Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is necessary for tumour progression, NF-κB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease. Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of <b>parthenolide,</b> a NF-κB inhibitor, in two human glioblastoma cell lines (U 87 MG and U 373) and in glioblastoma xenografts. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. Methods The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of <b>parthenolide</b> were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays. Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) assay. In addition, the effect of <b>parthenolide</b> on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model. Results We found that <b>parthenolide</b> suppresses proliferation, invasion, and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells. Molecular studies demonstrated that <b>parthenolide</b> suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors. Furthermore, <b>parthenolide</b> reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling, suggesting that the antitumour function of <b>parthenolide</b> may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-κB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins. <b>Parthenolide</b> suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts.

40|$|<b>Parthenolide</b> is {{the major}} {{bioactive}} compound of feverfew and has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity. Chapter 1 gives {{an overview of the}} history and current status of research on <b>parthenolide</b> in feverfew. As a promising anti-cancer drug, <b>parthenolide</b> has attracted a lot of attention from medical institutes and companies. A search with ‘parthenolide’ in Google patents yields more than 2000 hits on extraction of <b>parthenolide</b> or its use in treating cancer or other diseases. However, information on the <b>parthenolide</b> biosynthetic pathway is scarce. Elucidation of the full pathway to <b>parthenolide</b> would open up new opportunities for production of this compound in heterologous, more efficient production platforms. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of <b>parthenolide,</b> knowledge on the tissue(s) in which <b>parthenolide</b> is produced and stored is important. In Chapter 2, <b>parthenolide</b> was found to highly accumulate particularly in floral trichomes, suggesting that this is also the preferred site of biosynthesis. These floral trichomes were subsequently used to isolate germacrene A synthase (TpGAS), the gene encoding the first dedicated step in <b>parthenolide</b> biosynthesis, using a degenerate primer PCR approach. The transcript level of TpGASwas indeed highest in glandular trichomes. The high expression of TpGASin glandular trichomes which also contain the highest concentration of <b>parthenolide,</b> supports the assumption that glandular trichomes are the organ where <b>parthenolide</b> biosynthesis and accumulation occur. During my work on Chapter 2, a Canadian group reported a germacrene A oxidase (GAO) from lettuce. As the 454 cDNA library of feverfew trichomes was not available yet, we decided to use a 454 cDNA library of chicory (which also produces costunolide) to continue screening candidate genes involved in the next step of the <b>parthenolide</b> biosynthetic pathway, costunolide synthase (COS). In Chapter 3, four P 450 s (belonging to the CYP 71 group) were selected from the chicory cDNA library for functional characterisation in yeast. One of them, named CYP 71 BL 3, was found to be costunolide synthase, and can catalyse the oxidation of germacra- 1 (10), 4, 11 (13) -trien- 12 -oic acid to yield costunolide. The biosynthetic pathway of costunolide was reconstituted in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression  (agro-infiltration) ofTpGAS, CiGAO(which we also identified in the chicory library) and CiCOS, whichresulted in costunolide production of up to 60 ng. g - 1 FW. In addition, two new compounds were formed that were identified as costunolide-glutathione and costunolide-cysteine conjugates. When the 454 sequences of the feverfew trichome library became available, we continued to identify additional genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of <b>parthenolide.</b> In Chapter 4, the <b>parthenolide</b> biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by isolating all the structural genes from feverfew, TpGAS, TpGAO, TpCOS and TpPTS. Moreover, the whole pathway was reconstituted in N. benthamiana, through transient expression. In the agro-infiltrated plants, <b>parthenolide</b> {{as well as a number}} of conjugates (with cysteine and glutathione) were produced. In an anti-cancer bioassay, these relatively polar conjugates were highly active against colon cancer cells, with only slightly lower activity than free <b>parthenolide.</b> Finally, also a gene encoding a costunolide and <b>parthenolide</b> 3 β-hydroxylase was identified, which could potentially be used in biotechnological applications to produce hydroxylated <b>parthenolide.</b> The conjugation and hydroxylation of <b>parthenolide</b> open up new options to improve the water solubility of <b>parthenolide</b> and therefore its potential as a drug. Besides genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of <b>parthenolide,</b> we also identified two other P 450 genes that can utilize costunolide as substrate. In Chapter 5, Tp 8879 is identified. Tp 8879 can cyclise the monocyclic germacranolide sesquiterpene lactone costunolide to form the bicyclic guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone kauniolide, and is hence called kauniolide synthase. The biosynthetic pathway of kauniolide was reconstituted in N. benthamiana, through transient expression. This thesis combines a series of existing and new technologies for gene discovery – transcriptomics and metabolomics - as well as optimisation of plant metabolic engineering – using transient expression in N. benthamiana- and reports on novel combinatorial biochemistry occurring in metabolic engineering of heterologous plant hosts, resulting in novel sesquiterpene lactone derivatives with the potential to be new drug leads. The use of transient expression and metabolomics for unexpected product identification are technologies that will be of great value to others working in the field of metabolic engineering.

All cell lines were pretreated with <b>parthenolide</b> and then stimulated with IL- 1 β and/or TNF. <b>Parthenolide</b> significantly inhibited IL- 8 secretion induced by these cytokines and prevented NF-κB activation, IκBα degradation, and IκB Kinase complex activity.

Furthermore, the expression of several regulatory proteins relevant to VSMC proliferation including IκBα, cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2), p 21, and p 27 was examined to investigate the potential molecular mechanism. Results: Treatment with <b>parthenolide</b> significantly decreased the [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 30 %~ 56 % relative to control values in a dose-dependent manner (P< 0. 05). Addition of <b>parthenolide</b> also increased cell population at G 0 /G 1 phase by 19. 2 %~ 65. 7 % (P< 0. 05) and decreased cell population at S phase by 50. 7 %~ 84. 8 % (P< 0. 05), which is consistent with its stimulatory effects on p 21 and p 27. In addition, <b>parthenolide</b> also increased IκBα expression and reduced Cox- 2 expression in a time-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our results show that <b>parthenolide</b> significantly inhibits the VSMC proliferation by inducing G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest. IκBα and Cox- 2 are likely involved in such inhibitory effect of <b>parthenolide</b> on VSMC proliferation. These findings warrant further investigation on potential therapeutic implications of <b>parthenolide</b> on VSMC proliferation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Osteosarcoma is {{a devastating}} tumor of bone, {{primarily}} affecting adolescents. <b>Parthenolide,</b> a naturally occurring small molecule that interferes with NF-&#x 03 BA;B signaling, has recently attracted considerable attention {{because of its}} pharmacological action involving anti-cancer effects. However, the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect exerted by <b>parthenolide</b> on tumor cells is not clearly defined today. Methods: In this study, the effects of <b>parthenolide</b> were evaluated and characterized in human osteosarcoma cancer cell. Cell viability was assessed by CCK- 8. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V-FITC/PI Flow cytometry assay. Relative quantitative real-time PCR and western blot {{were used to determine}} the expressions of genes and proteins. Results: Our results suggest that <b>parthenolide</b> did not cause caspase-dependent cell death in osteosarcoma cancer cells, as indicated by the absence of significant early apoptosis as well as caspase- 3 cleavage. Instead, <b>parthenolide</b> increased the autophagy and mitophagy, as characterized by increased PINK 1 and Parkin translocation to mitochondria and enhanced autophagy proteins. The induction of autophagy by <b>parthenolide</b> was associated with the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated parthenolide-induced autophagy activity. Conclusions: Our findings unveil a novel mechanism of drug action by <b>parthenolide</b> in osteosarcoma cancer cells and suggest a potential value of treating osteosarcoma cancer through a caspase-independent autophagic cell death by ROS activation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chronic cocaine {{administration}} {{leads to}} catecholamine reuptake inhibition which enhances reward and motivational behaviors. Ventral Tegmental Area dopaminergic (VTA DA) neuronal firing {{is associated with}} changes in reward predictive signals. Acute cocaine injections inhibit putative VTA DA cell firing in vertebrates. <b>Parthenolide,</b> a compound isolated from the feverfew plant (Tanacetum parthenium), {{has been shown to}} substantially inhibit cocaine’s locomotion effects in a planarian animal model (Pagán et al., 2008). Here we investigated the effects of <b>parthenolide</b> on the spontaneous firing activity of putative VTA DA neurons in anesthetized male rats (250 - 300 g). Single-unit recordings were analyzed after intravenous (i. v.) <b>parthenolide</b> administration followed by 1 mg/kg i. v. cocaine injection. Results showed that <b>parthenolide</b> at 0. 125 mg/kg and 0. 250 mg/kg significantly blocked cocaine’s inhibitory effect on DA neuronal firing rate and bursting activity (p< 0. 05, two way ANOVA). We propose that <b>parthenolide</b> might inhibit cocaine’s effects on VTA DA neurons via its interaction with a common binding site at monoamine transporters. It is suggested that <b>parthenolide</b> could have a potential use as an overdose antidote or therapeutic agent to cocaine intoxication...|$|E
40|$|Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a {{medicinal}} herb which {{is rich in}} sesquiterpene lactones. The main sesquiterpene lactone in feverfew is <b>parthenolide.</b> Costunolide has been {{considered to be the}} immediate precursor of <b>parthenolide.</b> <b>Parthenolide</b> and costunolide levels in flowers and in leaves collected during the vegetative and generative phase of three feverfew genotypes (diploid, tetraploid and Zardband cv.) and in 2, 4 -D treated leaves of the diploid genotype were analyzed using UPLC–MS/MS. <b>Parthenolide</b> and costunolide levels showed a similar pattern in all genotypes, and were higher in flowers than in leaves. The developmental pattern of these two compounds was not the same in flowers of the different genotypes and 2, 4 -D treatment increased both coordinately. In conclusion, we show that genetical, developmental and spatial factors all influence the composition of sesquiterpene lactones in feverfe...|$|E
40|$|During {{the growth}} of Tanaceum parthenium (L.) Schultz-Bip. Feverfew, Asteraceae) the {{percentage}} of <b>parthenolide</b> was the highest {{at an early stage}} (just before the formation of stems), The yield of <b>parthenolide</b> per individual plant gradually increased from about 10 mg {{at the beginning of the}} study to about 20 mg when the plant was in full bloom, <b>Parthenolide</b> was present in the leaves and flowerheads, but not in the seems. Drying at ambient temperature and lyophilisation had no negative influence on the yield of <b>parthenolide</b> per individual plant on comparing the results with those of fresh plant material. Based on the results of this study and on data from the literature we propose to distinguish two qualities of feverfew: a: Tanaceti parthenii folium (feverfew leaf), harvested at an early stage before the formation of the stems and b: Tanaceti parthenii herba (feverfew herb), harvested at full bloom, with a minimum <b>parthenolide</b> content of 0. 50 % and 0. 20 %, respectively, calculated on a dry weight basis. Both drugs can be easily distinguished by means of microscopic examination...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{sesquiterpene}} lactone <b>parthenolide</b> lowers the viability of MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells, in correlation with oxidative stress. The present report examined the different radical species produced during <b>parthenolide</b> treatment and their possible role in the toxicity caused by the drug. Time course experiments showed that in the first phase of treatment (0 - 8 h), and in particular in the first 3 h, <b>parthenolide</b> induced dichlorofluorescein (DCF) signal in a large percentage of cells, while dihydroethidium (DHE) signal was not stimulated. Since the effect on DCF signal was suppressed by apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), two inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (NOX), we suggest that <b>parthenolide</b> rapidly stimulated NOX activity with production of superoxide anion (O 2 •-), which was converted by superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) into hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). In the second phase of treatment (8 - 16 h), <b>parthenolide</b> increased the number of positive cells to DHE signal. Since this event was not prevented by apocynin and DPI and was associated with positivity of cells to MitoSox Red, a fluorochrome used to detect mitochondrial production of O 2 •-, we suggest that <b>parthenolide</b> induced production of O 2 •- at the mitochondrial level independently by NOX activity in the second phase of treatment. Finally, in this phase, most cells became positive to hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) signal, a fluorescent probe to detect highly reactive oxygen species (hROS), such as hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite. Therefore, <b>parthenolide</b> between 8 - 16 h of treatment induced generation of O 2 •- and hROS, in close correlation with a marked reduction in cell viability...|$|E
