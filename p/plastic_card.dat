25|$|A {{credit card}} {{is part of}} a system of {{payments}} named after the small <b>plastic</b> <b>card</b> issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user. In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>plastic</b> <b>card,</b> each holder of a Bulgarian driving licence is in a possession of a second document, named check counterfoil (контролен талон). It is made of blue paper, is filled in by hand and is stamped. When a driver is fined for road violation, the counterfoil is taken by the authorities and is replaced by а breech act (акт за нарушение). The driver may continue driving for a limited period of time, stated in the document. The check counterfoil is returned back only after the fine is paid.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} stripe card {{is a type of}} card capable of storing data by modifying the magnetism of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The {{magnetic stripe}}, sometimes called a magstripe, is read by physical contact and swiping past a reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards such as a driver's license, and transportation tickets. The {{magnetic stripe card}} was invented in 1960 by IBM engineer Forrest Parry, who conceived the idea of incorporating a piece of magnetic tape in order to store secured information and data to a <b>plastic</b> <b>card</b> base.|$|E

25|$|The Council of the European Union Directive 91/439/EEC harmonises the {{categories}} of driving licences among the Member States and establishes two Community driving licence models, one paper version and one <b>plastic</b> <b>card</b> version. It furthermore establishes an obligatory test of knowledge (theory) and a test of skills and behaviour (practical) which has to be successfully passed before an individual is offered a driving licence. It also requires an applicant to meet the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness to drive. The directive specifies the minimum ages for driving different types of vehicles, and establishes progressive access in categories A, C, and D, from light vehicles to larger or more powerful vehicles. The directive stipulates that it is mandatory to have the normal residence in the Member State issuing the licence.|$|E
25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the <b>plastic</b> <b>card</b> {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E
500|$|Customers in North America who pre-ordered {{the game}} {{received}} a limited edition {{box with a}} golden <b>plastic</b> <b>card</b> affixed, reading [...] "Collector's Edition". This edition contained a gold-colored cartridge, a tradition for the Zelda series {{that began with the}} original game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Demand was so great that Electronics Boutique stopped pre-selling the title on November 3, 1998. Several versions of Ocarina of Time were produced, with later revisions featuring minor changes such as glitch repairs, the recoloring of Ganondorf's blood from crimson to green, and the alteration of the music heard in the Fire Temple dungeon to remove a sample of an Islamic prayer chant. The sample was taken from a commercially available sound library, but the developers did not realize it contained Islamic references. Although popularly believed to have been changed due to public outcry, the chanting was in fact removed after the company discovered it violated their own policy to avoid religious material in games, and the altered versions of Ocarina of Time were made prior to the game's original release.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a <b>plastic</b> <b>card,</b> printer paper or poster paper. [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes Mort Walker creates strips with raunchy {{subject matter}} {{for his own}} amusement. This is done at the sketch stage, and those strips are {{never meant to be}} {{published}} in the USA. They [...] "end up in a black box in the bottom drawer", according to Walker. These sketches are sometimes published in Scandinavia, however, with a translation underneath. In Norway, they've appeared in the Norwegian Beetle Bailey comic book, Billy, with the cover of the comic marked to show it contains censored strips. To offset any possible negative reaction, the publisher experimented with [...] "scrambling" [...] the strips in the mid-1990s. To see them, the reader had to view them through a [...] "de-scrambling" [...] <b>plastic</b> <b>card.</b> This was discontinued soon afterwards, and the strips today are printed without scrambling.

50|$|Alongside {{the basic}} {{function}} of printing cards, card printers can also read and encode magnetic stripes {{as well as}} contact and contact free RFID chip cards (smart cards). Thus card printers enable the encoding of <b>plastic</b> <b>cards</b> both visually and logically. <b>Plastic</b> <b>cards</b> can also be laminated after printing. <b>Plastic</b> <b>cards</b> are laminated after printing to achieve a considerable increase in durability and {{a greater degree of}} counterfeit prevention. Some card printers come with an option to print both sides at the same time, which cuts down the time taken to print and less margin of error. In such printers one side of id card is printed and then the card is flipped in the flip station and other side is printed.|$|R
