5|$|On 31 March 2003, the BCCS {{merged with}} the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which took over the {{responsibility}} of banknote issuance. On 4 May 2004, the MAS started issuing polymer versions of the S$10 note for general circulation; polymer versions of the S$2 and S$5 notes were subsequently released. Higher denomination banknotes (S$50, S$100, S$1,000 & S$10,000) are still printed on paper. The <b>paper</b> <b>version</b> of the lower denomination banknotes remain in active circulation alongside the polymer version, though the number of S$2 and S$5 paper notes have dwindled significantly since the introduction of polymer notes.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) {{measures}} {{are essential for}} assessing subjective patient experiences. Interactive voice response (IVR) data collection provides advantages for clinical trial design by standardizing and centralizing the assessment. Prior to adoption of IVR {{as a mode of}} PRO administration in the Testosterone Trials (TTrials), we compared IVR to <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> of the instruments to be used. METHODS: IVR versions of the FACIT-Fatigue scale and Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire, Question 4, were developed. In one pilot study, IVR versions of these scales were compared to <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> in 25 men = 65 years at each of two clinical sites. In another study, IVR versions of the SF- 36 Vitality Scale (SF- 36), Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire were evaluated in comparison with previously validated <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> in 25 men at two clinical sites. Both <b>paper</b> and IVR <b>versions</b> of each instrument were administered in counterbalanced order, and test-retest reliability was evaluated by repeated administration of the test. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the degree of agreement. Test-retest correlations for each measure were also determined. RESULTS: Satisfactory agreement was observed between IVR and <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> of each study measure. Specifically, linear and highly positive associations were observed consistently across the study for IVR and <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> of all study measures. These ranged from r = 0. 91 - 0. 99. Test-retest reliability for all measures was acceptable or better (r = 0. 70 - 0. 90). CONCLUSIONS: The IVR versions of TTrials endpoints in these two studies performed consistently well in comparison with <b>paper</b> <b>versions...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Council of the European Union Directive 91/439/EEC harmonises the {{categories}} of driving licences among the Member States and establishes two Community driving licence models, one <b>paper</b> <b>version</b> and one plastic card version. It furthermore establishes an obligatory test of knowledge (theory) and a test of skills and behaviour (practical) which has to be successfully passed before an individual is offered a driving licence. It also requires an applicant to meet the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness to drive. The directive specifies the minimum ages for driving different types of vehicles, and establishes progressive access in categories A, C, and D, from light vehicles to larger or more powerful vehicles. The directive stipulates that it is mandatory to have the normal residence in the Member State issuing the licence.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Storm of Zehirs {{use of the}} Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules {{with the}} exception of GameSpy, who expressed skepticism of the ruleset in a preview of the game. [...] The game's handling of character death was not well received, [...] despite being more faithful to the pencil and <b>paper</b> <b>version</b> than previous Dungeons & Dragons video games. [...] Unlike Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer where defeated characters would be automatically revived after a battle, Storm of Zehir requires a powerful spell or a [...] "Coin of Waukeen" [...] to resurrect dead allies. [...] Reviewers considered this requirement unforgiving; GameSpy said [...] "This merely forces the player to troop back to town through a zillion meaningless random encounters. This may be [...] "realistic" [...] (whatever that means in a world where players fight against newborn gods and sentient snakes), but it's simply not fun. Baldur's Gate had this all worked out over a decade ago. Why do we need to re-invent the wheel?" ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{questionnaires}} {{are recommended}} {{in the management}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by the global initiative for obstructive lung disease, of which two are the more comprehensive assessments: the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test and the clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire. Both are carefully designed high-quality questionnaires, but information on the feasibility for routine use is scarce. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the time to complete the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test and the clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire and the acceptability of the questionnaires. Furthermore, the agreement between electronic and <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> of the questionnaires was explored. The time to complete the electronic versions of the questionnaires was 99. 6 [IQR 74; 157] vs. 97. 5 [IQR 68; 136] seconds for clinical clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test, respectively. The difference in time to complete the questionnaire was not significant. The two questionnaires did not differ in "easiness to complete" or "importance of issues raised in questionnaires". Electronic vs. <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> revealed high agreement (ICC CCQ = 0. 815 [0. 712; 0. 883] and ICC CAT = 0. 751 [0. 608; 0. 847]) between the administration methods. Based on this study it can be concluded that both questionnaires are equally suitable for use in routine clinical practice, because they are both quick to complete and have a good acceptability by the patient. Agreement between electronic and <b>paper</b> <b>versions</b> of the questionnaires was high, so use of electronic versions is justified...|$|R
