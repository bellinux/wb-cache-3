40|$|Different <b>tax</b> <b>systems,</b> {{and their}} impact on work {{motivation}} and tax compliance are significant issues in contemporary political and economic debates. The proportional feature of a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> is assumed to lead to higher performance, while the fairness of the redistributive <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> is assumed to result in higher tax compliance. However, empirical findings on the topic are inconclusive. Both work performance and tax compliance under different <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> were examined in an experiment, with special attention devoted to the effect of a change in <b>tax</b> <b>systems.</b> A flat <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> was supposed to induce greater work performance, whereas a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> was expected to increase tax compliance based on fairness perceptions, allowing for the opposite effect due to higher complexity. Furthermore, it was assumed that performance and tax payments would be influenced by motives of self-interest. The design included 20 rounds with a real-effort task in each round, determining participants' experimental income. Participants (N = 191) made decisions about their tax payments from round-to-round in four different experimental conditions: (1) a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> (2) a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> (3) starting with a flat and changing to a progressive, and (4) starting with a progressive and changing to a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system.</b> Results indicate higher work performance in a progressive system.

40|$|II The {{paper offers}} an {{investigation}} of how a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> affects wage formation. When there is bargaining over wages, a rise in tax progressivity is {{likely to lead to}} wage moderation because it makes real labor costs- and thereby employment- more sensitive to changes in the real wage. A <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> may therefore also lead to a lower equilibrium unemployment rate in the economy. Our empirical analysis of wage determination exploits two different Swedish data sets. One data set contains time series on wages among workers in different skill categories; the other data set is a panel for 1989 - 92 with detailed information on individual workers. The results from the two data sets are broadly consistent with the theory, implying that tax progression contributes to wage moderation. This suggests that the decline in tax progressivity that has occurred {{over the past ten years}} may have increased the equilibrium unemployment rate in Sweden. I...|$|R

This study explores how <b>progressive</b> income <b>taxes</b> influence storage decisions and the markets for storable commodities.

50|$|One type of {{flat tax}} would {{be imposed on}} all income once—at {{the source of the}} income. Hall and Rabushka (1995) {{includes}} a proposed amendment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate. This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is not directed at specifying graduated tax rates). As it now stands, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient. It is further argued that current tax law retards economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current <b>system</b> to create <b>tax</b> shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance. Flat tax critics contend that a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> could be created with many loopholes, or a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> without loopholes, and that a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system</b> could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat <b>tax</b> <b>system.</b> A simple <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> would also discourage tax avoidance.|$|R
40|$|A general {{class of}} {{progressivity}} indices is proposed {{which is consistent}} with the well-developed theory of the measurement of inequality and social welfare.

For an additive social welfare function and a <b>progressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> the greater the degree of relative inequality aversion, the greater the progressivity index. We also discuss the link between inequality of gross income and tax progressivity.
