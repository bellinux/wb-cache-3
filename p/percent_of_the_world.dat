25|$|Fish do not {{actually}} produce omega-3 fatty acids, but instead accumulate them from either consuming microalgae that produce these fatty acids, {{as is the}} case with forage fish like herring and sardines, or, {{as is the case}} with fatty predatory fish, like salmon, by eating prey fish that have accumulated omega-3 fatty acids from microalgae.

25|$|Reef {{fisheries}} are fisheries for reef {{fish and}} other organisms that live among coral reefs. The Maldives contain 2.86 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> coral reefs. The FAO estimated in 1992 that a sustainable yield of about 30,000 tonnes per year was possible for commercial reef fish. The atoll basins, which {{are by far the}} largest part of the Maldivian atolls, were identified as having large reef fish resources. Outside the atolls, the deep reef slopes support some high value species, but their total potential yield is relatively small.|$|E
25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E

The first telecom R centre {{was set up by}} an Indian company called Primetel in 1996 and since then the city has developed as the global centre for the telecom R industry. Chengdu's growth accelerated alongside the growth of the telecom services sector in India and China, which together account for over 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> telecommunications market. Several key national electronics R institutes are located in Chengdu. Chengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone has attracted a variety of multinationals, at least 30 Fortune 500 companies and 12,000 domestic companies, including Intel, IBM, Cisco, Nokia, Motorola, SAP, Siemens, Canon, HP, Xerox, Microsoft, Tieto, NIIT, MediaTek, and Wipro, as well as domestic powerhouses such as Lenovo. Dell plans to open its second major China operations center in 2011 in Chengdu as its center in Xiamen expands in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Distinct trends exist {{regarding}} conservation development. While many countries' {{efforts to}} preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, {{those in the}} North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed {{at the level of}} the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs – in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.|$|E
