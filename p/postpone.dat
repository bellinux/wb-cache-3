40|$|Whether to {{implement}} <b>postponed</b> production with higher production cost is puzzled by more manufacturers, and {{to solve this}} problem, we set the total cost model considering inventory cost and customer waiting cost in non-postponed production and <b>postponed</b> production respectively.

Besides, if the <b>postponed</b> production is adopted, where is the best CODP (Customer order decoupling point) in the <b>postponed</b> production process, and these research results will provide theoretical support for the manufacturer to locate the CODP point correctly, and help the manufacturer to make decision on implementing <b>postponed</b> strategy...|$|R
