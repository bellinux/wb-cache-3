5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E

25|$|When charged, {{the device}} instructs {{the user to}} ensure no one is {{touching}} the patient and then to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to deliver the shock; human intervention is usually required to deliver the shock to the patient {{in order to avoid}} the possibility of accidental injury to another person (which can result from a responder or bystander touching the patient at the time of the shock). Depending on the manufacturer and particular model, after the shock is delivered most devices will analyze the patient and either instruct CPR to be performed, or prepare to administer another shock.|$|E
25|$|It {{is quite}} {{likely that a}} large range of {{cognitive}} operations are necessary to freely <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior {{that the rest of}} the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.|$|E

25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} an {{automated}} defibrillator was first conceived by Dr. Arch Diack, a surgeon in Portland, Oregon. His prototype, literally assembled in a basement, utilized a unique defibrillatory pathway – tongue to chest. There was a breath detector {{that was a}} safeguard to prevent shocking breathing persons. The electrode was essentially a rate counter, far cruder than today’s sophisticated VF detectors. The production model weighed 35pounds and gave verbal instructions. It was an idea ahead of its time. Most people viewed it as a curiosity. By the late 1980s, however, other manufacturers entered the field leading to the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) we have today. Current AEDs, like regular defibrillators, use electrode pads attached to the chest. AEDs are programmed to guide the operator (with a series of voice prompts) through the procedure. The pads once attached automatically detect the type of heart rhythm and if VF is present the AED instructs the operator to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> (usually flashing red) to shock the patient. From EMT defibrillation with AEDs, there was a natural and logical progression to first responder defibrillation (AEDs used by police or security personnel), next widespread Public Access Defibrillation (AEDs used by lay persons in public locations such as airports, schools, exercise facilities, etc.) and finally home AED including the opportunity to purchase AEDs over the counter without a prescription.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer {{is under}} the {{constant}} threat of a stalker named Scissorman. When Scissorman is confronted, the game will enter [...] "panic mode." [...] Depending on Jennifer's health status, she may begin to trip, slow down and eventually be killed. Jennifer cannot use weapons against Scissorman. Instead the player must find hiding spots throughout the mansion which are key to Jennifer's survival, or use traps placed in the environment. If caught, the player can rapidly <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> which allows them an attempt to escape. If Jennifer dies it is game over, returning the player to the title screen with an option to continue the game.|$|E

500|$|Cyber Danganronpa VR is {{a virtual}} reality game in which the player plays through the fourth [...] "class trial" [...] from the {{adventure}} game , where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami; unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, Cyber Danganronpa VR uses 3D models. The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with [...] "truth bullets". To do this, the player needs to turn their head toward the character who testified, and <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on the DualShock 4 controller. The game takes around ten minutes to play through, and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma punishes the player.|$|E
500|$|Most of the game's {{missions}} {{take place}} in third-person shooting format, combined {{with the use of}} a cover system. When a character is behind a low object like a crate, or at the edge of a corner or doorframe, they can <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to use the object or edge as cover. Another button will allow the character to peer around and enter a targeting mode, while releasing the button will quickly return them to cover. There is also a stealth mode which has the character stoop, walk silently (unless running), duck behind any low obstacles they can hide behind and be less detectable by sound. A character can sneak up behind an enemy using stealth mode and perform a silent [...] "stealth takedown" [...] by breaking his neck.|$|E
500|$|Some {{experiments}} give subjects a [...] "distractor" [...] task {{to ensure}} that subjects are not consciously {{paying attention to the}} experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes attentional resources to it. [...] For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. [...] The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attentionor at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to have Ninten [...] "check" [...] or [...] "talk" [...] with nearby people, animals, and objects. The game shares {{similarities}} with its sequel, EarthBound: {{there is a}} game save option through using a phone to call Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money. The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to EarthBound party members in style and function. Mother world map does not keep locations separate, and instead connects all areas (akin to the Pokémon series games). The game's story begins as Ninten discovers a music box and receives the journal of his great-grandfather, who studied psychic powers nearly a century earlier. Ninten is attacked by household items, and ventures outside to find a crazy world with hostile everyday objects and other odd events.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of John F. Kennedy's death and {{favorable}} economic circumstances, Lyndon Johnson was the favorite candidate {{early on in the}} general election campaign. In light of Nelson Rockefeller's rebuke of Goldwater's political ideology at the Republican Convention, which was televised nationally, the media speculated {{as to whether or not}} Rockefeller would endorse Goldwater in the general election, barring the Goldwater campaign with more negative publicity. In addition to this, Johnson was known for his ability to manipulate the press in order to provide favorable coverage of his own campaign. [...] Johnson, along with the media, who also had a generally unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, portrayed his opponent as a political extremist. Johnson also used Goldwater's speeches to imply that he would willingly wage a nuclear war, quoting Goldwater: [...] "by one impulse act you could <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> and wipe out 300 million people before sun down." [...] In turn, Goldwater defended himself by accusing Johnson of making the accusation indirectly, and contending that the media blew the issue out of proportion.|$|E
500|$|Baer {{spent the}} next few months {{designing}} further prototypes, and in February 1967 assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison {{spent the next}} few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype. [...] Baer, meanwhile, collaborated with engineer Bill Rusch on the design of the console, including developing the basis of many games for the system. The first game was developed by May, a two-player game where the players repeatedly <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box. These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management. Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.|$|E

500|$|The full 120-second {{version of}} the {{advertisement}} aired only 10 times in all, and only in the 10 days after the initial screening. The slots were chosen for maximum impact, mostly in high-profile sporting {{events such as the}} UEFA Champion's League football match between Manchester United and Real Madrid. The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60-second and five 30-second variations, which continued to air for a further six weeks. These shortened versions made use of newly introduced interactive options on the Sky Digital television network. Viewers were encouraged to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on their remote control, bringing up a menu that allowed the viewer to see the full 120-second {{version of the}} advertisement. Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord. The DVD, which was also included as an insert in 1.2million newspapers {{in the first week of}} the commercial's rollout, contained a [...] "making-of" [...] documentary featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the production process, a virtual tour of the Accord, the original music video to [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] by the Sugarhill Gang, and an illustrated guide to all the parts shown in [...] "Cog". The interactive 30-second versions of [...] "Cog" [...] proved hugely successful. Over 250,000 people used the menu option, spending an average of two and a half minutes in the dedicated advertising area. A significant number watched the looped 120-second version for up to ten minutes. Of those who opened the menu, 10,000 requested either a DVD or a brochure, and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of test drives.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, IBM representatives {{communicated with}} Jeopardy! {{executive}} producer Harry Friedman {{about the possibility}} of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants on the show, and the program's producers agreed. Watson's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy! staff during the planning of the competition. IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show's writers would exploit Watson's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues, thereby turning the game into a Turing test. To alleviate that claim, a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast. Jeopardy! staff also showed concerns over Watson's reaction time on the buzzer. Originally Watson signalled electronically, but show staff requested that it <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> physically, as the human contestants would. Even with a robotic [...] "finger" [...] pressing the buzzer, Watson remained faster than its human competitors. Ken Jennings noted, [...] "If you're trying to win on the show, the buzzer is all", and that Watson [...] "can knock out a microsecond-precise buzz every single time with little or no variation. Human reflexes can't compete with computer circuits in this regard." [...] Stephen Baker, a journalist who recorded Watson's development in his book Final Jeopardy, reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy! became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled. As part of the preparation, IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy!. Human players, including former Jeopardy! contestants, also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host. About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65% of the games.|$|E
