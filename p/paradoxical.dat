5|$|<b>Paradoxical</b> reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. <b>Paradoxical</b> reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. <b>Paradoxical</b> effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is <b>paradoxical</b> in {{evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and <b>paradoxical</b> effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have <b>paradoxical</b> reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears <b>paradoxical</b> as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. <b>Paradoxical</b> effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during breastfeeding. It is of the benzodiazepine class and works through the GABA neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears <b>paradoxical</b> and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were <b>paradoxical</b> or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent <b>paradoxical</b> reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem <b>paradoxical</b> given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by {{ceruloplasmin}} which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find a <b>paradoxical</b> potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; <b>paradoxical</b> effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam was {{the most}} <b>paradoxical</b> of all Prime Ministers {{in the last half}} of the 20th century. A man of superb intellect, knowledge, and literacy, he yet had little ability when it came to economics.... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage, and yet his {{parliamentary}} skills were rhetorical and not tactical. He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy.... Above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look <b>paradoxical</b> in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of the poem declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of the poem. Critics have focused on other aspects of the poem, including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the <b>paradoxical</b> relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently <b>paradoxical</b> behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|In Soul Reaver 2, it is {{established}} that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality—history is immutable, and all individuals {{are subject to}} predestination. Raziel, due to his <b>paradoxical</b> destiny, is the only exception to this rule—his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will {{in a bid to}} outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.|$|E
25|$|Use the <b>paradoxical</b> {{decomposition}} {{of that group}} and the axiom of choice to produce a <b>paradoxical</b> {{decomposition of}} the hollow unit sphere.|$|E
25|$|Hempel himself {{accepted}} the <b>paradoxical</b> conclusion, {{arguing that the}} reason the result appears <b>paradoxical</b> is that we possess prior information without which the observation of a non-black non-raven would indeed provide evidence that all ravens are black.|$|E
25|$|Finally, connect {{every point}} on S2 with a ray to the origin; the <b>paradoxical</b> {{decomposition}} of S2 then yields a <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition {{of the solid}} unit ball minus the point at the ball's center (this center point needs a bit more care, see below).|$|E

25|$|Although {{atropine}} treats bradycardia (slow heart rate) {{in emergency}} settings, {{it can cause}} <b>paradoxical</b> heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5nbsp&mg), presumably {{as a result of}} central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's <b>paradoxical</b> bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response.|$|E
25|$|A <b>paradoxical</b> {{observation}} {{has been}} the strong association of certain microbial organisms with autoimmune diseases.|$|E
25|$|Two other neurotransmitters, orexin and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), seem {{to promote}} wakefulness, {{diminish}} during deep sleep, and inhibit <b>paradoxical</b> sleep.|$|E
25|$|The two {{rotations}} behave {{just like}} the elements a and b in the group F2: {{there is now a}} <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition of H.|$|E
25|$|This {{is known}} as a <b>paradoxical</b> embolus because the clot {{material}} paradoxically enters the arterial system instead of going to the lungs.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} arithmetic {{proof of}} the existence of free groups in some special orthogonal groups using integral quaternions leads to <b>paradoxical</b> decompositions of the rotation group.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experiments}} have documented similar findings. In one study, when {{participants were given}} cognitively demanding concurrent tasks, the results showed a <b>paradoxical</b> higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither <b>paradoxical</b> effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{levels are}} not a good marker of baldness, and many studies {{actually}} show <b>paradoxical</b> low testosterone in balding persons, although research on the implications is limited.|$|E
25|$|In {{quantum field}} {{theories}} such as quantum electrodynamics, the Dirac field {{is subject to}} a process of second quantization, which resolves some of the <b>paradoxical</b> features of the equation.|$|E
25|$|The {{war would}} be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the <b>paradoxical</b> effect of {{creating}} {{one of the most}} fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre.|$|E
25|$|This is a <b>paradoxical</b> {{experience}} {{in which the}} person has a strong feeling {{of the presence of}} another person, sometimes recognised, sometimes unrecognised, but without any apparently justifying sensory stimulus.|$|E
25|$|With {{its highly}} limited color palette Gleizes {{achieved}} in La Femme aux Phlox a masterful demonstration of monochromism, a relative and <b>paradoxical</b> monochromy, considering {{the subject matter}} of a woman with flowers.|$|E
25|$|Tarski {{proved that}} {{amenable}} groups are precisely those {{for which no}} <b>paradoxical</b> decompositions exist. Since only free subgroups are needed in the Banach–Tarski paradox, {{this led to the}} long-standing Von Neumann conjecture.|$|E
25|$|John Polkinghorne {{suggests}} that the nearest analogy {{to the existence of}} God in physics is the ideas of quantum mechanics which are seemingly <b>paradoxical</b> but make sense of a great deal of disparate data.|$|E
25|$|In Step 3, {{the sphere}} was {{partitioned}} into orbits {{of our group}} H. To streamline the proof, the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation was omitted; since the <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, {{the fact that some}} points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H, denote this set of fixed points D. Step 3 proves that S2 − D admits a <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conscious}} patient, {{other signs of}} airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include <b>paradoxical</b> chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and cyanosis.|$|E
