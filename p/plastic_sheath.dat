50|$|The GAA {{version of}} rounders {{is very similar}} to softball, the main {{difference}} being that the game is played with baseball-sized bats, balls and field. However, baseball-style gloves are not allowed. The main differences between baseball and the Rounders England version of the game are that the rounders bat is much shorter and is usually swung one-handed; misses or strikes are not called, so there are no walks or strike-outs; each batter receives only one good ball and must run whether he or she hits it or not. Other differences include the posts for marking the bases, which should be wooden, and are preferably encased in <b>plastic</b> <b>sheaths,</b> the lay-out of the pitch, especially the location of the last base; and the bowler's pitch, which is an underarm pendulum action, as in softball.|$|R

30|$|The {{process of}} {{spatially}} aligning multi-modal image data sets is challenging {{and is usually}} achieved using anatomical landmarks, features and/or pixel intensity values to establish correspondences between images acquired with different modalities. The registration between in vivo human tomographic images and three-dimensional (3 D) histopathology data in the brain {{has been shown to}} obtain satisfactory results with submillimetre accuracy [2, 3]. However, the process of obtaining 3 D reconstructions of the whole histopathology specimen is laborious, expensive and not feasible in most routine pathology settings. The post processing for such an approach includes (a) registration of individual histopathology slices to block-face images (photographic images of the specimen taken before and after cutting) to correct for the shrinkage incurred during histopathology procedures [4], (b) registration of shrinkage-corrected histopathology slices to each other to reconstruct a 3 D volume [5, 6] and (c) registration of the histopathology volume to the in vivo imaging data (i.e. in vivo PET/computed tomography (CT)/MR) using intensity-based or other algorithms directly [2]. In some cases, the in vivo imaging and histology volume are registered using volumetric block-face images as the registration reference [3] due to the latter’s rich spatial information content. However, the 3 D reconstruction of block-face images can be distorted by the so-called ‘banana effect’ whereby a 3 D curved object cannot be reconstructed from cross-sections without any additional information [7]. It is possible to minimise related registration errors by using an additional intermediate tomographic scan, for example, CT or MRI, of the unsliced specimen (i.e. an ex vivo scan) with inserted fiducial markers that can be visualised on both ex vivo and block-face images to drive the reconstruction of the 3 D block-face volume [4]. Shojaii R. et al. [8] used a catheter filled with cuttlefish ink and flour as a fiducial marker that was visible in multi-modal images. A number of other markers have also been proposed, for example, cotton thread infused with solution of gadopentetate dimeglumine and blue tissue marking dye [9], <b>plastic</b> <b>sheaths</b> of catheter needles [10], cotton thread infused with a solution of Magnevist and blue tissue marking dye [11] and bronze and stainless-steel paints [12].

Preoperative urodynamics were carried out in 222 units (94 %). The majority of respondents carry out TVT for inpatients alone (n= 173) compared with day surgery units alone (n= 22). Forty surgeons carried out TVT in both day surgery and on inpatients, with only one surgeon carrying out TVT in the outpatient department. The type of anaesthetic varied widely from local anaesthetic alone (n= 15), local anaesthetic plus sedation (n= 32), general anaesthetic alone (n= 32), regional anaesthetic alone (n= 63) and a mixture of anaesthetics (n= 94). Opinion was divided concerning aqua dissection, with 125 respondents using this technique compared with 111 against it. The amount of local anaesthetic used ranged from 20 – 200  mls (mean 92  mls, median 90  mls). Almost all surgeons use a catheter introducer (n= 211, 89 %), with an average size of 18  g. All surgeons (100 %) carry out an intraoperative cystoscopy, with 108 doing a cystoscopy after each needle pass and 128 after both needles have been passed. Two hundred surgeons use a cough test compared to 36 who are against it: the majority (n= 144) simply filled the bladder to an approximate volume (range 150 – 1, 000  mls, mean 368  mls, median 350  mls). Three surgeons filled the bladder to the leak point pressure on urodynamics, eight filled to bladder capacity on urodynamics and ten used other measurements prior to a cough test. The majority (n= 125) do not routinely check the urethra after removal of the covering <b>plastic</b> <b>sheaths.</b> Those that do (n= 101) use an average of an 8 -hagar gauge or 18 French gauge dilator.

30|$|Diagnostic {{laparoscopy}} should ideally {{be performed}} during the follicular {{phase of the}} menstrual function after cessation of the menses [1]. The peritoneum is the most adherent at the umbilicus making it the thinnest part of the abdominal wall. The Verres needle should therefore be inserted {{in the base of}} the umbilicus. It is also the most cosmetically acceptable. It is inserted initially vertically and then angled towards the uterus. The abdominal wall is pulled away from the great vessels by grasping the umbilicus with the thumb and the index finger. The Verres needle should be held halfway up its shaft to prevent inadvertent damage to major vessels due to precipitate insertion. Throughout the insertion of the Verres needle the patient should be kept horizontal, because only the horizontal plane provides reference to the underlying anatomy. The practice of tilting the patient in a Trendlenburg position before pneumoperitoneum is established is unsafe. Various techniques have been described to ensure correct placement of the needle in the peritoneal cavity. Five millilitres of saline is injected through the Verres needle. No aspirate should be obtained in the syringe if the needle is in the peritoneal cavity. The swinging needle test is not recommended as the tip of the Verres needle cannot be visualised during the procedure, and moving it without due care may damage the abdominal viscera. The insuffulation technique is widely practised and easy. Once the surgeon is satisfied that the Verres needle is in the peritoneal space, the gas flow is attached and insufflation is commenced. If the gas flow is at or more than 1  l/min and the intraabdominal pressure is less than 10  mmHg, then the needle is most probably in the peritoneal cavity. The trocar insertion is the most hazardous part of the procedure. The trocar insertion follows similar directions as the insertion of the Verres needle. The trocar should be aimed at the uterus and kept vertically in the midline as deviation to the left or right of the midline can result in damage to the pelvic vessels. Laparoscopic trocars are approximately 10  cm long and, if inserted to their full extent, can easily perforate bowel or vessels. A better option is a shorter trocar (6 – 7  cm in length) with an atraumatic fixing mechanism such as a screw. The traditional valve mechanism found on many trocars restricts free movement on instruments within the trocar. <b>Plastic</b> <b>sheaths</b> are now available and are a suitable alternative. Secondary trocars are usually placed suprapubically or laterally. Insertion should be under direct vision. The inferior epigastric vessels can be avoided by direct inspection of the anterior abdominal wall. The superficial vessels can be observed at transillumination. With open laparoscopy as advocated by Hasson, the risk of injury to blood vessels is reduced; nevertheless, they still could occur especially in thin patients [2].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intravascular {{ultrasound}} imaging {{was performed in}} 27 patients after coronary balloon angioplasty to quantify the lumen and atheroma cross-sectional areas. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 20 -MHz ultrasound catheter was inserted through a 1. 6 -mm <b>plastic</b> introducer <b>sheath</b> across the dilated area to obtain real-time images at 30 times/sec. The ultrasound images distinguished the lumen from atheroma, calcification, and the muscular media. The presence of dissection between {{the media and the}} atheroma was well visualized.

The results indicate that high-quality intravascular ultrasound images under controlled in vitro conditions can provide accurate microanatomic information about the histological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques. Similar quality cross-sectional ultrasound images were also obtained in human coronary arteries in vivo. Quantitative analysis of the ultrasound images from the clinical studies revealed that the mean cross-sectional lumen area after balloon angioplasty was 5. 0 +/- 2. 0 mm 2. The mean residual atheroma area {{at the level of the}} prior dilatation was 8. 7 +/- 3. 4 mm 2, which corresponded to 63 % of the available arterial cross-sectional area.

CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular ultrasound appears to be more sensitive than angiography for demonstrating the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and arterial calcification.
