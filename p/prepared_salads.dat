50|$|In France, boudin is {{traditionally}} prepared in charcuteries, shops that prepare mainly pork products (and sometimes duck and game), but also sell smoked and dried sausages, pâtés, and terrines, along with <b>prepared</b> <b>salads.</b> It is usually called boudin noir {{and is often}} made with cream with apples or onions as a filler. It is generally served with either cooked apples, mashed potatoes or both, and is appreciated by combining either the apples or mashed potatoes with each bite of boudin, which has been gently heated and browned in butter. In France also, there are many regional different Boudins Noirs such as the large Boudin du Béarn with pork meat pieces eaten usually cold. The French Confrérie des Chevaliers du Goûte-Boudin (Brotherhood of the Knights of Blood Sausage Tasting) in Mortagne-au-Perche in southern Normandy holds an annual contest of international blood sausage specialities. Boudin is considered the emblematic staple of the French Foreign Legion, and gives {{its name to the}} Legion's anthem.|$|E
40|$|The market {{sales of}} {{ready-to-use}} fresh vegetables have grown rapidly {{in recent decades}} {{as a result of}} changes in consumer attitudes, especially consumption of fresh-cut lettuce and carrot due to their use in <b>prepared</b> <b>salads.</b> Chlorine solutions have been widely used to sanitise fruit and vegetables in the fresh-cut industry. However, the association of chlorine with the possible formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds in water has called into question the use of chlorine in food processing. There is a real need to ﬁnd alternatives for preservation of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables in order to improve the efﬁcacy of washing treatments. Alternatives or modiﬁed methods have been proposed, as antioxidants, irradiation, ozone, organics acids, modiﬁed atmosphere packaging, whey permeate, etc.; however, none have yet gained widespread acceptance by the industry. For this reason the development of alternatives and markers in order to measure the efﬁcacy of these alternatives are needed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundNorovirus (NoV) is {{commonly}} associated with gastrointestinal infection. It is normally transmitted person-to-person or from contaminated surfaces, although food-borne transmission is possible. MethodsWe conducted environmental, epidemiological, and microbiological investigations to ascertain the route of transmission of two linked outbreaks of NoV associated with events where food was consumed. Multivariate logistic regression {{was used to determine}} food items independently associated with infection. ResultsIn outbreak A, 19 of the 26 people who completed the food questionnaire fulfilled the case definition. The highest relative risks (RR) were for chicken kebab (RR 3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 9 – 10. 4), pork sausages (RR 2. 1, 95 % CI 0. 5 – 9. 1), pasta salad (RR 1. 94, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 4. 1), cheese (RR 1. 6, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 2. 8), and green leaf salad (RR 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 2. 4). In outbreak B, 60 of the 106 people surveyed fulfilled the case definition. Green leaf salad (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 9. 9) and coleslaw (aOR 8. 2, 95 % CI 3 – 22. 2) were independently associated with illness in the multivariate logistic regression model. NoV genogroup II genotype 6 (GII- 6) was identified in cases of both outbreaks and a food handler who had <b>prepared</b> <b>salads</b> for both events. ConclusionBecause outbreak investigations of small cohorts may not yield epidemiological association to food, most of these outbreaks may be attributed to the person-to-person transmission route. Therefore ascertainment of food-borne NoV infection may be low, underestimating the true prevalence of this route of transmission...|$|E

The epidemiological investigation showed that salad was strongly associated with the disease episode (RR = 2. 43, P = 0. 0005). Similar symptoms occurred among other customers who had had a meal at the same restaurant on the same evening. A foodhandler who had only <b>prepared</b> <b>salad</b> and appetizers became sick about 30 min {{after the end of}} his shift. He had been free of symptoms while preparing food.

5000|$|The moshav (agricultural village) of Sde Warburg, Israel, {{holds the}} Guinness World Record {{for the largest}} lettuce salad, {{weighing}} 10,260 kg (11.3 short tons).

Major General (Res.) Doron Almog, Chairman of Aleh Negev was present to accept the donation and commended the residents, who had grown the lettuce and <b>prepared</b> the <b>salad</b> on the moshav.

40|$|The need to {{minimise}} consumer risk, {{especially for}} food {{that can be}} consumed uncooked, is a continuing public health concern, particularly in places where safe sanitation and hygienic practices are absent. The use of wastewater in agriculture {{has been associated with}} disease risks, though its relative significance in disease transmission remains unclear. This study aimed at identifying key risk factors for produce contamination at different entry points of the food chain. Over 500 produce and ready-to-eat salad samples were collected from fields, markets, and kitchens during the dry and wet seasons in Accra, Ghana, and over 300 soil and irrigation water samples were collected. All samples were analysed for E. coli, human adenovirus and norovirus using standard microbiological procedures, and real time RT-PCR. Finally, critical exposures associated with microbial quality of produce were assessed through observations and interviews.
