5|$|For {{the first}} time in U.S. history, SCATANA was invoked, thus {{stranding}} tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights, causing about five hundred flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries.

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E

5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity.

5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival of <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced {{force and}} Abe's Vanguard force {{warships}} together headed directly towards the last reported {{position of the}} U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. The damaged carriers Zuihō and Shōkaku, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta {{in charge of the}} Zuikaku and Junyō aircraft forces. At 13:06, Junyō launched her second strike of seven torpedo <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five Zeros. At 15:35, Junyō launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four bombers and six Zeros.|$|E

United States military officials evacuated <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, {{in addition to}} flying planes down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm.

5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat <b>planes,</b> <b>and</b> battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports.

The F-80s spotted the North Korean <b>planes</b> <b>and</b> engaged them.
