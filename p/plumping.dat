25|$|Salt is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used additive in meat processing. It imparts flavor but also inhibits microbial growth, extends the product's shelf life and helps emulsifying finely processed products, such as sausages. Ready-to-eat meat products normally contain about 1.5 to 2.5 percent salt. Salt water or similar substances may also be injected into poultry meat to improve the taste and increase the weight, in a process called <b>plumping.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, back in Washington DC during October 1950, Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins {{submitted}} a memorandum to his Air Force counterpart, General Hoyt Vandenberg outlining Army complaints with the forward air control system and <b>plumping</b> for parceling {{close air support}} aircraft to its divisions. A month later, General Almond reported from Korea; his requests for improvements echoed that of Collins. During the same time frame, an Air Force team headed by General Glenn O. Barcus noted that the army's nonparticipation in the JOC hobbled close air support efforts. The Barcus report also contained suggestions to improve the Air Force participation in CAS.|$|E

25|$|Radiance, a synthetic, {{laboratory}} produced {{solution containing}} calcium hydroxylapatite (bone) suspended in a gel {{that has been}} safely used in medicine for years. Some studies indicate Radiance can last between three and five years. One researcher (Tzikas) found {{in a study of}} Radiance on 90 patients that 59 percent felt when injected, moderate to severe pain which disappeared two to five minutes later. But the substance produced results for an average of two years with a few patients reporting the <b>plumping</b> effects being sustained as long as three to five years. Of the 90 patients, four required surgical intervention due to nodules in the lips.|$|E
25|$|During his lifetime, Vallabhbhai Patel {{received}} {{criticism for}} an alleged bias against Muslims {{during the time}} of Partition. He was criticised by Maulana Azad and others for readily <b>plumping</b> for partition. Guha says that, during the Partition, Nehru wanted the government to make the Muslims stay back and feel secure in India while Patel was inclined to place that responsibility on the individuals themselves. Patel also told Nehru that the minority also had to remove the doubts that were entertained about their loyalty based on their past association with the demand of Pakistan. However, Patel successfully prevented attacks upon a train of Muslim refugees leaving India. In September 1947 he was said to have had ten thousand Muslims sheltered safely in the Red Fort and had free kitchens opened for them during the communal violence. Patel was also said to be more forgiving of Indian nationalism and harsher on Pakistan. He exposed a riot plot, confiscated a large haul of weapons from the Delhi Jumma Masjid, and had a few plotters killed by the police, but his approach was said to have been harsh.|$|E
500|$|As {{the poem}} progresses, Autumn is {{represented}} metaphorically {{as one who}} conspires, who ripens fruit, who harvests, who makes music. [...] The first stanza of the poem represents Autumn as involved with the promotion of natural processes, growth and ultimate maturation, two forces in opposition in nature, but together creating {{the impression that the}} season will not end. In this stanza the fruits are still ripening and the buds still opening in the warm weather. Stuart Sperry says that Keats emphasises the tactile sense here, suggested by the imagery of growth and gentle motion: swelling, bending and <b>plumping.</b>|$|E

In doing so, the pair underwent $200,000 worth of surgical alteration, receiving breast implants, cheek and chin implants, lip <b>plumping,</b> eye and nose jobs, tattooing, and hormone therapy, while also adopting gender neutral and alternating pronouns. With this project, P-Orridge's intent was to express {{a belief that the}} self is pure consciousness trapped within the DNA-governed body. The couple adopted the term [...] "pandrogyne" [...] because – in their words – [...] "we wanted a word without any history or any connections with things—a word with its own story and its own information." ...|$|E
