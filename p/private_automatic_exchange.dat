Together with the appendices, it provides: (1) The system requirements for determining system operability (Section 3. 0); (2) Evaluations of equipment to determine the safety boundary for the system (Section 4. 0); (3) List of system drawings that are annotated to show the SE boundaries (Appendix A); (4) Identification of the SE equipment by reference to systems and drawings (Appendix B); (5) Requirements for the individual SE equipment (Section 4. 0); and (6) A list of the operational and surveillance procedures necessary to operate and maintain the system equipment within the SE (Sections 5. 0 and 6. 0).

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} capable of transparently switching between multiple {{hardware and software}} implementations of embedded system components to cope with and adapt to dynamic runtime characteristics such as power, throughput and quality of service. The reconfiguration process is decomposed into small steps such that it is preemptable, transparent, dynamic and compliant with real-time requirements. We present a <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> Branch <b>eXchange</b> (PABX) system {{as a case study}} for the framework, and investigate the dynamic reconfiguration of three of its components: an ADPCM codec, a DTMF detector, and an AES core. Our results with this case study show how our framework is able to perform reconfiguration of hardware/software components in the order of a few milliseconds, without taking excessive system resources, and without disrupting the execution of application threads.

CTI allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller {{as a means of}} directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent. CTI can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the IVR dialog from the IVR to the agent desktop using a screen-pop, making for a more effective and efficient service. Voice-activated dialing (VAD) IVR systems are used to automate routine enquiries to switchboard or PABX (<b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> Branch <b>eXchange)</b> operators, and are used in many hospitals and large businesses to reduce the caller waiting time. An additional function is the ability to allow external callers to page staff and transfer the inbound call to the paged person. IVR can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller.|$|R

40|$|The actual {{idea of a}} {{telephony}} structure shows a <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> Branch <b>Exchange</b> (PABX) directly controlling a whole communication system. Ringing and {{caller identification}} signals, voltage setting for the phone sets among other important parameters all are transmitted using twisted pair cables {{that have to be}} installed and distributed along the building. The use of existing indoor power lines as the communication channel benefits the installation of the telephony system because the network infrastructure is already mounted. However, power lines behave noisy and aggressive when transmitting high frequency signals and in order to establish effective communication, modern modulation and transmissions schemes have to be implemented. With this new conception, the transmission scenario changes completely and so does the system. This paper presents the idea for the design of an analog modular electronic interface that is intended to create a sort of correlation between the current standards for conventional communication schemes and this system, which uses power lines to communicate between its peers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} various {{facets of the}} {{optimisation}} problem for telecommunication networks and proposes {{a number of new}} techniques for their solution. The necessary essentials, Graph Theory, Complexity Theory and Telecommunication Principles, are investigated. The relevant graphs are enumerated and the requirements of suitable optimisation algorithms for certain graphical problems are established. The <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> Branch <b>Exchange</b> (PABX) is introduced. the variety of telecommunications traffic as well as the practical requirements of a connection topology are discussed. The fundamental Network Optimisation Problem (NJP) is defined and analysed. Simple exhaustive methods of solution are considered together with partial solution algorithms and simplification methods. Centralised networks with and without concentrators are introduced. Extensions and modifications are proposed for some techniques and existing practical methods of dealing with the NOP are investigated. A number of new ideas are proposed for the practical solution of the NOP. Reduction methods are presented for replacing large unmanageable networks with smaller ones, on which optimisation can take place. Fixed topology techniques are introduced for initial tandem switch selection purposes and perturbation methods are considered which can be applied to such an initial solution. Lookahead methods of link removal are introduced for the purposes of determining the tandem interconnection network together with the traffic routeing strategy. A composite method is proposed incorporating all of these concepts and the results of a number of numerical experiments upon actual network problem; are presented. the extension of the proposed techniques to other areas of problem solving and optimisation is considered. In particular, a new method for the solution of the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (ETSP) is presented. A brief discussion is undertaken, in conclusion, concerning the practical difficulties of the NOP and The restrictions this placed upon solution algorithms of various types.

40|$|Any {{communication}} system requires {{at least three}} elements in order to function: a transmitting device, a receiving device, and a transmission line or propagation medium. Even the device children use, tin cans connected with string, consists or these three elements. One speaks into one can (transmitter), which vibrates at the same frequencies as the voice. The string (transmission path) picks up the vibrations of the can and carries them along its entire length. The other can (receiver) detects the vibration and reproduces the original sounds {{to a lesser extent}} depending on distance, tightness of string, type of string, etc. All {{communication system}}s depend on these three elements: transmitter, transmission path, and receiver. Communication systems can be divided into three fundamental categories: wired phone systems, radio systems, and carrier current systems. Sections 2. 2, 2. 3, and 2. 4, respectively, describe these systems and explain the basic principles of how each works. Hybrid systems are those systems that use various combinations of the three basic communication methods. Hybrid systems are described in section 2. 5. There are some other methods of signaling (stench warning, bell signaling, etc.) {{that can be used in}} underground mines to transmit or convey information. These systems, although they cannot be considered true communication systems since they do not provide voice or even two-way communication, are briefly described in section 2. 6. 2. 2 Wired Phone Systems Wired phone systems are all those that depend on a wire connection between phones with the wire carrying the voice signals. Figure 2 - 1 is a diagram of two typical wired phone systems. The top panel shows a simple single pair party line system. In this system each phone is connected to a common pair of wires, and a person speaking into one phone will be heard at all the other phones on the line. The bottom panel shows a multipair private line phone system. In this type of system, each phone is connected by its own individual pair of wires to a central switch or telephone exchange. To establish a call between two phones in this system, the lines between the two phones must be connected (switched together) within the telephone exchange. In early exchanges, the connections were made manually by an operator. These exchanges are called Private Branch Exchanges (PBX's). Today, equipment within the exchange can automatically connect each phone to any other phone in the system. These <b>exchanges</b> are called <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> Branch <b>Exchanges</b> (PABX's). There are many different types of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Some utilize switches to physically make each connection according to the number dialed. Other, more advanced exchanges are completely solid state and may even be computer controlled. [...|$|R
