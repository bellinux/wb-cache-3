40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Silvopasture is {{the planned}} and managed {{agroforestry}} {{system in which}} forage, livestock, and trees or shrubs are integrated {{in order to enhance}} individual components. Silvopasture has been identified as the most promising agroforestry system for the Pacific Northwest and Southeast United States. However, there have been few studies describing the economic viability of silvopasture in these regions. There are two objectives explored in this study: first, to determine the potential for silvopasture as an economically viable income source to farmers in eastern North Carolina and northeastern Oregon by calculating the Land Expectation Value (LEV), Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Annual Expectation Value (AEV), of realistic silvopastoral management regimes, compared to traditionally managed timber or livestock farms; second, to explore whether silvopasture can store as much or more carbon than a traditionally stocked timber plantation, and whether profits from sequestered carbon are possible at this time in the United States. The most profitable silvopasture regimes for eastern North Carolina were cool season grasses combined with loblolly pine at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate (LEV = 1, 025 per acre) and cool season grasses combined with longleaf pine at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate (LEV = 285 per acre). Traditionally stocked loblolly pine at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate accrued an LEV of 1, 777 per acre, while longleaf pine had negative returns (LEV = - 143 per acre). The cattle standard model for eastern North Carolina accrued an LEV of 2, 069 per acre at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate. The most profitable silvopasture regime for northeast Oregon was native forage establishment with ponderosa pine at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate (LEV = 274 per acre). Planted ponderosa pine had negative returns for all economic indicators (LEV at four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate = - 411). The cattle standard model accrued an LEV of 954 per acre at a four <b>percent</b> real <b>discount</b> rate. Models suggest loblolly pine timber management and cattle management is more profitable than silvopasture management in eastern North Carolina. Additionally, cattle management is more profitable than silvopasture in northeastern Oregon. Longleaf pine and ponderosa pine are not profitable when solely managed for timber, and benefit economically when combined with livestock. There is a growing appreciation for ecosystem services from Silvopasture in the scientific and public community. Tree canopy provides shade and a barrier from adverse weather for livestock herds. Silvopasture can also aid in increased biological diversity, reduced erosion, increased nutrient uptake, and enhanced carbon sequestration. In addition, silvopasture has the potential to store significant amounts of carbon, which benefits society as a whole. Therefore, it is amenable to include the social externalities of profitability in cash flow analyses. Currently there are only voluntary cap and trade markets. The most well-known is arguably the California Air Resources Board (ARB), regulated by the California Environmental Protection Agency. Unfortunately, silvopasture does not qualify at this time for carbon markets in the United States...|$|R

5000|$|At {{least two}} {{district}} courts {{have concluded that}} Mallinckrodt is no longer good law after Quanta. In Static Control Components, Inc. v.

In its original order, before Quanta was decided, the court rejected Static Control’s argument that Lexmark’s patent rights were exhausted {{as a result of}} the authorized sale of the cartridges. Relying heavily on Mallinckrodt, the court found that the sales were valid post-sale restrictions that avoided exhaustion. After Quanta was decided, however, the court reversed its original order and concluded that Lexmark’s single use restriction was not enforceable under patent law because the court was “persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio.” The court explained, “The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the Quanta holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on Mallinckrodt in reaching its decision in LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed.

40|$|In 1989, Boeing {{announced}} the fabrication of a tandem gallium concentrator solar cell with an {{energy conversion efficiency}} of 30 percent. This research breakthrough has now led to panels which are significantly smaller, lighter, more radiation resistant, and potentially less expensive than the traditional silicon flat plate electric power supply. The new Boeing tandem concentrator (BTC) module uses an array of lightweight silicone Fresnel lenses mounted on the front side of a light weight aluminum honeycomb structure to focus sunlight onto small area solar cells mounted on a thin back plane. This module design is shown schematically. The tandem solar cell in this new module consists of a gallium arsenide light sensitive cell with a 24 percent energy conversion efficiency stacked {{on top of a}} gallium antimonide infrared sensitive cell with a conversion efficiency of 6 percent. This gives a total efficiency 30 percent for the cell-stack. The lens optical efficiency is typically 85 <b>percent.</b> <b>Discounting</b> for efficiency losses associated with lens packing, cell wiring, and cell operating temperature still allows for a module efficiency of 22 percent which leads to a module power density of 300 Watts/sq. m. This performance provides more than twice the power density available from a single crystal silicon flat plate module and at least four times the power density available from amorphous silicon modules. The fact that the lenses are only 0. 010 ft. thick and the aluminum foil back plane is only 0. 003 ft. thick leads to a very lightweight module. Although the cells are an easy to handle thickness of 0. 020 ft., {{the fact that they are}} small, occupying one-twenty-fifth of the module area, means that they add little to the module weight. After summing all the module weights and given the high module power, we find that we are able to fabricate BTC modules with specific power of 100 watts/kg...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Horticulture)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Most {{nectarine}} orchards in South Africa {{are currently}} planted {{at a distance}} of 4 x 1. 5 m (2 500 trees/ha). These trees are mainly sylleptically trained to a central leader, although many producers also use the proleptic route. The former produces relatively high yields early in the lifetime of the orchard. A problem with nectarine production in South Africa is the lack of efficient rootstocks in terms of aspects such as size-control and the use of nematode-resistant rootstocks. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate different training systems for nectarine production and to investigate the role of three rootstocks that play a dominant role in the peach industry in South Africa. ‘Alpine’ nectarines were planted in the winter of 2002 at Lushof near Ceres, Western Cape, South Africa (33 º 18 ’S, 19 º 20 ’E). The trees were trained according to four different training systems: a four-leader system (5 x 3 m; 667 trees/ha), a two-leader system (5 x 1. 5 m; 1 333 trees/ha), a proleptically trained central leader (5 x 1 m; 2 000 trees/ha), and a sylleptically trained central leader (5 x 1 m; 2 000 trees/ha). The trees were planted on three different rootstocks: GF 667; SAPO 778; Kakamas seedling. The time spent per tree on pruning, thinning and picking was recorded. During harvest, the number of fruit and fruit mass per tree were recorded. Light measurements were recorded annually after summer pruning. The measurements were taken at different heights and at different depths in the canopy. To compare the training systems on an economic basis, the data from the trial together with projected data gathered from farmers and advisors were used to calculate the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) for each training system. The results showed that rootstock only played a significant role when it came to fruit mass (fruit size). Fruit from trees on SAPO 778 were heavier, indicating bigger fruit, than fruit from trees on Kakamas seedling rootstocks and this can play a role in packout percentage and income. In terms of the training system, the four-leader system took the most time to manage per tree. However, this system took the least time to manage per hectare during the initial years. No differences were found between the two central leaders. They both took the longest time to manage per hectare. The four-leader system produced significantly less fruit than any of the other systems during the first two years of production. In the third year of production, there was no significant difference found between the systems. Light penetration seemed to be the poorest at the middle and bottom of the canopy for trees trained to a central leader. Because of the open centre of the four-leader system, light penetration into the middle of these trees was good, but poor light penetration occurred in the upper and outer parts of the canopy underneath the scaffold branches. Poor light penetration occurred in the parts lower than 1. 5 m from the ground for all the systems. This was the area that was measured in this study. The result of an economic comparison showed that according to the IRR rating, the fourleader system should be preferred. The final decision should however be made according to the NPV rating. Results obtained from NPV calculations did not lead to the same conclusions as could be made from the IRR calculations. According to the rating of the NPV at five <b>percent</b> <b>discounting</b> rate, the two-leader should be the preferred system, while the proleptically trained central leader system should be preferred at a ten <b>percent</b> <b>discounting</b> rate. This implies that when the opportunity cost is low, the two-leader system should be preferred, and when the opportunity cost is high, the proleptically trained central leader system should be preferred...|$|R
