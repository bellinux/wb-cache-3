25|$|Spider silk is a <b>protein</b> <b>fibre</b> spun by spiders. Spiders {{use their}} silk to make webs or other structures, which {{function}} as sticky nets to catch other animals, or as nests or cocoons {{to protect their}} offspring, or to wrap up prey.

25|$|The final {{length is}} the {{tapering}} duct, {{the site of}} most of the fibre formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight about turns, a valve almost at the end (mentioned in detail at point No. 5 below) ending in a spigot from which the solid silk fibre emerges. The tube here tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is under constant elongational shear stress, which {{is an important factor in}} fibre formation. This section of the duct is lined with cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic, and remove water from the fibre. Collectively, the shear stress and the ion and pH changes induce the liquid silk dope to undergo a phase transition and condense into a solid <b>protein</b> <b>fibre</b> with high molecular organisation. The spigot at the end has lips that clamp around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining water.|$|E

Colouring biochemical components of tea revealed highest affinity for both the <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> at pH 2 to 4 in presence and absence of such mordanting agents. Use of ferrous sulphate and aluminium sulphate produced significant improvement in colour uptake following a pre- or post mordanting methods.

40|$|Here, we {{monitor the}} {{dissolution}} of several natural <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> such as wool, human hair and silk, in various ionic liquids (ILs). The dissolution of protein-based materials using ILs is an emerging area exploring the production of new materials from waste products. Wool is a keratin fibre, which is extensively used in the textiles industry {{and as a result}} has considerable amounts of waste produced each year. Wool, along with human hair, has a unique morphology whereby the outer layer, the cuticle, is heavily cross linked with disulphide bonds, whereas silk does not have this outer layer. Here we show how ILs dissolve natural <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> and how the mechanism of dissolution {{is directly related to the}} structure and morphology of the wool fibre. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R

5000|$|Protein {{deficiency}} or hormone problems—Ligaments {{are made}} up of several types of <b>protein</b> <b>fibre.</b> These proteins include elastin, which gives elasticity and which may be altered in some people. Female sex hormones alter collagen proteins. Women are generally more supple just before a period and even more so in the latter stages of pregnancy, because of a hormone called relaxin that allows the pelvis to expand so the head of the baby can pass. Joint mobility differs by race, which may reflect differences in collagen protein structure. People from the Indian sub-continent, for example, often have more supple hands than Caucasians.|$|E
5000|$|The {{developmental}} life {{stage of}} dogs requires a specific intake of nutrients to ensure proper {{growth and development}} and to meet energy requirements. Despite the fact that puppies have different nutritional requirements compared to their adult counterparts, of the 652 breeders surveyed in the United States and Canada in 2012, 8.7% report feeding puppies commercial diets not intended for the developmental life stage of canines. Large and small dog breeds have even more specific nutrient requirements during growth, such as adjusted calcium to phosphorus ratio, and as such should receive a breed specific growth formula. Feeding diets formulated by a nutritionist for specific breed and life stage differences in nutrient requirements ensures a growing puppy will receive the proper nutrition associated with appropriate skeletal, neurological and immune development. This includes nutrients such as <b>protein,</b> <b>fibre,</b> essential fatty acids, calcium and vitamin E. It is therefore important to feed puppies a diet that meets the minimum and/or maximum requirements established by the National Research Council.|$|E
50|$|Soybeans - Soy {{beans are}} being used to produce a huge number of {{products}} for vegetarians, vegans, and people with allergies to certain foods. The range of products produced using soy beans is extensive, and includes tofu, soy sauce, lecithin, meat analogue, miso, soy flour, soy milk, tempeh and yuba. They are high in <b>protein,</b> <b>fibre,</b> and calcium and are very filling, making them a popular choice for health-focused consumers. With the increase in demand, new crops have to be planted and the environment soy beans generally need to grow is warm and humid, making the tropics an ideal choice for new plantations. Unfortunately this is causing large portions of rainforest to be cut down for the productions of these crops, which has a severely negative net carbon effect. In the past 15 years, soy food sales have increased from $1 billion to $5.2 billion, meaning the amount of product being purchased is growing substantially. It should be noted that 97% of the soybeans produced are used for animal feed according to the UN, so the increase in popularity due to consumerism of soy-based products isn't the main cause of the increase in crops and destruction of forests.|$|E

40|$|Politicians and {{planners}} in Europe and America in the 1930 s and 1940 s {{were increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military requirements and actively encouraged research into substitute fibres. Innovation energised by the needs of war informed the development of processes to transform proteins normally used for food (milk, soya, corn, and fish) or perceived as waste (egg whites, chicken feathers and slaughter-house products) into fibres. This paper explores both innovative technology and conceptual models of innovation as applied to substitute fibres which were intended to result in both technical and cultural shifts. Substitute innovation was used to modify existing technology used to produce regenerated cellulosic fibres was modified to make regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres.</b> Moderately successful in the unusual economic conditions of war and marketed as modernistic, patriotic and utopian <b>fibres,</b> regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres</b> lost their price advantage to competing petrochemical fibres. Their physical disadvantages outweighed their benefits and they rapidly faded from popular memory and are only scantily represented in museum collections. The brief trajectory of these fibres prompted a revision of the traditional conceptualisation of innovation as developed by Usher and Schumpeter. Innovation is influenced by producers’ technological and tacit knowledge and skills and public policies. A new model of substitute innovation is proposed here to aid understanding of attitudes to the acceptability of new fibres which is relevant for the development, marketing and popular acceptance of today’s regenerated <b>protein</b> <b>fibres.</b> This paper will be illustrated with case studies of American and English fibres including Aralac, made from milk, Henry Ford’s soyabean fibre, Ardil made from peanuts and today’s milk and soyabean fibres, promoted as innovative, environmentally sensitive and health-giving...|$|R

The nitrogen-fixing plant also acts as green fertilizer and has potential to increase crop yields either directly by increasing soil fertility or indirectly through application of higher quality manure from animals on farm land which eat the legumes. [...] It can be applied in several ways: in pastures, fodder banks, and on fallow land to replace previously existing plant species, as well as amongst fruit trees or intercropped in rows with cereal crops. [...] These are good methods of no-till agriculture, which has proven in many instances to contribute to better and more sustainable farming.

The daily diet consumed by the subjects before supplementation was inadequate in food like pulses green leafy vegetables other vegetables and fruits having protective role for diabetes whereas consumption of foods like cereals roots and tubers and fat leading to increased risk was higher as compared with the suggested intake. However after supplementation {{a significant increase in the}} intake of protective foods and decrease in the intake of cereals, roots and tubers and fat was observed. The mean daily intake of energy, carbohydrates,fat, ascorbic acid, calcium and phosphorus was higher while of <b>protein,</b> <b>fibre</b> and zinc was below the recommendations.
