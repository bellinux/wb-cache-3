5|$|The king sent St-Calais on {{diplomatic}} {{missions to}} the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was {{also concerned about}} the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal <b>permission</b> <b>was</b> <b>secured.</b> To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was {{the driving force behind the}} organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the Little Domesday Book, a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This <b>permission</b> <b>was</b> <b>secured</b> by the {{intervention}} of the king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the Study The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if secondary level educable mentally retarded students had an awareness of skills developed in the Pre-Vocational Training Program and the skills needed for job placement and employment continuation. Subjects The subjects used in this study consisted of fifty-five Pre-Vocational Training students. They consisted of twenty-two females and twenty-three males. Their chronological ages ranged from 14 - 19. All had been enrolled in the Pre-Vocational Training Program from one to four years. Research Procedures The research procedure employed in this study was as follows: 1. <b>Permission</b> <b>was</b> <b>secured</b> from officials at the selected urban school to conduct the study. 2. Interviews were held with students to assure participation in the research project. 3. The fifty-five subjects were selected as part of the study on the basis of placement and schedule with a selected pre-vocational teacher. 4. <b>Permission</b> <b>was</b> <b>secured</b> from parents for students 2 ̆ 7 participation in the study. 5. The questionnaire was formulated and field tested on prep vocational training students not a part of the study and remedial reading students whose reading level approximate that of the pre-vocational training students in the study. Analysis of Study The data was presented using percentages on each item of the questionnaire to determine if pre-vocational training students were aware of occupational survival skills and skills needed for job placement and employment continuation.

40|$|Construction of {{a visitor}} centre in Kinghorn run by Mike Raynolds. Autonomous house – Earthship – {{made out of}} car tires, rammed earth and {{recycled}} materials, construction of a green roof. “What is an Earthship?” Just as a ship setting off on a long voyage must provide for all the needs of its crew, so an Earthship provides for the basic needs of shelter, water and electricity through its design and systems. An Earthship is a passive solar building with thermal mass. This means that it maintains a comfortable living temperature year round. It is made from natural and recycled materials – predominantly earth-rammed tyres and aluminium cans. It is powered by renewable energy, such as wind, water and solar power. It catches its own water supply from rainwater, and treats and contains its own sewage in planter beds. Earthships are a concept, not a set design. They can be adapted for any climate worldwide. Earthships offer people the opportunity {{to build their own}} homes and make a conscious decision to live lightly on the earth. Both the functionality and the aesthetics of the Earthship have been adapted for Scotland in the Earthship Fife project. “Where did they come from?” Earthships were first developed in South Western USA in the 1970 s. Since then they have evolved tremendously and now exist in virtually every climate. There are over 2, 000 Earthships and they are spreading fast! For Earthship Biotecture in New Mexico, please visit Earthship Biotecture “Where did Earthship Fife come from?” Earthship Fife was brought to Scotland by Paula Cowie, the founder of SCI. Paula visited Taos, New Mexico, in 1999 and “accidentally” stumbled upon one of the Earthship communities. They soon became the subject of her Masters dissertation at Stirling University and, not content to look at only the theory, she set up the organisation to fundraise for the first UK Earthship. In 2002 the funds were in place, planning <b>permission</b> <b>was</b> <b>secure,</b> and Michael Reynolds and a team of experienced Earthship builders arrived to deliver the training course that started the building. During the 2 year building period over 225 volunteers enjoyed some aspect of creating Earthship Fife...|$|R

At the same time, a substantial body of pertinent evidence has been rapidly accumulating in the form of biogeographic inquiries of diverse aquatic organisms that are based on detailed examination of the fossil record, phylogenetic analysis, phylogeography, and other modern analytical tools.

Due to the {{difficulty}} of receiving abortions - even if the abortion does fall under one of the exceptions to the law, judicial <b>permission</b> needs to <b>be</b> <b>secured,</b> which can take a very long time - many pregnant women end up having unsafe, clandestine abortions instead. According to the Bolivian Ministry of Health, almost all of the 67,000 abortions performed in Bolivia in 2011 were clandestine, with approximately half of the women who received them needing hospital care afterwards.

Geological Survey’s surface- and ground-water data-collection networks in each State, Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territories. These records of streamflow, stage, lake levels, ground-water levels, and water quality provide the hydrologic information needed by State, local, and Federal agencies and the private sector for developing and managing our Nation’s land and water resources. This report is the culmination of a concerted effort by dedicated personnel of the U. S. Geological Survey who collected, compiled, analyzed, verified, and organized the data, and who typed, edited, and assembled the report.
