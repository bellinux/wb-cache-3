5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 7, 1988 {{with a budget}} of $15 million. Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; {{a total of three}} cameras were used during the shoot. On March 8, the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers a monologue to Ward (Dafoe). On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cropping {{systems in}} the future will need to {{increase}} grain yield while reducing greenhouse gas emission per unit of production. Based on the investigation data of the farmer’s production, applying carbon cost model, we conducted the carbon cost of rice on state-operated farm(13 <b>production</b> <b>teams)</b> in Northeast China Plain. The results were as follows: the carbon cost of rice on Shuanghe Farm was 221. 62 ± 26. 32 gCO 2 e kg- 1, in which irrigation accounted for 40. 68 %, chemical fertilizer accounted for 24. 55 %, mechanical operation accounted for 24. 35 %, seed accounted for 9. 21 %, and pesticides accounted for 1. 20 %, respectively. The carbon cost of rice in different <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> were significantly different(P＜ 0. 01), and 20 th <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> was the highest (249. 56 ± 26. 68 gCO 2 e kg- 1) while 10 th team was the lowest (190. 87 ± 17. 09 gCO 2 e kg- 1). The differences of the carbon cost of rice among <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> almost was resulted from irrigation, and it had the potentiality of emission reduction in the <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> with higher carbon cost...|$|R

5|$|The <b>production</b> <b>team</b> {{also had}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} scenes in the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the purpose that the audience would not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism.|$|E

5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> {{became aware}} of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The <b>production</b> <b>team</b> agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E

5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> as they help make the first impression on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the <b>production</b> <b>team,</b> with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the reform}} of the {{household}} responsibility system in Yongjia appeared to end in failure, the household responsibility system did not in fact die out in Yongjia and other places in Wenzhou. Many rural areas of Wenzhou, especially mountainous or semi-mountainous villages, merely followed agricultural collectivization policies {{on the surface and}} secretly adopted the household responsibility system. This practice became more apparent after the Cultural Revolution. In 1968, 5432 <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> embraced the household responsibility system reform in Yongjia, accounting for 77.32  % of the county’s total <b>production</b> <b>teams.</b> In 1976, the number exceeded 6000, accounting for more than 80  % of the total <b>production</b> <b>teams</b> (Codification Committee of Local History of Yongjia County 2003, 465 – 66).|$|R

During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were responsible for the death, the <b>production</b> <b>team</b> did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident.
