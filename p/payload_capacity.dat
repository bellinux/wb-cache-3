5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its <b>payload</b> <b>capacity.</b> One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} was cancelled {{on economic}} grounds, as the Ministry of Defence {{decided that it}} would be cheaper to use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar <b>payload</b> <b>capacity,</b> for future launches. Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow, NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free; however, this offer was withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow.|$|E
5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets. It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, {{and to be able to}} dock with space stations, in support of Apollo Applications and MOL missions. It would have been launched by a Heavy lift launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar <b>payload</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the <b>payload</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and <b>payload</b> <b>capacity.</b> Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities.

50|$|Advances in US {{nuclear weapon}} {{technology}} {{had led to}} smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller <b>payload</b> <b>capacities.</b> By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.|$|R
40|$|High altitude, {{suborbital}} research payloads {{are typically}} restricted to small packages (in {{terms of both}} volume and mass) due to the delivery platform employed.

25|$|While {{the system}} was {{developed}} within the original cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, <b>payload</b> <b>capacity,</b> and reliability {{by the time of}} the February 2003 Columbia accident proved to be much worse than originally anticipated. A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending on the Shuttle for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and the fragility of the Shuttle's thermal protection system.|$|E

40|$|Cable-actuated {{parallel}} manipulators combine {{benefits of}} large workspaces, significant <b>payload</b> <b>capacities</b> and high stiffness {{by virtue of}} the cable actuation. However, redundant/surplus cables are required to overcome the unidirectional nature of forces exertable by cables. This leads to actuation redundancy which needs to be resolved in order to realize some of the benefits. We study the implication of using actuation redundancy to tailor the workspace (task space) stiffness of the cable robot system. Suitable trajectory tracking control schemes are developed that additionally achieve secondary goal of active stiffness control to improve disturbance rejection, under positive control input constraint We demonstrate the performance of these control schemes using a point-mass cable robot system modeled within a virtual prototyping (VP) implementation framework. ...|$|R

25|$|Initially, the India-China airlift {{was flown}} with the Douglas DC-3 and its {{military}} versions, the C-47, C-53 and C-39. However, the DC-3 design's fuselage {{was so high}} off the ground that loading from most truck beds was difficult, and its narrow door and weak floor could not sustain heavy cargo. Although C-47s had reinforced flooring and a wider door, they still required specialized loading equipment {{for much of the}} cargo needed in China and had a limited <b>payload</b> <b>capacity.</b> Also, performance specifications of the Douglas transports were not suited to high-altitude operation with heavy payloads, and could not normally reach an altitude sufficient to clear the mountainous terrain, forcing the planes to attempt a highly dangerous route through the maze-like Himalayan passes.|$|E
25|$|In September 1962, NASA {{planned to}} make four manned low-Earth-orbital test flights of {{partially}} equipped Block I Command/Service Modules (CSM) using the Saturn I launch vehicle, designated SA-11 through SA-14, in 1965 and 1966. However, the limited <b>payload</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Saturn I {{compared to the}} uprated Saturn IB would have severely limited the systems carried, and thus the testing value of these flights. Therefore, NASA canceled these flights in October 1963, {{and replaced them with}} two manned Saturn IB missions, designated AS-204 and AS-205. These would be followed by the first unmanned flight of the Lunar Module (LM) on AS-206, then the third manned mission, designated AS-207/208, would use AS-207 to launch the crew in an improved Block II CSM, which would rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.|$|E

50|$|Haul {{trucks are}} used in large surface mines and quarries. They have a rigid frame and {{conventional}} steering with drive at the rear wheel. As of late 2013, the largest ever production haul truck is the 450 metric ton BelAZ 75710, followed by the Liebherr T 282B, the Bucyrus MT6300AC and the Caterpillar 797F, which each have <b>payload</b> <b>capacities</b> of up to 400 ST. Most large size haul trucks employ Diesel-electric powertrains, using the Diesel engine to drive an AC alternator or DC generator that sends electric power to electric motors at each rear wheel. The Caterpillar 797 is unique for its size, as it employs a Diesel engine to power a mechanical powertrain, typical of most road going vehicles and intermediary size haul trucks. Other major manufacturers of haul trucks include Hitachi, Komatsu, DAC, Terex and BelAZ.|$|R
