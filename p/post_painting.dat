Today the term GI typically refers to essentially pure zinc (>99%) continuously hot dip coated steel, as opposed to batch dip processes. PPGI refers to factory pre-painted zinc coated steel, where the steel is painted before forming, as opposed to <b>post</b> <b>painting</b> which occurs after forming.|$|E

40|$|TVS Motor Company is {{the third}} largest {{manufacturer}} of two-wheelers in India {{and one of the}} top ten manufacturers in the world. The company manufactures 1. 5 million two-wheelers for both its domestic and overseas requirements. The company's manufacturing process involves painting of plastic, metal and aluminium components to enhance their appearance and performance properties. The company currently uses a conventional <b>post</b> <b>painting</b> process for its moulded plastic panels. However the conventional <b>post</b> <b>painting</b> process causes a huge impact on the environment through flue gas emissions from baking ovens, solvent emission from paint booths and ovens, sludge generation from paint booths and wastewater generation from paint booths and pretreatment processes. The volumes of waste and cost for part attached to the painting process for TVS Motor Company are detailed in this paper Paint shop replacement technologies in relation to current in-mould decoration technologies such as pigmented plastics, in-mould film, co-injection moulding and in-mould spray painting (INSPIRE) are considered. Based on current specifications and requirements for painted plastic components, INSPIRE is found to be the most advantageous paint shop replacement technology for current TVS Motor Company Ltd production as it uses a thermoset, matching current specifications. A design of experiments is performed using a polyester skin and ABS substrate to optimise part coverage for a sample part. Using statistical analysis spray time and spray pressure are found {{to be the most important}} process parameters for paint coverage. Paint coverage could be greatly improved compared to that which has been previously reported...|$|E

40|$|RIM {{encapsulated}} modular {{windows are}} now being used on several vehicles and growth in their use can be predicted. Advantages in glass handling, inven-tory control, assembly and appearance propell this growth. One disadvantage that retards this growth, however, is the old problem of weatherability of urethanes, {{even if they are}} pigmented. This has necessitated the use of either an in-mold-coating or a post paint as a protective coating for the urethane, adding to the cost of the process. This paper describes a new class of stabilized RIM polyurethanes, designed to meet the automotive specifications for exterior use without a protective coating, particularly for use in encapsulation of glass for modular windows. The results of both accelerated and actual outdoor weathering on appearance and physical properties are detailed and a comparison of the use of these new weatherable urethanes over protective coating, either by in-mold-coating or <b>post</b> <b>painting</b> is discussed...|$|E

50|$|Coil coating is the {{continuous}} and highly automated industrial process for efficiently coating coils of metal. Because the metal is treated {{before it is}} cut and formed, the entire surface is cleaned and treated, providing tightly-bonded finishes.

Coil coated metal (often called prepainted metal) is often considered more durable and more corrosion-resistant than most <b>post</b> <b>painted</b> metal.|$|R

50|$|According to village records, <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> was {{established}} as a village in 1803. The Erwin brothers are considered the first wealthy European descended settlers to have settled in the <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> area in the late 18th century (<b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> village is {{in the town of}} Erwin, named for the brothers and incorporated in 1796). The brothers' 4 mansions are still standing. There are maps in existence dated 1796 which include <b>Painted</b> <b>Post.</b> The village was first incorporated in 1860 and officially re-incorporated in 1893. The name is derived from an historic, although probably unpainted, wooden post seen in the area {{at the end of the}} 18th century. The origin and purpose of the post remain controversial. A glyph of the post is visible on the aforementioned 1796 map.|$|R

25|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the rail underpass, NY415 changes names to East High Street. This moniker follows the route into the town of Erwin and its village of <b>Painted</b> <b>Post,</b> where the route gains a pair of wide shoulders and begins to traverse areas slightly more residential in nature. In the center of the village, NY415 serves a cluster of businesses and intersects North Hamilton Street, designated as NY417 west of this point. To the northeast, North Hamilton Street connects to CR41. Past NY417, NY415 serves the predominantly residential neighborhoods that comprise western <b>Painted</b> <b>Post.</b> Just one block from North Hamilton Street, NY415 changes names to Coopers–Bath Road at a junction with Steuben Street.

2500|$|Construction began [...] on a bypass of NY17 and US15 in the {{vicinity}} of Corning (modern exit45) and <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> (exit43). The entirety of the highway, plus an extension northwest to Campbell (exit41), was completed between 1964 and 1968. US15 and NY17 were rerouted to follow the new highway, and their former routings between Campbell and Corning were redesignated as NY415. The portion of the US15/ NY17 freeway between Campbell and Avoca (exit36) was completed by 1973. On July 1, 1974, US15 was truncated to its current northern terminus in <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> and replaced with NY15 from <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> to Rochester.|$|R

25|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. One route assigned at this time was NY4, a highway extending from the Pennsylvania state line in Lindley to downtown Rochester. NY4 roughly followed the modern alignment of US15 from Pennsylvania to Presho, Indian Hill Road from Presho to Erwin, NY417 from Erwin to Gang Mills, and Hamilton Street from Gang Mills to <b>Painted</b> <b>Post.</b> From <b>Painted</b> <b>Post</b> northward, NY4 was routed along modern NY415 to Wayland, from where it continued to Rochester on what is now NY15. At the state line, NY4 connected to Pennsylvania Route4 (PA4). In 1927, US4 was first signed in New York. As a result, NY4 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway.|$|R
