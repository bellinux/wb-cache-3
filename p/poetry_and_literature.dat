25|$|The book {{is written}} in a style that {{differed}} from the prevailing writing technique {{and structure of the}} scholar gentry of the time. The scholar gentry under the Confucian education system fostered by the classical imperial examinations were molded by their study and memorization of classical Chinese <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> As such, the literary style tended to be poetic, indirect and metaphorical, relying on allusions and imagery to depict an idea. Phan eschewed this traditional style to write in a direct, ordinary prose style, especially in his analytical and argumentative sections. The book precipitated a new style of writing among scholar gentry revolutionaries, who later tended to use a more direct style.|$|E
25|$|The {{four-year}} {{program of}} study, {{nearly all of}} which is mandatory, demands that students read and discuss the works of many of Western civilization's most prominent contributors to philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, music, <b>poetry,</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> Tutorials (mathematics, language, and music), as well as seminar and laboratory, are discussion-based.

In the language tutorial student translations are presented (ancient Greek is studied {{in the first two years}} and French for the last two). The tutorials, with seminar and laboratory, constitute the classes. All classes, and in particular the seminar, are considered formal exercises; consequently, students address one another, as well as their teachers, by their honorific and last name during class.|$|E

500|$|In criticism, Johnson had {{a lasting}} influence, {{although}} not everyone viewed him favourably. Some, like Macaulay, regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works, and others, like the Romantic poets, were completely opposed to Johnson's views on <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature,</b> {{especially with regard}} to Milton. However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: Stendhal's Racine et Shakespeare is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare, and Johnson influenced Jane Austen's writing style and philosophy. Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and Matthew Arnold, in his Six Chief Lives from Johnson's [...] "Lives of the Poets", considered the Lives of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift, and Gray as [...] "points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always find our way again".|$|E

500|$|The {{visual arts}} during the Song dynasty were {{heightened}} by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite {{engaged in the}} arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. <b>Poetry</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> profited from the rising popularity {{and development of the}} ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as [...] "treatise on a place", or fangzhi, replaced the old [...] "map guide", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.|$|E
500|$|In France, Anne was a maid of honour to Queen Mary, {{and then}} to Mary's 15-year-old {{stepdaughter}} Queen Claude, with whom she stayed nearly seven years. In the Queen's household, she completed her study of French and developed interests in art, fashion, illuminated manuscripts, literature, music, poetry, and religious philosophy. She also acquired knowledge of French culture, dance, etiquette, literature, music, and poetry and came to gain experience in flirtation and the game of courtly love. Though all knowledge about Anne's experiences in the French court are conjecture, even Eric Ives, in his latest edition of the biography, conjectures that she was likely to have made the acquaintance of King Francis I's sister, Marguerite de Navarre, a patron of humanists and reformers. Marguerite de Navarre was also an author in her own right, and her works include elements of Christian mysticism and reform that verged on heresy, though she was protected by her status as the French king's beloved sister. She or her circle may have encouraged Anne's interest in reform, {{as well as in}} <b>poetry</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> Anne's education in France proved itself in later years, inspiring many new trends among the ladies and courtiers of England, and it may have been instrumental in pressing their King toward the culture-shattering contretemps with the Papacy itself. Eric Ives's latest version of his biography hypothesises that Anne may have had evangelistic conviction and a strong spiritual inner life. William Forrest, author of a contemporary poem about Catherine of Aragon, complimented Anne's [...] "passing excellent" [...] skill as a dancer. [...] "Here", he wrote, [...] "was [...] fresh young damsel, that could trip and go." ...|$|E
