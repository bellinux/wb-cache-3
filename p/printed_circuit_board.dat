5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

40|$|The <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> {{basis of}} {{electronic}} equipment {{have seen a}} rapid growth {{in recent years and}} {{played a significant role in}} modern life. Nowadays, the fact that electronic devices upgrade quickly necessitates a proper management of waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> Non-destructive desoldering of waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> becomes the first and the most crucial step towards recycling electronic components. Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> To cope with this problem, we proposed an innovative approach integrating Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) evolution theory and technology maturity mapping system to forecast the evolution trends of desoldering technology of waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> This approach can be applied to analyse the technology evolution, as well as desoldering technology evolution, then research and development strategy and evolution laws can be recommended. As an example, the maturity of desoldering technology is analysed with a technology maturity mapping system model. What is more, desoldering methods in different stages are analysed and compared. According to the analysis, the technological evolution trends are predicted to be 'the law of energy conductivity' and 'increasing the degree of idealisation'. And the potential technology and evolutionary state of waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> are predicted, offering reference for future waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> recycling...|$|R

The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards,</b> which were plugged into the backplane.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of solderability testing of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare different atmospheres for solderability testing with different finishes of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> (PCB’s). The article contains method descriptions that were used for solderability testing of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The method of wetting balance test was chosen for this experiment. The PCB can be made with several kinds of surface finishing. Copper is the most commonly used material in the manufacture of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The negative copper property is its low chemical stability. When a contact is in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, the surface is covered with a layer of copper oxides. This layer deteriorates copper solderability. Another way how to prevent oxidation of copper soldering pads of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> is an inert atmosphere. As an inert atmosphere does not contain oxygen and prevents oxidation of the material used on PCB’s. The increasingly frequent introduction of inert atmospheres into soldering processes encourages the introduction of a inert atmosphere also in solderability testing processes...|$|R
