The International Classification of Functioning, disabilities and health (ICF) was used to classify dimensions of functional outcome.

The current state of knowledge on the functional outcome after burns was hard to summarise, due to the wide variety in study designs and outcome assessment methods. Some indications on the major functional problems after burns were gained. Problems in mental function were described in subgroups of patients, both in children/adolescents and adults. Restrictions in range of motion were observed in about one-fifth of burn patients, even 5 years after injury. Problems with appearance were reported often (up to 43 %), even in patients with minor burns (14 %). Problems with work were reported in 21 - 50 % of the adult patients, with <b>permanent</b> <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in 1 - 5 %. None of the publications gave sufficient information to fully estimate the functional consequences of burns.

40|$|Background: The {{aim of the}} {{analysis}} {{was to determine the}} magnitude and causes of the sickness-related temporary incapacity for work in Poland, and to identify changes in sickness absence and its differences by the type of economic activity and region. Material and Methods: This analysis is based on the 2006 - 2012 data on sickness absence compiled from medical certificates of temporary incapacity for work and published by the Social Insurance Institution (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych). The sickness absence is described {{in terms of the number}} of sick leave days relative to the number of the employed or insured people. Results: In 2012, the number of days of disability per one employed was 14. 5 (12. 1 men, 17. 4 women), representing 3. 98 % of the time lost due to illness. The main causes of absence were: complications of pregnancy and mother's diseases during pregnancy (33 % of the sick leave days in women), injury and poisoning (men: 24 %; women: 8 %), diseases of the musculoskeletal system (men: 17 %; woman: 11 %). The highest level of sickness absence was noted in the łódzkie, śląskie and warmińsko-mazurskie provinces (38 - 19 % higher than nationwide) and in the administrative and support sectors (22. 2 days per 1 employee), when analyzed by sectors of the national economy. Conclusions: The high increase in sickness absence over the recent 7 years due to cancer, mental and muscloskeletal disorders may be an important risk factor for early assessment of <b>permanent</b> <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> Another major problem is female sickness absence due to pregnancy complications and mother's diseases during pregnancy.

40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{revealing}} the tendency of the "constitutionalisation" of the Insurance Law and the exceptional protection of the Constitutional Court to the so-called "Subjects of Constitutional Protection". That issue {{can be observed in}} the way an insured or loss payee of a Life Group policy in a "defenselessness situation" by means of a writ for protection of constitutional rights demands the payment of the death benefits or the total and <b>permanent</b> <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> without meeting the contractual and legal requirements to access to the mentioned coverages. The stance of Constitutional Court, taking into account that the substancial law prevails over procedural law, is based on on the principles of solidarity, immediacy and subsidiarity when someone invokes the basic rights for life, minimum wage, decent housing, equality, social security among others. It is worth mentioning that such constitutional writ has been appeared on cases in which the insurance companies have refused to pay the compensation due to a reticent insured, a preexistence illness or when, over time, the insured or beneficiary of the policy loses the possibility of the chose in action due to have started the statute of limitations under the Colombian Law for insurances contract. Este artículo tiene como objeto dar a conocer la tendencia a la “constitucionalización” del Derecho de Seguros y la protección excepcional de la Corte Constitucional a los denominados “Sujetos de Protección Constitucional”.  Lo anterior se representa en la manera en que un asegurado o beneficiario de una Póliza Vida Grupo en “estado de indefensión” mediante  una acción de tutela solicita hacer efectivos los amparos de muerte o incapacidad total y permanente sin cumplir con los requisitos contractuales y legales para acceder a dichas coberturas. La posición de la Corte Constitucional, teniendo en cuenta que prevalece el derecho sustancial sobre el procesal, se basa en los principios de solidaridad, inmediatez y subsidiaridad, cuando se invoca la protección de los derechos fundamentales a la vida, mínimo vital, vivienda digna, igualdad, seguridad social entre otros.  Se resalta que dicha tutela constitucional, se ha presentado en casos en los cuales las Compañías Aseguradoras han negado el pago de la Indemnización bajo el argumento de haber sido el asegurado reticente por tratarse de una enfermedad preexistente o cuando, por el transcurso del tiempo, el asegurado o beneficiario de la póliza pierde la posibilidad de ejercer el derecho de acción por haber operado el término de prescripción contemplado en la ley Colombiana para el Contrato de Seguros...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the trends of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in the Czech Republic since 1990. These trends {{are related to the}} {{legislative}} and socioeconomic changes, which are the results of transformation of socialist society towards capitalist society. In this thesis, there are followed three main indicators of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The number of cases of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> per 100 sickness insured persons, which has dropped since the beginning 1990; the number of calendar days of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> per 1 case, which has on the contrary increased and the average percentage of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> which has oscillated. The performed analyses have proved the crucial effect of sickness intensity (quantum) on changes of the values of mentioned indicators. The effect of intensity has explicitly outweighed the effect of age structure of population. Regression analysis has confirmed the hypothesis of causation of other factors, than only health factors, on the global level of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> With respect to obtained information and level of sickness intensity by age and social groups, there is an issue of possibility and manner of reduction of their level, which exceeds the European average.

40|$|Sickness {{insurance}} as part {{of social}} insurance is obligatory {{for a majority of}} Czech citizens – i. e., they are required by law to pay this insurance. On the other hand, they are entitled to certain benefits of this system in the case of social events determined by law. Legislative changes in sickness insurance significantly influenced the development of all indicators of temporary <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> (TIW) in individual regions. These changes are reflected most markedly in the indicators of the number of new cases of TIW per 100 insured persons, the average duration of 1 case of TIW and the average percentage of TIW.

This fourth edition of the Trend Report looks at key trends in sickness absenteeism, <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and labour {{participation of}} persons with health impairments. As well as describing these trends, this report focuses on two themes: the role of employers and how people with a work-limiting disability or illness fare in the workplace. What considerations do employers apply when recruiting or dismissing employees, and what role does health play in that process? What actions do they take to promote the health of their employees? The report also focuses on employees with illnesses or disabilities. How do they fare on the labour market? Do they have the same opportunities at work as healthy colleagues?

It compares the two regimes and concludes that although problems arise with both incapacity benefits and ESA, problems with ESA are greater. The ESA scheme and ongoing reforms appear to have <b>worked</b> well <b>for</b> people who are at the most severe end of the spectrum of mental illness, since they receive more money and are relieved of conditionality. For claimants with lesser mental health problems the situation has worsened. The thesis makes a number of recommendations for change. It suggests that mental health teams should include welfare benefits advisers, recommends better training in mental health issues for DWP staff, and improved communication between the DWP and claimants, in particular lesser reliance on telephony. Consideration should also be given to removal of national insurance contribution conditions <b>for</b> <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> benefits, and replacement by a universal benefit. The thesis points out that assessment of incapacity is the most significant obstacle to entitlement and suggests a return to the informal procedure used pre- 1995, as well as payment for partial capacity. It also recommends voluntary, rather than mandatory participation in work-related activity by claimants with mental health problems, and questions whether it is appropriate to use the welfare system to coerce claimants, particularly those with mental health problems, into employment.

SETTING: Nine practices comprising the Mersey Primary Care R&D Consortium. DESIGN: Prospective data collection and audit of sickness certificate details. METHOD: GPs issued carbonised sickness certificates for a period of 12 months. The resulting baseline dataset included claimant diagnosis, age, sex, postcode-derived deprivation score, and sickness episode duration. Associations of patient factors with sickness duration outcomes were tested. RESULTS: Mild mental disorder accounted for nearly 40 % of certified sickness. Relatively few claimants had their diagnosis changed during a sickness episode. Risk factors <b>for</b> longer-term <b>incapacity</b> included increasing age, social deprivation, mild and severe mental disorder, neoplasm, and congenital illness. For mild mental disorder claimants, age, addiction, and deprivation were risk factors <b>for</b> relatively longer <b>incapacity.</b> <b>For</b> musculoskeletal problems, the development of chronic incapacity was significantly related {{to the nature of the}} problem. Back pain claimants were likely to return to work sooner than those with other musculoskeletal problems.

STUDY DESIGN: From April 1998 to August 1998, 140 patients (83 men and 57 women) with an average age of 43. 8 years (range 19 to 83 years) underwent hemorrhoidectomy using a circular stapler. Oper-ative times, peri- and postoperative complications, mean hospital stay, assessment of the post-operative pain, period of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> and functional results were collected. All patients were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 18 months after operation. RESULTS: The average length of the operation was 18 minutes (range 8 to 60 minutes).

40|$|In Finland, {{the pension}} {{provision}} consists mainly of the employment-based earnings-related pension and the residence-based national pension, {{which provides a}} minimum income. The schemes secure subsistence in old age, {{in the event of}} <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> death of the family breadwinner or the ageing person becoming unemployed. Almost all gainful employment is covered by pension provision. Private-sector employees, self-employed persons, farmers, seamen and public-sector employees have their own pension acts. Earnings-related pensions are financed jointly by employers and employees. National pensions are financed solely through employer contributions and tax revenues. The handbook offers basic information on the Finnish pension scheme: its history, benefits, financing, administration and supervision, as well as future prospects. The book also contains information on supplementary pensions and pension taxation...|$|R
30|$|The {{benchmark}} {{figure for}} the calculation of sick leave is the monthly sick leave ratio, which is measured in % of compulsory members of the state health insurance scheme with continued payment of wages of at least six weeks. 8 The sick leave ratio is an official recording by the Statutory Health Insurance Statistics of the Federal Ministry of Health based on reporting dates. It comprises employees that reported unfit <b>for</b> <b>work</b> at the first of each month. The periods of short-term <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> lasting up to three days, which are under-recorded in this series, are possibly offset by non-compulsorily insured persons (employees {{not covered by the}} agreed pay scale, civil servants, and marginal part-time employees) with their typically lower levels of lost working hours. Cases in which people resume work while still certified unfit <b>for</b> <b>work</b> by a physician have a similar effect.|$|R
40|$|Social {{consequences}} of a disease constitute limitations in performing roles relating to working {{life as well as}} family and social life caused by the disease, mainly chronic. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the social {{consequences of}} rheumatic diseases in the aspect of disability pensions with respect to <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and quality of life. The occurrence of rheumatic diseases is related not only to increased risk of different types of organic changes, but above all disability. In Europe almost 50 % of persons suffering from diseases of the musculoskeletal system who are currently unemployed were breadwinners. Nearly 60 % of them received legal disability status. The loss of work ability is, among other things, the consequence of progressive disability. In Europe 40 % of persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had to stop working due to the disease. Most of the persons diagnosed with RA were of working age. It results in the decrease in the quality of life as well as economic difficulties (decreased incomes and increased disease-related costs). In Poland the results of the analysis of the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) of first-time disability recognition issued for the purpose of disability pensions in 2014 showed that the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> was caused by diseases relating to general health condition (65. 5 %). Diseases of the musculoskeletal system were the cause of partial inability to work of 21. 6 % of persons who received a disability pension for the first time (as many as 5, 349 certificates were issued). Early diagnosis and implementation of effective treatment are the necessary conditions for a patient to sustain activity, both professional and social, which is of crucial importance to reduce the negative effects of the disease...|$|R
