These function classes in turn provide new characterizations of the computational power of threshold circuits, {{and provide a}} link between the circuit classes AC 0 (where many lower bounds are known) and TC 0 (where essentially no lower bounds are known). In this paper, we resolve several questions regarding the closure properties of #AC 0 and GapAC 0.

In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps.
