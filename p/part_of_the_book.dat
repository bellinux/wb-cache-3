5|$|A Sweet Talk {{production}} of Pure was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> at Bedtime programme from 20–31 August 2012; it was read by John Sessions, abridged by Jeremy Osborne and produced by Rosalynd Ward.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{consists}} of six chapters, with a chapter covering {{each of the}} five days (Wednesday, March 28, 1979, to Sunday, April 1, 1979) of the crisis stage of the accident and another chapter covering its immediate effects. Walker draws {{on a wide range of}} sources, but mainly on the report of the Kemeny Commission, which President Carter appointed immediately after the accident, and the Rogovin Report, which resulted from the NRC's own inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> the Natural History, is {{presented}} as a compilation of 44 letters nominally to Thomas Pennant, a leading British zoologist of the day, and 66 letters to Daines Barrington, an English barrister and Fellow of the Royal Society. In these letters, White details the natural history of the area around his family home at the vicarage of Selborne in Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library {{publications}} such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) {{attracted the attention of}} reviewers in major newspapers. Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham speaks of the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Wallace {{published}} a book entitled The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures about developments in the 19th century. The first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, {{the rise of the}} urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism. Wallace continued his social activism {{for the rest of his}} life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus {{with his parents}} Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, {{and the birth of}} their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to destroy their civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which wipes out many of the D'ni and follows them through the Ages. Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two of them would have been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E

5|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement {{and its potential}} for the greater democratization of society. This {{is followed by the}} text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.|$|E
5|$|The first {{character}} {{introduced to}} the reader is a girl named Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts {{to escape from the}} totalitarian world of school and society. She rides the buses at night and has brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{presents}} {{evidence that}} globalization {{is creating a}} new class divide: those {{who are able to}} move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

5|$|On {{weekends}} C-SPAN2 dedicates its {{schedule to}} Book TV, which is 48 hours of programming about non-fiction books, book events, and authors. Book TV was first launched in September 1998. Booknotes was originally broadcast from 1989 to 2004, as a one-hour one-on-one interview of a non-fiction author. Repeats {{of the interviews}} remain a regular <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> TV schedule with the title Encore Booknotes. Other Book TV programs feature political and historical books and biographies of public figures. These include In Depth, a live, monthly, three-hour interview with a single author, and After Words, an author interview program featuring guest hosts interviewing authors on topics with which both are familiar. After Words was developed as {{a new type of}} author interview program after the end of production of Booknotes. Weekend programming on Book TV also includes coverage of book events such as panel discussions, book fairs, book signings, readings by authors and tours of bookstores around the U.S.|$|E
