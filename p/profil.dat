5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine <b>Profil</b> published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of the facts about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, he must have known they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{existence}} and the asymptotic stability of shock profiles associated to finite difference schemes. Assuming that the shock is stationnary, we look for steady solutions of the scheme. There are strong resemblances with traveling waves obtained {{by means of a}} parabolic approximation (the so-called viscous profiles). However, main differences occur when the shock is under-compressive, these being the counterpart {{of the differences between the}} dynamics of vector fields and the one of diffeomorphisms. The stability is investigated by means of an Evans function, in the spirit of the recent analysis of viscous profiles by R. Gardner & K. Zumbrun [2]. However, the results differ qualitatively. Abstract Nous 'etudions ici les <b>profils</b> discrets de chocs stationnaires, pour des sch'emas conservatifs aux diff'erences finies.
