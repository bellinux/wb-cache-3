5000|$|Bonus/Bonuses: Also {{known as}} the [...] "back-end". Typically, a <b>production</b> <b>bonus</b> is paid once the script goes into production, or, if {{there is more than}} one writer, after the final credit is determined. A typical {{contract}} will specify a smaller <b>production</b> <b>bonus</b> for shared credit. There may also be bonuses contingent upon budget (e.g., [...] "if the movie's budget is greater than x") or grosses. The cousin of the bonus is the [...] "penalty", which might be paid by the writer if, for example, the script has not been put into production by a set date; penalties are rarely included in writer's deals, however.|$|E

50|$|More than 75 {{years of}} labor {{peace in the}} glass {{industry}} ended in 1965. In March of that year, the GMPIU struck at 86 glass plants east of the Rocky Mountains. The strike lasted 11 days, and involved 32,000 workers. The union won a 15 percent wage increase over three years, establishment of an industry-wide health and life insurance plan, and pension portability for workers who are at least 40 years of age, have 15 years of service, and are laid off due to automation or permanent plant shutdown. A pact for West Coast workers achieved a 21.8 percent wage increase over three years. The agreement included a clause under which employers either offered a 10 percent <b>production</b> <b>bonus</b> plan or were forced to raise base wages another 20 percent.|$|E
5000|$|On February 11, 2008, Benedict Fitzgerald filed {{a lawsuit}} against Mel Gibson and the {{production}} company Icon Productions, alleging the unfair deprivation of compensation and deception on the overall expense of the film production budget after the blockbuster box office success of the film The Passion of the Christ, including but not limited to [...] "fraud, breach of contract & unjust enrichment" [...] seeking unspecified damages. According to his lawsuit, Fitzgerald says he [...] "accepted a salary substantially less than what he would have taken had he known the true budget for the film," [...] agreeing to an undisclosed [...] "relatively small salary," [...] a 75,000 dollar <b>production</b> <b>bonus,</b> another 75,000 dollars if the movie broke even, and then five percent of revenues. Fitzgerald received a loan of $200,000 from Gibson in December 2003 backed by his share of the film’s future profits as collateral.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, {{contract}} workers halted {{production at}} the El Salvador mine on 16 June 2007. The roads to the mine were blocked by striking contract workers and stopped company employees from reaching production areas, and union officials indicated {{that there would be}} blockades at Codelco's other mines. The contract workers were demanding the same <b>production</b> <b>bonuses,</b> health care, housing and education benefits that company employees received. An agreement was reached between Codelco and the union on 27 July 2007. Disruptions at the El Salvodor mine and other Codelco properties, coupled with production disruptions in Canada caused a 22% increase in the price of copper in 2007.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} an agency model using the payroll records of a copper mine that paid a <b>production</b> <b>bonus</b> to teams of workers. We estimate {{the cost of}} incomplete information due to insurance and incentives considerations and the inefficiency caused by the simple form of the incentive contract itself. At the estimated parameters the cost of worker risk aversion (insurance) is of similar magnitude to moral hazard (incentives). Overall, incomplete information accounted for one-half of the bonus system’s inefficiency relative to potential full information profits. The other half is attributed to the bonus system’s inefficient generation of incentives and insurance relative to the optimal incentive contract. 1...|$|E

40|$|We apply agency {{theory to}} the payroll records of a copper mine that paid a <b>production</b> <b>bonus</b> to teams of workers. As with most {{incentive}} pay used by firms, the bonus was simpler in form than the optimal contract that balances incentives, insurance, and free-riding. We explore whether transactions costs help explain this discrepancy. We estimate an agency {{model for the}} payroll data using the method of maximum likelihood and find that incentives and free-riding within teams accounted for two-thirds of the bonus system's inefficiency relative to potential full information profits. The remaining one-third of the inefficiency is attributed to {{the form of the}} incentive contract as constrained by transactions costs. We discuss alternative explanations and the general empirical content of agency theory. principal-agent models, transactions costs, performance pay, maximum likelihood estimation...|$|E

Exploration markers may contain events, which are resolved immediately and removed from the board; terrain, which are replaced face-up and provide <b>production</b> <b>bonuses</b> or penalties to players who build settlements there; resources, which are replaced face-down and permanently turned face-up if a player later builds a settlement there; or the lack of any special feature, which may be removed or replaced as a player sees fit. During the purchase phase, settlers may be converted into settlements for a price; any exploration markers that are face-down are resolved.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, players {{maintain}} {{a population of}} peasants, which rises and falls depending on {{the popularity of the}} player as a leader. Unpopular leaders can suffer riots, leading to extensive damage to structures and mass desertions by peasants. A player will gain peasants by capturing houses in quests or in PvP. At 74 happiness one's peasants will riot and at 90 one gains <b>production</b> <b>bonuses.</b> Any happiness above this is excess and should be used to tax the peasants. Normally, if your happiness is above 74 you gain 4 peasants a day.However, after the happiness system was patched in 2008, peasant happiness is no longer displayed as a numerical value. Happiness is gained by winning battles (PvP or quests), bribery and by having sufficient food and housing.Generally, having happiness in 'jubilant' is considered ideal.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the effects of}} incentives on industrial productivity in China’s food industry. Data covering the 1990 - 1996 period were collected from 30 food enterprises in Guangdong Province. The empirical results support the use of bonus schemes to motivate enterprises to achieve higher levels of productivity. Moreover, the study indicates an important variable affecting productivity: the proportion of temporary workers in the total labour force. It was found that flexibility in the use of temporary workers could produce a positive effect on enterprise productivity. This finding strongly supports the need for flexibility in employment policies. When compared to state-owned and collective-owned enterprises, their counterparts, e. g. foreign ventures and joint-stock enterprises, were relatively more efficient in <b>production.</b> <b>Bonuses,</b> China, Flexible labour, Industrial performance...|$|R
