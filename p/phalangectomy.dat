2500|$|Onychectomy, {{popularly known}} as declawing, is an {{operation}} to remove an animal's claws surgically {{by means of the}} amputation of {{all or part of the}} distal phalanges, or end bones, of the animal's toes. [...] Because the claw develops from germinal tissue within the third phalanx, amputation of the bone is necessary to fully remove the claw. The terms [...] "onychectomy" [...] (origin: Greek ὄνυξ onycho, nail + ἐκτομή ektome, excision) and [...] "declawing" [...] imply mere claw removal, but a more appropriate description would be <b>phalangectomy,</b> excision of toe bone.|$|E

Herein, we present a rare case of a 44 -year-old male patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus associated with the clinical symptoms of progressive dysphagia and hoarseness {{in the course of}} 2 days. During the second course of chemotherapy, the patient sustained a fall with scald to his right ring finger, while the swelling in the right ring finger was soft, cystic and 2. 0 × 1. 8 cm in size. Then, <b>phalangectomy</b> was performed in his right ring finger and pathologic diagnosis was considered metastasis from the esophagus. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to this disease within 2 months of diagnosis of metastasis. In conclusion, detection of soft tissue metastasis may have prognostic implications, providing more accessible biopsy sites and helping avoid invasive procedures.
