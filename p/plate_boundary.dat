5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean <b>plate</b> <b>boundary,</b> which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMost of the <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> are {{activated}} obliquely {{with respect}} to the direction of far field stresses, as roughly only 8 % of the <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> total length shows a very low obliquity (ranging from 0 to 10 °, sub-orthogonal to the plate displacement). The obliquity along <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> is controlled by (i) lateral rheological variations within the lithosphere and (ii) consistency with the global plate circuit. Indeed, plate tectonics and magmatism drive rheological changes within the lithosphere and consequently influence strain localization. Geodynamical evolution controls large-scale mantle convection and plate formation, consumption, and re-organization, thus triggering plate kinematics variations, and the adjustment and re-orientation of far field stresses. These geological processes may thus result in <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> that are not perpendicular but oblique to the direction of far field stresses. This paper reviews the global patterns of obliquity along <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Using GPlate, we provide a statistical analysis of present-day obliquity along <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Within this framework, by comparing natural examples and geological models, we discuss deformation patterns and kinematics recorded along oblique <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it {{undergoes}} a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The two main right–lateral strike-slip fault strands that extend across {{the southern part of the}} trough are the Elsinore Fault Zone/Laguna Salada Fault to the western side of the trough and the Imperial Fault to the east. The Imperial Fault is linked to the San Andreas Fault through the Brawley Seismic Zone, which is a spreading center beneath the southern end of the Salton Sea.|$|E
5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, {{and perhaps even}} its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly {{half the size of}} Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{four main}} Japanese islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido {{lie in a}} convex {{arrangement}} pointing to the Pacific Ocean, while the oceanic trenches that form the western boundary of the Pacific Plate are convex in the opposite direction, toward Eurasia. The continental crust above the subduction zones had previously {{been associated with the}} Eurasian Plate, but northern Honshu and Hokkaido have more recently been treated as part of the North American Plate, due to a poorly defined <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> between Eastern Siberia and Alaska and a newly forming boundary at the eastern perimeter of the Sea of Japan. This portion of the crust has been known locally as the Okhotsk Plate. The southwestern border of the plate is called the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. It is a region of faulting that traverses the width of central Honshu, but it has not generated any large earthquakes. Moving westward, though, the Atera, Miboro, Atotsugawa, and Nobi faults have all produced large events. Two of those events occurred beyond the terminus of the 1891 rupture: the 1945 Mikawa earthquake that hit near Nagoya on the Fukozu Fault and the 1948 Fukui earthquake that occurred near the Sea of Japan.|$|E

5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive <b>plate</b> <b>boundary)</b> by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 6.3 ML earthquake occurred inland on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST, (02:20 UTC) at {{a shallow}} depth of 6.0km (4mi), about 10km (6mi) to the east-southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Owing to {{the interaction of}} the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the rupture zone of another strong magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills Fault. The June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered fault in the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills Fault. The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a focal depth of 9km (5.6mi) for the earthquake, while the precursor tremor was assigned a magnitude of 5.2 Mw at a similar depth.|$|E

The convergence along this <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> is highly oblique, with the plate vector running at a low angle to the boundary. Most of the strike-slip component of the convergence is accommodated by the Great Sumatran fault, which passes northwards into the Andaman Sea spreading centre.

25|$|This {{relative}} {{weakness is}} important, {{because it would}} allow the relatively small east-west compressive forces associated with the continuing continental drift of the North American plate to reactivate old faults around New Madrid, making the area unusually prone to earthquakes in spite of it being far from the nearest tectonic <b>plate</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Increase in {{temperature}} {{is the most}} typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle.

Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.
