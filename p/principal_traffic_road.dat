40|$|Abstract. <b>Traffic</b> <b>roads</b> {{building}} {{is one of}} the most complex production processes in civil engineering. It is the most extensive one concerning the quantity of works executed and the most significant one concerning the scope of financial resources expended. The building of such and object inevitably requires the management of quality. The paper points out the significance, specific quality and application of the management of quality in the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> building. Considerable outlays for the repairing of a low-quality <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> represents a further motive for introducing the management of quality into the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>roads</b> building. Beside these direct outlays, there are also indirect outlays caused by the delay of the <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> building. As the outlays for the repairing of a low-quality <b>traffic</b> <b>road</b> noticeably exceed the outlays for the introduction of the management of quality systems, their introducing into the processes of <b>traffic</b> <b>roads</b> building becomes a necessity for planners, designers, subcontractors and contractors...|$|R

Objective: To outline systematically the global distribution of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> deaths by <b>road</b> user groups (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, motorised four-wheeler occupants). Methods: Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, TransportLink, grey literature and reference lists and communication with experts from international organisations and country-level institutions were conducted to identify eligible studies and data sources. All data sources that provided a breakdown of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> deaths by <b>road</b> user group at the national or sub-national level were eligible for inclusion.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> {{with its}} share from 2 / 3 to 3 / 4 {{of the total}} volume of {{transport}} service represents rather large and complicated social and production system with several subsystems that include roads, transport facilities, <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> organization, law enforcement, personnel training, <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> service and others. <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> quality can be quantitatively evaluated in accordance with values of losses pertaining to social and economic cost of discretionary (unenforced) expenses for <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> process. <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> contains accident, ecological, economic and social risks. Accidence is considered {{as the most important}} risk for participants involved in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> because it directly concerns their life, health and welfare. So accident response has rather high social significance and it is considered as a matter of national importance. In this connection role of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> organization has become very important and it is directed on improvement of its quality including security in the accident clusters. Methodological principles for improvement of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> quality have been developed in the paper. These principles presuppose the following: maximization of danger while selecting investigation object; minimization of total losses while evaluating quality and selecting solutions on improvement in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety; balanced accountability of accidental and ecological losses while selecting solutions on higher <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety in ambiguous situations; minimization of total cost pertaining to object operation while selecting measures on improvement of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety; obligatory operative control evaluation of accidence on the basis of method for conflict situations while introducing measures of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety.
