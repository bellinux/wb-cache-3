40|$|Button {{bars are}} a {{relatively}} new interaction method intended to speed up application use as compared to <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus.</b> This exploratory study compares three command selection methods: <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus,</b> button bars, and user choice of <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus</b> or button bars. Effectiveness was measured in two ways: speed of selection and error rate. 15 participants performed 15 word processor related tasks. Results show that in frequently used functions, such as character attribute selection (bold, italic, u nderline, etc.), button bars are faster. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in error rates between the three interaction methods. (Also cross-referenced as CAR-TR- 764...|$|R

50|$|The user {{interface}} of the ClassPad 300 uses a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> format. Solutions, expressions, {{and other items}} can be selected with the tap of the stylus. The ClassPad 300 also supports drag and drop, copy and paste, and other pen-based operations. An eActivity application allows the creation of eActivities that can include figures, expressions, and explanations.|$|E
5000|$|Users can {{click on}} a state on the DARE map, or select from any of 41 regions in a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> (e.g., Appalachians, Desert Southwest, Gulf States, North Central, South Atlantic), {{to get to a}} link to [...] "View all entries for state or region." [...] Because {{language}} does not adhere to state or regional boundaries, the user is also guided to a list of larger regions of which the state or region is a part, with links to searches for additional words characteristic of that area.|$|E
5000|$|A {{system to}} do this testing for the X window system, but {{extensible}} to any windowing system is described in. The X Window system provides functionality (via [...] and the editors' protocol) to dynamically send GUI input to and get GUI output from the program without directly using the GUI. For example, one can call XSendEvent (...) to simulate a click on a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu,</b> and so forth. This system allows researchers to automate the gene creation and testing so for any given application under test, a set of novice user test cases can be created.|$|E

5000|$|... {{aptitude}} {{is based}} on the ncurses computer terminal library, with which it provides an interface that incorporates some elements commonly seen in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (such as <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus).</b>|$|R
50|$|Before {{compositing}} window {{managers were}} developed, windows would instantly {{jump in and}} out of view, which is incongruent with the interface metaphor (and with a physical office setting). The sudden appearance and disappearance of GUI elements may seem confusing or even chaotic to inexperienced users. Visual transitions provide context and help distinguish the causal relationships of GUI elements. Instead of just disappearing, a window may fade away, or visibly shrink to the taskbar. A <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> that has been clicked may smoothly radiate outward from the menu bar, making it easier to determine its origin and purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the {{application}} {{was developed by}} Format Software GmbH (Cologne, Germany) to overcome deficits of Hypercard. It was released for the Mac in 1989, distributed by Olduvai, aimed at HyperCard power-users. Among the many [...] "wish list" [...] features included in Plus were document-like resizable and scrollable windows, 8-bit color support, {{and the ability to}} display and work with graphics files stored externally. Plus did not, however, provide for <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> support or allow stacks to be compiled into stand-alone applications, features of the competing Supercard. Plus could also run HyperCard stacks directly, and did so slightly faster than HyperCard itself.|$|E
5000|$|This type {{of control}} is called a [...] "pop-up menu" [...] on the Macintosh platform, however the term [...] "popup menu" [...] is {{used to refer to}} context menus in other GUI systems. The Macintosh also has the notion of [...] "pull-down menus". The {{distinction}} is that, when the menu is closed, a pop-up menu's title shows the last-selected item while a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> shows a static title like a menu in the menu bar. Thus, the uses are different—popup menus are used to select a single option from a list while pull-down menus are used to issue commands or in cases where multiple options can be selected.|$|E
40|$|Selecting {{items in}} {{cascading}} <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus</b> {{is a frequent}} task in most GUIs. These selections involve two major components: steering and selection, with the steering component being the most time-consuming and error-prone. We describe a new technique, called Adaptive Activation-Area Menu (AAMU) that eliminate corner steering. AAMUs contain an enlarged activation area which dynamically resizes itself providing a broader steering path for menu navigation. We also combined AAMUs with Force-field menus, to create Force-AAMUs. We empirically demonstrate that AAMUs and Force-AAMUs outperformed the current default menu. We also compared performances of various other menus including Enlarged activation area menus (EMUs) and Gesture based selection with mouse as an input device. Overall, users show higher satisfaction rates for AAMUs over other menu designs. Author Keywords Cascading <b>pull-down</b> <b>menus,</b> menu navigation, steering...|$|R

The game also has lightning- and tournament-timing alternatives. The player's letter rack is visible {{at the bottom}} of the screen. The player types a word composed of letters from the rack, and if the word is acceptable by the game, the player moves the cursor to the game board to position the word onscreen and score the move. The player may also pass a turn, request a hint of one playable word, and see the tile values at any time through the use of a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The many {{features}} of SPSS Statistics are accessible via pull-down menus {{or can be}} programmed with a proprietary 4GL command syntax language. Command syntax programming has the benefits of reproducible output, simplifying repetitive tasks, and handling complex data manipulations and analyses. Additionally, some complex applications can only be programmed in syntax and are not accessible through the menu structure. The <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> interface also generates command syntax: this can be displayed in the output, although the default settings have to be changed to make the syntax visible to the user. They can also be pasted into a syntax file using the [...] "paste" [...] button present in each menu. Programs can be run interactively or unattended, using the supplied Production Job Facility.|$|E
5000|$|LocoScript was {{regarded}} as easier to use than Wordstar and WordPerfect, which in the mid-1980s were the dominant word processors on IBM-compatible PCs, and many users needed no additional information beyond what the manual's [...] "first 20 minutes" [...] introductory chapter provided. The PCW's keyboard offered clearly labelled, one-press special keys for many common LocoScript functions, including cut, copy, and paste, while LocoScript's competitors required {{a wide range of}} key combinations that the user had to remember. [...] Most of the program's other features were presented via a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> bar in which the top-level options were activated by function keys. The menu system had two structures, one for beginners and the other for experienced users. Locomotive Software's slogan for the product was [...] "Everything you need, nothing you don't." [...] However, LocoScript version 1 {{was regarded}} as relatively slow.|$|E

5000|$|Classic Mac OS did not {{display a}} taskbar onscreen by default. Application {{switching}} prior to Mac OS 8.5 {{was done by}} clicking on an application's window or via a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> at the right end of the menu bar. Prior to version 8.5 the menu's title was the icon of the foreground application. Version 8.5 introduced the ability to optionally also display the application name and to [...] "tear off" [...] the menu by dragging the title with the mouse. The torn off menu was displayed as a palette. The palette window could be configured using AppleScript to appear much like a taskbar, with no title bar and fixed to one edge of the screen. No control panel was provided by Apple to access this functionality, but third-party developers quickly wrote applications that allowed users unfamiliar with AppleScript to customize their application palettes. Third party taskbars such as DragThing were a popular category of shareware on these systems.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{release of}} the new OS [...] - [...] Mac OS X Server 1.0 [...] - [...] used a {{modified}} version of the Mac OS GUI, but all client versions starting with Mac OS X Developer Preview 3 used a new theme known as Aqua. Aqua was a substantial departure from the Mac OS 9 interface, which had evolved with little change from that of the original Macintosh operating system: it incorporated full color scalable graphics, anti-aliasing of text and graphics, simulated shading and highlights, transparency and shadows, and animation. A key new feature was the Dock, an application launcher which took advantage of these capabilities. Despite this, OS X maintained a substantial degree of consistency with the traditional Mac OS interface and Apple's own Apple Human Interface Guidelines, with its <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu</b> at the top of the screen, familiar keyboard shortcuts, and support for a single-button mouse. The development of Aqua was delayed somewhat by the switch from OpenStep's Display PostScript engine to one developed in-house that was free of any license restrictions, known as Quartz.|$|E
50|$|Users may {{search through}} the YMDB {{using a variety}} of database-specific tools. The simple text query {{supports}} general text queries of the textual component of the database. By selecting either metabolites or proteins in the “search for” field it is possible to restrict the search and the returned results to only those data associated with metabolites or with proteins. YMDB’s browse tool generates a tabular synopsis of YMDB's content (Fig. 2). This browser view allows users to casually scroll through the database or re-sort its contents. Clicking on a given MetaboCard button brings up the full data content for the corresponding metabolite (Fig. 3). Under the Search link users will find a number of search options listed in a <b>pull-down</b> <b>menu.</b> The Chem Query option allows users to draw (using MarvinSketch applet or a ChemSketch applet) or to type (SMILES string) a chemical compound and to search the YMDB for chemicals similar or identical to the query compound. The Advanced Search option supports a more sophisticated text search of the text portion of YMDB. The Sequence Search button allows users to conduct BLAST (protein) sequence searches of all sequences contained in YMDB. Both single and multiple sequence (i.e. whole proteome) BLAST queries are supported. YMDB also supports a Data Extractor option that allows specific data fields or combinations of data fields to be searched and/or extracted. Spectral searches of YMDB’s reference compound NMR and MS spectral data are also supported through its MS, MS/MS, GC-MS and NMR Spectra Search links. Users may download YMDB’s complete textual data, chemical structures and sequence data by clicking on the Download button.|$|E
