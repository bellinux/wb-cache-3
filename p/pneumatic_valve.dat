25|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in cloudy weather with occasional rain showers. Michael Schumacher clinched his seventh pole position of his career, his first at the circuit, with a time of 1:14.266. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was one-tenth of a second slower and was helped by running in the slipstream of teammate Häkkinen on the main straight. Häkkinen qualified third and stated that he was not unhappy with his starting position. Barrichello qualified fourth, three-tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, and said he had more grip in his car to improve his time. Trulli qualified fifth. Button took sixth and was happy with his effort despite encountering a yellow flag on his third run and admitted to pushing too hard on his fourth attempt. Frentzen slid onto the grass during the session and managed to record the seventh quickest time. Villeneuve who secured eighth believed he could have set a faster time as he spun while on a quick lap. Diniz took ninth having removed some downforce which improved the feel of his car. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten having suffered his spin on his fourth run. Wurz qualified eleventh and said that he was happy with his car. Ricardo Zonta qualified twelfth, blaming his car for his qualifying performance. He was ahead of Verstappen and Salo. Fisichella, who started 15th, stated that understeer and poor grip prevented him from setting a faster lap time. He managed to qualify ahead of Heidfeld and Irvine, who spun during the session. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Herbert and Alesi filled the next three positions; the latter had a lack of running due to a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> system failure in his engine. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in front of Gené.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001, a 41-year-old {{woman from}} Antioch, California was thrown from the ride when a {{restraining}} bar failed {{as the result}} of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> being incorrectly installed. She landed on the pavement and suffered head and knee injuries. [...] Her later lawsuit named both the park and ride manufacturer Chance Rides as responsible parties.|$|E
2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once {{for each of the four}} strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). [...] Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000g.|$|E
2500|$|From [...] Benetton {{had been}} {{operating}} as the works Ford team, essentially {{taking over the}} role from the now defunct Haas Lola team. With the abandonment of turbocharging {{it was clear that}} the venerable DFV/Y/Z design was nowhere near being competitive with far newer offerings from Honda and Renault who were building V10 engines for 1989 and beyond, and Ferrari who were building what they knew, a V12 (Lamborghini entered F1 in 1989 and like Ferrari, also went down the V12 path). To counter this, drastic changes were made for the DFR of 1988. Although superficially a DFV-design, almost the only feature carried over from previous versions into the DFR was the basic 90° V8 engine architecture. The DFR became available to all customers in 1989, with the Benetton team also using this engine until the 1989 British Grand Prix. The DFR struggled on until the 1991 season finally being eclipsed by the higher revving abilities of new <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> gear engines such as the HB, and was last used in that year's Australian Grand Prix by the Footwork, Fondmetal, Larrousse and Coloni teams, nearly a quarter of a century after the DFV's first race. By the time of its demise, continued improvement had pushed the DFR power output to nearly , 60% higher than the original 1967 DFV.|$|E
