50|$|The {{sedimentary}} rocks surrounding Ear Mountain consist mainly of quartzites and dark slates, which resemble the slates near York {{and have been}} correlated with them. The core of the mountain is a granite boss or stock intruded in these slates. Radiating from the main granite mass there is a fringe of intrusive quartz-porphyry and rhyolite dikes which arc regarded as offshoots from the main intrusion. The granites of the main mass are coarsely crystalline and consist essentially of quartz, orthoclase, and biotite. A specimen {{from one of the}} smaller bodies, examined microscopically, is made up essentially of quartz and of orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars. A narrow dike from the same region was found to consist essentially of quartz and feldspar, with muscovite, largely secondary, and a secondary growth of feldspar surrounding the larger orthoclase crystals.

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} of soil is {{radically different from}} the atmosphere above. The consumption of oxygen, by microbes and plant roots and their release of carbon dioxide, decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil pore space it may range from 10 to 100 times that level. At extreme levels CO2 is toxic. In addition, the soil voids are saturated with water vapour. Adequate porosity is necessary, not just to allow the penetration of water, but also to allow gases to diffuse in and out. Movement of gases is by diffusion from high concentrations to lower. Oxygen diffuses in and is consumed and excess levels of carbon dioxide, diffuse out with other gases as well as water. Soil texture and structure strongly affect soil porosity and gas diffusion. It is the total pore space (porosity) of soil not the pore size that determines the rate of diffusion of gases {{into and out of}} soil. A <b>Platy</b> soil <b>structure</b> and compacted soils (low porosity) impede gas flow, and a deficiency of oxygen may encourage anaerobic bacteria to reduce (strip oxygen) from nitrate NO3 to the gases N2, N2O, and NO, which are then lost to the atmosphere, thereby depleting the soil of nitrogen. Aerated soil is also a net sink of methane CH4 but a net producer of greenhouse gases when soils are depleted of oxygen and subject to elevated temperatures.|$|R

Drilled in 2002 to explore the conditions of the geothermal system, well HE- 6 is now discharging at a rate of 29. 4 kg/s with an enthalpy of 1950 kJ/kg. The stratigraphic units in well HE- 6 are comprised of 4 distinct hyaloclastite formations, 3 lava units and 2 possible intrusions, one being of intermediate composition. There are four alteration zones: smectite-zeolite (376 - 730 m), smectite-mixed layer clay-chlorite (730 - 800 m), chlorite (800 - 1000 m) and chlorite-epidote (1000 - 1018 m).

The study was carried out between 2000 and 2006 as part of the long-term "cropping systems and soil structure" experiment conducted in Estrées-Mons in northern France. Soil hydraulic, mechanical and pore morphological properties were also measured to characterise the effects on soil structure dynamics. A complementary characterisation of the soil structure was conducted on a microscale. The method for morphological description of the soil macrostructure was well suited to studying soil structure dynamics in reduced tillage systems. Results showed that the soil structure in the layer without tillage depended in the first instance on compaction intensity. Structural porosity was partly preserved in the cropping system with little compaction. In contrast just one operation, such as the harvest of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), was sufficient to reduce structural porosity for 5 years even though no further compaction occurred during this period. Morphological analysis revealed the evolution of highly compacted zones under the effects of weather conditions. <b>Platy</b> soil <b>structures</b> were systematically observed in {{the upper part of the}} highly compacted zones under the tilled layers, with cracking slowly penetrating deeper into the soil with time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Eleven small Mesozoic plutons crop {{out within}} a 76 -squaremile {{area of the}} {{southern}} Seven Devils Mountains in west-central Idaho. The plutons are divided into a mafic suite, an older granitic suite, and a younger granitic suite {{on the basis of}} age, lithology, and degree of metamorphism. The six plutons of the mafic suite are Late Triassic-Middle Jurassic (?) in age. Maximum dimensions are slightly over 3 miles in length and about 4, 000 feet in width. Rock types, which may vary within individual plutons, are quartz-bearing hornblende metagabbro, hornblende metanorite, metadiorite, and metamorphosed quartz diorite. Chemically, the rocks are dioritic. The elongation of plutons suggests that emplacement was guided by the northeasttrending zone of weakness exemplified by the mylonite of the Oxbow- Cuprum shear zone. Forceful emplacement is indicated by local deflection of mylonite around plutons. Amphibolitization of pyroxene implies an increase in water pressure during the late stages of crystallization. The mafic plutons were subjected to greenschist facies regional metamorphism. The three plutons of the older granitic suite are Late Jurassic (?) in age. Maximum dimensions are 2 1 / 2 miles long and 4, 200 feet wide. Rock types include quartz diorite and granodiorite; the Crystal Lake pluton shows a faint compositional zonation. The elongation of plutons indicates that emplacement was guided by the northeast trend of the country rocks, including the Oxbow-Cuprum shear zone. Forceful emplacement is shown by the deformation of mylonite around the Crystal Lake pluton. The three intrusions show slight effects of greenschist facies regional metamorphism. The two plutons of the younger granitic suite, Deep Creek and Echols Mountain stocks, are Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (?) in age. The Deep Creek stock, largest intrusive mass in the thesis area, covers 9 1 / 2 square miles and has a thermal aureole as much as 5, 000 feet in width. Twelve tabular marble xenoliths, the largest about half a mile in length, were probably derived from the Martin Bridge limestone at depth. <b>Platy</b> flow <b>structure,</b> defined by the orientation of hornblende, biotite, and schliern, forms a concentric funnel-shaped closure in {{the main body of the}} stock and a glacierlike pattern in part of the eastern prong. The flow structure is thought to have originated, (1) by rotational alignment of platy minerals into parallelism with contacts early in the emplacement history of the stock, and (2) by orientation of platy minerals normal to the direction of greatest magmatic pressure during the later stages of intrusion. Marginal fissures, which form the only consistent joint pattern in the main body of the stock, indicate late stage adjustment of the consolidated shell to pressures from the interior. The main body of the quartz diorite pluton is compositionally zoned. Potassium feldspar and quartz increase inward; whereas color index decreases inward. Chemically, the stock exhibits a calc-alkaline trend of differentiation. The Echols Mountain stock, about four square miles in area, is similar in petrography to the Deep Creek stock. Flow structure outlines a dome, however, rather than a funnel. Neither the Deep Creek nor the Echols Mountain stock is metamorphosed. The eleven plutons of the map area represent three episodes of Mesozoic plutonism that in part straddle the time interval between emplacement of the Late Permian-Middle Triassic Canyon Mountain complex (Thayer and Brown, 1964) and the Middle Cretaceous-Early Tertiary Idaho batholith...|$|R
40|$|The limited acreage of Hong Kong's urban parks {{receives}} {{a huge number}} of visitors, imposing a heavy strain on the soil base. Most parks show widespread trampling-induced soil degradation, such as bare patches and compaction. These symptoms erode the quality of amenity vegetation and recreational experience. Soil in the most popular park was studied through detailed field and laboratory analysis of six pits denoting different levels of user impacts. Soil profiles show unnatural stratification and poor structure of decomposed granite fill materials used in reclaiming the land from the sea. Marked compaction in surface layers is induced by foot-traffic pressure with aggregate breakdown and formation of <b>platy</b> <b>structure.</b> Compaction in subsoil layers is inherited from construction damage that persists 40 years after park opening. The predominantly coarse texture has been packed to high bulk densities exceeding the 1. 75 Mg/m 3 threshold. With diminished porosity, transmission of air and water, storage of plant- available moisture, and root growth suffer. Chemically, the samples have an unnatural alkaline pH; inadequate organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, exchangeable cations; and limited cation exchange capacity. The results can help park-soil management, including the need to evaluate soil in planned park sites, salvage high-grade soil parcels, prevent construction damage, ameliorate structure by mechanical operations and suitable amendments, and replace site soil of very poor quality.

40|$|Changes to {{the soil}} occur as land-use {{practices}} are modified. These changes may include improvements but more commonly result in degradation, which may be obvious or subtle. The latter type is addressed here. In this case the degradation represents limited changes {{to the soil}} such that once recovered there is little apparent evidence that recalls this disturbance history. How this history is deciphered represents a compelling challenge to soil science that necessarily incorporates obvious signs of soil degradation, stratigraphic principles, archaeological principles and pedo-forensics at scales ranging from micro to macro. The challenge is to determine which features {{can be used in}} a diagnostic sense. Undoubtedly, these will differ between different environments, land-use practices and recovery time. Morphological indicators of different land use regimes may be revealed in soil colour, structure and texture and this leads naturally to confirmation using microscopic techniques that includes microstructure as well as the presence of exotic components. Often a stratigraphic approach is required to provide a geomorphic context such as when former upslope soil material now constitutes the downslope topsoil. Chemical changes often occur too. Several examples are used to illustrate this. Forest clearance offers the most compelling case especially where the litter layer and the bioturbated surface layer are replaced by very different features such as surface crusting and the presence of mineral soil at the surface. This is often associated with an increase in bulk density, reduced organic matter, and a reduction in larger biovoids. Changes within grassland systems may be less obvious if little disturbed. Further changes are apparent when compaction occurs, which must lead to a decrease in pore size, even of simple packing voids. More telling is the appearance of horizontal planar voids, which imparts a <b>platy</b> <b>structure</b> in the near surface that reflects the applied stresses imposed from above. Biovoids may display a radial fracture pattern in this situation. Changes in drainage that affects the redoximorphic status of the soil may lead to the superimposition of a set of features commensurate with this. However, many of these features are gradually lost as recovery occurs and this results in a greater reliance on general stratigraphy and the presence of exotics and perhaps local historical knowledge of land use change. Such information was used by soil surveyors in Eastern USA in the early 1900 's in delineating phases. In South-Eastern Australia, post-settlement alluvium (i. e. deposited since European settlement and mostly < 200 years old) blankets many valley floors. For many years it remained unknown in soil science circles since the material is often cultivated and even built upon (often an effective disguise) and treated as a natural part of the soil-landscape. Nevertheless, it often displays a paler colour, lower organic matter, preservation of bedding and a <b>platy</b> <b>structure</b> which readily distinguishes it from pre-settlement material. European artefacts, including partly to completely buried fence posts, fragments of porcelain etc., and/or OSL dating confirm the interpretation. Its identity was revealed during geomorphic investigations of valley fills. The source of these deposits has often been attributed to reworking of older valley fills but in at least one study the main source area is the adjacent valley sides with the evidence seemingly hidden within the topsoils of varying thickness. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Layered {{iron oxide}} {{nanosheet}} material {{is a new}} efficient adsorbent which is here developed and investigated for removing the eutrophicant phosphate from water. The layered Fe-III nanosheets are synthesized by anion exchanging layered Fe-II/Fe-III hydroxide chloride (green rust; GR) with dodecanoate, followed by solid state oxidation and exfoliation, by which the yield of the product can be easily scaled up. The obtained product exhibits a distinct <b>platy</b> <b>structure</b> with a minimal Fe-III oxide sheet thickness of 1 nm and lateral size of 100 to 200 nm as observed by means of high resolution transmission electronic microscopy, selected area electronic diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The Fe-III nanosheets can be well dispersed and stable in aqueous solution, showing a low tendency of aggregation. The performance of the obtained nanosheets to remove phosphate has been evaluated in kinetic and batch experiments under different environmental conditions (i. e. interfering anions and pH). The kinetic study shows that phosphate removal by the iron oxide quickly reaches a plateau with the rate constant k(2) ranging from 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) to 1. 4 x 10 (- 3) g (mu mol(- 1) min(- 1)) for the initial phosphate concentrations of 40 and 80 mu mol L- 1 (1. 2 to 2. 4 mg P per L) at pH 7. The maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of the layered Fe-III nanosheets is 2540 mu mol g(- 1) (about 77 mg g(- 1); 4006 mu mol P per g Fe) at pH 5, showing excellent potential for phosphate removal from wastewater. Our results also indicate that {{the performance of the}} layered Fe-III nanosheets for phosphate removal is selective. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of O 1 s, Fe 2 p and P 2 p spectra provide evidence for phosphate removal by forming inner-sphere Fe-O-P surface complexes.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{published}} in the last few decades on Pleistocene palaeo-temperature reconstruction based on isotopic studies on deep sea cores and ice core records from Greenland. Such temporal high-resolution data represents northern hemispheric circulations and has to be reconfirmed through the study of terrestrial archives in order to recognise the character of such fluctuations in different regions. Loess-palaeosol sequences (LPSs) are suitable to interpret them as palaeoenvironmental archives, because loess is a widely distributed terrestrial deposit and is datable using luminescence techniques. The Saxon loess region (SLR) is characterised by a loess cover of ca. 8 m thickness, mainly representing deposits of the last glacial cycle. Over the past 35 years, Saxon loess remains under-researched wherefore a reactivation with the objective of contributing to the European loess research is important. There is a clear need to re-examine Saxon LPSs and close this gap of knowledge, because in recent years much work has been done on important and European-wide known loess sections as well as in adjacent loess areas. In this study, LPSs from Saxony were investigated and a regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the last Glacial/Interglacial cycle was developed. The established stratigraphical scheme has to be advanced by results of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The stratigraphical results should be compared with previous work from Saxony and with results from adjacent loess areas, to verify if our results have to be interpreted as singularities or if they are in accordance with known European conceptions. Therefore, 8 sections, mostly never investigated before, were described and correlated with each other to finally generate an independent standard stratigraphy for this area. Carbonate content, pH-value, soil organic matter, total and pedogenic iron, magnetic susceptibility and classical grain size analyses were obtained from every section. Furthermore, rare earth elements concentrations were measured from selected positions in order to prove if there are variations in the deposit composition during the glaciation. The OSL dating results were processed by Kreutzer (2012). As previously noted, the first step towards a regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction was to establish a standard stratigraphic scheme where all found units are involved. Based on features regarding grain size distribution, the found palaeosols and the magnetic susceptibility Baumgart et al. (2013), 5 units could be defined. Unit V reflects the pre-Weichselian sediments modified by the Eemian soil formation. Unit IV contains deposits {{from the beginning of the}} Weichselian glaciation. Typically, this unit starts with the first Weichselian deposit, a bright-greyish Mn- and Fe-precipitates enriched layer which shows an aggregation of charcoal at its top. This layer is covered by a greyish, humus-enriched and reworked relict of a Chernozem-like soil. After a Gelic Gleysol and a reddish-brownish soil sediment, a loess package with an embedded interstadial Cambisol-like soil is preserved. The top of the unit is represented by another brownish soil sediment which forms the lower part of the Gleina complex. Typically, unit IV is characterised by stronger reworked layers and soil sediments but at the Rottewitz section an older loess package is preserved. Unit III represents the reactivation of aeolian sedimentation. The base of this unit is made up of a strong Gelic Gleysol (upper part of the Gleina complex). The deposits of this unit are mostly pedogenically overprinted and show features of at least two Gelic Gleysols. Unit II is dominated by unweathered loess. Its lower part (unit IIb) is built of a more stratified loess facies whereas the upper part (unit IIa) is built of a homogeneous loess facies. They are separated by a strong Gelic Gleysol. Unit I represent the upper part of the loess section, which is modified by the Holocene and Late Pleistocene soil development. Within this succession, a huge hiatus is found between unit III and IV of ca. 35 ka. It is labelled as the Gleina complex according to Lieberoth (1963). Furthermore, we demonstrate how combined analyses of high-resolution grain size distributions and microscopic analysis can be used to discriminate depositional and pedogenetic features of loess-palaeosol profiles from the SLR. Generally, it was observed that an increase of coarse material is linked with an increase of the mineralogical components which refers to slope processes. Rounded shapes of Mn- and Fe-precipitates, mostly found in Early Weichselian humus layers, indicate strong interstadial soil development modified by subsequent redeposition. Further observations suggest that the class of medium sand is dominated by secondary precipitates. The varying amount of very fine sand shows that sequences are cyclically built up of pure loess comparable to the Nussloch section. Studying coarse grain size fractions by microscopic analysis, a differentiation between loessic layers formed by periglacial slope processes and layers overprinted by pedogenetic processes is possible. Furthermore, an increase of fine material and secondary Mn- and Fe-precipitates can be attributed to soil forming processes (clay formation, redoximorphic processes, and illuviation). Additionally, a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for the Late Pleistocene is proposed. As palaeo-temperature proxies ice wedges, pure loess sedimentation or the <b>platy</b> soil <b>structure</b> due to former ice lensing for cold periods and soil formations or vegetation remnants for warmer periods were used. A reconstruction of wind speed is directly deduced from the very fine sand content. The stability/instability of the landscape surface could be indicated by soil formation (stable) or through an increase of coarse sand (active). The type of soil development for the reconstruction is of major importance. For example, a humus enriched soil indicates warmer and dryer conditions than a Gelic Gleysol. The results of grain size analyses reveal a similar temporal and lithogenic pattern of Weichselian aeolian dynamics of the study area and other records from Europe. Furthermore, grain size results independently confirm the luminescence chronology of the studied sections. Reworked loess-like sediments show varying OSL age estimates; aeolian loess shows a systematic change of OSL ages. Generally, the findings of this study agree with observations from other loess areas. In most areas, a similar hiatus between Middle and Upper Weichselians is documented. Additionally, OSL dating suggests that we found an older loess package with an age between ca. 60 and 70 ka and a younger loess package with an age of ca. 15 and 30 ka. These periods of aeolian deposition are in accordance with MIS 4 and MIS 2 as well as with dust concentrations results derived from lake sediments and from ice cores. A major finding of this study is that we uncover the internal differences of loess-palaeosol sequences regarding their temporal resolution. In periods of loess sedimentation, a temporally high-resolution record is preserved. In contrast, in periods dominated by interstadial soil development or redeposition, a temporal low-resolution record is preserved and a reconstruction of palaeoenvironment is almost impossible. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten wurden viele Studien über die Rekonstruktion der pleistozänen Temperaturentwicklung veröffentlicht, welche anhand von Isotopenanalysen aus Tiefsee- und Eisbohrkernen des grönländischen Eises abgeleitet werden konnten. In solchen zeitlich hochaufgelösten Daten sind nordhemisphärische Klimaschwankungen repräsentiert und diese sollten durch Untersuchungen terrestrischer Archive validiert und deren regionale Ausprägung in verschiedenen Räumen abgeschätzt werden. Löss-Paläobodensequenzen eignen sich hervorragend als Paläoumweltarchiv, da der Löss ein weit verbreitetes Sediment und mittels Lumineszenzverfahren datierbar ist. Die Sächsische Lössregion ist durch eine ca. 8 m mächtige Lössdecke charakterisiert, welche vornehmlich aus Ablagerungen des letzten glazialen Zyklus besteht. In den vergangenen 35 Jahren wurde die Lössforschung in diesem Raum vernachlässigt, sodass eine Wiederbelebung wichtig ist, um einen Beitrag zur europäischen Lössforschung zu leisten. Da in den letzten Jahren an wichtigen europäischen Lössprofilen, wie auch in angrenzenden Lössregionen, intensiv geforscht wurde besteht der dringende Bedarf, die Forschungen an sächsischen Löss-Paläobodensequenzen wieder aufzunehmen und die entstandene Wissenslücke zu schließen. In dieser Studie werden sächsische Löss-Paläobodensequenzen untersucht und eine regionale Umweltrekonstruktion für den letzten glazialen Zyklus vorgestellt. Die Standardstratigraphie wird dabei durch optisch stimulierte Lumineszenz (OSL) -Alter erweitert. Die Ergebnisse werden mit älteren Arbeiten aus diesem Raum verglichen, um abzuschätzen, ob es sich hierbei um Einzelbefunde handelt oder ob sich die Ergebnisse in schon bekannte europäische Konzepte einordnen lassen. Es werden 8, meist noch nie bearbeitete Profile beschrieben und miteinander korreliert, um schließlich eine unabhängige Standardstratigraphie für diesen Raum zu erarbeiten. Von jedem Profil wurde der Kalkgehalt, der pH-Wert, der Anteil der organischen Substanz, das pedogene und Gesamteisen, die magnetische Suszeptibilität und die Korngrößenverteilung (klassisch) bestimmt. Zudem wurde die Konzentration der Seltene Erden Elemente an ausgewählten Positionen bestimmt, um zu prüfen, ob es Verschiebungen in der mineralogischen Zusammensetzungen über das letzte Glazial hinweg gab. Die OSL-Datierungen wurden dabei von Kreutzer (2012) realisiert. Wie schon erläutert wurde, bestand der erste Arbeitsschritt darin, eine Standardstratigraphie zu erarbeiten, worin alle Befunde integriert werden können. Auf Grundlage der Korngrößenverteilung, der gefundenen|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 1998 in north-western New South Wales to assess how changes in tillage practices and farmers’ perceptions of ‘good’ or bad’ paddocks relate to soil structural properties. Forty landholders were visited and interviewed to obtain background information on their current and past management practices, crops and cropping systems used, and what they expect in the future. The majority of the soils were Vertosols (78 %), with some Kandosols and a few Chromosols. Conventional tillage was practised on 63 % of the fields surveyed. Conservation tillage (minimum or zero-tillage) was only practised on swelling clay soils. On these soils 26 % of the fields had been converted from conventional to conservation tillage during the past 3 years, while on 14 % of the fields conservation tillage had been practised since they were brought into crop production (3 – 10 years previously). Saturated hydraulic conductivities on the farmed black Vertosols with a history of conventional tillage were lower than those of the virgin sites, but increased after conversion from conventional to conservation tillage. Fields that were brought into cropping during the last 10 years using conservation tillage only had higher saturated conductivities than the virgin sites. There was little effect of cropping history on saturated hydraulic conductivity on the grey Vertosols. Soil organic carbon on the control sites was always greater than on the corresponding cultivated sites, regardless of whether conventional or conservation tillage was practised. Tillage history did not affect any of the measured soil chemical properties. Platyness of soil structure was a clear indicator for wheel-induced compaction. <b>Platy</b> <b>structure</b> was not shown on any of the swelling clay soils at the never-cultivated sites, and tended to be more frequent on the ‘poor’ sites. This was most pronounced for the grey Vertosols, where 80 % of the ‘poor’ and 50 % of the ‘good’ sites were platy, and on the black Vertosols, with 42 % and 31 % respectively. The overall close agreement between platyness and the farmers’ perceptions of ‘good’ and ‘poor’ sites indicated that platyness has an impact on soil productivity and that soil compaction continues to be a limiting factor for crop production. We also concluded that black Vertosols respond better to conservation tillage than grey Vertosols, possibly due to their greater resilience and better ability to self-ameliorate. The absence of conservation tillage adoption on non-swelling clay soils in this region (at the time of the study) may reflect the length of time required before conservation tillage improves soil structure and, ultimately, yield...|$|E
