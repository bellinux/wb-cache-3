Wearing the black and gold livery of John Player & Sons, Lotus' F1 sponsor at the time, these cars were known as the Commemorative Edition Esprits. They were mechanically identical to the regular 2.0L S2. According to Lotus a series of 300 was built, but it is likely the total was considerably lower.

25|$|Employment in Dundee changed {{dramatically}} during the 1980s {{with the loss}} of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. To combat growing unemployment and declining economic conditions, Dundee was declared an Enterprise Zone in January 1984. In 1983, the first Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computers were produced in Dundee by Timex. In the same year the company broke <b>production</b> <b>records,</b> despite a sit-in by workers protesting against job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings {{to make way for a}} supermarket. Timex closed its Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six-month industrial dispute.|$|E
25|$|<b>Production</b> <b>records</b> {{reveal that}} the palay {{production}} of the municipality reached an aggregate total of 27,176 metric tons or 543,520 cavans. The bulk of the palay produced came from the irrigated rice lands with a total population of 25,212 metric tons or 504,240 cavans. Average yield was 5.5 metric tons or 110 cavans per hectare for irrigated lands and 4.0 metric tons or 80 cavans per hectare for rain fed areas. Value wise, the total palay production with a farm gate price of 10 pesos per kilogram amount to not less than 252.12 million. The average yield has been computed in dry weight basis of 14% moisture content and the weight per cavan of 50 kilograms.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{investigation}} of <b>production</b> <b>records</b> at Norsk Hydro {{and analysis of}} an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D2O. Despite the apparent size of the shipment, the total quantity of pure heavy water was quite small, most barrels only containing 0.5–1% pure heavy water. The Germans would have needed {{a total of about}} 5 tons of heavy water to get a nuclear reactor running. The manifest clearly indicated that there was only half a ton of heavy water being transported to Germany. Hydro was carrying far too little heavy water for one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.|$|E

500|$|After the acquisition, the Hartford City Glass works {{became known}} as plant number 3 of the American Window Glass Company. The plant {{employed}} 450 people in 1901. [...] As natural gas supplies in Indiana became depleted, many manufacturers moved or did not survive. [...] The major plants of the American Window Glass successfully changed energy sources from natural gas to gas made from coal. [...] The company also had a technological advantage. Instead of using a glass blower, American Window Glass plants extracted molten glass with a machine. The machine, which was not immediately utilized at all American Window Glass plants, {{was known as the}} Lubbers blowing machine. Refinements to the machine and glass-making process were made at the Hartford City works by plant manager Harry G. Slingluff. <b>Production</b> <b>records</b> for the entire company were set at the Hartford City plant in 1905 and 1907—using the Lubbers machines.|$|E

Zelda also produced a pressure of , which was the lowest pressure ever recorded on Kwajalein. Later, In Ebeye, 60percent of homes were destroyed, and 6,000people were left homeless. Food and water supplies were contaminated from salt in surge waves, and the water desalination plant became inoperable. Fresh water <b>production</b> <b>records</b> since 1989 were lost during the storm. The local hospital was still intact, but a few power lines were cut. There were no deaths or significant injuries. Other islands in the nation had their water contaminated by saltwater, and 95percent of the crops were destroyed by the storm surge. [...] Coral reefs were also damaged when the storm came nearby.|$|E

2500|$|The Sharp's Minitruck, (initially, {{they were}} {{referred}} to as Utility in the <b>production</b> <b>records)</b> was the pickup version, which outwardly was {{very similar to the}} Mark B Tourer, but included an extension of the bodywork behind the rear wheel.

2500|$|A fourth model, the Bond Ranger {{light van}} was {{introduced}} in March 1960. This utilised the body with the cut out behind the front seats from the Family Saloon and married it with a similar hardtop roof without side windows, but {{with the addition of}} an opening flap around the rear window. Very much an economy model, in standard form it came finished in primer with topcoat as an optional extra. A total of 39 cars of this type were recorded in factory <b>production</b> <b>records</b> as a Van rather than a Ranger. This is believed to denote that they were only fitted with a single driver's front seat to increase load capacity, much like the 1952 Minitruck. U.K. law at the time also meant that this type of lightweight, single-seat three-wheeler could be driven [...] unaccompanied on learner L-plates without the need to pass a driving test.|$|E
