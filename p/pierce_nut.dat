40|$|Regarding {{the use of}} material, modern {{lightweight}} car {{bodies are}} becoming more and more complex than previous constructions. The materials nowadays are used for a more specific field of application and more high strength steels are used and also other materials like aluminium, stainless steel, reinforced polymers are used more frequent. The joining of these materials often requires new or modified joining processes. The aim with this thesis is concerned with the development of simulation models of the joining process as well as mechanical properties of self piercing riveted (SPR) joints and <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> joints. In both of these joining methods problems occur when introducing more high strength steel sheets. For SPR, fractures occur in the rivet, and for <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> the thread will be damaged. Since both the SPR process and the <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> process expose the material for plastic deformation up to 150 %, correct material properties for very large strain and a simulation program that could handle this was required. With the commercial finite element program Deform 2 D an axi-symmetric model has been built for the SPR process and the <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> process. Because of the computational time, 3 D simulations were only used where it was necessary. The developed 3 D models use the commercial finite element program ABAQUS-Explicit. All simulation models have been verified with satisfactory agreement to experimental results. For SPR, an axi-symmetric simulation model was used for evaluating and optimising the setting process in the stainless steel sheets EN 1. 4301, HyTens 800 and HyTens 1200. Subsequently, 3 D models were used for predicting the mechanical properties of new SPR joints that have showed reduced risk for rivet cracking. In <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> simulations, nuts with hardness 8 and 10 have been set in the high strength steel sheet DP 600. An axi-symmetric simulation model was used for centred nut setting and two different simulation models in 3 D were used to evaluate eccentric nut setting and torque resistance. This work resulted in more knowledge about the fracture risk in the rivet and how to reduce it. The strain and stress, which was used as fracture indicators, were reduced to the half with modifications of the rivet and the die geometry. Mechanical property simulations in shear and peel load resulted in satisfactory results for new SPR joints that have showed reduced fracture risk during rivet setting. New die and rivet designs can be developed effectively by combining the process and mechanical property simulations. For a <b>pierce</b> <b>nut</b> joint in high strength steel sheets (1. 5 mm DP 600), the simulations show that the cutting of the sheet in combination with eccentric setting over the die causes the thread damage. The thread damage can be avoided by changing the dimension of the nut or by increasing the strength of the nut material. The simulation models can also be used to develop new nut and die geometries for future applications. QC 2010111...|$|E
40|$|In this article, the {{possibilities}} for improving the joining process of self piercing solid rivets and self <b>piercing</b> <b>nuts</b> by increasing tool velocity are demonstrated. Thereby, the focus is put on the joining process of high strength steel sheets. Proper and reliable joining of these steels presents a major challenge for mechanical joining techniques. In the conventional joining process, where tool velocities well below 1 m/s are common, different problems during the joining process caused by the high strength of the steel sheets can occur. At the punch riveting process undesirable material flow or unwanted burr development can occur, and at the setting process of self <b>piercing</b> <b>nuts</b> a deformation of the nuts is possible. These problems can be reduced significantly by using elevated tool velocity. In the present paper, characteristics of the joining process at conventional and elevated tool velocity are investigated. The influence caused by different tool velocities within the joining process is shown by cross section- and process force analysis. In the cross section analysis of the mechanical joints it is demonstrated {{that the quality of}} connections can be improved significantly due to the usage of elevated tool velocity. The process force analysis of the high speed joining process shows an oscillating progression of tools and joining elements...|$|R

Introduction: Until recently, {{the world}} has {{depended}} chiefly upon the wild trees for its supply of nuts. They were never used as a staple article of food, but were merely incidental features in our living. It is probably {{for this reason that}} nuts have never been cultivated. We are not impelled by necessity to plant and rear such trees as hickory and walnut, even though we may like their fruit. Our forests are rapidly disappearing and there is liable to be a time soon, when nuts must be raised in our orchards, if we are to have any at all. The edible nuts, though they never have been so used, may profitably be made staple articles of food. They have a high nutritive value, and could well take the place of some of the other foods. If more of the natural products of the earth were eaten and less of artificially prepared and adulterated articles, mankind would be much the better for it...|$|R
