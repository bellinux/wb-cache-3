50|$|There {{are several}} GUIs available, such as QtPass for Linux/Windows/MacOS or <b>Password</b> <b>Store</b> for Android. A syncing {{system is not}} implemented, but syncing can be achieved, by syncing the {{password}} files with an external Tool.|$|E
50|$|Some {{computer}} systems store user passwords as plaintext, against which to compare user log on attempts. If an attacker gains {{access to such}} an internal <b>password</b> <b>store,</b> all passwords—and so all user accounts—will be compromised. If some users employ the same password for accounts on different systems, those will be compromised as well.|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{password}} management software - Many operating systems provide {{a mechanism to}} store and retrieve passwords by using the user's login password to unlock an encrypted password database. Microsoft Windows provides Credential Manager to store user names and passwords used to log on to websites or other computers on a network, Mac OS X has a Keychain feature that provides this functionality, and similar functionality {{is present in the}} GNOME and KDE open source desktops. In addition, web browser developers have added similar functionality to all of the major browsers. Although, if the user's system is corrupted, stolen or compromised, they can also lose access to sites where they rely on the <b>password</b> <b>store</b> or recovery features to remember their login data.|$|E

40|$|Vulnerabilities in {{password}} {{managers are}} unremitting because current designs provide large attack surfaces, {{both at the}} client and server. We describe and evaluate Horcrux, a password manager that is designed holistically to minimize and decentralize trust, while retaining the usability of a traditional password manager. The prototype Horcrux client, implemented as a Firefox add-on, is split into two components, with code that {{has access to the}} user's master's password and any key material isolated into a small auditable component, separate from the complexity of managing the user interface. Instead of exposing actual credentials to the DOM, a dummy username and password are autofilled by the untrusted component. The trusted component intercepts and modifies POST requests before they are encrypted and sent over the network. To avoid trusting a centralized store, stored credentials are secret-shared over multiple servers. To provide domain and username privacy, while maintaining resilience to off-line attacks on a compromised <b>password</b> <b>store,</b> we incorporate cuckoo hashing in a way that ensures an attacker cannot determine if a guessed master password is correct. Our approach only works for websites that do not manipulate entered credentials in the browser client, so we conducted a large-scale experiment that found the technique appears to be compatible with over 98 % of tested login forms.

25|$|Further, KeePass {{tracks the}} {{creation}} time, modification time, last access time, and expiration time of each <b>password</b> <b>stored.</b> Files can be attached and <b>stored</b> with a <b>password</b> record, or text notes can be entered with the password details.

50|$|In April 2010 a cross-site {{scripting}} vulnerability in Jira led to {{the compromise}} of two Apache Software Foundation servers. The Jira password database was compromised. The database contained unsalted password hashes, which are vulnerable to dictionary lookups and cracking tools. Apache advised users to change their passwords. Atlassian themselves were also targeted {{as part of the}} same attack and admitted that a legacy database with <b>passwords</b> <b>stored</b> in plain text had been compromised.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{only the}} salted and hashed {{version of a}} {{password}} {{is used in the}} whole login process, and the salt on the server doesn't change, a client <b>storing</b> <b>passwords</b> can <b>store</b> the hashed versions, and not expose the clear text password to attackers. Such hashed versions are bound to one server, which makes this useful on password reuse.|$|R
50|$|Its {{graphical}} {{user interface}} displays various keychains, with there usually being at least two: the login keychain and the system keychain. It also includes the Keychain first aid utility (which was removed by the 10.11.2 update) that can repair problems with Keychains. Various events can cause problems with Keychains, and sometimes the only {{solution to a problem}} is to delete the Keychain, which also deletes any <b>passwords</b> <b>stored</b> in the Keychain, and create a new one.|$|R
40|$|In the {{distributed}} environment, authentication and key exchange mechanisms {{play a major}} role. In general, for authentication, {{the client}} and the server mutually exchange a common cryptographic key. In earlier, <b>passwords</b> were <b>stored</b> on a single server. If an intruder gains access to the server by using some malicious attacks, then all the <b>passwords</b> <b>stored</b> in the database be compromised. So the e-commerce application security is endangered. In order to improve the efficiency and performance of the authentication scheme, we introduce multiple servers to <b>store</b> the <b>passwords</b> {{and participate in the}} key exchange and authentication schemes. This ensures entire systems' security even if a single server is compromised. The randomly generated nonce for each session corresponding to two-level security mechanism where the scope of an attacker pretends as legitimate user and login to the system is completely restricted. In this method, <b>passwords</b> are <b>stored</b> in their equivalent hash values and stored on multiple servers. This makes the attacker difficult to reverse engineer and intercept to determine the password even from segments of hash value. In this paper, we model a safe and secure password-based authentication scheme using a key exchange. Comment: 4 pages, one figure, ICASETM- 17 conferenc...|$|R

The breach included 37 million unique email addresses, usernames and <b>passwords</b> <b>stored</b> as unsalted MD5 hashes.|$|R
50|$|The major {{disadvantages}} of online password managers are the requirements that the user trusts the hosting site and a keylogger {{is not on}} the computer they are using. With servers and the cloud being a focus of cyber attacks, how one authenticates into the online service and that the <b>passwords</b> <b>stored</b> there are encrypted with a user defined key are just as important. Again, users tend to circumvent security for convenience. Another important factor is whether one or two way encryption is used.|$|R
50|$|A {{password}} {{manager is}} a software application that helps a user <b>store</b> and organize <b>passwords.</b> <b>Password</b> managers usually <b>store</b> <b>passwords</b> encrypted, requiring {{the user to}} create a master password; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database.|$|R
