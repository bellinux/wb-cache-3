25|$|Massachusetts was {{slower to}} end state support of Congregationalism, but disestablishment was made more likely after the Unitarian schism. Some congregations divided over Unitarianism, {{and there was}} {{confusion}} over which side owned the <b>parish</b> <b>property.</b> In 1820, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in the Dedham case {{that the majority of}} the parish (not just the church members) were entitled to the property. This effectively disenfranchised conservatives in the Boston area, who were usually the minority.|$|E

John Lindsay (of unknown religious affiliation but also on the County Court). Lord Fairfax in 1753 donated land as a glebe to support the minister, which remained <b>parish</b> <b>property</b> until the legal divisions of 1770.

2500|$|On December 19, 2008, a Virginia {{trial court}} ruled that eleven congregations of former Episcopalians could keep <b>parish</b> <b>{{property}}</b> when the members of these congregations split from the Episcopal church to form the Anglican District of Virginia (ADV).

2500|$|On June 29, 1856 Bishop Mathias Loras of Dubuque {{laid the}} {{cornerstone}} for the church. [...] Antoine LeClaire directed {{the construction of}} the church, which was named St. Margaret (or sometimes listed as St. Marguerite) in honor of St. Margaret of Scotland and Marguerite LeClaire. [...] The church was built of red brick in the Romanesque Revival style. [...] A frame rectory was built next to the church. [...] It was moved {{to the back of the}} <b>parish</b> <b>property</b> in 1859 and a brick rectory replaced it. [...] Once again Antoine LeClaire provided the money. [...] A year later a brick building was built on the west side of the church. [...] It was meant to be a part of a future expansion of the church.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the mixed opinion, 29 <b>parish</b> <b>properties</b> and St. Christopher Camp must be {{returned}} to the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, while the remaining seven parishes of the Episcopal Diocese in South Carolina involved in the lawsuit own their properties. The decision did not settle the question of who owns the name [...] "Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina" [...] and intellectual property because one justice did not participate in that portion of the decision. That left a 2-2 tie and the lower court's ruling remains in place on that issue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{settlement}} eventually {{cost the}} diocese $120 million; $80 million of {{which came from}} insurance while $40 million came from the mortgage of diocesan properties (most notably Catholic Center/Marydale property in Erlanger). No <b>parish</b> <b>properties</b> were affected by the settlement. Each victim received between $5,000 and $450,000 depending on the severity of their case.

2500|$|After the South Carolina Diocese {{voted to}} withdraw, it sued the {{national}} Episcopal Church to retain control over its property, {{and in a}} court decision announced in February 2015, the local diocese kept $500 million worth of property including the historic Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul. Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein ruled that the conservative diocese and its parishes are [...] "the owners of their real, personal and intellectual property" [...] and that the national church has no legal interest in the properties. However, this ruling was substantially overturned by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on August 2, 2017, which issued a split decision that effectively returns the property of 29 parishes and the St. Christopher Camp and Conference Center to the Episcopal Church in South Carolina, while seven parishes retained their properties because they had never ratified the Episcopal Church's Dennis Canon (a church bylaw meant to impose a trust on <b>parish</b> <b>property).</b> Because of a tie on the court, the Circuit Court's ruling on the name [...] "Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina" [...] and related intellectual property remains in place.|$|E

50|$|In November 2011, {{the diocese}} {{generated}} more controversy when it issued quitclaim deeds to all parishes in the diocese, thereby surrendering any {{claim that it}} might have over <b>parish</b> <b>property.</b> Under the canons of the Episcopal Church, <b>parish</b> <b>property</b> is held in trust for the diocese and the national church; however, South Carolina's diocesan chancellor defended the quitclaim deeds by citing a recent state Supreme Court ruling that the Episcopal Church's property canon was not binding on All Saints Parish in Pawleys Island.

The church was dedicated November 10, 1907. It was described at the time as Romanesque, seventy-five feet wide by 200 feet deep and sixty feet high.

50|$|By 1854, {{the parishioners}} built their first church, a log structure, and the <b>parish's</b> <b>property</b> was {{expanded}} with {{the purchase of}} land for a cemetery and a small rectory in 1861. By this time, growth in membership rendered the church {{too small for the}} numbers of worshippers, but the parish was too poor to erect a replacement. Under the leadership of Joseph Gregory Dwenger, the parish received encouragement from Archbishop John Baptist Purcell, and other churches in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati contributed significant amounts of money for construction; the parish finished its new church in 1867 at a cost of $12,000. Designed by Minster architect Anton Goehr, the new church was a simple rectangular brick structure with a bell tower, supported by a stone foundation. The original church was moved to the banks of the canal in downtown St. Marys.|$|R
