40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} {{are considered}} an inefficient technology for long-term phosphorus (P) removal. The P retention effectiveness of subsurface wetlands {{can be improved}} by using appropriate substrates. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) use sorption isotherms to estimate the P sorption capacity of the two materials, masonry sand and light weight expanded shale; (ii) describe dissolved P removal in small (2. 7 m 3) subsurface flow wetlands; (iii) quantify the forms of P retained by the substrates in the pilot cells; and (iv) use resulting data to assess the technical and economic feasibility of the most promising system to remove P. The P sorption capacity of masonry sand and expanded shale, as determined with Langmuir isotherms, was 60 mg/kg and 971 mg/kg respectively. In the <b>pilot</b> <b>cells</b> receiving secondarily treated wastewater, cells containing expanded shale retained a greater proportion of the incoming P (50. 8 percent) than cells containing masonry sand (14. 5 percent). After a year of operation, samples were analyzed for total P (TP) and total inorganic P (TIP). Subsamples were fractionated into labile-P, Fe+Al-bound P, humic-P, Ca+Mg-bound P, and residual-P. Means and standard deviations of TP retained by the expanded shale and masonry sand were 349 + 169 and 11. 9 + 18. 6 mg/kg respectively. The largest forms of P retained by the expanded shale <b>pilot</b> <b>cells</b> were Fe+Al- bound P (108 mg/kg), followed by labile-P (46. 7 mg/kg) and humic-P (39. 8). Increases in the P forms of masonry sand were greatest in labile-P (7. 5 mg/kg). The cost of an expanded shale wetland is within the range of costs conventional technologies for P removal. Accurate cost comparisons are dependent upon expansion capacity of the system under consideration. Materials with a high P sorption capacity also have potential for enhancing P removal in other constructed wetland applications such as stormwater wetlands and wetlands for treating agricultural runoff...|$|R

A column {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the ability of various substrates to support sulfate reducing bacteria and remove sulfate from iron mining tailings basin water in northern Minnesota. The tailings water has a pH of around 7. 5, 800 mg/L of sulfate {{and low levels of}} iron and trace metals. Although sulfate was removed in all columns, overall removal rates varied widely between substrates, ranging from 270 to about 3000 mmoles/m 3 /day. The best removal occurred in the columns that were fed an organic carbon source, either ethanol or molasses. An organic substrate based column, biosolids + sawdust + hay, also had a high reaction rate but produced unacceptable levels of hydrogen sulfide. Effluent sulfate concentrations in some of these columns were below 50 mg/L and the reaction rate may have been sulfate limited. Methanol was also tried as an organic carbon source but the reaction rate was only about 50 % of the rates achieved with ethanol and molasses. Based on the column results, a field <b>pilot</b> <b>cell</b> was designed and constructed in 2002.

This first stages are expected to be the most problematic period for this type of waste. The evolution of the temperature and the composition of leachate and gas at various points within the cell are included.

However, there was a quick wash, reducing concentrations to below one third of the initial values before the first year. pH values influenced concentrations of some pollutants such as copper.

40|$|A new {{boundary}} condition treatment has been devised for two-phase flow numerical simulations in a self-aerated minerals flotation machine {{and applied to}} a Wemco 0. 8 m 3 <b>pilot</b> <b>cell.</b> Airflow rate is not specified a priori but is predicted by the simulations as well as power consumption. Time-dependent simulations of two-phase flow in flotation machines are essential to understanding flow behavior and physics in self-aerated machines such as the Wemco machines. In this paper, simulations have been conducted for three different uniform bubble sizes (db = 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 0 mm) to {{study the effects of}} bubble size on air holdup and hydrodynamics in Wemco pilot cells. Moreover, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based flotation model has been developed to predict the pulp recovery rate of minerals from a flotation cell for different bubble sizes, different particle sizes and particle size distribution. The model uses a first-order rate equation, where models for probabilities of collision, adhesion and stabilization and collisions frequency estimated by Zaitchik- 2010 model are used for the calculation of rate constant. Spatial distributions of dissipation rate and air volume fraction (also called void fraction) determined by the two-phase simulations are the input for the flotation kinetics model. The average pulp recovery rate has been calculated locally for different uniform bubble and particle diameters. The CFD-based flotation kinetics model is also used to predict pulp recovery rate in the presence of particle size distribution. Particle number density pdf and the data generated for single particle size are used to compute the recovery rate for a specific mean particle diameter. Our computational model gives a figure of merit for the recovery rate of a flotation machine, and as such can be used to assess incremental design improvements as well as design of new machines...|$|E

We hypothesized that this could alter regional lung mechanics (tissue stiffening or accumulation of fluid and inflammatory cells) through interactions with host cells. We explored this with serial inspiratory computed tomography (CT) and image matching to assess regional changes in lung expansion. We retrospectively assessed 44 pairs of two serial CT scans on 21 sarcoma patients: 12 without lung metastases and 9 with lung metastases. For each subject, two or more serial inspiratory clinically-derived CT scans were retrospectively collected. Two research-derived control groups were included: 7 normal nonsmokers and 12 asymptomatic smokers with two inspiratory scans taken the same day or one year apart respectively. We performed image registration for local-to-local matching scans to baseline, and derived local expansion and density changes at an acinar scale. Welch two sample t test was used for comparison between groups. Statistical significance was determined with a p value < 0. 05. Lung regions of metastatic sarcoma patients (but not the normal control group) demonstrated an increased proportion of normalized lung expansion {{between the first and}} second CT. These hyper-expanded regions were associated with, but not limited to, visible metastatic lung lesions. Compared with the normal control group, the percent of increased normalized hyper-expanded lung in sarcoma subjects was significantly increased (p < 0. 05). There was also evidence of increased lung "tissue" volume (non-air components) in the hyper-expanded regions of the cancer subjects relative to non-hyper-expanded regions. "Tissue" volume increase was present in the hyper-expanded regions of metastatic and non-metastatic sarcoma subjects. This putatively could represent regional inflammation related to the presence of tumor pilot cell-host related interactions.
