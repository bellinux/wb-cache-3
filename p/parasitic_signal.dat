40|$|We {{report a}} kinetic small angle neutron {{scattering}} {{study of the}} skyrmion lattice (SL) in MnSi. Induced by an oscillatory tilting of the magnetic field direction, the elasticity and relaxation of the SL along the magnetic field direction have been measured with microsecond resolution. For the excitation frequency of 325 Hz the SL begins to track the tilting motion of the applied magnetic field under tilting angles exceeding α_c > 0. 4. Empirically the associated angular velocity of the tilting connects quantitatively with the critical charge carrier velocity of approx. 0. 1 mm/s under current driven spin transfer torques, for which the SL unpins. In addition, a pronounced temperature dependence of the skyrmion motion is attributed to the variation of the skyrmion stiffness.

We introduce {{for the first time}} the concept of differential actuation and sensing for flexural type microresonators as a viable solution to improve linearity and <b>parasitic</b> <b>signal</b> rejection properties of the devices as compared with the single-ended one. Three novel mechanical structures of fully-differential flexural resonators are presented, and a theoretical analysis is conducted based on Bernoulli’s beam theory and the equivalent circuit approach developed by Tilmans. Moreover, some features of flexural free-free resonators made with the THELMA process by STMicroelectronics are investigated. We propose a new lumped-parameters equivalent circuit for the description of the main electrical and mechanical properties, and an analytic model for the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency. Both models are verified by means of numerical, finite-element simulations performed with FEMLAB. Finally, two set-ups for electrical characteristic measurement of flexural free-free resonators were developed.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{separate}} the non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering signal of a micro-metric sample contained inside a diamond anvil cell (DAC) from the signal originating from the high-pressure sample environment is described. Especially for high-pressure experiments, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>signal</b> originating from the diamond anvils, the gasket and/or the pressure medium can easily obscure the sample signal or even render the experiment impossible. Another severe complication for high-pressure non-resonant inelastic X-ray measurements, such as X-ray Raman scattering spectroscopy, can be {{the proximity of the}} desired sample edge energy to an absorption edge energy of elements constituting the DAC. It is shown that recording the scattered signal in a spatially resolved manner allows these problems to be overcome by separating the sample signal from the spurious scattering of the DAC without constraints on the solid angle of detection. Furthermore, simple machine learning algorithms facilitate finding the corresponding detector pixels that record the sample signal. The outlined experimental technique and data analysis approach are demonstrated by presenting spectra of the Si L- 2,L- 3 -edge and O K-edge of compressed alpha-quartz. The spectra are of unprecedented quality and both the O K-edge and the Si L- 2,L- 3 -edge clearly show the existence of a pressure-induced phase transition between 10 and 24 GPa...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{inexpensive}} means to measure background-free photoinduced absorption spectra by implementing a dual optical modulation scheme. Our objective is to measure quasi-steady-state absorption spectra of long-lived photoexcitations, such as polarons and triplet excitons in organic semiconductors, when the photoluminescence of the sample is strong compared to the photoinduced absorption signal. In our instrument, we modulate a continuous-wave laser at a frequency f_pu with a mechanical chopper before exciting the material. We measure the fractional change of transmission of the sample with a tuneable monochromatic probe source modulated at a frequency f_pr, and with a digital lockin amplifier at a reference frequency f_ref = f_pu + f_pr. We generate the reference sinusoidal wave for the lockin amplifier using a simple home-built electronic circuit that generates their sum-frequency signal. This scheme allows measurement of the fractional change of transmittance of the sample induced by the pump laser at a frequency f_pu + f_pr without <b>parasitic</b> <b>signal</b> at a frequency f_pu, such as photoluminescence of the sample or pump-laser scatter.

The method is based on compensation of the stray-light components induced by the non-idealities of both the incident light beam and a Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonator. The compensation structure consists of the same layer stack as used in the active F-P filter. The {{difference is that the}} optical length of the cavity is decreased below λ/ 10 (< 40 nm if applied for measurements in the visible spectral range).
