5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says this indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E
5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron <b>plough.</b> <b>In</b> addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in addition to the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

25|$|The Romans {{achieved}} the heavy wheeled mouldboard <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> the late 3rd and 4th century AD, when archaeological evidence appears, inter alia, in Roman Britain. The first indisputable appearance after the Roman period is from 643, in a northern Italian document. Old words {{connected with the}} heavy plough and its use appear in Slavic, suggesting possible early use in this region. The general adoption of the carruca heavy <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> Europe appears to have accompanied {{the adoption of the}} three-field system in the later eighth and early ninth centuries, leading to an improvement of the agricultural productivity per unit of land in northern Europe. This was accompanied by larger fields as well, known variously as carucates, ploughlands, and ploughgates.|$|E
25|$|One set of ploughs was right-handed, and {{the other}} left-handed, {{allowing}} continuous ploughing along the field, as with the turnwrest and reversible ploughs.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date of ploughing (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat. The 3 -cut system resulted in nitrate losses below the limit of the EC Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC), even with <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn. When <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently of ploughing time. With swards mulched and <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit. The management of grass-clover swards did not affect the yield of wheat, whereas <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn increased the yield. It is concluded, that appropriate grass-clover management and date of ploughing can reduce N-leaching, even in stockless farms...|$|R

The cart had disc wheels that dug into the ground so that the cart acted as an anchor for the pulley.

25|$|The agrarian {{reforms of}} the Mughal Empire also {{played a crucial role}} in {{developing}} Bengali Muslim society. According to historian Richard M. Eaton, Islam became the religion of the <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> the Bengal delta. The delta was the most fertile region in the empire. Mughal development projects cleared forests and established thousands of Sufi-led villages, which became industrious farming and craftsmanship communities. The projects were most evident in the Bhati region of East Bengal, the most fertile part of the delta.|$|E

On the other side of these coins is Vasudeva-Krishna holding the conch and chakra. Other than being evidence of Balarama's significance in ancient times, according to Singh and Classical Numismatic Group, these suggest that he and Krishna were a part of the developing interaction between Hellenistic Greeks and ancient Indians.|$|E

25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper parts}} of the frame carry (from the front) the {{coupling}} for the motive power (horses), the coulter and the landside frame. Depending {{on the size of}} the implement, and the number of furrows it is designed to plough at one time, a forecarriage with a wheel or wheels (known as a furrow wheel and support wheel) may be added to support the frame (wheeled <b>plough).</b> <b>In</b> the case of a single-furrow plough there is only one wheel at the front and handles at the rear for the ploughman to steer and manoeuvre it.|$|E
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The {{closest thing to a}} formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
40|$|Litterbag {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} {{different}} ploughing depths on decomposition rate of barley straw with different ploughing depths. The burying depth of the litter (13 vs 25 cm) affected the decomposition rate of barely straw more than the different ploughing depths (13 vs 25 cm). From our results we suggest that slowly decomposable organic matter, such as leached barley straw, may be incorporated deeply by <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> organic cereal production systems, in order to regulate perennial weeds. In soils with good structure and porosity, the decomposition rate of straw can even be larger with deep <b>ploughing.</b> <b>In</b> dense, clayey soils {{it is important to be}} very accurate <b>in</b> <b>ploughing</b> time <b>in</b> order to secure that the <b>ploughing</b> is <b>in</b> fact loosening the soil. Otherwise, lack of oxygen and low decomposition of straw is likely to be the results...|$|R

25|$|A {{story told}} by the 13th-century Icelandic mythographer Snorri Sturluson in his Prose Edda {{about the origin of}} Mälaren was {{probably}} originally about Vänern: the Swedish king Gylfi promised a woman, Gefjon, as much land as four oxen could <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> a day and a night, but she used oxen from the land of the giants, and moreover uprooted the land and dragged it into the sea, where it became the island of Zealand. The Prose Edda says that 'the inlets in the lake correspond to the headlands in Zealand'; since this is much more true of Vänern, the myth was probably originally about Vänern, not Mälaren.|$|E
25|$|In America {{the firm}} {{soil of the}} Plains allowed direct pulling with steam tractors, such as the big Case, Reeves or Sawyer-Massey {{breaking}} engines. Gang ploughs of up to fourteen bottoms were used. Often these big ploughs were used in regiments of engines, so that in a single field there might be ten steam tractors each drawing a <b>plough.</b> <b>In</b> this way hundreds of acres could be turned over in a day. Only steam engines {{had the power to}} draw the big units. When internal combustion engines appeared, they had neither the strength nor the ruggedness compared to the big steam tractors. Only by reducing the number of shares could the work be completed.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven plough for normal ploughing, {{rather than just}} drainage channels. However normal ploughing was much lighter work that could be achieved perfectly well {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven plough was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the plough’s efficiency would be to design a plough that could <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the plough that had two ploughs attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two plough blades would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the plough was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly ready for the next furrow.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Norman conquest of England, between 1069 and 1070, William the Conqueror led a {{military}} {{campaign against the}} Saxon Earl Edwin, who ruled England north of the River Mersey. On the campaign's successful conclusion, William gave his kinsman Roger de Poictou all of the land between the River Mersey and the River Ribble. Part of this land was in turn given to Albert de Greslet, who {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, bestowed as much land as a team of oxen could <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> one-year on Orme Fitz Seward, the son of Edward Aylward. It is probable that the name Urmston is derived from Orme's Easton, or Ormestun, the [...] "tun" [...] or dwelling of Orme Fitz Seward.|$|E
500|$|The {{mechanisation}} and rationalisation {{of agriculture}} was another important factor. Robert Bakewell and Thomas Coke introduced selective breeding, and initiated {{a process of}} inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century, such as the New Leicester sheep. Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation, such as Jethro Tull's seed drill of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and Andrew Meikle's threshing machine of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham iron <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> 1730 to James Small's improved [...] "Scots Plough" [...] metal in 1763. In 1789 Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies was producing 86 plough models for different soils. Powered farm machinery began with Richard Trevithick's stationary steam engine, used to drive a threshing machine, in 1812. Mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the 19th century. The first petrol-driven tractor was built in America by John Froelich in 1892.|$|E
