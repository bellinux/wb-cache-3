5|$|During 2006, Teaneck {{underwent}} a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This revaluation adjusted <b>property</b> <b>values</b> to market prices, ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, {{an increase of}} 132.1% from the prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year. In {{the wake of the}} revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year. The township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine <b>property</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E

50|$|Together/Plus Mortgages {{represent}} loans of 100% {{or more of}} the <b>property</b> <b>value</b> - typically up to {{a maximum}} of 125%. Such loans are normally (but not universally) structured as a package of a 95% mortgage and an unsecured loan of up to 30% of the <b>property</b> <b>value.</b> This structure is mandated by lenders' capital requirements which require additional capital for loans of 100% {{or more of the}} <b>property</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland Farms. In the mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen city blocks of ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent to the land which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later these communities would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and <b>property</b> <b>values</b> became threatened.|$|E
5|$|Mayfair is {{the most}} {{expensive}} property on the standard British Monopoly board at £400, and is part of the dark blue set with Park Lane. It commands the highest rents out of all properties; landing on Mayfair with a hotel costs £2,000. The price is a reference to the <b>property</b> <b>values</b> in the area, which have remained consistently high, with real-life rent as much as £36,000 per week. At the time the board was being designed in the 1930s, Mayfair still had a significant upper-class residential population.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and <b>property</b> <b>values</b> slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the {{construction of}} taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E

50|$|Since 2007, {{those most}} exposed to {{negative}} equity are borrowers who obtained loans {{of a high}} percentage of the <b>property</b> <b>value</b> (such as 90% or even 100%).

50|$|Panama has a Property Tax {{based on}} the value of the land and its {{improvements}} with the maximum annual rate being 2.1% of the total value. Prior to 2012, Panama had several laws exempting certain residential real properties from paying the property tax for 20 years. Starting in 2012, the property tax exemption changed to 15 years for residential <b>properties</b> <b>valued</b> up to $100,000 USD; 10 years for <b>properties</b> <b>valued</b> from $100,000 to $250,000; and a 5-year exemption for <b>properties</b> <b>valued</b> above $250,000.

5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and <b>property</b> <b>values</b> would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase <b>property</b> <b>values,</b> and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, <b>property</b> <b>values</b> plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} <b>property</b> <b>values</b> in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was {{extended}} by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike. The {{construction of the}} extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. New apartment buildings were being built {{as a result of}} the subway line, and it transformed both Forest Hills and Kew Gardens from quiet residential communities of one-family houses to active population centers. Following the line's completion, there was an increase in the <b>property</b> <b>values</b> of buildings around Queens Boulevard. On April 24, 1937, the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{was extended}} four stops to 169th Street, with 169th Street and Parsons Boulevard serving as terminals.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{practice}} in the residential mortgage underwriting industry is to estimate collateral values via independent appraisals conducted by third parties. This paper empirically examines the role of <b>property</b> <b>value</b> ("i. e. ", appraisal) uncertainty as a determinant of default on residential mortgage loans. Based upon an analysis of 1, 428 residential loans drawn from the portfolio of a national mortgage lender, we find evidence that semivariance in <b>property</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty is related to default risk. Specifically, subject <b>properties</b> that are <b>valued</b> above the sales price of recently sold "similar and proximate" properties show evidence of greater default risk. Interestingly, a variance (range) measure of <b>property</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty is not significantly related to default risk. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R
5|$|The Great Fire of 1835 {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} old financial buildings, and {{in their}} place {{a wide variety of}} new buildings were erected and demolished in quick succession during the 1840s and 1850s; traveler Philip Hone suggested that the entire city was being rebuilt every decade. Most buildings adopted the Italian Renaissance inspired palazzo-style of architecture popular in England, and rose no more than five or six stories. New York did not have any restrictions on the height of buildings, but in practice low-rise buildings were the norm, at least until 1865, with the tallest buildings being the city's churches. New York's population tripled between 1840 and 1870, and <b>property</b> <b>values</b> soared, increasing by more than 90 percent between 1860 and 1875.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski station spurred {{commercial}} {{development in the}} Archer Heights neighborhood. Area development began even before the station opened, as the Midway Square shopping mall opened at Pulaski Road and 51st Street in 1988 {{in anticipation of the}} potential customers the Orange Line would bring. The station's opening continued the trend of development, and Pulaski station was credited with boosting business in Archer Heights and doubling <b>property</b> <b>values</b> in the neighborhood. The station also created a parking problem in the neighborhood. The station's parking lot filled up as early as 7 A.M. most workdays, causing commuters to park on residential streets. The commuters prompted local residents to ban non-residents from parking on certain streets during daytime hours.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would {{have a positive effect on}} <b>property</b> <b>values</b> in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E

5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction wrought by Hurricane Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> Research {{indicates that the}} typical hurricane strike raises real house prices {{for a number of}} years, with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence. However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the freeway opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. <b>Property</b> <b>values</b> in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby <b>property</b> <b>values,</b> as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
