40|$|We {{observed}} the decrease of the hysteresis effect and {{the transition from}} the stable to the dynamic domain regime in doped superlattices with increasing temperature. The current-voltage characteristics and the behaviours of the domain boundary are dominated by the temperature-dependent lineshape of the electric field dependence of the drift velocity (V(F)), As the <b>peak-valley</b> <b>ratio</b> in the V(F) curve decreases with increasing temperature, the hysteresis will diminish and temporal current self-oscillations will occur. The simulated calculation, which takes the difference in V(F) curves into consideration, gives a good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the behavior of the new generation of SensL SiPM arrays, ArrayB and ArrayM, for PET/MR applications. The evaluation of the SiPMs performance underwent with pixelated GaGG and BGO scintillators with 2 x 2 x 5 mm 3 pixel size and various coupling schemes for 511 keV and 662 keV energies. To acquire raw images, we used a symmetric resistive voltage division network and the 4 x 4 SiPMs anodes reduced to 2 X and 2 Y position signals. A FPGA Spartan 6 LX 150 T was used for triggering and digital processing of the pulses acquired using free running ADCs. The first step of our work was optimization of the bias voltage of the two SiPM arrays. The optimal bias voltage is a tradeoff between high photon detection efficiency and low excess noise factor. The SiPMs were coupled to homogeneous 16 x 16 x 10 mm 3 CsITl scintillator and irradiated with 137 Cs source. The energy resolution calculated in overvoltages between 26.5 V and 30.5 V for ArrayB and between 28.3 V and 31.3 V for ArrayM. The bias voltage with the best energy resolution was used for the evaluation of the SiPMs. The clear visualization of the GaGG and BGO crystal elements is expressed quantitatively by the mean <b>peak-valley</b> <b>ratio</b> of a horizontal profile in the raw images. The best optical coupling for the BGO was 2 mm thick glass. In the case of the GaGG 1 mm thick glass was adequate. The mean energy resolution of the GaGG scintillator is about two times better than the BGO for both type of SiPMs, after applying correction for their non-linear response. The low light output of the BGO scintillator in comparison with the GaGG as well as different emission spectra and the different PDE of the two types of SiPMs explain the differences in the behavior of the tested SiPMs arrays.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of GaN interband tunnel junction showing forward tunneling characteristics. We have achieved very high forward tunneling currents (153 mA/cm 2 at 10 mV, and 17. 7 A/cm 2 peak current) in polarization-engineered GaN/InGaN/GaN heterojunction diodes grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We also report the observation of repeatable negative differential resistance in interband III-Nitride tunnel junctions, with <b>peak-valley</b> current <b>ratio</b> (PVCR) of 4 at room temperature. The forward current density achieved in this work meets the typical current drive requirements of a multi-junction solar cell. Comment: 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|A 1 GaAs/ 1 nGaAs high {{electron}} mobility transistors (HEMTs) and AlAs/GaAs resonant tunnelling diodes (RTDs) are integrated on GaAs substrates. Molecular beam epitaxy {{is used to}} grow the RTD on the HEMT structure. The current-voltage characteristics of the RTD and HEMT are obtained on a two-inch wafer.

40|$|Preclinical {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} with 20 – 30 μm wide, 10 mm high parallel microbeams of hard, broad-‘‘white’’-spectrum x rays (50 – 600 keV) to investigate microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) of brain tumors in infants for whom other kinds of radiotherapy are inadequate and/or unsafe. Novel physical microdosimetry (implemented with MOSFET chips in the ‘‘edge-on’’ mode) and Monte Carlo computer-simulated dosimetry are described here for selected points in the peak and valley regions of a microbeam-irradiated tissue-equivalent phantom. Such microbeam irradiation causes minimal damage to normal tissues, possible because of rapid repair of their microscopic lesions. Radiation damage from an array of parallel microbeams tends to correlate with the range of <b>peak-valley</b> dose <b>ratios</b> (PVDR). This paper summarizes comparisons of our dosimetric MOSFET measurements with Monte Carlo calculations. Peak doses at depths 3 ̆c 22 mm are 18...|$|R
40|$|The tunneling-FET (TFET) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a prospective MOSFET replacement technology with the potential to extend geometric and electrostatic scaling of digital integrated circuits. However, experimental demonstrations of the TFET have yet to reliably achieve drive currents necessary to power large scale integrated circuits. Consequentially, much effort has gone into optimizing the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) efficiency of the TFET. In this work, the Esaki tunnel diode (ETD) is used as a short loop element to map and optimize BTBT performance for a large design space. The experimental results and tools developed for this work may be used to (1) map additional and more complicated ETD structures, (2) guide development of improved TFET structures and BTBT devices, (3) design ETDs targeted BTBT characteristics, and (4) calibrate BTBT models. The first objective was to verify the quality of monolithically integrated III-V based ETDs on Si substrates (the industry standard). Five separate GaAs/InGaAs ETDs were fabricated on GaAs-virtual substrates via aspect ratio trapping, along with two companion ETDs grown on Si and GaAs bulk substrates. The quality of the virtual substrates and BTBT were verified with (i) very large <b>peak-valley</b> current <b>ratios</b> (up to 56), (ii) temperature measurements, and (iii) deep sub-micron scaling. The second objective mapped the BTBT characteristics of the In 1 -xGaxAs ternary system by (1) standardizing the ETD structure, (2) limiting experimental work to unstrained (i) GaAs, (ii) In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As, and (iii) InAs homojunctions, and (3) systematically varying doping concentrations. Characteristic BTBT trendlines were determined for each material system, ranging from ultra-low to ultra-high peak current densities (JP) of 11 μA/cm 2 to 975 kA/cm 2 for GaAs and In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As, respectively. Furthermore, the BTBT mapping results establishes that BTBT current densities can only be improved by ~ 2 - 3 times the current record, by increasing doping concentration and In content up to ~ 75 %. The E. O. Kane BTBT model has been shown to accurately predict the tunneling characteristics for the entire design space. Furthermore, it was used to help guide {{the development of a new}} universal BTBT model, which is a closed form exponential using 2 fitting parameters, material constants, and doping concentrations. With it, JP can quickly be predicted over the entire design space of this work...|$|R
