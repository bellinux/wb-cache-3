In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E

Bouchut presented this experimental technique along with the results he had achieved in the first seven cases at the French Academy of Sciences conference on 18 September 1858. The members of the Academy rejected Bouchut's ideas, {{largely as a result of}} highly critical and negative remarks made by the influential Armand Trousseau. Undaunted, Bouchut later introduced a set of tubes ("Bouchut's tubes") for intubation of the trachea, as an alternative to tracheotomy in cases of diphtheria.|$|E

40|$|The ultrastructural {{organization}} of the nucleus during late oogenesis in Rana temporaria was examined in normal and in hormone-stimulated maturing oocytes in vitro. At this stage numerous nucleoli are assembled around a knot of highly contracted chromosomes (the karyosphere) making up a karyosphere capsule. The nucleoli are fibrillar. They bear no pro-ribosomal granules and do not synthesize RNA. This period is characterized by segregation of nucleolar material into core and cortex. The nucleoli are of irregular shape. The presence of micronucleoli and nuclear bodies indicates an intensive fragmentation of nucleolar material. In the central fibrous zone of the capsule separating the chromosomes from the nucleoli, abundant accumulations of annuli lacking any membranous component occur. The annuli are connected by fibrous material and are regularly packed, forming peculiar <b>pseudomembranes</b> which are connected directly to the chromatin. <b>Pseudomembranes,</b> though less abundant and Jess regularly packed, are {{also found in the}} middle zone of the capsule. Along with annuli, membranous areas of various sizes and shapes are found in the <b>pseudomembranes.</b> Pseudo-membranes are linked to micronuclei by granular filaments 20 - 30 nm thick. A variety of membranous structures in the form of intranuclear annulate lamellae or mem-tranous tubular formations was detected in the peripheral zone of the capsule and outside it. The conclusion is drawn that the fibrous component of the karyosphere capsule consists of different membranous and pseudomembranous structures. It is suggested that chromatin participates directly in the formation of <b>pseudomembranes</b> and intranuclear membranous structures...|$|R

50|$|Bacterial {{conjunctivitis}} {{causes the}} rapid onset of conjunctival redness, {{swelling of the}} eyelid, and mucopurulent discharge. Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2-5 days. Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep. Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis is involved.Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness.

The previously taken biopsies of the adenocarcinoma were reevaluated and showed a clear cell lesion. Further immunohistochemical examination with antibodies against p 16, Ki 67, CEA, and p 53 could not prove its malignant character. As a result we diagnosed an atypical form of microglandular hyperplasia in a patient with ligneous cervicitis. Ligneous cervicitis is a rare inflammatory condition that might affect all mucus membranes in patients with plasminogen deficiency. This case shows the importance of correlating pathologic and clinical findings in the diagnosis of ligneous cervicitis because of the rarity of the disease and the heterogeneity at presentation. © 2013 International Society of Gynecological Pathologists...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{characterized}} by a coating or individual patches of pseudomembranous white slough that can be easily wiped away to reveal erythematous (reddened), and sometimes minimally bleeding, mucosa beneath. These areas of <b>pseudomembrane</b> are sometimes described as [...] "curdled milk", or [...] "cottage cheese". The white material is made up of debris, fibrin, and desquamated epithelium that has been invaded by yeast cells and hyphae that invade to the depth of the stratum spinosum. Due to the fact that an erythematous surface is revealed beneath the pseudomembranes, some consider pseudomembranous candidiasis and erythematous candidiasis stages of the same entity. Some sources state that if there is bleeding when the <b>pseudomembrane</b> is removed, then the mucosa has likely been affected by an underlying process such as lichen planus or chemotherapy. Pseudomembraneous candidiasis can involve any part of the mouth, but usually it appears on the tongue, buccal mucosae or palate.|$|E

5000|$|Fibrinous inflammation: Inflammation {{resulting}} in a large increase in vascular permeability allows fibrin {{to pass through the}} blood vessels.

This is commonly seen in serous cavities, where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function.

40|$|We {{have noted}} that prairie dogs given {{cefoxitin}} develop diarrhea and lose weight yet survive for periods of up to 4 weeks. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that cefoxitin causes Clostridium difficile cecitis in prairie dogs. Six prairie dogs were given a single intramuscular dose of 100 mg of cefoxitin per kg of body weight, and six control animals received saline; both groups were sacrificed 1 week later. Controls had no diarrhea and lost 2 % of their body weight, whereas cefoxitin-treated animals had diarrhea (P less than 0. 001) and lost 16 % of their body weight (P less than 0. 001); one animals died 6 days after cefoxitin challenge. None of the controls yielded C. difficile or had cecal cytotoxin or <b>pseudomembranes</b> detected.

Clinical data, 25 biopsy specimens and two autopsies from these patients are reviewed. All presented with crampy abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Colonoscopic findings included edema, erythema, <b>pseudomembranes</b> and hemorrhage. On biopsy, two patients had ischemic colitis, one had pseudomembranous colitis and three had {{a combination of}} concurrent ischemic and pseudomembranous colitis. Four cases showed fibrin-platelet thrombi in mucosal capillaries and submucosal arterioles. The classical pattern of infectious colitis was not seen in these cases. Other nonspecific changes included patchy mucosal edema, congestion, focally prominent interstitial hemorrhage and mild, patchy increase of the lymphoplasmocytic component of the lamina.
