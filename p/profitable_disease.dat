40|$|Gray {{leaf spot}} (GLS) has reached {{threshold}} levels in some corn fields in southwestern Iowa and a fungicide application {{should be considered}} for these fields. As many as 5 - 20 gray leaf spot lesions are present on the ear leaf and, in some fields GLS lesions are also present on the leaf above the ear leaf. Approximately one in two plants are infected, and corn is at growth stage VT/R 1. A couple of weeks ago, I summarized data from Greg Shaner at Purdue University, that showed fungicide applications can be <b>profitable</b> when <b>disease</b> pressure is high and the infected hybrid is susceptible to gray leaf spot...|$|R

50|$|Productivity of a citrus groves can be {{retained}} at pre-Huanglongbing levels through a three pronged strategy. Current research {{is aimed at}} the goal of giving the greatest yields for the lowest costs. Indeed, these lower costs are necessitated by the increased per acre cost of caretaking brought upon by Huanglongbing infection. Huanglongbing forces the commercial citrus caretaker to spray his/her block of citrus many more times a year than normal, considerably increasing costs. Per pound prices of citrus must continue increasing for citrus to remain <b>profitable</b> due to <b>disease</b> pressure.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a complex}} neurologic disease of unknown etiology and inheritance pattern, but with increasing incidence among females. The study of aunt/uncle-niece/nephew (AUNN) pairs has potential {{to shed light on}} the on complex trait inheritance as this group can be divided into eight different pair types by gender, MS status, and parent of origin. METHODS: Using a cohort of 807 avuncular MS families with 938 affected AUNN pairs ascertained from a longitudinal, population-based Canadian database, we examined differential MS transmission by separating affected pairs into likely maternal and paternal trait origin. RESULTS: We observed an increased number of avuncular pairs connected through unaffected mothers compared to unaffected fathers (p = 0. 008). To restrict confounders introduced by families with multiple pairs the overall number of maternal and paternal families were compared, to reveal a significantly higher number of maternal families (p = 0. 038). Female-to-male sex ratios were higher among affected nieces/nephews when compared to the sex ratio for aunts/uncles (0. 00042). CONCLUSIONS: This observation independently confirms previous findings of a "maternal parent-of-origin" effect in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. These findings highlight the special contribution that can be derived from avuncular pairs. These underutilized pairings can compare transmission by the gender of affected aunt-uncle, the unaffected transmitting parent, and by that of the affected offspring. This strategy may be especially <b>profitable</b> in <b>diseases</b> where parent-of-origin effects are being sought. These findings also independently confirm the increasing rate of MS in females, demonstrating that familial cases are influenced by the same environmental factors as the general MS population...|$|R
40|$|Herein is {{described}} {{the identification of}} novel inhibitors of key pathogenic proteins, the use of established computational techniques to further drug discovery, {{and the development of}} novel computational methods, with the ultimate goal of identifying small-molecule compounds that, with further development, may serve as future treatments for neglected diseases. Two of the pathogens targeted, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, are neglected because they are tropical, and drugs marketed solely to the developing world are rarely <b>profitable.</b> A third <b>disease,</b> H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza, is somewhat neglected because it is only now emergent. For Trypanosoma brucei, two drug-discovery projects are described, focusing on two crucial enzymes : UDP-galactose 4 '-epimerase and RNA editing ligase 1. For Trypanosoma cruzi, the dynamics of cruzain, a crucial cysteine protease, are studied and characterized. Finally, for influenza, predicted inhibitors of neuraminidase (N 1) are presented. Aside from describing identified enzyme inhibitors, the current work also describes several new methods that may be generally applicable to drug discovery. These new methods include a multidimensional strategy for the identification of secondary targets of known small-molecule inhibitors in the absence of global structural and sequence homology with the primary target protein, a novel computer-aided drug design algorithm (AutoGrow) that combines the strengths of both fragment-based growing and docking algorithms, and an extension to the relaxed complex scheme that accounts for both population-shift and induced-fit contributions to ligand bindin...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of {{conjugated}} linoleic acids (CLAs), vitamin E, and combination of these nutrients on serum lipid profiles and blood pressure (BP) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 87 patients with active RA were divided into four groups receiving one of the following daily supplements for three months: Group C: CLAs 2. 5 g equivalent to 2 g mixture of cis 9 -trans 11 and trans 10 -cis 12 CLAs in a rate of 50 / 50; Group E: vitamin E: 400 mg; Group CE: CLAs and vitamin E at above doses: Group P: placebo. After supplementation, SBP levels decreased significantly in the group C in comparison with groups E and P and mean arterial pressure reduced significantly in groups C and CE. There weren’t significant differences in the levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL/HDL, cholesterol/HDL, fasting blood sugar, C-reactive protein (CRP), arylestrase activity, platelet count and body mass index between groups. CRP dropped nonsignificantly in groups P, C, E and CE (19 %, 24 %, 55 %, and 39 %, respectively). Erythrocytes sedimentation rate levels decreased in groups C, E and CE (P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 05, P ≤ 0. 001, respectively). It is concluded that supplementation of CLAs decreased BP and vitamin E decreased CRP.

40|$|Progressive control {{pathways}} (PCPs) are stepwise {{approaches for}} the reduction, elimination, and eradication {{of human and}} animal diseases. They provide systematic frameworks for planning and evaluating interventions. Here we outline a PCP for tsetse-transmitted animal trypanosomosis, the scourge of poor livestock keepers in tropical Africa. Initial PCP stages focus on the establishment of national coordination structures, engagement of stakeholders, development of technical capacities, data collection and management, and pilot field interventions. The intermediate stage aims at a sustainable and economically <b>profitable</b> reduction of <b>disease</b> burden, while higher stages target elimination. The mixed-record {{of success and failure}} in past efforts against African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) makes the development of this PCP a high priority. Trends: Whilst great strides are being made in the elimination of tsetse-transmitted human African trypanosomosis (HAT or sleeping sickness), progress in the control of African animal trypanosomosis (AAT or nagana) is patchy at best. Progressive pathways (or stepwise, staged approaches) are increasingly used for the control of a number of human and animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, brucellosis, and rabies. A range of tools are coming of age, which enable an evidence-based prioritization, planning, and monitoring of interventions against AAT, including geographic information systems (GIS), species distribution models, and population genetics. Whilst the development of novel drugs against AAT lags behind, the array of techniques for vector control has broadened, and knowledge on their optimal field of application has improved. Among growing concerns on the capacity of sub-Saharan Africa to feed itself in the coming decades, removing the constraints posed by AAT appears more urgent than ever. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
