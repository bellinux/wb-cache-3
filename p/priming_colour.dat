40|$|In {{our daily}} lives, {{information}} concerning temperature is often provided {{by means of}} colour cues, with red typically being associated with warm/hot, and blue with cold. While such correspondences have been known about for many years, they have primarily been studied using subjective report measures. Here we examined this correspondence using two more objective response measures. First, we used the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a test designed to assess the strength of automatic associations between different concepts in a given individual. Second, we used a priming task that involved speeded target discrimination {{in order to assess}} whether <b>priming</b> <b>colour</b> or thermal information could invoke the crossmodal association. The results of the IAT confirmed that the association exists at the level of response selection, thus indicating that a participant’s responses to colour or thermal stimuli are influenced by the colour-temperature correspondence. The results of the priming experiment revealed that priming a colour affected thermal discrimination reaction times (RTs), but thermal cues did not influence colour discrimination responses. These results may therefore provide important clues as to the level of processing at which such colour-temperature correspondences are represented...|$|E
40|$|Bees {{have the}} {{flexibility}} to modulate their response to a visual stimulus according to {{the context in which}} the visual stimulus is seen. They readily learn that in one context a yellow target, but not a blue one, should be approached to reach sucrose and that in another context blue, but not yellow, leads to sucrose. Here we contrast the bumblebee’s ability to use two types of contextual or priming cue in deciding which of two coloured targets to approach. Bumblebees could perform this task well when the pairs of colours to be discriminated were in two different places, so that the cues associated with each place indicated whether the bees should select a blue or a yellow target. In this case the priming cues were presented concurrently with the rewarded stimuli. Priming cues, which occur a little earlier than a rewarded stimulus, seem less powerful in their ability to bias a bee’s choice of rewarded stimulus. We tried with a variety of methods to train bees to use a <b>priming</b> <b>colour</b> to indicate which of two colours should be approached a few seconds later.

40|$|We report data on {{the ability}} of a patient with Balint's {{syndrome}} (GK) to process global information from compound letters. As with other patients with Balint's syndrome, GK was impaired at responding to large, global letters. In Experiment 1 we show that this was due to local capture rather than the absolute size of the stimuli. Also, despite his impairment with global letters, GK showed global interference on local judgements, indicating that some implicit processing took place at the global level. Interestingly, the inability to perceive large global letters was overcome when GK identified a solid, large prime letter prior to the onset of the compound figure (Experiment 2). This priming effect was temporary, and decreased as the interval between the prime and the compound letter increased (Experiment 3). When the prime was an English letter, the effect was maintained even when GK only had to identify the <b>prime's</b> <b>colour,</b> provided a colour-identification block of trials followed rather than preceded a block of trials where prime shapes had to be identified (Experiment 4). In contrast, there was no priming when GK had to identify the colour of English letter primes in a trial block following a block where the task was to identify the colour of Hebrew letter primes (Experiment 5). Overall the data indicate that local capture in Balint's syndrome can be overcome by actively priming a wide attentional window. The results can be interpreted in terms of an interaction between spatial attention and grouping processes that subserves the perception of global compound letters. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{effects of}} TMS {{have been shown}} to depend on various factors, such as neural {{activation}} state, stimulation intensity, and timing of stimulation. Here we examined whether these factors interact, by applying TMS at either sub- or suprathreshold intensity (relative to phosphene threshold, PT) and at different time points during a state-dependent TMS paradigm. The state manipulation involved a behavioral task in which a visual <b>prime</b> (<b>colour</b> grating) was followed by a target stimulus which could be either congruent, incongruent or partially congruent with the colour and orientation of the prime. In Experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied over the early visual cortex (V 1 /V 2) or Vertex (baseline) {{at the onset of the}} target stimulus – timing often used in state-dependent TMS studies. With both subthreshold and suprathreshold stimulation, TMS facilitated the detection of incongruent stimuli while not significantly affecting other stimulus types. In Experiment 2, TMS was applied at 100 ms after target onset –a time window in which V 1 /V 2 is responding to visual input. Only TMS applied at suprathreshold intensity facilitated the detection of incongruent stimuli, with no effect with subthreshold stimulation. The need for higher stimulation intensity is likely to reflect reduced susceptibility to TMS of neurons responding to visual stimulation. Furthermore, the finding that in Experiment 2 only suprathreshold TMS induced a behavioral facilitation on incongruent targets (whereas facilitations in the absence of priming have been reported with subthreshold TMS) indicates that priming, by reducing neural excitability to incongruent targets, shifts the facilitatory/inhibitory range of TMS effects...|$|R
40|$|Embodied {{semantics}} {{proposes that}} mental simulation {{of an action}} word plays an integral role in the comprehension of an action word. A strong prediction made by embodied semantics is that effector-specific activation (which occurs in action execution and observation) should occur during comprehension of effector-related action words. Hard versions of embodied semantics predict that effector-specific activation should occur automatically, whereas soft versions predict that effector-specific activation should occur when attention is directed to action features. A masked paradigm was adopted to access semantic processing while avoiding confounds associated with conscious attention. In the present study, 35 participants completed a masked priming study, where target words represented hand-related verbs {{and the relationship between}} the prime and target was manipulated across three levels. There were semantically related category-congruent primes (hand-related verbs), semantically unrelated category-congruent primes (leg-related verbs) and other semantically unrelated <b>primes</b> (<b>colour</b> words or vocal action words). The depth of feature processing was also manipulated, with a low depth of processing condition to test the hard version of embodied semantics (colour categorisation task), and a high depth of processing condition to test the soft version of embodied semantics (vocal action categorisation task). Results showed no significant differences in priming between semantically related category-congruent prime words (handrelated verbs) and semantically unrelated category-congruent prime words (leg-related verbs) for either categorisation task. These results indicated that effector-specific activation did not occur automatically or when attention was directed to action features, and contradicted both hard and soft versions of embodied semantics.

60|$|But {{of all the}} particoloured {{reptiles}} the chameleon is by far {{the best}} known, and on the whole the most remarkable for his inconstancy of coloration. Like a lacertine Vicar of Bray, he varies incontinently from buff to blue, and from blue back to orange again, under stress of circumstances. The mechanism of this curious change is extremely complex. Tiny corpuscles of different pigments are sometimes hidden {{in the depths of the}} chameleon's skin, and sometimes spread out on its surface in an interlacing network of brown or purple. In addition to this <b>prime</b> <b>colouring</b> matter, however, the animal also possesses a normal yellow pigment, and a bluish layer in the skin which acts like the iridium glass so largely employed by Dr. Salviati, being seen as straw-coloured with a transmitted light, but assuming a faint lilac tint against an opaque absorbent surface. While sleeping the chameleon becomes almost white in the shade, but if light falls upon him he slowly darkens by an automatic process. The movements of the corpuscles are governed by opposite nerves and muscles, which either cause them to bury themselves under the true skin, or to form an opaque ground behind the blue layer, or to spread out in a ramifying mass on the outer surface, and so produce as desired almost any necessary shade of grey, green, black, or yellow. It is an interesting fact that many chrysalids undergo precisely similar changes of colour in adaptation to the background against which they suspend themselves, being grey on a grey surface, green on a green one, and even half black and half red when hung up against pieces of particoloured paper.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{present an}} {{extension}} of a neurobiologically inspired robotics model, termed CoRLEGO (Choice reaching with a LEGO arm robot). CoRLEGO models experimental evidence from choice reaching tasks (CRT). In a CRT participants are asked to rapidly reach and touch an item presented on the screen. These experiments show that non-target items can divert the reaching movement away from the ideal trajectory to the target item. This is seen as evidence attentional selection of reaching targets can leak into the motor system. Using competitive target selection and topological representations of motor parameters (dynamic neural fields) CoRLEGO is able to mimic this leakage effect. Furthermore if the reaching target is determined by its colour oddity (i. e. a green square among red squares or vice versa), the reaching trajectories become straighter with repetitions of the target colour (colour streaks). This <b>colour</b> <b>priming</b> effect can also be modelled with CoRLEGO. The paper also presents {{an extension of}} CoRLEGO. This extension mimics findings that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the motor cortex modulates the <b>colour</b> <b>priming</b> effect (Woodgate et al., 2015). The results with the new CoRLEGO suggest that feedback connections from the motor system to the brain’s attentional system (parietal cortex) guide visual attention to extract movement-relevant information (i. e. colour) from visual stimuli. This paper adds to growing evidence {{that there is a}} close interaction between the motor system and the attention system. This evidence contradicts the traditional conceptualization of the motor system as the endpoint of a serial chain of processing stages. At the end of the paper we discuss CoRLEGO’s predictions and also lessons for neurobiologically inspired robotics emerging from this work...|$|R

The influence of red or blue coloured prices is evaluated with regards to perceived price, perceived value, and purchase intention. Price and value are shown to be perceived significantly better if coloured prices are used.

40|$|How can {{perception}} {{be altered}} by language?” {{is the fundamental}} question of this article. Indeed, various studies have pointed out the influence of colour-related knowledge on object and colour perception, evoked by linguistic stimuli. Here {{the relevance of the}} simulationist approach is assumed in order to explain this influence, where the understanding of colour-related words or sentences involves a process of colour simulation that is supported by a neuronal network partially similar to the network involved in colour perception. Consequently, colour-related knowledge and colour perception can interact through a process of pattern interference. In support of this idea, studies are discussed showing <b>priming</b> effects between <b>colour</b> simulation and colour perception, but two limitations are also raised. Firstly, these works all used between-category colour discrimination tasks that allow the intervention of lexical processes that can also explain priming. Secondly, these works control the congruency link between prime and target at the level of ‘colour category’, and no demonstration is made of an influence at the level of specific hues. Consequently, the simulationist view of language/perception interactions seems an interesting way to thinking but more experimens are needed in order to overcome some limitations...|$|R
40|$|Five {{experiments}} examined associative or identity priming {{effects in}} a colour-naming task with colour-neutral words. In Experiment 1, subjects instructed {{to read the}} prime silently showed no associative priming effect but a colour-naming facilitation with identity priming. In Experiment 2, the typical associative <b>priming</b> interference in <b>colour</b> naming was demonstrated in subjects recalling the prime word, but not in subjects reading the prime silently, whereas associative primes facilitated word naming regardless of the prime response requirement. The remaining studies investigated the colour-naming facilitation observed with identity primes. Experiment 3 showed no effects on the facilitation of colour naming from varying the letter case of a silently read prime. Experiment 4 showed facilitation when subjects recalled the prime, and a target frequency effect, with faster colour-naming latencies for high- and medium- than low-frequency targets. In Experiment 5, there was no facilitation for naming the colour of target words paired with non-word primes differing in their initial letter from the target. Taken together, {{the results suggest that}} the facilitation of colour naming following identical primes reflects faster target word recognition, whereas the associative priming interference reflects an attentional effect...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} how overt {{attention is}} influenced by the <b>colour</b> that is <b>primed</b> when a target word is read during a lexical visual search task. Prior studies have shown that attention can be influenced by conceptual or perceptual overlap between a target word and distractor pictures: attention is attracted to pictures that have the same form (rope―snake) or colour (green―frog) as the spoken target word or is drawn to an object from the same category as the spoken target word (trumpet―piano). The hypothesis for this study was that attention should be attracted to words displayed in the <b>colour</b> that is <b>primed</b> by reading a target word (for example, yellow for canary). An experiment was conducted in which participants' eye movements were recorded whilst they completed a lexical visual search task. The primary finding was that participants' eye movements were mainly directed towards words displayed in the <b>colour</b> <b>primed</b> by reading the target word, even though this colour was not relevant to completing the visual search task.

40|$|Using a novel {{paradigm}} {{to engage}} the long-term mappings between object names and the prototypical colours for objects, we investigated the retrieval of object-colour knowledge as indexed by long-term priming (the benefit in performance from a prior encounter with the same or a similar stimulus); a process about which little is known. We examined priming from object naming on a lexical-semantic matching task. In the matching task participants encountered a visually presented object name (Experiment 1) or object shape (Experiment 2) paired with either a colour patch or colour name. The pairings could either match whereby both were consistent with a familiar object (e. g., strawberry and red) or mismatch (strawberry and blue). We used the matching task to probe knowledge about familiar objects and their colours pre-activated during object naming. In particular, we examined whether the retrieval of object-colour information was modality-specific and whether this influenced priming. Priming varied {{with the nature of}} the retrieval process: object-colour priming arose for object names but not object shapes and beneficial effects of priming were observed for colour patches whereas inhibitory <b>priming</b> arose with <b>colour</b> names.

40|$|The {{experience}} of controlling one’s own actions, and through them {{events in the}} outside world, is a pervasive feature of human mental life. Two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. Action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right keypress actions {{in response to a}} supraliminal visual target. The action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. The specific colour shown depended on whether the participant’s action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the prime identity alone. Unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. Participants rated how much control they experienced over the different colours. Replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. Crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control over colours produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding <b>prime</b> than over <b>colours</b> associated with prime-incompatible actions. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action–effect contingencies. These results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested...|$|R
40|$|Task {{interruption}} is {{a pervasive}} applied problem despite {{a dearth of}} experimental work {{and the absence of}} a developed theoretical framework. Using a novel experimental approach (interrupting problem solving in the Tower of Hanoi task), and theoretical guidance from ACT-R-based models of goal suspension and resumption (Altmann & Trafton, 2002 Anderson & Douglass, 2001), nine experiments were conducted to assess how goal-directed behaviour is affected by interruption. A cost of interruption was exhibited mainly by extended times to resume an interrupted goal compared to an uninterrupted goal. The first empirical series established performance impairments in the form of long resumption latencies for promptly suspended goals and decrements in move accuracy, especially when interruption fell before or during a complex goal-sequence, with performance impaired further by secondary tasks that were similar to primary tasks. The second empirical series revealed that participants opportunistically encode promptly suspended goals for retrieval, a process supported by the associative activation provided by a salient <b>colour</b> <b>priming</b> cue and impaired when such a cue had changed colour and/or location. With a brief time lag before secondary task initiation, participants were able to encode a suspended goal more efficiently, reflected in faster resumption latencies even when secondary tasks were similar and when interruption fell within a complex goal sequence. The findings suggest that suspended goals do not reside in a heightened level of activation such that retrieval is definite (e. g., Goschke & Kuhl, 1993) neither is retrieval always abandoned at longer retention intervals (as suggested by Anderson & Lebiere, 2001). Instead, goals decay as a power function of the time since they were last processed and suffer retroactive interference from other goals, but can be reactivated if appropriately rehearsed and associated with salient retrieval cues (in support of Altmann & Trafton, 2002). In contrast to Altmann and Trafton, participants exhibit retrieval-like behaviour even when interruption is un-signalled, with efficiency augmented by experience of problem solving in the task domain and experience of being interrupted. The current experiments provide a novel insight into interruption management behaviours, particularly that humans are able and willing to adapt strategies to support faster and more efficient transitions back into the primary task...|$|R

40|$|The {{expanding}} waistlines of New Zealanders are {{cause for}} concern. Yet current attempts in-store focused on conscious intentions for health behaviour {{have been met}} with limited success (Papies, 2016). The literature suggests that more subtle approaches might be helpful, {{such as the use}} of store atmospherics to nudge shoppers toward healthier food choices. This thesis asks which store atmospherics are representative of a healthier store environment. It further explores what store atmospherics can be tailored to create a message of healthfulness, and act as a prime to nudge shoppers toward healthier food choices. The stimulus-organism-response paradigm, nudge priming, dual-processing model, situated inference model, spreading activation theory, and the literature on cue congruency lend support to this investigation, which include field observations and an experimental supermarket trial. In Study 1, field observations established what store atmospherics are most prevalent among more-healthy versus less-healthy food retailers. Stores (n = 363) across New Zealand at key locations, representative of all socioeconomic deprivation levels, were observed. Findings demonstrated that more-healthy food stores, defined by foods sold, had more natural wholefood scents present, more-healthy wall imagery, and green shelving. In contrast, less-healthy food stores had more processed food scents, images related to less healthy foods or images unrelated to the foods sold. Study 2, a follow-on experiment, tested findings from the observational study to determine whether more-healthy (versus less-healthy) scent, imagery and <b>colour</b> <b>prime</b> shoppers to make healthier food choices. Following a series of pre-tests to determine health-evoked associations for scent, imagery and colour, a between-subjects experimental design of a 2 (more-healthy scent: herbs versus less-healthy scent: sweet bakery) x 2 (more-healthy colour: green versus less-healthy colour: grey) x 2 (more-healthy imagery: food-related versus less-healthy imagery: food-related) was completed. Participants (n = 220) were recruited from the community to the laboratory and randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions (26 to 34 each group) to complete scenario-based grocery-shopping trips through a virtual supermarket simulated on a computer screen. Findings from Study 2 revealed that participants exposed to herb scent (versus sweet bakery) purchased a healthier basket of goods. Counter to findings from Study 1, however in part, participants exposed to less-healthy imagery (versus more-healthy imagery) and grey (versus green) shelving purchased healthier baskets of goods. In conclusion, the two studies in this thesis reveal that store atmospherics could be used to nudge (remind or alert) shoppers toward healthier food choices in a virtual supermarket. The findings extend current literature on store atmospherics in retailing and marketing, and in other domains such as food, nutrition and health. Store atmospheric cues are examined through the lens of nudge priming, the situated inference model, and System 1 heuristic information processing for the first time. The research conveys practical findings to help retailers achieve corporate social responsibility outcomes and increase profits, and to aid policy makers in minimising less healthy food choices and encouraging more healthy food choices. Methodological underpinnings {{such as the use of}} a virtual store with scent machines in a laboratory, further provide new ways for collecting store atmospheric data and testing theory...|$|R
