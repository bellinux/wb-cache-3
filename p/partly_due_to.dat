5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; {{this may have}} been <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature.|$|E
50|$|He is {{also well}} known for the drama Romanticismo, whose success was <b>partly</b> <b>dued</b> <b>to</b> its {{patriotic}} content; it was later adaptated in a film with the same name directed by Clemente Fracassi and starred by Amedeo Nazzari and Clara Calamai. In theatre Romanticismo and I disonesti found in Paola Pezzaglia an ideal interpreter.|$|R
50|$|Spencer was a trombonist who, {{after playing}} in the band that he led from 1946 to 1949, gave up playing entirely, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> a heart murmur, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> the hard {{economics}} of big bands in {{that began in the}} late 1940s, and <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> the band's record label, Black & White Records, which went out of business in October 1949.|$|R

5|$|Aikido derives {{mainly from}} the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Ueshiba's {{involvement}} with the Ōmoto-kyō religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term aiki-jūjutsu.|$|E
5|$|Before The 3rd Birthdays {{release in}} 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura {{discussed}} the re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II. The release {{was being held}} up <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the {{domestic}} and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has increased significantly, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the increasing affluence of Asia.|$|E

50|$|The life of Joan of Arc {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{documented}} of her era. This is especially remarkable when one considers that she was not an aristocrat but rather a peasant girl. This fact is <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> the trial record, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> also <b>to</b> the records of the later appeal of her case after the war when the trial was investigated and its verdict overturned.|$|R

5|$|The {{consumption}} of coffee, vitamin C and dairy products, {{as well as}} physical fitness, appear to decrease the risk. This is believed to be <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their effect in reducing insulin resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of SEATO members were not located in Southeast Asia. To Australia and New Zealand, SEATO {{was seen as}} a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> having long maintained colonies in the region, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> concerns over developments in Indochina. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India. Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast Asia to be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its Cold War containment policy.|$|E
5|$|Today, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the {{foresight}} or business acumen of Ralph Hawkes, the company controls the copyrights in major 20th-century music.

5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{her role as}} Mother Superior and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made {{a speech to the}} assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E
5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the recovery time of his previous injury.

5|$|Houston is multicultural, in {{part because}} of its many {{academic}} institutions and strong industries, as well as being a major port city. Over 90languages are spoken in the city.

An estimated 400,000 undocumented immigrants reside in the Houston area.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the project}} was subject to {{significant}} delays due to cost overruns and contract re-negotiations. This was <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> difficulties combining refurbished Nimrod MR2 fuselages, which had not been built to a common standard, with newly built wings. The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years, while costs continued to climb.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the city's inland location.

5|$|In 1918, {{he went to}} the Technical College of Delft. From 1919 to 1922, Escher {{attended}} the Haarlem School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing and the art of making woodcuts. He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of subjects (<b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a persistent skin infection) and switched to decorative arts, studying under the graphic artist Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} of the abbey buildings still extant is its church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, whose construction began in 1208 with the transept and the apse. The edifice remained <b>partly</b> unfinished, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> financial and political troubles within the order.|$|R
5|$|In India, {{the sword}} dance Choliya or Saraon of the Kumaon {{region of the}} hills of the Indian state of Uttarakhand started <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their long martial {{tradition}} and also to give protection to marriage processions.

5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his short tenure, and {{because most of}} it was {{together}} with his brother.

5000|$|The Scarlet Empire had {{a longer}} life than many popular novels enjoy, however. This was <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> its humor and its {{effective}} storytelling—and <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> effective promotion by capitalist interests.
