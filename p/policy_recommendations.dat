5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, King's College London {{students}} founded London's first student-led think tank, the King’s Think Tank (formerly {{known as}} KCL Think Tank). With a membership {{of more than}} 2000, {{it is the largest}} organisation of its kind in Europe. This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other policymakers with their ideas. Every September, it produces a peer-reviewed journal of <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations</b> called The Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Research and {{academic}} institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations {{to improve the}} transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan World Economic Forum facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations.</b> The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world. The Group of Thirty (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance.|$|E

5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations</b> {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations</b> and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations,</b> stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes {{published}} The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations</b> for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The {{committee}} issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes <b>policy</b> <b>recommendations.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} banking sector development, stock market development, economic growth, and four other macroeconomic variables in ASEAN countries for the period 1961 – 2012. Using principal component analysis {{for the construction of}} the development indices and a panel vector auto-regressive model for testing the Granger causalities, this study finds the presence of both unidirectional and bidirectional causality links between these variables. The study contributes to understanding the importance of the interrelationship between the variables and combines the different strands of the literature. It also contributes to the literature by focusing on a group of countries that have not been studied before. One particular <b>policy</b> <b>recommendation</b> is to make the banking sector more accessible for those country's inhabitants that do not have bank accounts. Another <b>policy</b> <b>recommendation</b> is to nurture stock market development, which will facilitate the increased raising of capital for investment purposes to enhance economic growth.
