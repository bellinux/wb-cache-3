5000|$|Catholics {{cannot be}} excommunicated unless for some personal, grievously {{offensive}} act. Here, therefore, {{it is necessary}} to state with precision the conditions under which this penalty is incurred. Just as exile presupposes a crime, excommunication presupposes a grievous external fault. Not only would it be wrong for a Christian to be punished without having committed a <b>punishable</b> <b>act,</b> but justice demands a proportion between the offense and the penalty; hence the most serious of spiritual chastisements, i.e. forfeiture of all the privileges common to Christians, is inconceivable unless for a grave fault. Moreover, in order to fall within the jurisdiction of the forum externum, which alone can inflict excommunication, this fault must be external. Internal failings, e.g. doubts entertained against the Catholic Faith, cannot incur excommunication. Most authors add that the offense must be consummated, i.e. complete and perfected in its kind (in genere suo), unless the legislator have ordained otherwise. This, however, is a rule of interpretation rather than a real condition for the incurring of censure, and is tantamount to saying that attempt at a crime does not entail the penalty meted out to the crime itself, but that if the legislator declares that he wishes to punish even the attempt, excommunication is incurred (cf. Const. [...] "Apost. Sedis", III, 1, for attempt at marriage on part of clerics in major orders).|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} a growing {{interest}} in {{issues related to the}} protection of rights and safeguards of ‘children in conflict with the law’ can be observed at the international level. In the light of both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Council of Europe Guidelines on child-friendly justice, in cases concerning children in conflict with the law, an important element of the system of justice is to provide them with a fair trial in which their rights and safeguards are not minimised or denied under the pretext of the child’s best interest. The European Union {{is currently working on a}} proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. The aim of these works is to set common minimum standards throughout the European Union on the rights of children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings and children subject to European arrest warrant proceedings. One of the problems discussed in the course of works on the proposal for the directive is the issue of defining the scope of its application regardless of whether the proceedings in the cases of children in conflict with the law are treated as ‘criminal proceedings’ under the national law. 	During the period of work on the proposal, the European Commission funded an international research project focused on the protection of the rights of interrogated juveniles. The project entitled ‘Protecting Young Suspects in Interrogations: a study on safeguards and best practice’ was coordinated by the University of Maastricht. It aimed at comparing juvenile justice systems in five countries (England and Wales, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and Italy), with particular emphasis on the rights and safeguards provided to juveniles suspected of breaking criminal law during their first interrogation connected with the alleged offence. Comparative legal analysis of juvenile justice systems in the participating countries revealed that, as opposed to Poland, in all other countries the procedure applied in juvenile cases was principally the criminal procedure. Moreover, unlike in Poland, it was commonly accepted that in the cases concerning children in conflict with the law, respecting the child’s best interest did not mean depriving them of the rights and safeguards granted to adults in criminal proceedings. 	In Poland, the proceedings in the cases concerning children in conflict with the law who are accused of displaying signs of demoralisation or committing a <b>punishable</b> <b>act</b> are regulated in a complicated and unclear way. Legislators assume combining the procedural provisions included in the Juvenile Act, the provisions of civil procedure and, to a limited extent, the provisions of criminal procedure. Contrary to legislative assumptions, the first interrogation of a juvenile suspected of punishable acts is most often conducted by the police before the institution of juvenile proceedings via the family court. Although this first interrogation is often decisive in the further course of proceedings, the Juvenile Act does not contain detailed regulations in this regard and only briefly refers to the appropriate application of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 	Empirical research carried out in Poland as part of the project involved individual interviews with lawyers and focus group interviews with both police officers and juveniles. The results of the research indicate that from the perspective of providing juveniles with procedural rights and safeguards, current regulations are far from satisfactory. Because of the limited scope of the conducted research, it is difficult to draw generalised conclusions. However, the results undoubtedly allow the conclusion that the issues regarding providing juveniles interrogated by the police with procedural rights and safeguards ensured in international documents deserve much more attention than has been paid so far. The results of the conducted empirical research constitute another argument for the need of an in-depth discussion on the necessary systemic changes in the Polish juvenile system of justice which is also supported by the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases Adamkiewicz v. Poland and Grabowski v. Poland...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} century, while advocates of prison {{nurseries}} have applauded their individual and societal benefits, opponents have criticized their touchy-feely undertones, arguing that {{children do not}} belong behind bars. New York instituted the first modern prison nursery program in 1901 at its Bedford Hills facility, and the nursery has existed ever since. The federal government {{and a number of}} other states have followed suit in developing programs that, to varying degrees, give mothers and infants an opportunity to remain together until the infant reaches a particular age. The requirements for such programs vary by state but generally only permit women with nonviolent criminal histories to take part. Some states have instituted alternative community-based residential parenting programs that fall between halfway houses and prisons; others have segmented off the prison to build a nursery that will hold both mothers and babies. These institutions recognize the emotional value of allowing mother and child to bond, while simultaneously giving incarcerated mothers an opportunity to learn about the basics of being a parent, both from a practical and an emotional standpoint. On the other hand, many onlookers take offense at the thought of young children being imprisoned for their mothers’ crimes. Why are women allowed to reside with their children, despite committing a <b>punishable</b> <b>act?</b> State governments, along with the federal government, have weighed these issues when creating such programs, and, in the process, have ultimately concluded that keeping families together outweighs the retributive value of incarceration. While nontraditional, this approach to imprisonment is useful for both its deterrent and rehabilitative aspects and may even create multigenerational benefits. As the female prison population continues to grow, many have argued for increasing the number of facilities that offer alternative prison programs for pregnant women. In 2009, 6. 9 % of U. S. prisoners were women, according to the U. S. Department of Justice. In 2004, 4 % of women in state prisons, 3 % of women in federal prisons, and 6 % of women in jails were pregnant. A large majority of women in this group also have at least one child under the age of eighteen at home, and many are single parents. Conversely, less than one in five incarcerated men are single parents. A number of scholars have investigated the societal impact of these family arrangements and have found that, while children whose fathers are incarcerated more often than not live with their mothers, children whose mothers are incarcerated typically live with a nonparent family member or become part of the foster care system. Studies have shown that children who fail to sufficiently bond with their mothers are more likely to suffer from developmental delays, an inability to connect with others, and a greater likelihood of being convicted of a crime later in life. Consequently, it is difficult not to wonder whether incarcerating mothers is more detrimental for the mother or the child. Considering these negative effects, many children may believe they are the ones being punished for their mothers’ crimes. While children who are left with their fathers or other relatives may be subject to poverty, a lack of stimulation, violence, non-nutritious food, or any number of other negative side effects, the in-prison or alternative programs would, in an ideal world, give children a stable, nurturing environment in which they are given significant attention and at least three meals a day. Even though they are surrounded by concrete walls and barbed wire, these babies may ultimately have a better opportunity to begin their lives on the right foot than those children who are separated from their mothers and sent out into the world. Furthermore, using community-based residential parenting programs as a transitional tool equips both mother and child with a sturdy foundation before releasing them into regular society. This Note advocates a hybrid approach to alternative prison programs in which community-based residential parenting programs are not used in lieu of, but in addition to prison nurseries. The combination of the two approaches would maximize the individual emotional benefits to both mother and child and the more general societal benefits while being less susceptible to political criticism. Part I examines the effects prison nurseries and community-based residential parenting programs can have on the cognitive and emotional well-being of both the mother and child in arguing that these programs are beneficial to both parties. Part II explores some of the existing programs and looks to empirical evidence in determining whether the states and federal government have instituted programs that best cater to the emotional needs of mothers and babies. Part III argues for the combined use of these programs to ensure a socially appealing punishment and a logical transitional period for mother and child. Finally, Part IV addresses the arguments against prison nurseries and community-based residential parenting programs and concludes that the individual and societal benefits of these programs outweigh the financial burdens and moral opposition...|$|E
