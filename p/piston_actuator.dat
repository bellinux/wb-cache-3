40|$|This study {{investigated}} nastic materials applied to twisting a rigid beam. Nastic materials contain small, simple machines in a compliant matrix. Here a generic beam must twist by ? 4 degrees; the ? 4 degrees twist is an optimum value {{to change the}} angle of attack on a helicopter?s rotor blade. Small <b>piston</b> <b>actuators</b> distributed through the beam?s outer core provide the internal work needed. By actuating the piston elements in their axial direction, which is transverse to the beam?s central axis, the beam twists as desired. This study?s objective is to gain insight into the geometry, the material property combinations, and the boundary conditions that produce nastic materials and structures that twist. An important performance metric is the work density, which {{is the product of}} blocked stress and free strain. Blocked stress is the maximum actuation stress in a single stroke that produces maximum work output and free strain is the maximum actuation strain that produces the maximum work output. Optimum work density was found for the <b>piston</b> <b>actuators.</b> As it is difficult to model distributed <b>piston</b> <b>actuators</b> across the beam?s outer core, <b>piston</b> <b>actuator?s</b> effective properties are calculated using finite element models and homogenized in the beam?s outer core. As the goal is to twist a beam, an important parameter in comparing the active beam to a passive beam is torsional stiffness. Torsional stiffness is torque per unit deflection. The active beam?s torsional stiffness is 13. 705 MN-m/rad without twist in the initial state, which is 3. 5 times stiffer than the passive beam, and 13. 341 MN-m/rad at the twisted state, which shows that the beam loses 2. 6 % of its stiffness during twist. The passive beam?s density is 1000. 01 kg/m 3 and the active beam?s density is 1399. 42 kg/m 3, which shows that active structures have a weight penalty that must be less than achieving the motion by traditional systems...|$|R

A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a <b>piston</b> <b>actuator</b> in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at-rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically.

The flow is described by the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzman equation. A standard approach to simulate incompressible viscous flows with moving boundaries is the immersed boundary method. In this work, we propose an extension of this approach to a deterministic simulation of rarefied flows. The immersed boundary approach consists in keeping the same mesh all along the calculation: every cell of the mesh remains fixed for all time steps while the domain occupied by the gas changes. This strategy avoids to use moving meshes and remeshing approaches, and should be easily applied to problems with complex geometries. The method has been tested with both specular and diffuse boundary conditions and has been validated on several 1 D problems (moving <b>piston,</b> <b>actuator,</b> etc.).

The spring strain is measured to get an accurate estimate of force. This measurement alone is used in PI feedback to control the force in the actuator. The spring allows for high force fidelity, good force control, minimum impedance, and large dynamic range. A third order linear actuator model is broken into two fundamental cases: fixed load – high force (forward transfer function), and free load – zero force (impedance). These two equations completely describe the linear characteristics of the actuator. This model is presented with dimensional analysis to allow for generalization. A prototype actuator that demonstrates force control and low impedance is also presented. Dynamic analysis of the prototype actuator correlates well with the linear mathematical model.

40|$|A {{product line}} of {{improved}} electrohydraulic linear actuators has been developed. These actuators are designed especially {{for use in}} actuating valves in rocket-engine test facilities. They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, process control valves, dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the actuator cylinder is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a servo amplifier that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo valve shifts, causing a greater flow of hydraulic fluid {{to one side of}} the cylinder and thereby causing the <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> to move to extend or retract a piston rod from the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the servo amplifier.

40|$|The {{construction}} of free form building stagnated, {{due to the}} high construction cost of it. Double curved surfaces are only applied at projects with a high profile and projects above average budget during years. The problem with double curved surfaces is mainly the formwork. The present days used techniques to construct these formworks are statically. For example: wooden, steel or milled EPS formwork could only be used for one shaped elements. The lack of repetition and so the reusability of the formwork, which means that for a free form surface for every element a unique formwork is needed, makes the construction very expensive. A feasible way for mass production of unique shaped double curved elements could be achieved by a flexible formwork: a formwork that can be adjusted in every desired shape. It consists of a flexible layer that can be deformed into the desired curved surface by adjusting for example <b>pistons,</b> <b>actuators</b> or pins. Recently K. Huyghe and A. Schoofs have executed a series of experiments with a flexible formwork, build earlier by D. Rietbergen and Dr. Ir. K. Vollers. The purpose of this master thesis was to solve more aspects of the flexible formwork, {{and to make it}} a feasibly system. The main focus was the behavior of the flexible layer, at some places the flexible layer did not though the actuators. Predicting the behavior of the deformed flexible layer makes an accurate production possible. To be able to determine the behavior of the flexible layer some models are proposed. With these models the reaction forces at the supports could be determined, compression forces means that the flexible layer though the supports. The first model that is proposed, is for a single curved element. For the double curved mould surface two models are proposed, a plate model and a strip model. With tests at the Stevin Laboratory these models are verified, and some other aspects are tested, for example the flexible border of the formwork. Tests indicate that a plate is not suitable for the flexible layer, it buckles due to the plate stresses. The strip mould consists of two layers of strips, perpendicular to each other. The top layer of the strips is the mould surface. Tests showed {{that it is possible to}} produce double curved elements with the strip mould. Conclusions and recommendations. The models that are proposed in this thesis describe the behavior of the flexible layer well. A plate does not fulfil the function of a flexible layer. Tests have shown that it is possible to produce double curved elements with the strip mould as flexible layer. To cover the strips an additional layer is needed. In these tests polyether is used, as well for the borders. The protection of the polyether with sealant made the concrete element very rough.

The parameters {{common to all}} investigations were a Reynolds number of 1000 or 1500 based on the body diameter, and a boundary layer thickness entering the body base of 30 % of the base diameter. Harmonic forcing was accomplished using eight individual <b>piston</b> pump <b>actuators</b> providing blowing and suction disturbances into the boundary layer close to the body base, or into the wake {{at the base of}} the body. This setup allowed the excitation of azimuthal mode numbers up to four. The resulting flow field was evaluated using flow visualization, single wire hot film anemometry, and direct drag force measurements. Four different helical mode combinations were used to force the wake, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, and ± 4. The ± 1 modes are dominant in the natural wake. When forcing the ± 1 modes it was possible to lock their frequency and phase to the forcing over a relatively large frequency range. Within the lock-in range, the wake drag increased by up to 40 %. The mean flow of the wake was axisymmetric. Forcing the ± 2 modes, the lock-in frequency range was significantly smaller and was centered at somewhat higher frequencies. The mean flow in this case was distorted to a four-lobed polygon, and the drag increased by more than 60 %. The ± 3 forcing yielded a flow response that involved neighboring modes with significant amplitudes, which was most likely caused by the decreased quality of the spatial representation of the forcing input due to the limited number of pistons. The combination of the different modes resulted in a mean flow distortion and amplitude distribution with five lobes. The frequency range for which lock-in could be observed was further reduced when compared to the ± 2 case. For forcing modes ± 4, the flow responded only locally to the forcing, and the decay of the forced modes in downstream direction was very rapid, for example, at three diameters downstream the forced modes were no longer detectable...|$|R

Initially used to model TBIs produced by automotive crashes, the CCI model rapidly transformed into a standardized technique to study TBI mechanisms and evaluate therapies. CCI is most commonly produced using a device that rapidly accelerates a rod to impact the surgically exposed cortical dural surface. The tip of the rod can be varied in size and geometry to accommodate scalability to difference species. Typically, the rod is actuated by a pneumatic <b>piston</b> or electro-mechanic <b>actuator.</b> With some limits, CCI devices can control the velocity, depth, duration, and site of impact. The CCI model produces morphologic and cerebrovascular injury responses that resemble certain aspects of human TBI. Commonly observed are graded histologic and axonal derangements, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, subdural and intra-parenchymal hematoma, edema, inflammation, and alterations in cerebral blood flow. The CCI model also produces neurobehavioral and cognitive impairments similar to those observed clinically. In contrast to other TBI models, the CCI device induces a significantly pronounced cortical contusion, but is limited in {{the extent to which it}} models the diffuse effects of TBI; a related limitation is that not all clinical TBI cases are characterized by a contusion. Another perceived limitation is that a non-clinically relevant craniotomy is performed. Biomechanically, this is irrelevant at the tissue level. However, craniotomies are not atraumatic and the effects of surgery should be controlled by including surgical sham control groups. CCI devices have also been successfully used to impact closed skulls to study mild and repetitive TBI. Future directions for CCI research surround continued refinements to the model through technical improvements in the devices (e. g. minimizing mechanical sources of variation).

40|$|This thesis treats {{position}} control of an electropneumatic clutch actuator operated by simple on/off solenoid valves. This clutch actuator {{is intended for}} automatic manual transmission systems or clutch-by-wire systems in heavy duty trucks. Pressurized air is already present {{as a part of}} the brake system in such vehicles, and pneumatics is therefore the natural choice for actuating the manual transmission in these clutch actuator systems. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of the automobile industry. For the clutch actuator system this influence the choice of number of sensors present in the production system, limiting it to only a position sensor. It also lead to that a set of on/off solenoid valve is chosen for actuation over more commonly used proportional valves, even though it complicates the control task. Production quality sensors are considered in this thesis, and these are sensors which are more influenced by noise than sensors found in test rigs made for research and development. Motor vibration and possible other mechanical influence also have to be taken into consideration when testing in a full-scale truck as done in this thesis. Motivated by the choice of on/off solenoid valves as the control valves in the clutch actuator system, switched control design is considered. Switched controllers exploit the on/off solenoid valves discrete behavior, switching the valves between fully open and fully closed in a manner such that desired supply or exhaust of air from the actuator chamber is obtained, ensuring the demanded piston position. Based on this line of action, two switched controllers are developed along with a dual-mode switched controller utilizing the best features of the individual controllers. Stability analysis based on standard Lyapunov theory are provided, and the performance of the controllers are tested in a full-scale test truck at Kongsberg Automotive ASA. Both theoretical and practical performance analyses confirm that switch controllers are well suited for <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> {{position control}} of the clutch actuator system. Full-state feedback availability is assumed in the design of the switched controllers. Adaptive nonlinear observers are derived to provide estimates of unmeasured states and parameters for the clutch actuator system. These adaptive observers are deterministic with linear output-injection, and have adaptation laws for estimation of clutch load characteristics and friction. A full-order adaptive observer, including filtering of position for suppression of noise, shows best performance. The adaptation of unknown parameters accounts for wear of the clutch and variations in temperature, ensuring a robust design of the clutch actuator model and improving state estimates. Theoretical analyses of convergence are derived under persistence of excitation condition, and performance of the adaptive observers are validated by experimental data. The switched controller and the adaptive nonlinear are combined into an observerbased switched controller. Simulation of this is provided, comparing the results with actual truck measurements. These analysis indicate that the pressure sensor can be exchanged with an adaptive nonlinear observer without significant loss of performance for nonlinear state feedback based control designs for the system.

40|$|Compressibility of air used as {{a working}} medium in {{pneumatic}} control systems raise certain difficulties in calculating dynamic characteristics of the pneumatic drive and solving problems of its regulation. These difficulties are due {{to a number of}} factors:    - flow of compressed air through the narrow working splits of distributive and throttling devices of pneumatic control;    - filling in and discharging the pneumatic actuator cavities of variable volume (piston and rod cavities of the air-cylinder) under conditions of heat and mass transfer;    - simultaneous filling in and discharging a pneumatic cavity of permanent volume (receiver);    - pneumatic cylinder piston end positioning alteration under variable loading and at the moment of shutdown; A number of factors {{have a significant impact on}} the piston end positioning alteration value, namely an initial positioning of the piston at the moment of its shutdown, which determines the volume of the pneumatic cylinder cavity; a value of the permanent component of the load at the moment the piston shuts down and its change during keeping time period; transmission coefficient of the positioning component of the load; a working area of the air-cylinder piston and also an atmospheric pressure reduction, which can significantly affect the operation of control systems of a small aircraft at high altitudes. With a view to deepening the problem of calculation and design of pneumatic actuators, it is shown that the relationship between the parameters of compressed air and their changes is determined by the properties of thermodynamic processes under conditions of heat and mass transfer. In pneumatic actuators for general industrial use, the pressure of compressed air does not exceed a value equal to 1 MPa. In this case, the working medium can be regarded as an ideal gas in simplified calculations. Based on the general equation of thermodynamics, the paper considers the particular cases of a changing gas state process under its constant temperature, pressure, and volume and also in the absolute or partial absence of heat exchange with the surrounding medium. The inconstancy of the compressed air mass during filling in and discharging of pneumatic cavities of variable volume causes non-stationary thermodynamic processes in the pneumatic actuators and requires their specifying in conditions of heat and mass exchange. The pneumatic <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> speed is related to the peculiarities of the working medium movement through the narrow slits of distribution and control devices of pneumatic automation due to dependency of the flow on the outflow parameter, which in turn is related to the criticality of the outflow process (the ratio of the pressure at the outlet of the throttling device and at its inlet). It is shown that when calculating and designing the pneumatic drives, including closed-loop ones, as well as for evaluating their dynamic characteristics, a system solution of the equations determining the processes of filling and discharging the cavities of the pneumatic cylinder is required, taking into account the peculiarities of compressed air movement through the narrow slits of pneumatic automation devices. The outflow parameter available in the equations of the pneumatic drive dynamics and determined by the outflow process criticality and by the heat exchange conditions (a poly-tropic index) requires their numerical solution. </p...|$|R
