30|$|The mode of {{preparation}} of {{ion exchange resins}} is through suspension polymerization technique containing the monomers, cross-linkers and initiators. Various types of polymeric beads like styrene, MMA, MAA, DVB, etc. can be prepared by this technique, varying the ratio of monomers, diluents, the stabilizer, concentration and the agitation rate is dispersed by agitation in a liquid phase, usually water, in which the monomer droplets are polymerized while they are dispersed by continuous agitation also known as <b>pearl</b> <b>polymerization</b> technique (Penlidis et al. 1997).|$|E
