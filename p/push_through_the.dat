5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two weeks more skirmishes {{occurred}} and the Allies were not able to cut off a major portion of the German forces, but the Germans were also not able to maintain any stable defense line as planned. On 10September forward units of the VI Corps were able to establish contact with units from Patton's Third Army. Truscott hoped to be able to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Belfort Gap, but on 14September he received orders from the Allied High Command to halt the offensive. Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line at the Vosges mountains, thwarting further Allied advances. This, combined with the Allied need to reorganise their command structure as the forces from northern and southern France have now linked up, forced the Allies to stop their pursuit of the Germans, ending the offensive here.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1944, Slovaks {{rebelled against}} the Nazis and the Czechoslovak {{government}} appealed to Soviets for help. On 31 August, Soviet marshal Ivan Konev {{was ordered to}} prepare plans for an offensive to destroy Nazi forces in Slovakia.

25|$|In {{the early}} months of 2015, the second BJP-led NDA Government under Narendra Modi further opened up the {{insurance}} sector by allowing up to 49% FDI. This came seven years after the previous government attempted and failed to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same reforms and 16 years after the sector was first opened to foreign investors up to 26% under the first BJP-led NDA Government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's administration.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{irritation}} was the regional assemblies, {{which had been}} organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP {{wanted them to be}} more or less advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.|$|E

25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. It {{has been suggested that}} a problem with Monbiot's approach is that economic drivers may be required in order to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> development of more sustainable second-generation biofuel processes: it is possible that these could be stalled if biofuel production decreases. Some environmentalists are suspicious that second-generation biofuels may not solve the problem of a potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E
25|$|Walthall's division, intermixed {{partially}} with Loring's division {{because of}} the confusion that resulted from the narrow space, struck Casement's and Reilly's brigades in multiple waves of brigade assaults—probably {{as many as six}} distinct attacks. All of these assaults were turned back with heavy losses. The brigade of Brig. Gen. William A. Quarles was able to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> abatis and reached the Federal earthworks, where it was pinned down by murderous crossfire. Quarles was wounded in the left arm {{and at the end of}} the battle the highest-ranking officer standing in his brigade was a captain.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, Paisley {{gathered}} {{a throng of}} Orangemen and tried to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> police lines, but was arrested. Loyalists threw missiles at the police and tried {{to break through the}} blockade; police responded with plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked roads across Northern Ireland, and there were attacks on Catholics and the police. The march was eventually allowed to continue through the Catholic area. As the march ended, Paisley and David Trimble held hands in the air {{in what appeared to be}} a gesture of triumph, causing considerable ill-feeling among the Catholic residents.|$|E
25|$|On July 1st 2017, the BJP-led NDA Government under Narendra Modi {{launched}} the Goods and Services Tax (India). This came {{years after the}} previous government attempted and failed to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same reform and 17 years after the legislation was proposed under the first BJP-led NDA Government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee's administration in 2000. Touted to be India's biggest tax reform in 70 years of independence {{and the most important}} overall reform in terms of ease of doing business since 1991. GST replaces a slew of indirect taxes with a unified tax structure and is therefore set to dramatically reshape the country's 2 trillion dollar economy.|$|E
25|$|Operation Watch on the Rhine, {{followed}} by Operation Nordwind were the final major offensives and last gambles Hitler {{made on the}} Western Front. The plan was for an armored <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> American lines, {{all the way to}} Antwerp to split the western Allies forces and buy the Germans time. Mohnke's SS Division Leibstandarte, attached to the I SS Panzer Corps, was the spearhead of the operation in the Ardennes. The fuel crisis in Nazi Germany meant that the LSSAH had insufficient amounts of fuel for the vehicles. On 16 December 1944 the operation began, with Mohnke designating SS-Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe to lead the push to Antwerp.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, about 10,000 Orangemen and {{supporters}} had gathered at Drumcree and {{were engaged in}} a standoff with about 1,000 police. During this standoff, loyalists continuously threw missiles at the police and tried to break through the police blockade; police responded by firing 24 plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked numerous roads across Northern Ireland, and sealed off the port of Larne. There was violence in some Protestant areas. On the evening of Monday 10 July, Ian Paisley (Democratic Unionist Party leader) and David Trimble (Ulster Unionist Party leader) held a rally at Drumcree. Afterwards, they gathered a number of Orangemen and tried to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> police line, but were taken away by officers.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, a {{confrontation}} broke {{out between the}} student protesters and the police {{when a group of}} female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike. The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to <b>push</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> line and came charging toward the students. The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation. Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march. The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to Tharawaddy, the nearest town; to fly banners and use megaphones after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; and to have the police forces keep a distance from them. However, they did not receive any response from the minister.|$|E
25|$|Longstreet {{gave the}} order to move at 11:10a.m. and Johnson's {{division}} proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood's Union division was {{pulling out of the}} line. Johnson's brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen. Evander McNair, encountered opposition from Brannan's division (parts of Col. John M. Connell's brigade), but was also able to <b>push</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught. At {{the far side of the}} Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg's brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield's brigade, commanded by Col. William Perry, and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson, captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge.|$|E
