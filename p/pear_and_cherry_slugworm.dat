40|$|The {{object of}} the study was a sensory {{evaluation}} of used sweetners in beverages from selected fruits. Within the sensory analysis apple juice <b>and</b> also <b>pear,</b> apricot, <b>cherry</b> <b>and</b> blackcurrant nectar were used. These drinks were subsequently diluted at two concentrations with drinking water: 1) in a ratio of 50 % of the original beverage and 50 % of drinking water; 2) in a ratio of 25 % of the original beverage and 75 % of drinking water. Each of the concentrations were then divided into groups which were sweetened with white sugar, cane sugar, aspartame, sucralose or rebaudioside A. The performed sensory analyses show that rebaudioside A would have great potential to replace the commonly used white sugar in apple juice. Sucralose would have this potential in <b>pear</b> <b>and</b> <b>cherry</b> drinks. However, the use of other sweeteners in other types of beverages is also not excluded, because to prove a preference for white sugar failed in most cases...|$|R
