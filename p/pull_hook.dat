25|$|Pitches in Australia have {{traditionally}} been known {{to be good for}} fast bowlers because of the amount of bounce that can be generated on these surfaces. In particular, the pitch at the WACA Ground in Perth is regarded as being possibly the quickest pitch in the world. The Gabba in Brisbane is also known to assist fast bowlers with its bounce. However, these kinds of bouncy pitches also open up more areas for run-scoring, as they promote the playing of a lot of <b>pull,</b> <b>hook</b> and cut shots. Batsmen who play these shots well have a lot of success on these pitches.|$|E
2500|$|Virender Sehwag {{is often}} noted for his {{extremely}} attacking style of batting, and in 2005 he {{was described by}} Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as the [...] "most exciting opener in the world" [...] due to his aggressive style in Test matches, his strike rate being inferior only to that of Adam Gilchrist and Shahid Afridi. Sehwag has also been noted for his apparent disregard for the match situation, exhibited by aggressive batting even when his team is in a poor position or after being outmanoeuvred by the bowler in the recent past. This is a two-edged sword, as it allows him to not be psychologically hindered by previous failures, but {{can also lead to}} excessive aggression. Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer spoke of him as a [...] "sophisticated slogger". But over the years, his style has changed from [...] "reckless hitting" [...] to that of [...] "controlled aggression", according to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. Previously Sehwag was known predominantly as an offside player, with a weakness against straight short pitched bowling. However, {{in the last two years}} he has improved his leg side and bouncer hitting considerably. This is shown in the recent ODIs against New Zealand where he utilised the <b>pull,</b> <b>hook</b> and flick shots to devastating effect.|$|E

50|$|García and Lingmerth were in {{the last}} group, with Woods in the group just ahead. Leading by several shots, Woods double-bogeyed No. 14 with a <b>pulled</b> <b>hook</b> into the water, which brought the field back in play. Woods {{came back into the}} lead by making a birdie on No. 16, after a bunker shot ended just a couple feet from the hole. García hit his ball {{to the center of the}} No. 16 green and made a two-putt for a birdie, tying Woods for the lead going into No. 17. Lingmerth hit his second shot into the left green side bunker at No. 16, and hit a sand shot to just a few feet; he then {{converted}} on his birdie attempt to get one behind the leaders heading into No. 17.|$|R

25|$|At {{his most}} {{comfortable}} against pace bowling, Vermeulen was a back-foot player by inclination, particularly strong on the cut, <b>pull</b> and <b>hook</b> shots, {{although he was}} also a sweet timer of the ball through the covers. He was an excellent slip fielder, an occasional offbreak bowler, and a former national junior javelin champion.|$|R
5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the <b>pull</b> and <b>hook</b> shots. He was able to <b>pull</b> and <b>hook</b> almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|R
50|$|After a par at 14, Nicklaus {{began his}} legendary charge at 15. After hitting his 204 yd {{approach}} to 12 ft, he buried the putt for eagle to pull within two shots of Ballesteros. Nicklaus then hit his tee shot on 16 to within 3 feet and after holing his birdie putt he was within one shot of Ballesteros who {{was playing the}} 15th hole. Ballesteros, who was in prime position {{to go for the}} green in two, <b>pull</b> <b>hooked</b> his approach into the water. After failing to get up and down, Ballesteros bogeyed the hole, giving Nicklaus a share of the lead. Kite made birdie at 15 to enter into a three-way tie with Ballesteros and Nicklaus. After a wayward drive, Nicklaus hit his approach on 17 to 18 ft. After long deliberation, he holed his putt on 17 for sole possession of the lead {{for the first time in}} the tournament. He two-putted for par on 18 to post −9 and a one shot lead.|$|R

I hooked at him, but did not hurt or scare him. Finally I <b>pulled</b> the <b>hook</b> out of him. While I was reeling in my line {{suddenly}} a huge purple shadow hove in sight. It was the swordfish--and certainly one of immense size--the hugest yet.|$|R

25|$|The {{second class}} of cricket stroke {{comprises}} the horizontal bat shots, {{also known as}} cross bat shots: the cut, the square drive, the <b>pull,</b> the <b>hook</b> and the sweep. Typically horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing {{to make contact with}} the ball than vertical bat shots, and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batsman's head typically not being perfectly in line with the ball at point of contact.|$|R
25|$|Ponting {{was known}} as an {{aggressive}} right-handed batsman who played a wide repertoire of shots with confidence, most notably the <b>pull</b> and <b>hook.</b> However, he had some technical weaknesses, such as shuffling across his stumps and being trapped leg before wicket, and thrusting his bat away from his body—especially early in his innings. Despite being widely renowned as the best player of the <b>hook</b> and <b>pull</b> shots in the world, Ponting was equally adept on both {{the front and back}} foot. However, during the latter stages of his career, the <b>hook</b> and <b>pull</b> shots have often been the cause of his dismissal.|$|R
2500|$|A pull is a cross-batted shot {{played to}} a ball {{bouncing}} around waist height by swinging the bat in a horizontal arc {{in front of}} the body, pulling it around to the leg side towards mid-wicket or square leg. The term hook shot is used when the shot is played against a ball bouncing at or above chest high to the batsman, the batsman thus [...] "hooking" [...] the ball around behind square leg, either along the ground or in the air. <b>Pull</b> and <b>hook</b> shots can be played off front or back foot, with back foot being more typical.|$|R
50|$|The City {{commissioned}} W. A. Snow & Company of Boston {{to create}} the new fire station’s weathervane for the sum of $75. (Known primarily as a foundry, Snow & Company also forged the iron door hinges used throughout the building.) Perched atop the station’s tall drying tower used to hang wet fire hoses, the showpiece was impressive in both size and artistry. The weathervane depicts a “flying team” of horses <b>pulling</b> a <b>hook</b> and ladder wagon. The copper sculpture measures nearly 6-feet long by 3-feet high. Its iron pole stands almost 8-feet tall, and the four copper directionals span 3-feet wide.|$|R

5000|$|The hook grip is {{more secure}} than grips {{in which the}} thumb remains outside the other fingers, like the closed grip or the natural grip. During a snatch or clean, the lifter can exert forces up to 2-3 times {{the weight of the}} loaded barbell at rest, and the hook grip allows an athlete to {{maintain}} a grip on the bar during the phase of highest bar acceleration, the second <b>pull.</b> The <b>hook</b> grip does this by preventing the bar from rolling in the hands, whereas the bar would have a tendency to roll towards the fingertips in a normal overhand grip.|$|R
25|$|In epigeal {{germination}} (or epigeous germination), the hypocotyl elongates {{and forms}} a <b>hook,</b> <b>pulling</b> rather than pushing the cotyledons and apical meristem through the soil. Once {{it reaches the}} surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.|$|R

25|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{handling}} hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, <b>pulling</b> the <b>hook</b> out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|R
50|$|When {{the box is}} {{activated}} by turning a knob or <b>pulling</b> a <b>hook,</b> a spring-loaded wheel turns, tapping out a pulsed electrical signal corresponding to the box's number. A receiver at fire headquarters annunciates the pulses through flashing lights or tones, or via a pen recorder, and the box number is matched {{to a list of}} box locations. In modern installations a computer receives and translates the pulses; in unmanned installations in small communities, the box number may be sounded out by a horn or bell audible community-wide. Though still in wide use, many communities have removed them, relying instead on the widespread availability of landline and (especially) cellular telephones.|$|R
50|$|Hanbōjutsu, {{the art of}} {{wielding}} the hanbō, is a {{focus in}} several martial arts including the Kukishin-ryū koryū classical school of martial arts, and Kukishinden-ryū, one of the nine schools of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. Part of the importance in using this length {{is that it is}} approximately that of a walking cane. Although techniques with a cane in this ryū-ha utilize <b>pulling</b> or <b>hooking</b> and possess one rounded end, they invariably function the same as a hanbō in all other respects. The hanbō can be held toward one end, and be swung like a katana or kendo sword. Additionally, it can be held in the middle like a staff and strike and block from either end.|$|R
