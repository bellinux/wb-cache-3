Homeowners wishing {{to participate in}} it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even ask an effort from the children {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums.

2500|$|The {{families}} of {{soldiers in the}} 507th heard almost right away of the ambush and fatalities in the unit. The Piestewa family saw people in her unit being interviewed by Iraqi TV, and {{for more than a}} week {{families of}} the two women waited for news. All around Tuba City signs were hung out telling people: [...] "Put your <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> on, show Lori the way home." [...] They used white stone to spell her name on a 200 foot high mesa just outside the town.|$|E

50|$|As NGB Chief {{during the}} Vietnam War, Wilson also made news when he {{advocated}} that Guard members {{take part in}} counter-demonstrations in response to opponents of the war, asking them to drive with their car headlights on during the day, fly the U.S. flag more frequently, and leave their <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> on at night.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011, {{more than}} two-thirds of the streetlights in Highland Park were removed by the city, due to an {{inability}} to pay a $60,000 per month electric bill. The street lights were not only turned off, but decommissioned, or removed from their posts. The city advised residents to keep <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> on in order to deter crime.|$|R
2500|$|Holt's {{death has}} entered Australian folklore, and is {{frequently}} {{the subject of}} black humour. Travel writer Bill Bryson labelled it [...] "the swim that needed no towel". Holt's name has become a byword for any sudden or unexplained disappearance; the phrase to do a Harold Holt is rhyming slang for to bolt (i.e., {{to make a quick}} exit). Holt's death spawned a storyline in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, and has also been credited with inspiring The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, a British television series. In 1988, rugby league commentator Jack Gibson – ex-coach of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks – said that [...] "waiting for Cronulla to win a Grand Final is like leaving a <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> on for Harold Holt". Over the following thirty years, opposition fans taunted Cronulla by waving posters of Holt's face and dressing up in wetsuits; the club eventually won its first premiership in 2016.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> Una beheld a heavy-shouldered, typical American {{business}} man, in derby hat and clipped mustache, his jowls shining with {{a recent}} shave; an alert, solid man of about forty-five. She remembered {{him as a man}} she had been glad to meet; she felt guiltily that she ought to know him--perhaps he was a Wilkins client, and she was making future difficulty in the office. But place him she could not.|$|E

50|$|The {{event has}} been held {{annually}} since 1984 and {{is sponsored by the}} National Association of Town Watch in the United States and Canada. National Night Out began simply with neighbors turning on their <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> and sitting in front of their homes. From the first National Night Out involved 2.5 million residents across 400 communities in 23 states, National Night Out has grown to include more than thirty-eight million residents in twenty-thousand communities across the USA as of 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Maladera castanea, the Asiatic garden beetle, is a beetle in {{the family}} Scarabaeidae native to Japan and China. It was {{introduced}} to North America, where it is considered a crop and deciduous leaf (tree leaf) eating pest.Adults are active in the summer, and can be seen feeding on plant leaves at night or found around <b>porch</b> <b>lights.</b> Adults range in length from 7 to 9 mm and possess a cinnamon-brown color. Larva are approximately ¾" [...] long and feed on the roots of various plants.|$|R
60|$|Kit {{went up the}} lonning {{and sitting}} down in the <b>porch</b> <b>lighted</b> his pipe. Grace had not forgotten; {{she had given him}} his real welcome home and he thrilled as he thought about her quiet friendliness. Perhaps the meeting was awkward for her, but she had struck the right note, with the dignified {{simplicity}} he had expected. It said something for her pluck that she had met him as if the interview at Ashness, when Osborn had driven him away, had never taken place. All this was comforting, but Kit was vaguely disturbed on her account.|$|R

50|$|Some {{adapters}} {{for wall}} outlets use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket {{to become an}} ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a <b>porch</b> <b>light),</b> or to make a pull-chain switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a lamp holder (lamp socket).|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} {{holds an}} annual one-day event in August called SeaScare, {{a play on}} the name of Seattle's Seafair. The event includes a <b>Porch</b> <b>Light</b> Parade, contests, music and a screening of a classic movie, among other activities. It involves nautical themes, in keeping with its Seafair ties. It {{is supported by the}} small number of Brier businesses. SeaScare strives for a small town and community feel, explaining the nostalgic events and movie.|$|E
50|$|The ranger {{station is}} located on a terrace between the Middle Fork of the Smith River and US 199. The main office is a 1-1/2 story frame {{structure}} completed in 1938, facing U.S. 199. The main roof is end-gabled, with a large cross-gabled front porch. The building measures about 37 ft by 41 ft. In plan it originally was two rooms downstairs, with an attic storage room. Pine tree cut-outs are painted green against the white gables, and the stationary shutters feature similar cut-outs. The <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> are designed to resemble fire lookout cabins. Over time there have been modest additions and changes to the interior.|$|R
5000|$|The western {{banded gecko}} is secretive and nocturnal, {{foraging}} at night for small insects and spiders, {{and is one}} of the few reptiles that control scorpion populations by eating baby scorpions. If captured, C. variegatus may squeak and may discard its tail. As a defense mechanism, it can also curl its tails over its body to mimic a scorpion. Females lay up to three clutches of one to two soft-shelled eggs in the spring and summer. Emerging on warm nights around 80 °F, they can be seen around <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> looking for an easy meal, retreating if the temperature rises too high or drops too low. [...] Eggs hatch after six weeks.|$|R
50|$|These frogs rarely ever {{descend from}} high treetops except for breeding. They are {{strictly}} nocturnal. Male gray tree frogs rarely have large choruses, {{as they are}} mostly solitary animals, but might vocalize competitively {{at the height of}} breeding periods. Gray treefrogs may congregate around windows and <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> to eat insects that are attracted to the light. During the day they often rest on horizontal tree branches or leaves out in the open, even in the sun. Evidently they are less prone to overheating and desiccation than other amphibians and rely on their superb camouflage to hide them from predators. In captivity, they become tame and learn to associate their owners with food, {{even to the point of}} lunging at empty fingers that usually contain an insect.|$|R
50|$|Leave the <b>Porch</b> <b>Light</b> On was the {{companys}} first original, full-length musical {{production and}} {{was created for}} the companys 25th-anniversary. The initial performance of Leave the Porchlight On was attended {{by a number of}} celebrities and other well-known people, including the Governor General of Canada. The production was very successful and is still occasionally performed at the companys theatre in Toronto and on tour. A sequel of sorts followed two years later, entitled Hide and Seek: A Game of Human Spirit.|$|E

50|$|McCall's parents {{contacted}} {{police in}} reference to their daughter's disappearance from Levitt's home more than 16 hours after the women were last seen, and other worried friends and family called and visited the home the following day. Police later estimated that the crime scene had been corrupted by ten to twenty people who visited Levitt's house. Upon the officers' arrival, the scene {{showed no signs of}} a struggle, except for the shattered <b>porch</b> <b>light.</b> Police also noted Levitt's bed had been slept in. All personal property was left behind including purses, money, cars, keys, cigarettes, and the family dog.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Practically to {{electrify}} lighting system electricity supply {{is a necessity}} to power the light. Thus, solar energy is known as an alternative source to provide electricity. This paper presents an off-grid system development for house car <b>porch</b> <b>lighting</b> system. Development {{of the system is}} composed of photovoltaic panel, environmental sensors, charge controller, battery and lighting loads such as florescent lamp. The off-grid system focuses to supply electricity in small scale which is integrated with some energy saving characteristics. An auto timer and smart charge controller is integrated into the off-grid system to turn-on and turn-off the lighting at the house car pouch. Integration of some smart functions is an ideal solution for small scale electricity supply or particularly for location which cannot be accessed by grid supply...|$|R

Low level windows in the brick base, {{to either side of}} the <b>porch,</b> <b>light</b> a service corridor behind.|$|E
50|$|At 10:35 p.m., Officer Roy McCowan {{received}} a jarring phone call. A girl was screaming hysterically {{on the other}} end, and McCowan heard the words “come quick!” The connection, however, broke off before the girl could identify herself. At that late hour, the test board at the telephone company was not staffed, and the call could not be traced. At about 1:35 a.m., the Romacks returned home to find the front Venetian blinds open and the <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> illuminated. Both {{the front and back}} doors were unlocked, and a side window was broken open. Christman lay {{in a pool of blood}} on a shag carpet by the family piano.|$|E
5000|$|As their fame grew, Peter, Paul and Mary mixed {{music with}} {{political}} and social activism. In 1963, the trio marched with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma, Alabama, and Washington, D.C.. The three participated in countless demonstrations {{against the war in}} Vietnam. They sang at the 1969 March on Washington, which Mr. Yarrow helped to organize. Though their activism provoked a steady stream of death threats, they were never harmed. [...] "But for years, I used to bite my fingernails on stage," [...] Mary Travers says. [...] "There you are and look like the back <b>porch</b> <b>light,</b> and stare out at 12,000 or 15,000 people. Any one of whom could have had a gun." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since most of {{the fires}} {{appeared}} to have been started using material such as trash, debris or furniture, police and city officials started ordering people to remove any such items from their porches. Officials also asked them to keep <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> on at night or install motion detector lights on their property, and suggested residents purchase guard dogs. In late January, the city distributed 800 motion-activated lights and smoke detectors and batteries to residents. In January, a $5,000 reward was offered to anyone who provided information that would result in a conviction; the next month, the reward was increased to $20,000. A local credit union set up a $5,000 relief fund to help people displaced by the fires. [...] On February 8, a curfew was imposed forbidding anyone younger than 18 from staying out past 8 p.m.; a previous curfew had been set for 10 p.m.|$|R
5000|$|Most geckos are nocturnal, hiding {{during the}} day and {{foraging}} for insects at night. They can be seen climbing walls of houses and other buildings in search of insects attracted to <b>porch</b> <b>lights,</b> hence their name [...] "house gecko". Spread around the world by ships, these geckos are now common in the Deep South of the United States, large parts of tropical and sub-tropical Australia, and many other countries in South and Central America, Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. They grow to a length of between 75 - 150 mm, and live for about 5 years. These small geckos are non-venomous and harmless to humans. Medium to large geckos may bite if distressed; however, their bite is gentle and will not pierce skin.A tropical gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus thrives in warm, humid areas where it can crawl around on rotting wood in search of the insects it eats. The animal is very adaptable and may prey on insects and spiders, displacing other reptiles.|$|R

50|$|At the Larsen home, Stan apologizes to Terry (Jamie Anne Allman), {{who says}} the case may never be solved, that he is angry because he cannot let go, and {{suggests}} he fix what he can. Stan later approaches Amber (Ashley Johnson) and Bennet (Brandon Jay McLaren) Ahmed at their front door. He admits to them that he was wrong, that Rosie cared for Bennett, and that she came to say goodbye that night. Bennet threatens {{to call the police}} unless Stan leaves. Amber later walks out her front door and turns on the <b>porch</b> <b>light,</b> realizing Stan has fixed it. A crying Stan later calls Rosie's phone and leaves a message, apologizing for never telling her that he was not her biological father. He then surprises Terry and the boys with a bulldog.|$|E

5000|$|About 5 - 47 mm {{long and}} with a {{wingspan}} of 5 - 30 mm, some mantidflies such as Climaciella brunnea, Euclimacia nodosa are wasp mimics, but most are brownish with green, yellow and sometimes red hues. The vernacular and scientific names are derived from their mantis-like appearance, as their spiny [...] "raptorial" [...] front legs are modified to catch small insect prey and {{are very similar to}} the front legs of mantids (the only difference is that the pincers lack footpads and are not used for walking at all). The adults are predatory insects that are often nocturnal, and are sometimes attracted by <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> or blacklights. They are usually green, brown, yellow, and sometimes pink, and have four membranous wings which may sometimes be patterned (especially in wasp mimicking species) but are usually clear. Adult mantidflies are predators of suitably sized insects, which they catch as mantids do. However, the underlying mechanisms for the prey capture behavior are different in mantidflies and mantids. Mantidflies are active hunters, but as with other Neuroptera, they are cumbersome fliers.|$|R
