40|$|Summary: CSXT {{has used}} rail {{grinding}} {{as a part}} of its rail maintenance program since the mid 1980 ’s. Toward the end of 2000 steps were taken to transition the grinding program from a corrective grinding strategy to a preventive approach. In January 2002 a statistical study was launched to analyze rail surface defect service failure rates over a select group of curves on the system that had previously been subjected to a corrective method of grinding and were then maintained using <b>preventive</b> grind <b>cycles.</b> A 65 % year to year reduction in rail surface initiated service failures were found on the selected curves. A system wide study of CSXT’s rail grinding program was also initiated {{as a part of}} CSXT’s Six Sigma program and found similar reductions where a preventive method of grinding had been performed...|$|R

This paper studies TCP performance over a range of link environments and highlights the advantage of recent modifications to TCP (e. g. SACK, New-Reno) for wireless communications. It also identifies two key issues which impact the performance of TCP over error prone links: TCP’s reliance on timers to recover from a failed <b>retransmission</b> <b>cycle,</b> and TCP’s inability to separate congestion packet loss from other types of packet loss. A solution to the first issue is identified and analysed by simulation, and the factors affecting the second issue are outlined. ...|$|R

40|$|From a {{long time}} {{architectural}} design is tackling {{the problem of the}} aging and deterioration of construction materials in the last phase of a building life cycle, a key concept {{from the point of view}} of environmental sustainability, because it allows the dismantling of buildings by disassembling their components without any further energy use. The aim of design is to find solutions, both at procedural and designing level, to improve the durability of both the single components and the whole building, expecting to intervene with <b>preventive</b> maintenance <b>cycles</b> or replacement of components without damaging the rest of the building (Gaspar & Brito, 2003). Buildings are composed of different layers who reach the end of life service in different phases of the life cycle. Several authors (Gaspar and Brito 2003; Hovde and Moser 2004) subdivide a building in different durability layers, i. e. in different functional layers(skin, structure, service, space plan, stuff), that reach the degradation state at different times from their installation. In Italy the diffusion of wooden buildings places greater emphasis on the durability of both the materials and the buildings built with them. In particular, envelopes are the most studied elements, because they are the elements more subjected to environmental agents, like meteorological events or UV rays, which are the main causes of wooden deterioration (Davoli 2001; Rüther and Time 2015). In order to provide durability to the technological element, it is important to guarantee both the natural component durability and the possibility of skin management. In fact, the former is important to guarantee the durability of the single skin components and their composition, the latter is important for the possibility to forecast inspection's <b>cycles,</b> maintenance's <b>preventive</b> <b>cycle</b> and/or substitution of element in case of damage (Hovde and Moser 2004; Manfron and Siviero 1998). The new Italian Public Procurement Code requires the designer has to guarantee not only the energy saving solutions during the phases of construction and use of the building, but it has to be also responsible for the assessment its of life cycle and maintenance solutions (art. 23 Dlgs n 56, 2017). The aim of this research is to identify through a set of case studies some best practices for improving the maintenance procedures of wooden envelope sand to improve the overall element durability. It will be investigated different case studies, with different functional models and different finishing solutions, to compile a list of designing suggestions for wooden façades. The façade will be investigated with some key requirements, which are described into the Italian standard UNI 8290, where there are the provisions related to the requirement of building components and language of Italian building system. The requirements that will be used in the analysis are: the accessibility, the inspection, the ability of the component to be installed/assembled, and the possibility to replace the components. The accessibility is the capability of examining the façade's layers after the building construction. This feature is linked to the functional model chosen for the considered technological element (e. g., ventilated facade, type with continuous insulating element and continuous finishing), and is crucial in the user's ability to judge the degree of wear and/or damage of one of the components. The inspection is the requirement that considers the possibility of changing or inspecting one or more façade's component, without damage for the rest of the element. This feature depends on the possibility of mounting and dismantling components. The ability of the parts to be installed/assembled, is the possibility of eventual disassemble of the skin's components without damaging the other elements, and with the possibility of reusing them after a temporary dismantling. This ability is related to the characteristics of fixings of the external finishing. The repairability and the ability to be replaceable, are the requirements whose consider the possibility of assessing how the single parts can be disassembled without damaging the entire technologic element, but only the local area of damage. In conclusion, the design of both elements and procedures to facilitate the maintenance and the possibility of changing parts of an envelope could increase the durability of wooden component façades. The aim of this research is to investigate a set of case studies to see which are the best practices to implement these capabilities and to indicate design suggestions useful to the designer approaching the design of wooden buildings...|$|R

40|$|The {{architecture}} of network games is generally of two main types: Client/Server (C/S) and Peer to Peer (P 2 P). Distributed network games use the P 2 P architecture mainly to reduce network latency. This architecture may {{be based on}} graph or tree structures. Given an identical amount of data to be transferred, the bandwidth requirement in a tree-based P 2 P network game {{is not the same}} as that of a graph-based game. In a graph-based P 2 P network game, the bandwidth requirement of each player is a linear function of the number of players. In a tree-based game, by contrast, it is a quadratic function of the number of child nodes. This implies that, due to limited bandwidth, some nodes may suffer from being overwhelmed by the arrival of a large number of packets, leading to a packet-drop. In turn, the packet-drop would trigger packet retransmission; this may result in a repetitive <b>cycle</b> of packet <b>retransmission</b> and packet-drop. Such packet-drop problems may cause severe network latency. In this paper we examine methods to reduce the bandwidth requirements of tree-based P 2 P network games, with a view to improving system performance. Full Tex...|$|R

Methods. -LEPs were recorded to stimulation of both the right hand and the right perioral region in 14 patients and in 14 healthy subjects. The habituation of both the N 1 and the vertex N 2 /P 2 components was assessed by measuring the LEP amplitude changes across 3 consecutive repetitions of 30 trials each. Results. -In the 8 patients who had clinically improved after treatment, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude habituation was significantly higher after treatment than before treatment following both hand (F = 43. 2, P <. 0001) and face stimulation (F = 6. 9, P =. 01). In these patients, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude habituation after treatment was not different from that obtained in healthy controls (P =. 18 and P =. 73 for hand and face stimulation, respectively). On the contrary, in the patients who did not improve, the N 2 /P 2 amplitude still showed reduced habituation after both hand (F = 3. 1, P =. 08) and face (F = 0. 7, P =. 4) stimulation. Conclusion. -The deficient habituation of the vertex N 2 /P 2 complex was partly restored after successful treatment of medication-overuse headache, reflecting a modification in pain-processing pathways...|$|R

40|$|Optimal asset {{management}} in industries requires accurate reliability prediction of complex repairable systems. A Split System Approach (SSA) {{has previously been}} presented for predicting the reliability of complex systems with multiple <b>Preventive</b> Maintenance (PM) <b>cycles</b> over a long term horizon. However, the algorithms in that model were derived with an assumption that the same single component is always repaired in all PM actions. This paper extends the model to a scenario where a different single component is repaired each time. This extended model {{can be used to}} determine the remaining life of the system and to describe the changes in reliability with PM actions for this scenario. As a result, {{it can be used to}} support asset PM decision making over the operation and maintenance phase of the asset. Assets often have a number of vulnerable components, i. e., the lives of these components are much shorter than the lives of the rest of the system. An optimal time of sequential PM actions of these critical components can maximise the useful life of the asset effectively. The model developed in this paper can be used to determine this optimal PM strategy...|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} is an {{implementation of the}} Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), a communications protocol intended to support the Bundle Protocol in Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) operations. LTP {{is designed to provide}} retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely long message round-trip times and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. Communication in interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of environment, and LTP is principally aimed at supporting long-haul reliable transmission over deep-space RF links. Like any reliable transport service employing ARQ (Automatic Repeat re-Quests), LTP is stateful. In order to assure the reception of a block of data it has sent, LTP must retain for possible retransmission all portions of that block which might not have been received yet. In order to do so, it must keep track of which portions of the block are known to have been received so far, and which are not, together with any additional information needed for purposes of retransmitting part, or all, of the block. Long round-trip times mean substantial delay between the transmission of a block of data and the reception of an acknowledgement from the block s destination, signaling arrival of the block. If LTP postponed transmission of additional blocks of data until it received acknowledgement of the arrival of all prior blocks, valuable opportunities to use what little deep space transmission bandwidth is available would be forever lost. For this reason, LTP is based in part on a notion of massive state retention. Any number of requested transmission conversations (sessions) may be concurrently in flight at various displacements along the link between two LTP engines, and the LTP engines must necessarily retain transmission status and retransmission resources for all of them. Moreover, if any of the data of a given block are lost en route, {{it will be necessary to}} retain the state of that transmission during an additional round trip while the lost data are retransmitted; even multiple <b>retransmission</b> <b>cycles</b> may be necessary. LTP's possible multiplicity of sessions per association makes it necessary for each segment of application data to include an additional demultiplexing token: a session ID that uniquely identifies the session in which the segment was issued and, implicitly, the block of data being conveyed by this session. This software comprises a prototype implementation developed by Johns Hopkins University APL in cooperation with JPL, together with adaptations that improve the robustness, correctness, and operability of that implementation...|$|R
40|$|What is the {{threshold}} for {{the prediction of}} moderate to severe or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) {{based on the number}} of growing follicles ≥ 11 mm and/or estradiol (E 2) levels?The optimal threshold of follicles ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG to identify those at risk was 19 for both moderate to severe OHSS and for severe OHSS. Estradiol (E 2) levels were less prognostic of OHSS than the number of follicles ≥ 11 mm. In comparison to long gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocols, the risk of severe OHSS is reduced by approximately 50 % in a GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while the two protocols provide equal chances of pregnancy per initiated cycle. Nevertheless, moderate to severe OHSS may still occur in GnRH antagonist protocols if human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered to trigger final oocyte maturation, especially in high responder patients. Severe OHSS following hCG trigger may occur with an incidence of 1 - 2 % in a relatively young (aged 18 to 36 years) IVF population treated in a GnRH-antagonist protocol. From the Engage, Ensure and Trust trials, in total, 2, 433 women who received hCG for oocyte maturation and for whom the number of follicles ≥ 11 mm and the level of E 2 on the day of hCG administration were known were included in the analyses. The threshold for OHSS prediction of moderate and severe OHSS was assessed in women treated with corifollitropin alfa or daily recombinant follicle stimulation hormone (rFSH) in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -antagonist protocol. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses for moderate to severe OHSS and severe OHSS were performed on the combined dataset and the sensitivity and specificity for the optimal threshold of number of follicles ≥ 11 mm, E 2 levels on the day of (hCG), and a combination of both, were determined. The optimal threshold of follicles ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG to identify those at risk of moderate to severe OHSS was 19 (sensitivity and specificity 62. 3 % and 75. 6 %, respectively) and for severe OHSS was also 19 (sensitivity and specificity 74. 3 % and 75. 3 %, respectively). The positive and negative predictive values were 6. 9 % and 98. 6 %, respectively, for moderate to severe OHSS, and 4. 2 % and 99. 5 % for severe OHSS. This was a retrospective analysis of combined data from three trials following ovarian stimulation with two different gonadotropins. For patients with 19 follicles or more ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG, measures to prevent the development of OHSS should be considered. Secondary <b>preventive</b> measures include <b>cycle</b> cancellation or coasting, use of a GnRH agonist to trigger final oocyte maturation in place of hCG and a freeze all strategy.

40|$|The National {{guide to}} a {{preventive}} health assessment in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (National guide) is an {{initiative of the}} National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO), lead agency of the Chronic Disease Alliance of Non- Government Organisations. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) supported {{the development of the}} guide. The National guide is intended for all health professionals delivering primary health care to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. This includes general practitioners (GPs), Aboriginal health workers, nurses and those specialists with a role in deliveringprimary health care. The National guide package consists of: The National guide • Recommendations compiled from the review of the Evidence base • Child and adult <b>preventive</b> health life <b>cycle</b> summaries. The Chronic Disease Alliance determined that recommendations in the National guide should be based on a review of the evidence, seeking where possible existing systematic reviews addressing questions related to preventive health care, expert opinion and consensus statements of relevance to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The Evidence base documents the research literature used to form the National guide and can be accessed on the RACGP website at: www. racgp. org. au and on the NACCHO website at: www. naccho. org. au. Users of this guide are encouraged to access this Evidence base for more information. Health care providers (particularly in regional and remote areas) are also encouraged to refer to local guidelines (where they are appropriate and available) in order to optimise preventive health assessments. Many of the recommendations in the National guide describe health problems that may be of concern only in certain regional areas. For example, trichiasis screening is not appropriate in Victoria except when an elderly Aboriginal person from northern Australia is assessed. Consequently, many recommendations highlight the importance of clinical discretion in decision making. The National guide makes specific recommendations regarding the elements of a preventive health assessment in the non-pregnant adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population as well as children. The aim is to provide a national evidence based resource that can inform health care providers and policy makers on a defined set of activities that are of particular relevance to this population, or that are different from those for the non-Indigenous population. These activities may prevent disease, detect early and unrecognised disease, and promote health in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population while allowing for variations based on regional and local circumstances. General practitioners should use the recommendations to enhance the clinical care that they provide to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. The National guide aims to complement the RACGP Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice (known as the ‘red book’) by dealing with health issues that are specific to the Aboriginal and TorresStrait Islander population. The chosen subject areas represent key health issues that are amenable to primary health care intervention and contribute to morbidity and mortality in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Where issues common in the general Australian population have not been dealt with in this guide (eg. osteoporosis), GPs are encouraged to cross reference with the ‘red book’ which is available on the RACGP website at: www. racgp. org. au/document. asp?id= 4169. To assist health care providers, the Evidence base used to form the National guide provides a summary of recommendations from the ‘red book’ and from other groups, such as the Central Australian Rural Practitioners Association and the Northern Zone Management Unit of Queensland Health in north Queensland. The authors have presented the information in this guide so that it can apply to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is recognised that, while the health of Torres Strait Islanders is very similar to the Aboriginal population, they represent a distinct Indigenous Australian population. Health care providers should use the National guide to systematically appraise current preventive practice, especially where recommendations for the general population have previously been applied to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Providers may also benefit by appraising certain screening activities for which there is little evidence. These activities may draw resources away from other activities to improve the health of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, eg. risk factor modification and immunisation programs. General practitioners may undertake preventive health assessment activities as part of their normal consultations. Medicare benefits are payable for a medical examination or test on a symptomless patient by that patient’s own medical practitioner in the course of normal medical practice, to ensure the patient receives any medical advice or treatment necessary to maintain his or her state of health...|$|R
