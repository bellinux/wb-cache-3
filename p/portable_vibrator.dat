5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the spread of home {{electricity}} brought the vibrator to the consumer market. The appeal of cheaper treatment in the privacy of one's own home understandably made the vibrator a popular early home appliance. In fact, the electric home vibrator was on the market before many other home appliance 'essentials': nine years before the electric vacuum cleaner and 10 years before the electric iron. A page from a Sears catalog of home electrical appliances from 1918 includes a <b>portable</b> <b>vibrator</b> with attachments, billed as [...] "very useful and satisfactory for home service".|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to test a new <b>portable</b> <b>vibrator</b> for plaster pouring (developed for this purpose), {{comparing}} the effect of its use on the accuracy of working cast of implant-supported restorations to the conventional vibrator. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From a master cast with 2 implants, 30 transfer moldings were made randomly and divided into three groups: Group I (GI) : pouring performed in an outsourced dental laboratory with conventional plaster vibrator (10 casts), Group II (GII) : pouring performed in the laboratory of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) with conventional plaster vibrator (10 casts) and Group III (GIII) : pouring performed with the <b>portable</b> <b>vibrator</b> fabricated for this study (10 casts). The position of the analogue and marginal adaptation of the infrastructure were verified by testing the single screw on the master model and on the working model. The measurement of misfit was blindly performed with a precision microscope and analyzing unit, Quadra-Check 200. The data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Holm-Sidak test (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: Means±standard deviations were as follows: GI: 19. 19 ± 4. 73 µm; GII: 21. 72 ± 5. 41 µm; GIII: 13. 5 ± 2. 39 µm (P< 0. 05), with GIII significantly lower as compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that a greater accuracy of working cast was achieved when a <b>portable</b> <b>vibrator</b> was used for casting molds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of direct {{vibration}} during two sub-maximal isometric loading conditions on electromyographic output. Sixteen participants performed isometric knee extensions, at an angle of 150 °, under four conditions in random order: 1) a load of 10 % one repetition maximum [1 RM] with no vibration (10 %+NV); 2) a load of 30 % 1 RM with no vibration (30 %+NV); 3) a load of 10 % 1 RM with vibration (10 %+V); and 4) a load of 30 % 1 RM with vibration (30 %+V). Direct vibration (amplitude = 1. 2 mm, frequency = 65 Hz) was applied to the distal end of the quadriceps using a purpose built <b>portable</b> <b>vibrator.</b> Electromyographic root-mean-squared (EMGrms) output of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) was measured and assessed. Vibration significantly enhanced RF, VL and VM EMGrms output in comparison to no vibration in both the 10 % 1 RM and 30 % 1 RM loading conditions, but the degree of vibration induced enhancement was no...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{training}} {{is a novel}} strength training method that has gained popularity {{in the last five}} years. However, current findings on vibration training are contradictory about whether vibration {{training is}} an effective training method for strength and power development. A critical review of the relevant literature reveals that vibration training effect may be dependent on a number o f factors, in particular vibration characteristics (vibration amplitude and frequency) and exercise protocol (type of exercise and exercise intensity). However, {{there is a lack of}} study of many of these factors. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence o f these factors on the acute effect o f vibration training on neuromuscular performance. Methods: A <b>portable</b> muscle-tendon <b>vibrator</b> with variable vibration amplitude (0. 2 to 2 mm) and frequency (30 to 200 Hz) capacity was developed in the thesis. The vibration is produced by a number of rotating eccentric masses. The vibrator is strapped to the muscle tendon during the strength training exercise. Neuromuscular performance was assessed during strength training exercise by examining EMG and various mechanical outputs. The mechanical outputs included: angular velocity, moment and power assessed in terms of peak, average, rate of development and initial (first 100 ms) measures. Findings: Study 1 : The vibration amplitude on the vibrator and the muscle was affected by the eccentric mass, with a large eccentric mass (ems-II) producing significantly greater amplitude (1. 2 mm) than the small eccentric mass (0. 5 mm) (ems-I) (p 0. 05).

The transmissibility o f vibration amplitude from the vibrator to the muscle was significantly higher with ems-I (p 0. 05), and was 100 %. Vibration induced a significant increase in EMGrms of the biceps in sub-maximal isometric elbow flexion (p 0. 05), indicating the repeatability of the vibration load under various operational conditions. Study 2 : The vibration peak frequency of the vibrator was determined only by the motor rotating speed (p 0. 05). Vibration induced a significant increase in EMGrms of the biceps in sub-maximal isomctfic ClbOW flexion (p^Q. QS), with the greatest increase of EMGrms being induced by vibration with a frequency of 65 Hz and an amplitude of 1. 2 mm (p 0 05). Study 3 Vibration training induced enhancements m EMGrms o f the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) during sub-maximal isometric extension o f the knee (p 0 05) Resistance load had a significant effect on the enhancement, with the greater load (20 % 1 RM) producing a significantly higher EMGrms than the smaller load (10 % 1 RM), on both the VL (0 049 vs 0 038 mV, p 0 05) Similarly, after training there was no enhancement in the mechanical and EMG output when either the muscle was trained maximally or the muscle was rested (untrained) (p> 0 05). Study 5 Direct vibration did not enhance the mechanical (angular velocity, moment and power) and EMG output of a ballistic knee extension exercise during and after training On the contrary, vibration significantly increased the time to peak power (4 %, 10 % and 16 % in set 1, 2 and 3, respectively, p 0 05). On the contrary, vibration significantly decreased mean power with the 70 % 1 RM load (16 8 %, 13 % and 18 5 % in set 1, 2 and 3, respectively, p< 0 05) and the initial power with both loads (19 5 %, p< 0 05). Conclusion: A <b>portable</b> muscle tendon <b>vibrator</b> has been successfully developed to allow investigation of the effect of vibration at different frequencies and amplitudes during sub-maximal and maximal isometric and isotonic contractions. The vibrator can produce the required vibration load consistently across different operational conditions. For sub-maximal isometnc contractions, vibration could induce a significant increase of EMG. The enhancement was greater with the increase of vibration amplitude (1 2 vs 0 5 mm) and frequency (100 and 65 Hz vs 30 Hz). In addition, the higher resistance load could induce greater EMG response to vibration training with sub-maximal isometnc contraction. For maximal isotonic contractions, vibration did not enhance neuromuscular performance, and in fact had a negative effect on some mechanical and EMG outputs both dunng and after training Vibration alone (with no exercise) had no significant acute residual effect on the mechanical and EMG outputs of maximal isotonic contractions. The neuromuscular measurements m this thesis are repeatable across different test days...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies of}} persons with {{deafness}} (D) and/or deafblindness (DB) have primarily focused on the mobility and communication problems. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to develop technology for monitoring aids to improve the ability {{of persons with}} D and/or DB to detect, identify, and perceive direction of events that produce sounds in their surroundings. The purpose was achieved stepwise in four studies. In Study I, the focus was on hearing aids for persons with residual low frequency hearing. In Study II-IV, the focus was on vibratory aids for persons with total D. In Study I, six signal processing algorithms (calculation methods) based on two principles, transposition and modulation, were developed and evaluated regarding auditory identification of environmental sounds. Twenty persons with normal hearing listened to 45 environmental sounds processed with the six different algorithms and identified them in three experiments. In Exp. 1, the sounds were unknown and the subjects had to identify them freely. In Exp. 2 and 3, the sounds were known and the subjects had to identify them by choosing one of 45 sounds. The transposing algorithms showed better results (median value in Exp. 3, 64 %- 69 %) than the modulating algorithms (40 %- 52 %) did, and they were good candidates for implementing in a hearing aid for persons with residual low frequency hearing. In Study II, eight algorithms were developed based on three principles, transposition, modulation, and filtration – in addition to No Processing as reference, and evaluated for vibratory identification of environmental sounds. The transposing algorithms and the modulating algorithms were also adapted to the vibratory thresholds of the skin. Nineteen persons with profound D tested the algorithms using a stationary, wideband vibrator and identified them by choosing one of 10 randomly selected from the list of 45 sounds. One transposing algorithm and two modulating algorithms showed better (p< 0. 05) scores than did the No Processing method. Two transposing and three modulating algorithms showed better (p< 0. 05) scores than did the filtering algorithm. Adaptation to the vibratory thresholds of the skin did not improve the vibratory identification results. In Study III, the two transposing algorithms and the three modulating algorithms with the best identification scores in Study II, plus their adapted alternative, were evaluated in a laboratory study. Five persons from Study II with profound D tested the algorithms using a <b>portable</b> narrowband <b>vibrator</b> and identified the sounds by choosing one of 45 sounds in three experiments (Exp. 1, 2, and 3). In Exp. 1, the sounds were pre-processed and directly fed to the vibrator. In Exp. 2 and 3, the sounds were presented in an acoustic test room, without or with background noise (SNR=+ 5 dB), and processed in real time. Five of the algorithms had acceptable results (27 %- 41 %) in the three experiments and constitute candidates for a miniaturized vibratory aid (VA). The algorithms had the same rank order in both tests in the acoustic room (Exp. 2, and 3), and the noise did not worsen the identification results. In Study IV, the portable vibrotactile monitoring aid (with stationary processor) for detection, identification and directional perception of environmental sounds was evaluated in a field study. The same five persons with profound D as in Study III tested the aid using a randomly chosen algorithm, drawn from the five with the best results in Study III, in a home and in a traffic environment. The persons identified 12 events at home and five events in a traffic environment when they were inexperienced (the events were unknown) and later when they were experienced (the events were known). The VA consistently improved the ability with regard to detection, identification and directional perception of environmental sounds for all five persons. It is concluded that the selected algorithms improve the ability to detect, and identify sound emitting events. In future, the algorithms will be implemented in a low frequency hearing aid for persons with low frequency residual hearing or in a fully portable vibratory monitoring aid, for persons with profound D or DB to improve their ability to sense the environment...|$|R
