25|$|Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which is stable {{at room temperature}} because it reaches <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> At freezing temperatures, the structures inside mayonnaise undergo crystallization {{depending on the type}} of emulsion. Unlike mayonnaise, butter is a water-in-oil emulsion with the water phase having a higher freezing point than oil. When frozen, the small water droplets suspended in the continuous oil phase freeze where they are, while the rest of the oil stays in place. On thawing the butter, it regains its properties as the water droplets melt in their original locations.|$|E

[...] The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors. [...] It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design. [...] However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.|$|E

50|$|A {{traditional}} catalyst {{adheres to}} three general principles, namely: 1) it speeds up a chemical reaction; 2) it participates in, {{but is not}} consumed by, the reaction; and 3) it {{does not change the}} chemical equilibrium of the reaction. Epicatalysts overcome the third principle when gas-surface interactions are appreciable and gas-phase collisions are rare. Under these conditions the gas particles that desorb from an epicatalytic surface can retain characteristics of the gas-surface interactions far away from the surface because gas phase collisions are too infrequent to establish normal gas <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Because gas-surface interactions dominate over gas-phase interactions in determining the gas-phase concentrations, the gas phase can be held, continuously, far away from normal gas <b>phase</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E
