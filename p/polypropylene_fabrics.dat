40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to develop a}} {{mathematical}} model to predict vertical wicking behaviour of woven fabric. The first part of this series (Part I) has dealt with the mathematical model for predicting vertical wicking through yarn. In this part a model has been proposed to predict vertical wicking of the woven fabric, based on the developed yarn model. In order to model the flow through woven fabric along with the vertical flow through liquid carrying threads, the horizontal flow through transverse threads has also been taken into account. A simplified fabric geometrical concept (inclined tube geometry) and Peirce geometry for plain woven fabric have been used to define the fabric structure. Warp and weft linear density, fabric sett and yarn crimp have been considered in the fabric modelling. The theoretical wicking values of the yarn and fabric made from that yarn have been compared. Experimental verification of the model has been carried out using polyester and <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The model is found to predict the wicking height with time through the yarns and fabrics with reasonable accurac...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} the use of fabrics as reinforcements for cement composites. The present paper addresses the influence of the production processes, casting and pultrusion of fabric-cement composites, on the mechanical properties of the composites, fabric-matrix bond and microstructural characteristics. Bonded glass mesh fabrics, woven polyethylene fabrics and warp knitted weft insertion <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fabrics</b> were studied. Tensile, flexural and fabric-matrix bond tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. SEM observations were carried out to correlate microstructural characteristics with mechanical performance. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly identified in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points. This improved mechanical performance could be accounted for by the improved bonding, which was induced by the impregnation of the spaces between the filaments in the pultrusion process, and the lack of such effective impregnation is the casting process. However, in the epoxy impregnated fabric and the mono-filament fabric sufficient interfacial bonding could be obtained in the casting process and pultrusion did not yield a significant advantage...|$|E

As sedimentation of photocatalyst particles is facilitated by their flocculation, the influence of common constituents of biologically pretreated wastewaters (NaCl, NaHCO 3, and their combination with humic acid sodium salt) on flocculation was tested by the pipet method. Results showed {{that the impact of}} these substances on TiO 2 nanoparticle flocculation is rather complex and strongly affected by pH. When humic acid was present, TiO 2 particles did not show efficient flocculation in the neutral and slightly basic pH range. As an alternative to photocatalyst separation by sedimentation, precoat vacuum filtration with powdered activated carbon (PAC) over low-cost spunbond <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fabrics</b> was tested in the presence of two PAC types in aqueous NaCl and NaHCO 3 solutions as well as in biologically treated greywater and in secondary municipal effluent.

40|$|Engineering of {{materials}} used for shielding from electromagnetic fields is currently {{one of the}} most extensively developing field of applications of composite materials (Bula et al., 2006; Jaroszewski & Ziaja, 2010; Koprowska et al., 2004, 2008; Sarto et al. 2003, 2005; Wei et al., 2006; Ziaja et al., 2008, 2009, 2010). The choice of suitable materials for the shields and their appropriate arrangement have an essential meaning. Development of lightweight and resistant to environmental exposure shielding materials is possible by using substrates of polypropylene and plasma technology (Ziaja&Jaroszewski, 2011). The shields for suppression of electric field were made in the form of composites of polypropylene unwoven fabrics with deposited plasma layers. Additional advantage of the application of the method is the possibility of plasma cleaning of a fabric surface and modifying its surface properties. The unique properties of pulse plasma make possible to obtain metallic and dielectric coatings on <b>polypropylene</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are not achievable by standard methods. The coatings are characterized by a good adhesion to the substrates. The surface of the samples was examined in two ways: by metallurgical microscope Nikon MA 200 and scanning microscope Quanta 200 in the low vacuum mode. To identify the structure of the obtained layers the X-Ray radiography was used. Additionally properties of the composites was studied using impedance spectroscopy. The method of impedance spectroscopy allows one to connect the measured frequency characteristics with the physical structure of tested material and the alternations in the structure. This method has been used by the authors to determine the properties of plasma layers deposited on a polypropylene nonwoven fabric (Jaroszewski et al., 2010 a; Pospieszna et al., 2010; Pospieszna et al., 2010 b) ...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the bactericidal effects of fabrics coated with the hydroxyapatite-binding silver/titanium dioxide ceramic nanocomposite &quot;Earth-plus&quot;. Methods: Bactericidal activities of woven and nonwoven fabrics coated with Earth-plus were investigated by the time-kill curve method using nine bacterial strains, including three Staphylococcus aureus, three Escherichia coli, and three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Results: The numbers of viable S. aureus and E. coli cells on both fabrics coated with Earth-plus decreased to below 2 log 10 colony-forming units/mL in six hours and reached the detection limit in 18 hours. Viable cell counts of P. aeruginosa on both fabrics coated with Earth-plus could not be detected after 3 &ndash; 6 hours. Viable cells on woven fabrics showed a more rapid decline than those on nonwoven fabrics. Bacterial cell counts of the nine strains on fabrics without Earth-plus failed to decrease even after 18 hours.
