At that time, Felix was located north of the Lesser Antilles, moving to the north-northwest due to an approaching trough weakening the ridge. After peak winds, Felix weakened due to stronger wind shear and its eyewall replacement cycle. The eye became indistinct and opened on August13, {{and it became a}} minimal hurricane by August14 with a broad inner core. Late on August14, Hurricane Felix turned more to the west-northwest, after the trough that previously brought it northward split into two pieces of energy, one moving southward and the other moving northeastward. On August15, the hurricane passed about 75mi (120km) south of Bermuda, and a building ridge was anticipated to allow Felix to continue its trajectory toward North Carolina.|$|E

It moved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north, a motion the depression would continue for much of its duration. Nearby ship reports indicated gradual strengthening, and the depression became a tropical storm on August11. At 0400UTC on August12, the San Juan Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. That day, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the storm, reporting a pressure of [...] and flight level winds of its <b>peak</b> <b>surface</b> winds were estimated at 60mph (95km/h).

500|$|Situated along a {{weakness}} in the subtropical ridge, Bret drifted very slowly southward during {{the initial stages of}} its existence. Though traces of dry air approached it from the west, the cyclone continued to strengthen, as prominent bands of deep thunderstorms tightened around it eastern semicircle. Satellite images displayed a disorganized eye-like feature on July 18, suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength. Indeed, an additional reconnaissance flight into the cyclone found <b>peak</b> <b>surface</b> winds of around 70mph (110km/h), just below hurricane strength. Following its peak, Bret began to accelerate toward the northeast in response to building high pressure in the area. It fluctuated little in intensity for several hours, although a combination of high wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture inhibited further development. By July 19, the circulation center had become exposed and devoid of deep convection, and the storm weakened to 50mph (85km/h) winds upon moving through the increasingly hostile environment.

2500|$|Tracking {{through an}} area of {{extremely}} low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content, Felix quickly developed a well-defined eye, a symmetric cloud structure, and strong upper-level outflow; consequently, the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward. Felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800UTC on September 2 while located about 490mi (790km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. Rapid strengthening continued, and later that day the hurricane attained Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with the pressure dropping to 957mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg); this corresponded to a falling rate of 3.4mbar (hPa; 0.1inHg) per hour, which the National Hurricane Center described as [...] "one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed." [...] A Hurricane Hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye, and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14mi (22km). A subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175mph (280km/h), with <b>peak</b> <b>surface</b> winds of 163mph (263km/h) reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall; surface winds of 189mph (306km/h) were found in its northeastern quadrant, although the National Hurricane Center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds. Based on the observations, it is estimated Felix attained winds of 175mph (280km/h) by 0000UTC on September 3 while located about 390mi (625km) southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, making Felix a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. While investigating the hurricane, Hurricane Hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel, which forced the flight to abort the mission.|$|E
