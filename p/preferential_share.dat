40|$|Ontario’s current {{method for}} trying to ensure the fair {{distribution}} of an intestate’s estate, or the estate of an individual without a valid Last Will and Testament, is outlined in the Succession Law Reform Act. Specifically, section 45 (1) outlines the foundational concept of a “preferential share,” which entitles the surviving spouse to a prescribed financial interest in the estate which is prioritized above all other heirs. The concept of a <b>preferential</b> <b>share</b> stands in sharp contrast with historical English common law methods of devolving intestate estates in which legal entitlements were heavily influenced by an individual’s gender and marital status. In light of the historical influence of gender and marital status on intestacy legislation, this paper investigates the origins {{and development of the}} <b>preferential</b> <b>share</b> provision. This paper uses an analytical framework emphasizing the historically gendered experiences of widows and widowers, and how their gender informed the nature of their legal interests under intestacy. In addition, this essay frames its analysis within historical commentary that demonstrates a sharp conceptual dichotomy between the “good wife and deserving widow” or the “bad wife and undeserving widow,” and how such categorization impacted perceptions of what a fair and reasonable devolution entailed...|$|E

The authors examined linkage in {{the families of}} 14 probands with bipolar illness, with the candidate genes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Dq dopamine receptor (DRD 4) at 11 p 15, tyrosinase (TYR) at 11 q 14 -q 21, and D- 2 dopamine receptor (DRD 2) at 11 q 22 -q 23, {{as well as with}} the c-Harvey-ras oncogene (HRAS) and insulin gene (INS), both located at 11 p 15, a region that previously showed linkage to bipolar illness. Method: The genetic data were analyzed with both lod score analysis (parametric) and affected-sib-pair analysis (nonparametric); both narrow and broad definitions of the clinical phenotype were used. Further influences of diagnostic uncertainties were accounted for by using diagnostic probability classes weighing the stability of each phenotype. Results: Two-point linkage results excluded close linkage of bipolar illness to each candidate gene; negative results were also obtained when the narrow definition of the clinical phenotype was used. Moreover, multipoint linkage analysis of HRAS and INS excluded the 11 p 15 region encompassing both DRD 4 and TH. In agreement with the negative linkage results, affected-sib-pair analysis did not show <b>preferential</b> <b>sharing</b> of marker alleles at arty of the candidate genes. Conclusions: The negative results obtained under different genetic models exclude a frequent role for DRD 4, TH, TYR, and DRD 2 in the pathogenesis of bipolar illness...|$|R

2500|$|Typically, a company's {{articles}} will vest {{a general}} power of {{management in the}} board of directors, with full power of directors to delegate tasks to other employees, subject to an instruction right reserved for the general meeting acting with a three quarter majority. This basic pattern can theoretically be varied {{in any number of}} ways, and so long as it does not contravene the Act, courts will enforce that balance of power. In Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame, a shareholder sued the board for not following a resolution, carried with an ordinary majority of votes, to sell off the company's assets. The Court of Appeal refused the claim, since the articles stipulated that a three quarter majority was needed to issue specific instructions to the board. Shareholders always have the option of gaining the votes to change the constitution or threaten directors with removal, but they may not sidestep the separation of powers found in the company constitution. Though older cases raise an element of uncertainty, the majority opinion is that other provisions of a company's constitution generate personal rights that may be enforced by company members individually. Of the most important is a member's right to vote at meetings. Votes need not necessarily attach to <b>shares,</b> as <b>preferential</b> <b>shares</b> [...] (e.g., [...] those with extra dividend rights) are frequently non-voting. However, ordinary shares invariably do have votes and in Pender v Lushington Lord Jessel MR stated votes were so sacrosanct as to be enforceable like a [...] "right of property". Otherwise, the articles may be enforced by any member privy to the contract. Companies are excluded from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, so people who are conferred benefits under a constitution, but are not themselves members, are not necessarily able to sue for compliance. Partly for certainty and to achieve objectives the Act would prohibit, shareholders in small closely held companies frequently supplement the constitution by entering a shareholders' agreement. By contract shareholders can regulate any of their rights outside the company, yet their rights within the company remain a separate matter.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the under-researched field of political selection, namely one’s re-selection onto the party list after one has been elected in the previous term. The theoretical rationale is to introduce a broader concept of political selection to a field mostly focused on political recruitment, one’s first point of entry into Politics.

2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel <b>preferential</b> <b>shares</b> before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|R

40|$|Transcription {{factors of}} the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) family play crucial roles in epidermis-related processes. To gain further {{insight into the}} {{molecular}} function of OUTER CELL LAYER 1 (OCL 1), 14 target genes up- or down-regulated in transgenic maize (Zea mays) plants overexpressing OCL 1 were identified. The 14 genes all showed partial coexpression with OCL 1 in maize organs, and several of them <b>shared</b> <b>preferential</b> expression in the epidermis with OCL 1. They encoded proteins involved in lipid metabolism, defense, envelope-related functions, or cuticle biosynthesis and include ZmWBC 11 a (for white brown complex 11 a), an ortholog of AtWBC 11 involved in the transport of wax and cutin molecules. In support of the annotations, OCL 1 -overexpressing plants showed quantitative and qualitative changes of cuticular wax compounds in comparison with wild-type plants. An increase in C 24 to C 28 alcohols was correlated with the transcriptional up-regulation of ZmFAR 1, coding for a fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase. Transcriptional activation of ZmWBC 11 a by OCL 1 was likely direct, since transactivation in transiently transformed maize kernels was abolished by a deletion of the activation domain in OCL 1 or mutations in the L 1 box, a cis-element bound by HD-ZIP IV transcription factors. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to AP 2 /EREBP and MYB-type transcription factors, members of the HD-ZIP IV family contribute to the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis.

40|$|This paper investigates Central America''s {{external}} linkages {{over the}} last fifteen years of increased integration in light of the 2008 - 09 global recession. Using structural VAR models, it is found that a one percent shock to U. S. growth shifts economic activity in Central America by 0. 7 to 1 percent, on average. Spillovers from global shocks {{and the rest of the}} region also affect activity in some countries. Spillovers are mostly transmitted through advanced country financial conditions and fluctuations in external demand for Central American exports. Shocks to advanced economies associated with the 2008 - 09 financial crisis lowered economic activity in the region by 4 to 5 percent, on average, accounting for a majority of the observed slowdown. The impact was almost twice as large as elasticities estimated on pre-crisis data would have predicted. These results underscore the importance of operating credible policy frameworks that enable a countercyclical policy response to external shocks.
