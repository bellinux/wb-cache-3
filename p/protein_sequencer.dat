The current release contains 21 reference maps based on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) of proteins from rice tissues and subcellular compartments. These reference maps comprise 11 941 identified proteins showing tissue and subcellular localization, corresponding to 4180 separate protein entries in the database. The Rice Proteome Database contains the calculated properties of each protein such as molecular weight, isoelectric point and expression; experimentally determined properties such as amino acid sequences obtained using <b>protein</b> <b>sequencers</b> and mass spectrometry; {{and the results of}} database searches such as sequence homologies. The database is searchable by keyword, accession number, protein name, isoelectric point, molecular weight and amino acid sequence, or by selection of a spot on one of the 2 D-PAGE reference maps. Cross-references are provided to tools for proteomics and to other 2 D-PAGE databases, which in turn provide many links to other molecular databases.

50|$|Protein {{sequencing}} is {{the practical}} process {{of determining the}} amino acid sequence of {{all or part of}} a protein or peptide. This may serve to identify the protein or characterize its post-translational modifications. Typically, partial sequencing of a protein provides sufficient information (one or more sequence tags) to identify it with reference to databases of protein sequences derived from the conceptual translation of genes. The two major direct methods of protein sequencing are mass spectrometry and Edman degradation using a <b>protein</b> sequenator (<b>sequencer).</b> Mass spectrometry methods are now the most widely used for protein sequencing and identification but Edman degradation remains a valuable tool for characterizing a protein's N-terminus.|$|R

These are the more unpredictable off-shoots of the innovation enforcement policy rather than the positive outcomes. In this group, the types of academic-industrial interactions can be quite different. We allude for an example to the stories of shared equipment arrangements between company and university. Shared-use equipment is a vital element in the research infrastructure in many universities around the world. It provides a cost-effective way for groups of researchers from different departments or different universities to use commercially-available equipment that costs more than certain amount (for instance, for National Institute of Health, USA, it is more than $ 100, 000, 000; for post-Soviet countries, it can be lower costs).

5000|$|These new {{instruments}} had a {{major impact}} on the emerging fields of proteomics and genomics.The gas-liquid phase <b>protein</b> <b>sequencer</b> was developed with Michael W. Hunkapiller, then a research fellow at Caltech. [...] The instrument makes use of the chemical process known as the Edman degradation, devised by Pehr Edman. Edman and Begg's 1967 design involves placing a protein or peptide sample into a spinning cup in a temperature controlled chamber. Reagents are added to cleave the protein one amino acid at the time, followed by solvents to allow extraction of reagents and byproducts. A series of analysis cycles is performed to identify a sequence, one cycle for each amino acid, and the cycle times were lengthy. Hood and Hunkapiller made a number of modifications, further automating steps in the analysis and improving effectiveness and shortening cycle time. By applying reagents in the gas phase instead of the liquid phase, the retention of the sample during the analysis and the sensitivity of the instrument were increased. Polybrene was used as a substrate coating to better anchor proteins and peptides,and the purification of reagents was improved. HPLC analysis techniques were used to reduce analysis times and extend the technique's applicable range.The amount of protein required for an analysis decreased, from 10-100 nanomoles for Edman and Begg's <b>protein</b> <b>sequencer,</b> to the low picomole range, a revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of the technology.

The ES-MS and capillary-skimmer collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra of eight dimethylaminopropylthiohydantoin (DMAP-TH) amino acid derivatives as well as the trimethylaminopropylthiohydantoin (TMAP-TH), diethylaminopropylthiohydantoin, and dibutylaminopropylthiohydantoin (DBAP-TH) derivatives of Phe are presented. The spectra contain prominent [M + H]+ ions as well as fragment ions due to the loss of the respective neutral alkylamines. The CID spectrum of DMAP-TH-Phe also contains the dibutylaminoethyl cation. The relative responses of the alkylamine thiohydantoin derivatives obtained under identical solvent conditions are found to increase as the solvophobicity of the amino acid R group increases; the most solvophobic DBAP-TH-Phe gives rise to the highest overall response.
