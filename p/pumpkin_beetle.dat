50|$|Raphidopalpa foveicollis, the red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is a foliar pest {{of members of the}} Cucurbitaceae, {{particularly}} the pumpkin.|$|E
50|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.The red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (Raphidopalpa foveicollis) is a serious pest of cucurbits, especially the pumpkin, which it can defoliate.Cucurbits are susceptible to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pumpkin</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are found}} in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Some of the more {{important}} pest species are A. foveicollis from Africa, Europe and Asia, A. similis from southern and southeastern Asia, A. coffeae from Malaysia, A. flavomarginata from Malaysia and Indonesia, A. femoralis from Myanmar and Vietnam, A. lewisii from Malaysia and Vietnam, and A. frontalis from Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetles</b> feed on {{the foliage}} and flowers of the host plants; {{seedlings}} may be destroyed by heavy attacks and young plants may be severely affected. Several beetles may cluster on a single leaf, leaving other leaves untouched. The beetles feed between the veins, often cutting and removing circular discs which they then eat. The larvae tunnel into the roots, which become swollen, discoloured and distorted, and the plant may die.|$|R
40|$|To {{find out}} {{preferred}} cucurbit host(s) of the <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> {{and to determine}} the susceptibility of ten different cucurbits to the pest, a trial was conducted under field conditions. The results revealed that the most preferred host of the red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (RPB) was muskmelon, which was followed by khira, cucumber and sweet gourd, and these may be graded as susceptible hosts. Bitter gourd, sponge gourd, ribbed gourd and snake gourd were least or non preferred hosts of RPB and these may be graded as resistant hosts. Other two crops, the bottle gourd and ash gourd were moderately preferred hosts of the insect and these may be graded as moderately susceptible hosts. The order of the most preferred host of the blue <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> may be shown as bitter gourd> ribbed gourd> sponge gourd. Of these cucurbits, population of blue <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was much {{higher than that of}} red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> The hosts most preferred to RPB are less preferred or not preferred to the blue <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> The field trials revealed that the order of preference of RPB for ten tested cucurbit hosts was muskmelon> sweet gourd> cucumber> khira> ash gourd> bottle gourd> sponge gourd ≥ ribbed gourd ≥ snake gourd> bitter gourd...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the eco-biology and management of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (Aulacophora foveicollis Lucas) on Indian snap melon during 2011 and 2012 in different areas of Punjab. Ten landraces of Indian snap melons were screened out {{on the basis of}} population and damage infestation of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Aulacophora foveicollis during cropping season 2011. Maximum population (8. 06) and infestation (15. 46 %) was recorded in landrace SHW. However minimum population (5. 56) and infestation (10. 63 %) was recorded in landrace BHW. In another experiment synthetic insecticides (carbaryl, imidacloprid, bifenthrin) were also evaluated. Carbaryl dust was most effective minimum population (3. 63) and infestation (7. 56 %) was recorded in this treatment, however, maximum population (3. 91) and infestation (8. 85) was recorded in in plot treated with Imidacloprid. In Botanical screening, minimum population and infestation was recorded in plot treated with Neem seed kernel extract 4. 31, 9. 1, respectively. In mechanical control screening minimum population (5. 82) and infestation (13. 06) recorded in plots treated using Yellow Sticky Traps. Host plant susceptibility indices was also calculated maximum susceptibility was recorded in landrace SHW (12 %) and minimum in BHW (8 %). Data of different physical and biochemical characters of various landraces of Indian snap melon were observed. Effect of these physical and biochemical plant characters was evaluated in relation to population and infestation caused by red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> Physical plant characters like Leaf Area and Leaf Sheath Thickness were calculated varying significantly among different landraces while Moisture contents (%) and Hair Density were non-significant when compared. Bio-chemical plant characters including Nitrogen (%), Phosphorous (%), Potassium (%), Carbohydrate (%), Iron (%), Cu (%), Zinc (%) were recorded significant while factors like Fat (%), Mg (%) and Total Minerals (%) were non-significant among different landraces. Impact of Leaf Area (cm 2), Leaf Sheath Thickness (µm), Moisture Contents (%), Nitrogen (%), Carbohydrate (%), Cu (%), Zinc (%) was recorded positive to population and infestation of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> However, the impact of Phosphorous (%) and Potassium (%) contents had a negative impact on the population infestation of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle.</b> Effect of weather factors (temperature and rainfall) on the population dynamics of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was also worked out. Effect of temperature on the population was calculated positive while the impact of temperature on the infestation cannot be calculated because it depends on crop stage and leaf density. Whereas, the effect of rainfall on the population of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was calculated negative. Maximum population (13. 16) of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> was observed during 1 st week of May afterward it goes on declining and maximum infestation (20. 36 %) was recorded on 1 st date of observation as minimum density of leaves was present at that time. Mean population and infestation caused by red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> against different treatments was recorded. Minimum population and infestation was recorded in treatment no. 7 (carbaryl + neem + yellow sticky traps) in all districts. Maximum population reduction and infestation reduction percentage was recorded in the same treatment in all districts. Overall trend of different treatment were as Control > Yellow Sticky Traps > Neem > Neem + Yellow Sticky Traps > Carbaryl > Carbaryl + Yellow Sticky Traps > Carbaryl + Neem > Carbaryl + Neem + Yellow Sticky Traps...|$|E
40|$|The red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Aulacophora foveicollis (Lucas) is a common, {{serious and}} major pest {{of a wide}} range of cucurbitaceous vegetables. It is {{injurious}} to the crops and cause severe damage to almost all cucurbits. The present study was conducted to find out the host suitability of red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle,</b> Aulacophora foveicollis (Lucas) among different cucurbit hosts in the Laboratory and Field Laboratory of the Department of Entomology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh. This study was investigated with a view to explore a resistant host to this pest. The experiment was laid out in the completely randomized design (CRD) and Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) in laboratory and field respectively with five replications. Three cucurbit hosts such as sweet gourd (Var. BARI Sweet gourd 1), bitter gourd (Var. Hybrid Nepali) and bottle gourd (Var. Kajla) were selected to conduct this research work. Host suitability was determined depending on the average number of beetles present per plant in field. But in the laboratory host suitability was measured following force feeding and choice feeding bioassays. In the field at three different stages of the plant the highest number of beetle per plant was observed on the sweet gourd and the lowest number was found on bitter gourd. Similarly both in force feeding and choice feeding bioassays the highest leaf feeding was observed on sweet gourd and the lowest leaf feeding was determined on the bitter gourd. Both in the laboratory and field among the three cucurbit hosts sweet gourd was the most suitable and bitter gourd was the least suitable host for red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle...</b>|$|E

The treatment consisted of five different concentrations of multineem i. e. 2 ml/litre, 3 ml/litre, 4 ml/litre, 5 ml/litre, and control (water) replicated four times in randomized complete block design. There were altogether three sprays (beginning 15 day of sowing) at ten days interval and total number of beetle population were counted in leaf whorl before spray, after four, seven and ten days in each succeeding spray. The results showed that 5 ml/litre concentration of multineem gave the highest reduction of beetle population (100 %) followed by 4 ml/litre (91. 5 %), 3 ml/litre (63 %) and 2 ml/litre (37. 9 %), respectively...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on Raphidopalpa foveicollis (Lucas) in {{an organic}} {{cultivation}} of winter melon in western Sicily Red <b>pumpkin</b> <b>beetle</b> (Raphidopalpa foveicollis), is a Chrysomelidae beetle that lives on various species of cucurbits with greater preference for Cucumis sp. Both larval and adult stages are injurious to the crops. The former feeds on roots and stems of the plants, {{while the latter}} feeds on foliage, petals and fruits. In Sicily, this insect {{has occurred in the}} past as a secondary pest on the winter melon, but sometimes it reaches levels of infestation to arouse considerable concern among farmers. In order to implement economic methods of pest control a study on organic cultivation of winter melon was conducted in Camporeale (500 meters a. s. l.) (Palermo). Particularly, the dynamics of population and infestation levels have been investigated, taking into account also the possible influence of mulching, using chromotropic traps. Such traps consisted of yellow adhesive plates placed horizontally in mulched rows, on the plastic film, and between the rows, on the ground. In addition, surveys were carried out by comparing mulched plots and not mulched ones. Results showed that the peak catches (47. 4 adults / trap) occurred in mid-June and the greater number of catches was found in the traps placed between the rows, with significant difference. A greater number of individuals has been detected on plants of the not mulched plots than that of the mulched plots, even though no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of plants with damaged leaves ranged from 68. 7...|$|E
