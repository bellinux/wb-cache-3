5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and {{confidence of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), which was already high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E

5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E

25|$|The {{actual torque}} the rider must {{apply to the}} {{handlebars}} to maintain a steady-state turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider position, tire properties, turn radius, and forward speed. At low speeds, the steering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite {{the direction of the}} turn, even when the steering angle is {{in the direction of the}} turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often becomes <b>positive,</b> <b>that</b> is in the same direction as the turn.|$|E

25|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{force on}} the diver is {{the weight of the}} volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is <b>positive,</b> <b>that</b> force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef).|$|E
25|$|By July 1934, Dillinger {{had dropped}} {{completely}} out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, {{he was able to}} lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago. When the authorities found Dillinger's blood-spattered getaway car on a Chicago side street, they were <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> he was in the city.|$|E

However, on 28 July 2015, the Supreme Court issued a statement in denounced the International Commission demands.

25|$|Despite the Australian media {{treating}} {{the defeat of}} the Papua New Guinean team as a mere formality, with the team having odds of 125-1 to win the tournament, the players and journalists at home were <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> the Kumuls could make a lasting impression in the tournament. After their first up 42-0 defeat against Australia, the team's enthusiasm and crunching tackles were praised, but ball control and creativity let the team down hugely. However the team faced much more criticism after their 76-12 thrashing suffered at the hands of New Zealand, with fans angry at the poor display from the players and some questioning the credentials of new coach Stanley Gene. Days after the match a broader look at the sport in the country occurred with one assessment concluding that rugby league was poorly managed and former PNG great Marcus Bai called on clubs to supply a greater number of representative standard players especially from the New Guinea Islands region which had supplied five of this year's team. The way politics had made its way into the governing of the sport was also condemned.|$|E

John Schlight, in his A War Too Long, said of the PAVN's logistical apparatus:"This sustained effort, requiring the full-time activities {{of tens of thousands}} of soldiers, who might otherwise have been fighting in South Vietnam, seems proof <b>positive</b> <b>that</b> the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail had disrupted the North Vietnamese war effort." ...|$|E

The team made its WWF television debut on the July 18, 1993 episode of All-American Wrestling, teaming with Blake Beverly in a loss to Tatanka and The Steiner Brothers.
