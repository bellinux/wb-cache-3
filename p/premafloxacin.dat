40|$|<b>Premafloxacin</b> {{is a novel}} 8 -methoxy {{fluoroquinolone}} with enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus. We found <b>premafloxacin</b> to be 32 -fold {{more active}} than ciprofloxacin against wild-type S. aureus. Single mutations in either subunit of topoisomerase IV caused a four- to eightfold increase in the MICs of both quinolones. A double mutation (gyrA and either grlA or grlB) caused a 32 -fold increase in the MIC of <b>premafloxacin,</b> while the MIC of ciprofloxacin increased 128 -fold. <b>Premafloxacin</b> {{appeared to be a}} poor substrate for NorA, with NorA overexpression causing an increase of twofold or less in the MIC of <b>premafloxacin</b> in comparison to a fourfold increase in the MIC of ciprofloxacin. The frequency of selection of resistant mutants was 6. 4 × 10 − 10 to 4. 0 × 10 − 7 at twofold the MIC of <b>premafloxacin,</b> 2 to 4 log 10 less than that with ciprofloxacin. Single-step mutants could not be selected at higher concentrations of <b>premafloxacin.</b> In five single-step mutants, only one previously described uncommon mutation (Ala 116 Glu), and four novel mutations (Arg 43 Cys, Asp 69 Tyr, Ala 176 Thr, and Pro 157 Leu), three of which were outside the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were found. Genetic linkage studies, in which incross of grlA+ and outcross of mutations were performed, showed a high correlation between the mutations and the resistance phenotypes, and allelic exchange experiments confirmed the role of the novel mutations in grlA in resistance. Our results suggest that although topoisomerase IV is the primary target of <b>premafloxacin,</b> <b>premafloxacin</b> appears to interact with topoisomerase IV in a manner different from that of other quinolones and that the range of the QRDR of grlA should be expanded...|$|E

Therapeutic treatment of animal diseases is necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality, {{as well as to}} decrease econom-ic losses to farmers. The fluoroquinolones are a class of anti-microbial agents uniquely suited for use in treatment of animal diseases due to their activity against a broad range of veteri-nary pathogens, particularly the gram-negative bacilli (1, 3). Several fluoroquinolones are approved or under development for animal health use in the United States or Europe, including enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, sarafloxacin, and marbofloxacin (1 – 3, 7). <b>Premafloxacin</b> (PD- 140288, U- 95376), chemically defined a...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen qnr-containing transconjugants were {{constructed}} with azide-resistant Escherichia coli J 53 as the recipient, and the MICs of 12 quinolones were tested by agar dilution methods. Sitafloxacin, BAYy 3118, and <b>premafloxacin</b> had higher activity in vitro than ciprofloxacin against transconjugants and donors containing qnr. The donors had higher quinolone MICs than the transconjugants...|$|E

The in vitro activity values (MICs) of linezolid, eperezolid, and comparator antibiotics against 102 strains of Rhodococcus equi isolated from humans and animals were determined.

40|$|We {{report for}} the first time {{low-level}} quinolone resistance mediated by decreased expression of topoisomerase IV in Staphylococcus aureus. A single-step mutant of wild-type S. aureus strain ISP 794, P 18 selected by using twice the MIC of <b>premafloxacin,</b> had four- and four- to eightfold greater MICs of <b>premafloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, respectively, than the wild type. Sequencing of parEC and gyrBA with their promoter regions revealed a point mutation (G→A) 13 bp upstream of the start codon of parE. Genetic linkage studies showed that there was a high level of correlation between the mutation and the resistance phenotype, and allelic exchange confirmed the contribution of the mutation to resistance. Decreased expression of ParE and decreased steady-state levels of parEC transcripts in P 18 and in resistant allelic exchange mutants were observed. The steady-state levels of gyrBA and topB transcripts were increased in P 18 but not in two resistant allelic exchange mutants, and sequencing upstream of either gene did not reveal a difference between ISP 794 and P 18. The steady-state levels of topA transcripts were similar in the various strains. Growth competition experiments performed at 30, 37, and 41 °C with a susceptible allelic exchange strain and a resistant allelic exchange strain suggested that loss of fitness was associated with reduced levels of ParE at 41 °C. However, P 18 had a growth advantage over ISP 794 at all temperatures, suggesting that a compensatory mechanism was associated with the increased levels of gyrBA and topB transcripts. Thus, reduced levels of ParE appear to be compatible with cell survival, although there may be a fitness cost during rapid cell multiplication, which might be overcome by compensatory mechanisms without reversion of the resistance phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The present multicenter study proposes broth microdilution {{quality control}} (QC) ranges for the {{antimicrobial}} agents ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin G-novobiocin, pirlimycin, <b>premafloxacin,</b> and spectinomycin, {{which are used}} in veterinary practice. Six separate laboratories tested replicates of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) -recommended QC organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) on medium lots both common and unique to all laboratories. The proposed ranges were within 3 or 4 log 2 dilution steps of the modal MICs for all organism-antimicrobial agent pairs, depending on their MIC distributions. With > or = 94. 7 % of all MIC results being within the proposed QC ranges, all combinations tested comply with NCCLS guidelines and all have been accepted by the NCCLS subcommittee developing susceptibility testing procedures for veterinary laboratories...|$|E
40|$|This multicenter study proposes {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility (MIC and disk diffusion methods) {{quality control}} (QC) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. Alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) -recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). In addition, disk diffusion zone diameter QC limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and <b>premafloxacin</b> by using E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. The results from {{five or six}} participating laboratories produced ≥ 99. 0 % of MICs and ≥ 95. 0 % of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. The NCCLS Subcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next M 31 document...|$|E
