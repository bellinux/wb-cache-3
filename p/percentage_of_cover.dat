They felt {{the sting of}} their punk rock audience, who scornfully {{rejected}} the band's sudden conversion to commercial rock. Disunity over the band's direction was rampant and {{eventually led to the}} exit of guitarist James Singletary. The band's next album showed an even greater fragmentation in their musical approach: Schizophrenic Circus (1984) featured a new guitarist, Shawn Paddock, and new producers Rick Chertoff and William Wittman but lacked a group cohesion. To its critics, the album drifts among musical forms and relies heavily on a high <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> songs: the quasi-psychedelia of [...] "Good Thing I Know Her" [...] (which bears the album title in its lyrics) conveyed yet another new departure for the band's sound, [...] "bewildering" [...] to some. [...] With some difficulty, Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone described Schizophrenic Circus as [...] "postpunk folk-rock with garage-band propulsion and longhair tunefulness." ...|$|E
40|$|Phytostabilisation (i. e. using {{plants to}} immobilise contaminants) {{represents}} a well-known technology to hamper heavy metal spread across landscapes. In Katanga (D. R. Congo), Microchloa altera, a tolerant grass from the copper hills, was recently {{identified as a}} candidate species to stabilise copper in the soil. More than 50 grasses compose this flora, which may be studied to implement phytostabilisation strategies. However, {{little is known about}} their phenology, tolerance, reproductive strategy or demography. The present study aims to characterize the other Poaceae that may be used in phytostabilisation purposes based on the following criteria: their ecological distribution, seed production at two times, abundance, soil coverage and the germination percentage of their seeds. We selected seven perennial Poaceae that occur on the copper hills. Their ecological distributions (i. e. species response curves) have been modelled along copper or cobalt gradients with generalized additive models using logic link based on 172 presence/absence samples on three sites. For other variables, a total of 69 quadrats (1 m 2) were randomly placed across three sites and habitats. For each species, we compared the number of inflorescence-bearing stems (IBS) by plot, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> the number of seeds by IBS and the estimated number of seeds by plot between sites and habitat. Three species (Andropogon schirensis, Eragrostis racemosa and Loudetia simplex) were very interesting for phytostabilisation programs. They produced a large quantity of seeds and had the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> However, A. schirensis and L. simplex presented significant variations in the number of seeds and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> according to site.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{possibility}} of using water sensitive papers (WSP) to estimate the amount of deposit on the target when varying the spray characteristics. To identify the main quantities influencing the deposit, some simplifying hypotheses were applied to simulate WSP behaviour: log-normal distribution of the diameters of the drops and circular stains randomly placed on the images. A very large number (4704) of images of WSPs were produced by means of simulation. The images were obtained by simulating drops of different arithmetic mean diameter (40 - 300 µm), different coefficient of varia-tion (0. 1 - 1. 5), and different <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> surface (2 - 100 %, not considering overlaps). These images were considered to be effec-tive WSP images and then analysed using image processing software in order to measure the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> surface, the number of particles, and the area of each particle; the deposit was then calculat-ed. These data were correlated with those used to produce the images, varying the spray characteristics. As far as the drop populations are concerned, a classification based on the volume median diameter only should be avoided, especially in case of high variability. This, in fact, results in classifying sprays with very low arithmetic mean diameter as extremely or ultra coarse. The WSP image analysis shows that the rela-tion between simulated and computed <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> surface is independent of the type of spray, whereas impact density and unitary deposit can be estimated from the computed <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> surface only if the spray characteristics (arithmetic mean and coeffi-cient of variation of the drop diameters) are known. These data can be estimated by analysing the particles on the WSP images.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{interest}} in mapping Posidonia oceanica beds has increased along with {{the improvement of the}} equipment’s precision of data acquisition. In Calvi Bay (Corsica, France) the meadows cover an area of about 5 km² and are found at a depth ranging from 3 m to 37 m. The availability of three distinct datasets for 1997, 2002 and 2010 allowed to assess changes in the patchiness of the meadows in the bay and to investigate evolution of maps precision through a surface analysis via GIS software. Thus, three maps were elaborated combining aerial photographs and side scan sonar images. The meadows <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> through time was assessed using four bathymetric sections: 0 - 10 m, 11 - 20 m, 21 - 30 m and 31 - 40 m. Differences in the patchiness of P. oceanica meadows between 1997 and 2010 appear to be moderate (less than 3 %) in the sections 0 - 10 m and 11 - 20 m and then greatly increase with depth: 24 % at 21 - 30 m and 39 % at 31 - 40 m. This amazing regression seems hardly natural and unlikely given the slight quantity of human activities that can cause damages on the P. oceanica meadows of the Calvi Bay. These results are likely to be mainly due to the improvement of precision and resolution of the aerial photographs (5 m in 1997, 0. 8 m in 2002 and 0. 5 m in 2010) and sonar images (5 m in 1997, 3 m in 2002 and 0. 5 m in 2010). An issue of habitat determination (human vs instrumental) linked with the method adopted for mapping can also cause differences in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> Given the different accuracy among the three maps, the real regression and fragmentation of P. oceanica meadows could be hardly assessed. However, in several areas where the human activities are important, a clear regression or even a disappearance of the meadows has been observed. It is obvious that the last maps are more accurate than the previous ones and, thus, the former can be used for management purpose as well as for study on the patchiness; however, they still keep uncertainty no matter which method is used to create them...|$|E

In areas which require overseeding, {{there is a}} need for a cool-season counterpart suitable for over-seeding. The goal of this field research is to evaluate a year-round turfgrass system for saline conditions using perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans), and a combination of perennial ryegrass and Puccinellia as the cool-season grasses. In the summer months, paspalum quality and density were reduced when overseeded with ryegrass or with a combination of puccinellia and ryegrass. Ryegrass quality and density decreased slightly as irrigation water salinity was increased from 0 to 3000 to 6000 mg/L. In addition, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> by overseeded ryegrass decreased significantly when 6000 mg/L irrigation water was applied. Puccinellia was much more sensitive to salinity than ryegrass and overall quality, turf density, and percent cover by puccinellia were greatly reduced by addition of salt. However, in the absence of added salt, puccinellia quality, percent cover, density, and color were generally greater than that of ryegrass.

The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to suggest post-fire management regimes and to assess their iniluence on the recovery of the forest. Three treatments were applied to the old burned trees: (1) burned trees were left untreated; (2) burned trees were cut down, the trunks were removed but smaller twigs were left in the plots; (3) burned trees were cut down, the trunks and the smaller twigs were cleared. Four treatments were applied to the new seedlings in the cleared plots: (1) no seedlings were thinned out; (2) Pinus seedlings were thinned out; (3) Cistus seedlings were thinned out; (4) both Pinus and Cistus seedlings were thinned out.

Data were collected in 0. 2 -m 2 plots randomly distributed throughout each of four replicate pastures in spring and summer 2000 and 2001. Backslope landscape positions within pastures managed with either continuous or rotational stocking contained the greatest overall diversity of species. Across years, overall species richness under grazing averaged 4. 8 on backslopes, 3. 5 on summits, and 2. 9 on toeslopes. Legume cover was greatest within the rotational stocking system, averaging 21 % on back- slopes, 10 % on summits, and 3 % on toeslopes across years. Cool- season grasses dominated summits and toeslopes, consisting of 88 to 94 % of the cover. Weed species diversity and cover were greatest on backslopes within the continuous stocking system. Our results showed that rotational stocking had more desirable effects through greater legume cover and less weed cover on backslopes than continuous stocking.

Measurement of plant canopy reflectance with a ground-based radiometer offers an indirect, rapid, and noninvasive characterization of pasture productivity and composition. The objectives {{of this study were}} (i) to determine the relationships between easily collected canopy reflectance data and pasture biomass and species composition and (ii) to determine if the use of pasture reflectance data as a covariate improved mapping accuracy of biomass, percentage of grass cover, and percentage of legume cover across three sampling schemes in a central Iowa pasture. Reflectance values for wavebands most highly correlated with biomass, percentage of grass cover, and percentage of legume cover were used as covariates. Cokriging was compared with kriging as a method for estimating these parameters for unsampled sites. The use of canopy reflectance as a covariate improved prediction of grass and legume <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> in all three sampling schemes studied. The prediction of above-ground biomass was not as consistent given that improvement with cokriging was observed with only one of the sampling schemes because of the low amount of spatial continuity of biomass values.

Survey areas with a high percentage cover of tall vegetation were assumed to have experienced lower livestock grazing intensities than survey areas with a low percentage cover of tall vegetation. This relationship was verified for the tall grass Elytrigia atherica. The species richness, and abundance of birds was related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation on the survey areas. We found that total bird species richness was positively related to the percentage cover of tall vegetation.

The second alternative included metrics of first-return LiDAR intensity. The third alternative used area-level variables derived from STRS LiDAR metrics. The ALM model for Lorey’s height did not change with inclusion of intensity and yielded the best results in terms of both model fit (adjusted R² = 0. 93) and cross-validated relative root mean squared error (RRMSE = 8. 1 %). The ALM model for density (stems per hectare) had the poorest precision initially (RRMSE = 39. 3 %), but it improved dramatically (RRMSE = 27. 2 %) when intensity metrics were included. The resulting RRMSE values of the ALM models excluding intensity for basal area, quadratic mean diameter, cubic stem volume, and average crown width were 20. 7, 19. 9, 30. 7, and 17. 1 %, respectively.

Tubastraea is an ahermatypic scleractinian nonindigenous to Brazil, which probably arrived on a ship's hull or oil platform {{in the late}} 1980 's. The exotic coral was found along a great geographic range of the Canal Central of Ilha Grande, extending over a distance of 25 km. The abundance of Tubastraea was quantified by depth, using three different sampling methods: colony density, visual estimation and intercept points (100) for <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> Tubastraea showed ample tolerance to temperature and desiccation since it was found more abundantly in very shallow waters (0. 1 - 0. 5 m), {{despite the fact that}} hard substratum is available at greater depths at all the stations sampled. At most sites, 1 to 5 colonies per 0. 25 m² were found most frequently, but occasionally more than 50 colonies were found per 0. 25 m², indicating a somewhat gregarious spatial distribution for this coral. The coral Tubastraea was found to occupy slopes of every possible angle in the Canal Central of Ilha Grande, but more colonies were found occupying slopes of 80 to 100 °. Therefore, its insensitivity to angles of recruitment and its tolerance for different depths makes it an organism with great ecological tolerance, with a potential to colonize new areas and increase its current range in Brazil's coastal waters...|$|E

TAM is partially funded by FCT, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, Portugal, through the project UID/MAT/ 00006 / 2013. Ungulates are especially difficult to monitor, and population estimates are challenging to obtain; nevertheless, such information is fundamental for effective management. This is particularly important for expanding species such as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), whose populations dramatically increased in number and geographic distribution over the last decades. In an attempt to follow population trends and assess species ecology, important methodological advances were recently achieved by combining line or point sampling with geographic information systems (GIS). In this study, we combined density surface modelling (DSM) with line transect survey to predict roe deer density in northeastern Portugal. This was based on modelling pellet group counts as a function of environmental factors while taking into account the probability of detecting pellets and conversion factors to relate pellet density to animal density. We estimated a global density of 3. 01 animals/ 100 ha (95 % CI 0. 37 – 3. 51) with a 32. 82 % CV. Roe deer densities increased with increasing distance to roads as well as with higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> areas and decreased with increasing distance to human populations. This recently developed spatial method can be advantageous to predict density over space through the identification of key factors influencing species abundance. Furthermore, surface maps for subset areas will enable to visually depict abundance distribution of wild populations. This will enable the assessment of areas where ungulate impacts should be minimized, allowing an adaptive management through time. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-An {{experiment}} {{comparing the}} effectiveness of the all-uses and all-edges test data adequacy criteria was performed. The experiment was designed so as to overcome some of the deE-eieneies of previous software testing experiments. A large number of test sets was randomly generated for each of nine subject programs with subtle errors. For each test set, the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> executable edges and definition-use associations covered were measured and it was determined whether the test set exposed an error. Hypothesis testing was used to investigate whether all-uses adequate test sets are more likely to expose errors than are all-edges adequate test sets. All-uses was significantly more effective than all-edges for Eve of the subjects, and appeared guaranteed to detect the error in four of them. Further analysis showed that in four of these subjects, all-uses adequate test sets were more effective than all-edges adequate test sets of similar size. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate whether the probabil-ity that a test set exposes an error increases as the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> defhdtion-use associations or edges covered by it increases. The evidence did not strongly support this cot@cture. Error exposing ability was shown to be strongly positively correlated to <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> deEnit. ion-use associations in only four of the nine subjects. Error exposing ability was also shown to be positively correlated to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> edges in four (different) subjects, but the relationship was weaker.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{activity}} is to help students better understand percent cloud cover and to take more accurate cloud cover observations. Working in pairs or small groups, students use construction paper to simulate cloud cover. They estimate the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> cloud <b>cover</b> represented by torn pieces of paper on a contrasting background and assign a cloud cover classification to the simulations created by their classmates. Intended outcomes are that students will understand the difficulties of visually estimating the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> cloud <b>cover</b> and gain experience estimating cloud cover, evaluating the accuracy of estimates, and using fractions and percentages.

30|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{vulnerability}} of network systems, which are associated with certain spatial areas. A hazard may <b>cover</b> any part <b>of</b> the area associated with a network system. For example, {{in the case of}} the Chinese domestic civil aviation network, the territory of China is the spatial area of the system, and a rainstorm may only cover a few provinces in China. We divide the size <b>of</b> the hazard <b>covered</b> area by the size of the entire network system area, and obtain the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> area <b>covered</b> by the hazards. Hereafter, we define the impact curve by measuring the spreading impact of hazards on the network system against the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> area <b>covered</b> by hazards.|$|R
