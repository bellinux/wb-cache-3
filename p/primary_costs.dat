It is also aimed at reducing one of the <b>primary</b> <b>costs</b> of messaging, namely having to constantly move messages around in memory. Even moving them from the communication manager to the message queue subsystem to the processing program is eliminated. Instead each message is placed in a small bank of its own. Instructions allow placing the bank descriptors of these banks in a queue and removing them from a queue. When a message is placed in a queue, the sending program or subsystem no longer has any access to it. That bank is removed from its address space. When a message is retrieved from a queue, the bank {{becomes part of the}} receiver's address space. The queuing instructions also provide activity synchronization functions (e.g., wait for a message).|$|E

We propose an unorthodox approach for tackling vulnerabilities in shared DNS resolvers: removing shared DNS resolvers entirely and leaving recursive resolution to the clients.

In practice, real-world decision support applications require to access data from disparate sources. Existing techniques define the skyline operation to work on a single set, and therefore, treat skylines as an “add-on 2 ̆ 2 on top of a traditional Select-Project-Join query plan. In many real world applications, the skyline dimensions can be anticorrelated (e. g., attribute pairs price, mileage for cars or price, distance for hotels). Anti-correlated data are skyline-unfriendly and thus ignored by existing techniques. In this work, we propose a robust execution framework called SKIN to evaluate skyline over joins. The salient features of SKIN are: (a) effective in reducing the two <b>primary</b> <b>costs,</b> namely the cost of generating the join results and the cost of dominance comparisons to compute the final skyline of join results, (b) shown to be robust for both skyline-friendly (independent and correlated) as well as skyline-unfriendly (anticorrelated) data distributions. SKIN is effective in exploiting the skyline knowledge in both local (individual data source), as well as across disparate sources – to significantly reduce the above mentioned two <b>primary</b> <b>costs</b> incurred during the evaluation of skyline over join.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} {{the results of}} our theoretical investigation into {{the costs and benefits of}} extending the conservative simulation window established in a non-aggressive windowing algorithm. There are two <b>primary</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by the non-aggressive algorithm: the cost of global synchronization and the cost of blocking due to pessimistic synchronization constraints. As the conservative simulation window is extended processors are required to synchronize less often and parallelism is increased. However, the increased aggressiveness increases the costs associated with state saving and rollbacks. This is the fundamental trade-off we capture analytically. 1 Introduction Most of the synchronization protocols developed for parallel discrete event simulation fall into two basic categories. Protocols that are non-aggressive (e. g.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} routing and rate assignment with p-cycle protection for mixed line rate (MLR) networks that are limited by transmission reaches. The problem is formulated mathematically as integer linear programming (ILP) problems under two different assumptions. First, we consider using each p-cycle to protect working lightpaths at common fixed line rate, and refers to this case as the fixed cycle rate (FCR) approach. We then perform comparative study between the FCR approach and the mixed cycle rate (MCR) approach, which is the second case and allows each p-cycle to protect working lightpaths with various rates. The objective of each ILP problem is to minimize the overall cost function, which consists of transponder operating cost, as <b>primary</b> <b>costs</b> and p-cycle operating costs, as secondary costs. Number {{results show that the}} MCR approach yields lower cost and is more efficient as the traffic increase when compared the FCR approach. In addition, we compare the use of MLR networks to the use of single line rate (SLR) networks to verify that MLR networks yield lower costs. ...|$|E

For the corresponding maximization problem, we construct two zone-based algorithms, one with and one without the above liveness constraint.

It then outlines how fisheries are currently governed and why governance is failing, before reviewing the consequences of governance failure for human security. Although the paper does not calculate the monetary costs of these human security risks, and therefore the benefits to be derived from improving fishery governance, it does point to examples of clear costs to specified groups of people that result from poor governance.

40|$|Com a redução da participação estatal na economia, busca-se cada vez mais colher evidências acerca dos efeitos da privatização no desempenho das companhias. O presente artigo objetiva testar a hipótese de melhoria da eficiência produtiva da Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), privatizada em 1997, a partir da identificação empírica dos seus custos de produção. A separação dos custos em seus componentes fixos e variáveis foi realizada por meio de regressão linear simples entre as variáveis custo dos produtos vendidos e receita operacional líquida, extraídas das demonstrações contábeis publicadas entre os anos de 1990 e 2004. Para a consecução dos objetivos, foi considerada uma alteração ao conceito originário de custos primários, estes passando a representar exclusivamente os materiais diretos em virtude das peculiaridades jurídicas que afetam a mão-de-obra direta no Brasil. A relação entre as variáveis identificadas foi testada por intermédio do coeficiente de correlação (r), do coeficiente de determinação (r 2) e da estatística t. Teste paramétrico de igualdade de médias dos custos primários foi, então, aplicado sobre séries de tempo anteriores e {{posterior}}es à privatização, visando alcançar o objetivo do estudo.

Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} test the hypothesis of improvement in the productive efficiency of the company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, privatized in 1997, starting with empirical identification of the company’s production costs. Separation of costs into their fixed components and variables component was accomplished through simple linear regression between the variables cost of goods sold and operating profit, taken from the accounting statements published between the years 1990 to 2004.

40|$|Guido Calabresi {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} dominating paradigm of fault with simpler strict liability rules that put liability on the most appropriate actors (the cheapest cost avoiders). Assuming that the objective function of the tort system is the mimimization of {{the sum of the}} injury and injury avoidance costs associated with accidents (<b>primary</b> <b>costs),</b> risk-spreading costs (secondary costs), and administrative costs (tertiary costs), he suggested that the adoption of strict liability, targeted to specified activities, would achieve the goal of cost minimization. The core of an extremely richer message was that the cheapest cost avoider test would abate the administrative costs of courts. Moreover, the manufacturers' ability to spread the costs of strict liability through the prices charged for their products would effectively insure product users against the risks of injury. This masterpiece of normative analysis has deployed an ever increasing influence on thinking about tort law, not only in the US but also in Europe.
