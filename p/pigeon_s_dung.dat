This test method was evaluated with the dung beetle Aphodius constans by using fecal residues of ivermectin after a pour-on administration. Dung of different age (and thus containing different concentrations of ivermectin) as well as mixtures of highly-contaminated spiked dung with untreated control dung were studied in five test runs in two laboratories. The concentration of ivermectin (active substance; a. <b>s.)</b> in the <b>dung</b> samples was verified analytically. The main test endpoint was the survival of first instar larvae. The LC_ 50 using dung directly obtained from treated cattle ranged from 470 to 692  μ g a. <b>s.</b>  kg^- 1 <b>dung</b> (dry weight; d. w.) and 67 to 97  μ g a. <b>s.</b>  kg^- 1 <b>dung</b> (fresh weight; f. w.).

(1) R-Type I: Only 2 -butanone was effective for all cells of this type. The impulse frequency increased with increase of stimulus concentration. The slope of the dose-resoonse curve was relatively steep. Threshold concentration of the individual olfactory cells varied in the value. Impulse discharges of some of the cells to 2 -butanone disappeared of decreased by stimulus of the mixture with other four odors. (2 s) R-Type II: All cells in this type responded to 2 -butanone but the responses to the other four odors were different with cells. The dose-response curve to 2 -butanone of this type of cells resembled with that of R-Type I.

It attempts to enlighten on forage preferences of the megaherbivore and investigate the effects of fire on abundance of their preferred vegetation species. Plant species were sampled in 64 rhino foraging plots, 300 random plots, and 198 plots with known occurrence of fire history to estimate abundances and extent of plant species browsed and the preferred species response to fire history. Additionally, a total of 15 fresh black rhinoceroses dungs were collected for DNA metabarcoding analysis to ascertain relative plant species composition of the animals diet. Across all 64 rhino foraging plots, rhinoceroses preferred 9 plant species: 5 forbs (Crotalaria barkae, Justicia betonica, Indigofera basiflora, Achyranthes aspera, Indogofera volkensii), 3 shrubs (Ziziphus abyssinica, Hibiscus species, Abutilon species), and 1 tree (Acacia sieberiana). A total of 72 taxa were identified in the rhinoceros <b>s</b> <b>dung</b> by DNA analysis, and the most important genera found are Crotalaria, Indigofera, Solanum, Euphorbia and Vachellia.

40|$|Computational {{models of}} argumentation are an active {{research}} discipline within Artificial Intelligence {{that has grown}} {{since the beginning of}} the 1990 <b>s</b> (<b>Dung</b> 1995). While still a young field when compared to areas such as SAT solving and Logic Programming, the argumentation community is very active, with a conference series (COMMA, which began in 2006) and a variety of workshops and special issues of journals. Argumentation has also worked its way into a variety of applications. For example, Williams et al. (2015) described how argumentation techniques are used for recommending cancer treatments, while Toniolo et al. (2015) detail how argumentation-based techniques can support critical thinking and collaborative scientific inquiry or intelligence analysis. Many of the problems that argumentation deals with are computationally difficult, and applications utilising argumentation therefore require efficient solvers. To encourage this line of research, we organised the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA), with the intention of assessing and promoting state of the art solvers for abstract argumentation problems, and to identify families of challenging benchmarks for such solvers. The objective of ICCMA’ 15 is to allow researchers to compare the performance of different solvers systematically on common benchmarks and rules. Moreover, as witnessed by competitions in other AI disciplines such as planning and SAT solving, we see ICCMA as a new pillar of the community which provides information and insights on the current state of the art, and highlights future challenges and developments. This article summarises the first ICCMA held in 2015 (ICCMA’ 15). In this competition, solvers were invited to address standard decision and enumeration problems of abstract argumentation frameworks (Dunne and Wooldridge 2009). Solvers’ performance is evaluated based on their time taken to provide a correct solution for a problem; incorrect results were discarded.

In this context, ultrafast laser excitation triggers nanoscale self-arrangement of matter on irradiated surfaces, known as Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS). The understanding formation dynamics of regular self-organized nanoscale structures under laser exposure of materials still required rigorous concepts related to modulated energy deposition, laser-induced non-equilibrium phenomena and the related relaxation paths involving mass transport. A comprehension effort related to laser excitation mechanisms will be presented, able to assist and validate experiments. We will indicate some fundamental aspects deriving from the initial stage of plasmonic coupling, the electron-phonon nonequilibrium process, the subsequent sequence of phase transformation and finally the surface dynamics via surface tension gradients. In a first experiment, grating-coupled Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) on metallic surface has been exploited to investigate the correlation between ripples formation under ultrashort laser exposure and SPP generation conditions. The main result was an experimental demonstration of the resonant coupling of the fs-laser pulse to the grating structure, based on SPP excitation, {{and its impact on}} the early stage of LIPSS formation [1]. In a second set of experiments, LIPSS amplitude has been measured on various materials with different electronic configuration in order to investigate the influence of the electron-phonon coupling strength and thermal diffusion efficiency on the specific contrast of LIPSS [2]. Finally, we will show that in the particular case of strongly absorbing materials which can undergo capillary action as metals, hydrodynamic modeling approaches should be involved to explain the observed patterns. Discussion will be made on how feedback mechanisms can cause the growth of grating periodicities by coupling to the diffractive laser light, involving plasmonic/hydrodynamic effects. [1] F.

The condensation properties of warm Xenon, Krypton, and Argon upon a cryogenically-chilled QCM were characterized at a range of temperatures and pressures. Heats of adsorption were predicted with a model to solve for intermolecular forces, and experimental data was used to assess the model's validity.

40|$|International audienceApplication {{potential}} for ultrashort laser pulses relies on their remarkable capacity to confine and localize energy on the smallest scales. In particular conditions, ultrafast laser excitation triggers nanoscale self-arrangement of matter on irradiated surfaces, known as Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structure (LIPSS). A comprehension effort related to laser excitation mechanisms will be presented, able to assist and validate experiments. In this context, we investigate hypotheses assuming that low spatial frequency LIPSS, having a spatial period {{close to the}} irradiation wavelength, are formed due to Surface Plasmon (SP) excitation. If the most part of experiments are performed on a practically smooth surface, we will present irradiation results obtained on pre-structured surfaces. Grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance on metallic surface has been exploited to investigate the correlation between ripples formation under ultrashort laser exposure and SP generation conditions. For TM irradiation conditions we will show that a well-defined period of grating is a seed for low spatial frequency LIPSS formation [1]. To design matter transformation patterns with predictable properties {{for a wide range}} of materials, the contrast of the nanostructuring process is another key parameter. Following localized photoexcitation, the sub-surface region undergoes transient melting and ultra-rapid quenching at the nanoscale. A thorough understanding of the involved physical mechanisms during the matter transformation will therefore help to control LIPSS morphology. By taking advantage of different metals behavior under nonequilibrium conditions, we propose experiments dedicated to evaluate the effects of energy coupling and relaxation strength on LIPSS formation [2]. We generated LIPSS on various materials with different electronic configuration in order to investigate the influence of the electron-phonon coupling strength and thermal diffusion efficiency on the specific contrast of LIPSS. For metals, the initial energy redistribution and the dimensional size of the region undergoing transient melting and resolidification appears to be correlated to the ripples height. The involved mutual influence of phase transformation and capillarity phenomenon can be effectively understood by applying theoretical methods accounting for the particular effects. Hydrodynamic simulations of laser-matter interaction will be presented to estimate laser energy deposition, electron-ion nonequilibrium stage, material heating and growth [3]. Time history of LIPSS formation will be discussed in this context of matter transformation phases using a capillarity approach. [1] F. Garrelie, J. P.

In the urban area 13. 5 % of the dung beetles dissected were infected, while the prevalence of <b>S.</b> lupi in <b>dung</b> beetles in the rural area was 2. 3 %. All the dung beetles that were infected with this nematode showed a preference for omnivore (pig and dog) dung. </span...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} by legumes has {{a particular}} requirement for adequate soil sulphur status. Sulphur (S) is a mobile nutrient and is easily leached from aquic soil environments, therefore regular topdressing with S fertilizer is required to maintain legume vigor and pasture production in most New Zealand pasture soils. Escalating fertilizer costs have focused attention on the efficiency of use of S fertilizers, particularly superphosphate (SSP) and alternative elemental S (S 0) based fertilizers less liable to leaching loss in this aquic environment. Field and glasshouse trials, using the resident clover/ryegrass sward on undisturbed soil cores (150 mm diameter, 100 mm depth), were undertaken to determine the comparative short-term fate of SSP and different particle sizes of S 0. Methods for manufacturing radioactively labelled (35 s) fertilizers were developed. In addition, the effect of sheep dung on the short-term immobilization of soil and fertilizer S was also investigated. A simple computer simulation model explaining the observed transformation of soil sulphur and 35 s labelled fertilizer was developed. Initially, the effect of sheep dung on the short-term immobilization of soil and fertilizer S was investigated. Very small amounts (about 2 - 5 %) of plant (clover/ryegrass pasture) S and P, within 1 00 mm of the area surrounding the dung pellet, were derived from the dung. Under the experimental conditions that prevailed, <b>dung</b> <b>S</b> behaved as a slow release S form causing neither greater immobilization of soil or fertilizer S nor mineralization of soil organic S. It was concluded {{that the impact of}} dung return on short-term ( 0. 1 50 m m) which had not oxidized, the major fate of fertilizer 35 s, either under glasshouse or field conditions, was again in soil organic matter mostly formed in the top 33 mm of the soil. Applications of gypsum and SSP caused 35 s to move to the 33 - 1 00 mm soil depths but there was no additional influence of P on the depth to which so 4 = was leached. A preliminary computer simulation model describing the fate of 35 so 4 =-s fertilizer was developed. The model provided a very accurate method of predicting plant uptake of S from both SSP fertilized and u nfertilized soil cores. The model also indicated that, at any particular soil depth, on average, actual rates of mineralizatio n a nd i m mobilization may exceed root uptake of S by 1. 5 to 2 fold (mg S turned over per unit of S taken up by plants). The accuracy of the estimated turnover rate could not be validated because the model gave relatively inaccurate predictions of the measured movement and transformations of 35 s tracer added to the soil as SSP. There was, however, relative similarity between the observed and predicted proportional distribution of 35 s between soil and plant S forms. Such a distribution supported the concept of using root activity as a modifier of mineralization and immobilization rates in order to describe the extent of these processes at different soil depths. The study has emphasized the greater importance of the surface few millimeters of pasture soil in S transformations, important in the fate of fertilizer and pasture plant nutrition. There appears to be scope in manipulating S 0 particle size to improve the efficiency of the S fertilizer used...|$|R
