40|$|A {{number of}} {{problems}} pertaining to the flowfield in a plug nozzle, designed as a supersonic thruster nozzle, with provision for cooling the plug with a coolant stream admitted parallel to the <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> surface, were studied. First, an analysis was performed of the inviscid, nonturbulent, gas dynamic interaction between the primary hot stream and the secondary coolant stream. A numerical prediction code for establishing the resulting flowfield with a dividing surface between the two streams, for various combinations of stagnation and static properties of the two streams, was utilized for illustrating the nature of interactions. Secondly, skin friction coefficient, heat transfer coefficient and heat flux to the <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> were analyzed under smooth flow conditions (without shocks or separation) for various coolant flow conditions. A numerical code was suitably modified and utilized for the determination of heat transfer parameters {{in a number of}} cases for which data are available. Thirdly, an analysis was initiated for modeling turbulence processes in transonic shock-boundary layer interaction without the appearance of flow separation...|$|E
40|$|A three {{dimensional}} linear {{plug nozzle}} of area ratio 12. 79 {{was designed by}} Astrium. The nozzle was tested within the German National Technology Program LION in a cold air wind tunnel by TU Dresden. The experimental hardware and test conditions are described. Experimental data was obtained for the nozzle without plug side wall fences and then with plug side wall fences. Experimental data for two nozzle pressure ratios (NPR), 116 and 45, are presented for the without fence and with fence configurations. Schlieren images of both NPR were recorded. Axial profiles of <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> static pressures were measured at several spanwise locations and on the plug base. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed for these nozzle configurations by NASA MSFC. The CFD exhibits good agreement with the experimental data. A detailed comparison of the CFD results and the experimental <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> pressure data is given for four test conditions; at both NPRs, without and with plug side wall fences. Numerical schlieren images are compared to experimental schlieren images. Nozzle thrust efficiencies are calculated from the CFD results. The CFD results are used to illustrate the plug nozzle fluid dynamics for all four test conditions. The effect of the plug side wall fences at both NPRs is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Computational and {{experimental}} tools {{have been used}} to understand the linear cluster plug nozzle flowfield for a range of pressure ratios. The experimental cluster configuration is arrived at from a linear plug nozzle by introducing splitter plates in the primary nozzle, and computational analysis of corresponding geometry is also carried out. The flow development on the plug surface has been analyzed for two different cluster module spacings. The interactions between the cluster module jets is a complex one with a three-dimensional shock structure because of the differential end condition the shock experiences on the <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> and freejet boundary. A prominent streamwise vorticity resulting from curvature of the shock is also seen {{along the length of the}} plug downstream of the module junctions. The out-of-phase wave interactions occurring along the module centerline and the splitter plate centerline, resulting in a wavy surface-limiting streamline pattern, particularly at lower pressure ratios, is explained...|$|E

40|$|The {{computations}} of a non-reacting nozzle-flow {{problem and}} a reacting impinging jet problem using a unified numerical methodology is presented. The nozzle {{problem is a}} shrouded plug configuration that operates at nozzle pressure ratio (NPR, ratio of inlet pressure to ambient pressure) between one to a design NPR of 6. 23 for supersonic applications. An sub-scale model with extensive instrumentation {{is the basis of}} axisymmetric and three-dimensional computations done as both steady and unsteady problems with an aim to understand nozzle flow physics. The pressure distribution and shock structure predicted by steady computations not only detailed the shock physics but were also in close agreement with measured pressure data and visualization. The nozzle is observed to transition from normal shock at NPR 2 ̆ 7 s just above one to a lambda shock below NPR of 2. 0 and then from a Mach reflection to a regular reflection within NPR range 2. 25 to 3. 1. A barrel oblique shock is observed above NPR of 3. 1 before achieving perfect expansion at design NPR. During the shock transition the separation region behind the shock is observed to be fully attached for NPR 2 ̆ 7 s below 2. 0, a regime called free shock separation (FSS), followed by reattached flow on <b>plug</b> <b>wall</b> called restricted shock separation (RSS) at higher NPR 2 ̆ 7 s. The unsteady computational analysis explained the shifts in frequencies observed in measurements. The unsteady computations at NPR of 1. 26 show that the measured frequency of 170 Hz is because of periodic choking and unchoking driven by large scale shock motion. In the FSS regime identified by computations the measured frequency remains constant at 200 Hz. Following this the frequency shifts to above 300 Hz and increases monotonically as the nozzle transitions from FSS to RSS observed to occur between NPR of 2. 0 and approximately 2. 25. Unsteady 3 -D computations showed axisymmetric instantaneous flowfield at NPR of 1. 26 while at NPR of 1. 59 the dynamic flowfield was observed to be asymmetric. Time-averaged pressure distribution and oscillation frequency from three-dimensional unsteady computations were closer to the measurements than with axisymmetric assumption. ^ An experimental impinging jet configuration involving MMH as fuel stream and RFNA as oxidizer stream, impinging at an included angle is studied to analyze combustion initiation, flame propagation, holding and sustenance. A newly devised reduced chemical mechanism is evaluated in this context for two background gases of argon and helium which showed different combustion behavior in recent experiments. Also, combustion is studied at two pressures corresponding to experiments (1 atm) and applications (100 atm). Before the impinging jet configuration is studied, a simple homogeneous mixture constant volume combustion problem is formulated to understand chemical time scales. The chemical mechanism resulted in combustion in a millisecond time frame only for an initial mixture temperature of 800 K with initial pressure of 100 atm showing faster combustion than 1 atm. The impinging configuration is studied first with a planar assumption before three-dimensional analysis is taken up to understand effect of background gas. In agreement with experiments, the helium and argon gases showed considerable differences. At low pressure of 1 atm the combustion initiation, propagation and holding were analogous to experiments in both gases but the ignition event timings and flame sustenance were different in the two gases. Argon resulted in wider flame zone compared to helium. At high pressures the flame propagation behavior differed from low pressures with instantaneous combustion initiation but different flame behaviors in both gases. The flame propagation, holding and sustenance behavior has been explained in detail in the two back ground gases at both pressure extremes. The three-dimensional computations showed that the combustion behavior is different with predictions using planar assumption. The differences have been documented. ...|$|E

40|$|The DC House {{project at}} Cal Poly State University faces a {{challenge}} of supplying DC voltage to household appliances. Each appliance in the DC House constitutes a DC load {{that has a}} unique voltage and power rating, hence {{the need to develop}} a smart DC <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> that will automatically adjust to the operating voltage required by any DC load. This thesis entails a proof of concept design of the smart DC <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> which can automatically detect an appliance’s voltage rating. The design employs a dc-dc converter in conjunction with a microcontroller to sense load current to properly adjust the required load voltage. Hardware implementation to demonstrate the functionality of the smart <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> was developed.

50|$|One of {{the first}} of these {{mixtures}} was produced by Rawlplug and was composed of dry white asbestos fibres, sold loose in a tin.

However, another way to fix <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> is accomplished by the application of a cotton woven pad which has been impregnated with a special formulated gypsum to bond into the wall. The pad is wetted and wrapped around the <b>wall</b> <b>plug,</b> and the two are inserted into the hole; after a short time it hardens and a strong bond is achieved and the wall fitting can be applied.
