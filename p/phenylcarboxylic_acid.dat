40|$|A marked {{increase}} in abnormal Krebs cycle metabolites {{was found in}} the urine of two brothers with autistic features. These metabolites include citramalic, tartaric (3 -OH-malic),and 3 -oxoglutaric acids, and compounds tentatively identified as a citric acid analog and partially identified as a <b>phenylcarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> by the fragmentation pattern of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the compounds and mass shifts of the same compounds derivatized with perdeuterated N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide. The molecular weight of the TMS derivative of the tentatively identified citric acid analog is 596 Da based on finding a significant M- 15 ion at m/z 581. The concentration of the citric acid analog was excreted in quantities as high as 137 mmol/mol creatinine based on the response factor of citric acid as a surrogate calibration standard. A carbohydrate with a retention time and mass spectrum identical to arabinose was also found in high concentrations in the urine of these brothers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectron {{transfers}} in modified polyaryl multilayers containing redox active molecules (ferrocenyl moieties) {{have been}} investigated by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in feedback mode. The modified surfaces were prepared by the electro-reduction of aryl diazonium salts that provides anchoring layers for the immobilization of the electroactive groups. Two types of anchoring films were prepared, the first with aminophenyl and the second with <b>phenylcarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> groups, allowing us to vary the oxidation level of the electroactive film. Determination of the apparent electron transfer rates between the modified surface {{and a series of}} redox mediators displaying increasing standard potentials permits the analysis of different processes involved in the charge transfer, namely, the permeation of the organic molecules (the mediator) and the conduction mechanism. In addition to the first oxidation of the immobilized molecules by the mediator at the solution−film interface, the global oxidation kinetics involves the conduction by charge transfer between grafted ferrocenes and the reverse charge transfer reaction from the film to mediator. This last step that is required to maintain the charge balance could become a kinetic limit for the highest driving force. For the most oxidizing mediator, analyses also suggest that the aromatic layer participates in the charge transfer...|$|E

40|$|Haloesterification {{of diverse}} diols with various {{carboxylic}} acids was achieved using potassium halides (KX) {{as the only}} halide source in ionic liquids. The best yield was obtained in [BMIM][PF 6] when 1, 2 -octanediol, palmitic acid and KBr were used.

40|$|Purpose is to {{understand}} how the mobilization, dielectric, orientation, composition, coverage, and structure of self-assembled organic monolayers on metal surfaces affects the surface reactivities and properties of these films in order to facilitate the construction of desired films. Two model systems were used: tiols at Au and aromatic acids at Pt. Surface analysis methods, including contact angle, electrochemistry, ellipsometry, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), and x-ray photospectroscopy, were used to study the self-assembled organic monolayers on Au and Pt. IRRAS, contact angle, and electrochemistry were used to determine the surface pK{sub a} of <b>phenylcarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> and pyridylcarboxylic acids monolayers on Pt. These techniques were also used to determine the orientation of polymethylene chain axis and the carboxylic follow the structural evolution of the chains and end group of the thiolate monolayers during formation. IRRAS was also used to assess the carboxylic acid group in terms of its possible existence as the non-hydrogen-bonded species, the hydrogen-bonded dimeric group, and the hydrogen-bonded polymeric group.

40|$|The paper postulates {{whether the}} {{phenomenon}} of integration of metabolism in man and his microbiome exists. The author&# 8217;s previously hypothesized fact that small molecules from microbes are involved in human homeostasis [1, 2] has found confirmation in subsequent experimental and clinical studies. The interactions of bacterial metabolites with the human body, which are natural and harmonious in health, are shown to become distorted in different diseases, which may be present in critical conditions at the most and the worsening disintegration results in multiple organ dysfunction and a fatal outcome. Thus, the performed investigations have established {{that there is a}} relationship between the severity and outcome of disease and the metabolic profile of low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds from microbes in the patient&# 8217;s blood and that there are key molecules that are involved in the integrative interaction with human cells among the exometabolites of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (the main representatives of the human microbiota); the mechanisms of this interaction at the cellular and subcellular levels have been studied. In the author&# 8217;s opinion, a study of integration mechanisms and the role of microbial aromatic metabolites (MAM) and a search for MAM-oriented therapeutic methods open up new avenues to improve the results of patient treatment in different fields of medicine and mainly in reanimatology.

40|$|A {{search for}} low {{molecular}} weight biomarkers to objectively evaluate the efficiency of extracorporeal detoxification methods is extremely relevant. For this purpose, the investigation is to verify whether metabolites, the production of which from aromatic amino acids {{in the human body}} can be of microbial ori gin, may be used.   Objective: to evaluate the efficiency of extracorporeal detoxification methods on the serum level of phenyl carboxylic acids in patients with sepsis associated renal failure.   Subjects and methods. Ten patients with acute or chronic (end stage) renal failure that had developed in the presence of severe sepsis, infective and toxic shock, long term extracorporeal circulation, postresuscitation disease, etc. were prospectively examined and treated. All the patients underwent extracorporeal detoxification; the choice of its technique was determined from their past medical history and intoxication patterns. The investigators eval uated organ dysfunctions using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale, estimated body tempera ture, leukocyte count, and leukocyte index of intoxication, and assessed the results of a procalcitonin test. Hemodiafiltration was done as extrarenally indicated to ameliorate a systemic inflammatory response in septic shock, by applying an EMiC 2 superhigh permeability dialyzer. Low flux Diacap LO PS dialyzers were employed for hemodialysis. Blood samples were taken to estimate changes in the serum concentrations of <b>phenylcarboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> benzoic acid, 3 phenylpropionic acid, phenyllactic acid, para hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p HPAA), and para hydroxyphenyllactic acid (p HPLA) directly before and immediately after extracorporeal detoxification.   Results. The severity of organ dysfunctions by SOFA score was 10 — 22 (mean 16 scores); 10 day mortality rates were 40 %. In all the patients, the baseline serum levels of some phenylcarboxylic acids were considerably above normal. After hemodiafiltration, the serum concentrations of p HPAA and p HPLA decreased (by an aver age of 1. 7 and 1. 85 fold, respectively).   Conclusion. In sepsis associated renal failure, the clearance rate of microbial aromatic acid metabolites (p HPAA and p HPLA) is promising potential biomarker to evaluate the efficiency of extracorporeal detoxification methods.   </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of accurate and applicable methods {{to assess the}} severity of patient condition is an urgent need in critical care medicine. The goal {{of the study was}} to determine whether the quantitave evaluation of <b>phenylcarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (PhCAs) concentrations in blood might be employed to assess the severity of patient condition and treatment efficiency intensive care unit. Materials and methods. Clinical and laboratory findings in patients (n= 58) with acute surgical diseases of abdominal organs were registered on the day of admission to intensive care unit and during follow-up control including lactate level and blood serum PhCA concentrations of phenyllactic (PhLA), p#hydroxyphenyllactic (p-HPhLA) and phydroxyphenylacetic (p#HPhAA) acids. Patients' condition was assessed using APACHE II and SOFA international scales. PhCA concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. The reference group included healthy blood donors (n= 25). Results. PhLA, p-HPhAA, p-HPhLA levels and total concentration of the three PhCAs were shown to be in direct correlation with APACHE II score (rs: 0. 624; 0. 757; 0. 763 and 0. 804, respectively; P< 0. 001). When testing PhCAs as a molecular prognostic criteria, areas under ROC#curves (AUC) were within the range of 0. 800 — 0. 900 (P< 0. 001). Therewith the molecular prognostic criteria were comparable with APACHE II multi# parameter scale by accuracy: AUCAPACHE II was 0. 897 (P< 0. 001). Lactate level dynamics as a prognostic criterion was inferior in accuracy to the dynamics of PhCA total concentration: AUCС lactate, % 0. 667 (P= 0. 071) vs AUCС 3 PhCAs, % 0. 862 (P< 0. 001). In patients with documented bacterial inflammatory complications PhCA level was 2. 5 times higher (P< 0, 001, n= 35) and p#HPhLA level was 1. 5 times higher than in patients without infectious complications (P= 0. 048, n= 23). Conclusion. The findings provide evidence for the inclusion of PhCAs (PhLA, p-HPhAA, p-HPhLA, 3 PhCAs) in clinical practice as biomarkers of the severity of condition in patients with surgical diseases of abdominal organs. The study showed that change in PhCA serum concentrations reflected the dynamics of patient condition and might be used for objective monitoring of the treatment...|$|R
