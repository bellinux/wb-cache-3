Seamless {{stainless}} microtube (SUS 304 L) {{was selected}} for a detailed investigation of the strain-hardening influencing grain refinement and microstructural evolution during processing by varying <b>press</b> <b>bending</b> angles. The problem was approached in three stages. First, the microtubes were annealed to examine the initial grain size and analyzed the effect of grain size on mechanical properties by performing a tensile test. Second, a microtube <b>press</b> <b>bending</b> system was developed to observe springback behavior. Third, the microstructure of the microtube with different <b>press</b> <b>bending</b> angle was observed to investigate the effect of strain-hardening induced grain refinement on springback behavior. As a result, the occurrence of grain refinement reduced the springback amount. The mechanism of microstructure development in the shear zone during the <b>press</b> <b>bending</b> process is needle like, twin band and equiaxed and small rounded grains sequentially...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} find out the optimal press bend forming path in {{fabricating}} aircraft integral panels, this article proposes a new method {{on the basis of the}} authors' previous work. It is composed of the finite element method (FEM) equivalent model, the surface curvature analysis, the artificial neural network response surface and the genetic algorithm. The method begins with analyzing the objective's shape curvature to determine the bending position. Then it optimizes the punch travel at each bending position by the following steps: (1) Establish a multi-step press bend forming FEM equivalent model, with which the FEM experiments designed with the Taguchi method are performed. (2) Construct a back-propagation (BP) neural network response surface with the data from the FEM experiments. (3) Use the genetic algorithm to optimize the neural network response surface as the objective function. Finally, this method is verified by <b>press</b> <b>bending</b> a complicated double-curvature grid-type stiffened panel and bears out its effectiveness and intrinsic worth in designing the press bend forming path...|$|E
40|$|The Lightweight Steel Frame {{technology}} (LSF) employs pro les made by thin {{steel and}} manufactured by cold forming. This technology {{dates back to}} the mid- 1800 s and today the exibility of the industrialized production enables innovations and bene ts in the use of it: buildings can be designed with a very high level of detail, using the precision of the industrial design or on-demand production. Each pro le in Cold Formed Steel (CFS) is designed and built for a speci c purpose and industrial nishing follows the work of the designer, without imposing constraints, such as modularity and mass production. The manufacturing of cold-formed steel rods is made by pro ling, or <b>press</b> <b>bending.</b> The use of CAD/CAM solutions for the design and the production promote the di usion of pro ling during LSF processing. The CFS rods can be produced of whatever length (even all of di erent lengths) from the same sheet metal strip and without interrupting or slowing down the processing. Furthermore, shapes and pro les can be many and di erent. The manufacturing is highly customizable, just so the changes in shapes and pro les are carried out in compliance with the UNI EN 1090 and meet the tolerances required by law. Design a building with the LSF system requires attention to seve- ral issues. The CFS is a real system and a ects the calculation of the structures so, a correct approach to the project is crucial. The collaboration between designer, structural engineer, engineering, manufacturer, and con- struction company can’t be underestimated. The quality of the project and of teamwork allow to realize low cost buildings in a short time and with high performance. These design principles also allow the development for an accurate sustainability analysis. Thanks to the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), all kinds of processing can be described in terms of energy and CO 2 emission costs. This analysis can be performed right from the ma- terials production and construction elements. The research focuses on the project and the buildings even during the phase of use, consider main- tenance and theorize the disas-sembly operations (or demolition) and recycling (or reuse) of the constituent parts of the buildings. Some early data collected, even about the end of life of buildings (case studies), show the advantages associated with dry machining in terms of savings in economic and environmental costs in comparison with buil- dings constructed with traditional technologies...|$|E

40|$|Sandwich {{panel has}} been widely applied to enhance the {{stiffness}} to weight performance of components in many industries. The manufacturing procedure of curved metal sandwich panels typically consists of forming the sheet and core material into prescribed shapes and applying the adhesive to bond the material in shaped molds. An alternative manufacturing method is to apply the conventional sheet metal forming technique to deform the flat sandwich panel into a curved panel. However, the face sheet will significantly limit the formability of the sandwich panel. To solve the problem, one face sheet was removed in the sandwich panel to increase the formability, then the metal sheet and the metallic open-cell foam were selected as the face sheet and the core material to form the metallic open-cell foam supported sheet metals. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop a proper forming method to deform the metallic open-cell foam supported sheet metal without failure occurring. Two forming processes, <b>press</b> brake <b>bending</b> and hydroforming, which can reduce the contact stress to avoid the structure damage were investigated. Experiments were designed to understand the possible failure modes and the failure mechanism. Through the parametric study in the experimental results, the effects of material dimensions, material properties, and test parameters were analyzed to establish a failure criterion. In addition, a finite element analysis with a proper foam model was implemented to further inspect the failure mechanism and develop a guideline for the selection of materials and test parameters. For the <b>press</b> brake <b>bending</b> process, the experiment results have shown that the supported sheet metal can be successfully bent into a curved panel within small thickness reduction. The prediction in both geometric hoop strain failure criterion and shear strain failure in the finite element analysis were matched and agreed with the experimental result. For the hydroforming process, the experimental result indicated that the major failure mode is the adhesive failure. The early adhesive failure at the perimeter of the attached foam disc caused the open-cell foam to separate from the sheet metal. The required adhesive strength to the attainable dome height relationship was given by finite element analysis...|$|R
