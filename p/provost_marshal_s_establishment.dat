50|$|A <b>provost</b> <b>marshal</b> is a title {{given to}} a person {{in charge of a}} group of {{military}} police (MP). The title originated with an older term for military police, provosts.

A <b>Provost</b> <b>marshal</b> may also oversee security services, imprisonment, fire/emergency services and ambulances.|$|R
