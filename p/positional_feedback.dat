5000|$|The {{mechanics}} {{behind a}} PCB milling machine are fairly straightforward {{and have their}} roots in CNC milling technology. A PCB milling system {{is similar to a}} miniature and highly accurate NC milling table. For machine control, positioning information and machine control commands are sent from the controlling software via a serial port or parallel port connection to the milling machine's on-board controller. The controller is then responsible for driving and monitoring the various positioning components which move the milling head and gantry and control the spindle speed. Spindle speeds can range from 30,000 RPM to 100,000 RPM depending on the milling system, with higher spindle speeds equating to better accuracy, in a nutshell the smaller the tool diameter the higher RPM you need. [...] Typically this drive system comprises non-monitored stepper motors for the X/Y axis, an on-off non-monitored solenoid, pneumatic piston or lead screw for the Z-axis, and a DC motor control circuit for spindle speed, none of which provide <b>positional</b> <b>feedback.</b> More advanced systems provide a monitored stepper motor Z-axis drive for greater control during milling and drilling as well as more advanced RF spindle motor control circuits that provide better control over a wider range of speeds.|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} stepping motors {{to date is}} in low power open loop positioning systems. It is widely known that self synchronisation offers a significant improvement in dynamic performance in addition to step integrity. The necessary <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> is traditionally provided by a position encoder. However the fitting of such a device is usually expensive and inconvenient. Previous analyses of stator current waveforms of motors driven from the conventional L/R drive have revealed rotor position dependant characteristics {{which can be used}} to provide self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback.</b> A variety of different schemes using both on and off phases have been proposed in the literature. Successful self synchronisation utilising some of these characteristics has been reported for multiple stack variable reluctance stepping motors. When the active suppression drive is used, the variable reluctance stepping motor offers high specific output and efficiency making it a contender in controlled speed drive applications as well. Lower manufacturing cost makes the single stack motor additionally attractive. A single stack stepping motor driven under self synchronised control from self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> and using active suppression drives is potentially an efficient cost effective drive offering precision speed and position control. The single stack motor has significant mutual inductances between phases. This coupling considerably complicates the task of obtaining self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback,</b> especially when active suppression drives are used. This research investigates the suitability of the single stack variable reluctance stepping motor to position encoderless self synchronisation when driven by an active suppression drive and chopper current limiting. An algorithm for obtaining the necessary self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> has been developed and the equipment necessary to implement it has been designed and constructed. Certain characteristics which restrict the performance of the algorithm have been observed during operation. These characteristics have been explained in terms of the significant mutual inductances between phases inherent in the single stack motor. A linear model of the on and de-energising phase currents has been developed and implemented numerically. The results have been used to generate theoretical torque vs speed plots. These plots show good agreement with the measured performance. A linear model of the self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> algorithm has been developed to further the analytical understanding of the advances made experimentally. The numerical solutions identify the cause of the performance restrictions and simulate the nature of the observed self <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> characteristics closely. A suggestion is made for continuing research which is believed likely to yield significant results...|$|E

We developed a digital isometric joystick (IJ) with sophisticated signal processing and two control functions. In a prior study, subjects' driving accuracy with our IJ was comparable to using an MSJ. However, we observed subjects using excessive {{force on the}} IJ possibly because its rigid post provides no <b>positional</b> <b>feedback.</b> Thus, this paper examines the time-series data recorded in the previous study to characterize subjects' force control strategies since weakness is a concern. Eleven EPW users with upper limb impairments drove an EPW using an IJ with two different control functions and an MSJ in a Fitts' law paradigm. Subjects relied upon <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> from the MSJ and used appropriate force. In contrast, subjects using the IJ with either control function applied significantly higher force than necessary (p < 0. 0001 and p= 0. 0058). Using higher average force was correlated with quicker trial times but not associated with accuracy. Lack of <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> may result in use of excess isometric force.

We simulated linear dynamic systems with different types of force fields–stable and unstable dynamics–and compared the performance of MMFC to that of OFC. MMFC delivered better performance than OFC in terms of stability and the achievement of tasks. Moreover, the gain in <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> with the MMFC model in the unstable dynamics was tuned to the direction of instability.

5000|$|This {{automatic}} technique mostly works. Evidence {{suggests that}} it tends to work better than global analysis. Through a query expansion, some relevant documents missed in the initial round can then be retrieved to improve the overall performance. Clearly, {{the effect of this}} method strongly relies on the quality of selected expansion terms. It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task [...] But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile. In addition, if the words added to the original query are unrelated to the query topic, the quality of the retrieval is likely to be degraded, especially in Web search, where web documents often cover multiple different topics. To improve the quality of expansion words in pseudo-relevance <b>feedback,</b> a <b>positional</b> relevance <b>feedback</b> for pseudo-relevance feedback has been proposed to select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of words in feedback documents.

The low-cost LST {{is characterized by the}} use of reaction wheels for the generation of control torques. Because of the critical requirement on the pointing accuracy of the LST, the nonlinear frictional characteristics of the bearings of the reaction wheels were studied which can cause limit cycles in a closed-loop system. Another possible source of pointing error in the LST is due to the effect of quantization and sensor noise. Since the LST is a digital system, digital to analog and analog to digital converters and sensors for <b>positional</b> and rate <b>feedbacks</b> were used. Sensor noise and amplitude quantization causes pointing error in the LST and, in addition, quantization is a nonlinear phenomenon which can cause self-sustained oscillations in the closed-loop system.

We report {{the expansion of}} intermittent contact (IC) -SECM to the nanoscale, using disk-type Pt nanoelectrodes prepared using the laser-puller sealing method. The Pt was exposed using a focused ion beam milling procedure to cut {{the end of the}} electrode to a well-defined glass sheath radius, which could also be used to reshape the tips {{to reduce the size of}} the glass sheath. This produced nanoelectrodes that were slightly recessed, which was optimal for IC-SECM on the nanoscale, as it served to protect the active part of the tip. A combination of finite element method simulations, steady-state voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy for the measurement of critical dimensions, was used to estimate Pt recession depth. With this knowledge, the tip-substrate alignment could be further estimated by tip approach curve measurements. IC-SECM has been implemented by using a piezo-bender actuator for the detection of damping of the oscillation amplitude of the tip, when IC occurs, which was used as a tip-position feedback mechanism. The piezo-bender actuator improves significantly on the performance of our previous setup for IC-SECM, as the force acting on the sample due to the tip is greatly reduced, allowing studies with more delicate tips.

Overall, published studies of these applications indicate that NMES can improve UL function after stroke, with improvements at the impairment level more common than improvements at the activity level. While EMG-NMES has been researched most widely and has the highest level of evidence to support its use, newer applications (e. g. outcome-triggered NMES, accelerometer-triggered NMES) appear promising, on the basis that key requirements for motor learning are employed.

First, a somewhat novel optical design for x rays, in which matched toroidal mirrors are positioned before and after the double-crystal monochromator, was adopted.

Golf robots perform a simplification of the complex sequence of motions that compose a golf swing; however, traditional devices are typically capable of performing only a single swing profile at variable speeds. Significant differences exist between individual golfers’ swing motions, especially for golfers of different ability, experience, and physical stature, which suggests a requirement for swing profile variability in mechanical simulators. This investigation has found that the swing motion of a traditional golf robot provides a poor representation of golfers’ swings and, as a result, a bespoke control system has been developed for a commercially available golf robot to enable performance of variable swing profiles with <b>positional</b> <b>feedback.</b> Robot swing command files are generated by fitting a curve to a number of discrete data points that are equally spaced in time, and which define angles representative of individual golfers’ swings.

The tool, which consists of a mass and two hand-held non-linear springs, is affected by a saddle-like force-field. The non-linearity of the springs allows the users to determine size and orientation of the tool stiffness ellipse, by using different patterns of bimanual coordination: minimal stiffness occurs when the two spring terminals are aligned and stiffness size grows by stretching them apart. Tool parameters were set such that minimal stiffness is insufficient to provide stable equilibrium whereas asymptotic stability can be achieved with sufficient stretching, although {{at the expense of}} greater effort. As a consequence, tool users have two possible strategies for stabilizing the mass in different regions of the workspace: 1) high stiffness feedforward strategy, aiming at asymptotic stability and 2) low stiffness <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> strategy aiming at bounded stability. The tool was simulated by a bimanual haptic robot with direct torque control of the motors.

Methodology/Findings: This experiment was designed such that subjects could achieve stability using either strategy, with a marked difference in terms of effort and control requirements between the two strategies. The task was to balance a virtual mass in an unstable environment via two elastic linkages that connected the mass to each hand. The dynamics of the mass {{under the influence of the}} unstable force field and the forces applied through the linkages were simulated using a bimanual, planar robot. The two linkages were non-linear, with a stiffness that increased with the amount of stretch. The mass could be stabilized by stretching the linkages to achieve a stiffness that was greater than the instability coefficient of the unstable field (high-stiffness), or by balancing the mass with sequences of small force impulses (low-stiffness). The results showed that 62 % of the subjects quickly adopted the high-stiffness strategy, with stiffness ellipses that were aligned along the direction of instability. The remaining subjects applied the low-stiffness strategy, with no clear preference for the orientation of the stiffness ellipse. Conclusions: The choice of a strategy was based on the bimanual coordination of the hands: high-stiffness subjects achieved stability quickly by separating the hands to stretch the linkages, while the low-stiffness subjects kept the hands close together and took longer to achieve stability but with lower effort. We suggest that the existence of multiple solutions leads to different types of skilled behavior in unstable environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of modern robotic manipulators has allowed research in recent years, {{for the development}} of fast automated non-destructive testing (NDT) of complex geometries. Contemporary robots are well suited for their accuracy and flexibility when adapting to new tasks. Several robotic inspection prototype systems and a number of commercial products have been created around the world. This paper describes the latest progress of a new phase of the research applied to a composite aerospace component of size 1 by 3 metres. A multi robot flexible inspection cell was used to take the fundamental research and the feasibility studies to higher technology readiness levels, all set for future industrial exploitation. The robot cell was equipped with high accuracy and high payload robots, mounted on 7 metre tracks, and an external rotary axis. A robotically delivered photogrammetry technique was first used to assess the position of the components placed within the robot working envelope and their deviation to CAD. Offline programming was used to generate a scan path for phased array ultrasonics testing (PAUT) which was implemented using high data rate acquisition from a conformable wheel probe. Real-time robot path-correction, based on force-torque control (FTC), was deployed to achieve the optimum ultrasonic coupling and repeatable data quality. New communication software was developed that enabled the simultaneous control of the multiple robots performing different tasks and the reception of accurate <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> positions. All aspects of the system were controlled through a purposely developed graphic user interface that enabled the flexible use of the unique set of hardware resources, the data acquisition, visualisation and analysis. This work was developed through the VIEWS project (Validation and Integration of Manufacturing Enablers for Future Wing Structures), part funded by the UK’s innovation agency (Innovate UK) ...|$|E
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings used on oil-free centrifugal refrigeration compressors {{have lower}} stiffness than conventional oil-lubricated journal or rolling element bearings. The lower stiffness of these bearings makes them sensitive to internal flow instabilities that are precursors of rotating stall or compressor surge. At operating conditions {{far away from}} surge the internal flow is very stable and the magnetic bearings keep the shaft centered, resulting in a minimal bearing orbit. The internal flow instabilities that arise when the compressor approaches the surge limit result in some radially fluctuating forces on the shaft. The active magnetic bearings correct for these fluctuating radial forces on the shaft. The bearing orbit increases {{with the size of}} these radial forces. Optimum compressor efficiency occurs close to surge at incipient stall conditions when maximum internal flow pressure recovery occurs. The <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> system of the active magnetic bearing control loop system indicates the bearing orbit which relates to compressor efficiency. At high flow conditions capacity is controlled by compressor speed for the imposed pressure ratio. At low flow conditions a combination of variable speed and a means of range extension (e. g. inlet guide vanes, variable geometry diffuser, or flow recirculation) are required to control capacity at the imposed pressure ratio and guarantee stable compressor operation. The bearing orbit signal can be used to determine which speed/geometry combination gives the highest compressor efficiency. If the bearing orbit is below a minimum value the compressor runs too close to choke and a reduction in speed combined with an opening of the diffuser throat area would increase compressor efficiency. If, on the other hand, the bearing orbit is above a maximum value the compressor runs too close to surge and an increase in speed combined with a closing of the diffuser throat area is required to increase compressor efficiency and guarantee surge-free compressor. Experience with this control scheme will be illustrated for a newly developed 350 ton two-stage centrifugal compressor where the variable geometry hardware is replaced with a controlled internal flow recirculation...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} use of sensors to either enable the use of robots, or increase the productivity of robots for gas metal arc welding. Conventional robotic arc welding without the use of sensors can suffer from a number of possible process errors which, if not compensated, produce defective welds. Much work has already been carried out in developing sensors which address these process errors, but none can satisfy the requirements of all possible weld joint configurations and sizes which are fabricated. The majority of the previous work in this area has concentrated on providing seam tracking systems for the welding of sheet materials, typically used in the heavy and automotive industry, although some work is suitable for tubes between 50 and 100 mm in diameter. This thesis presents the initial development stages of a novel fully automated computer vision based welding sensor for saddle type joints formed by small diameter intersecting tubing, less than 50 mm in diameter. The sensor uses the active projection of multiple planes of light to highlight the weld joint features. The underlying image processing techniques which have been developed are based upon the local area analysis of an image of the illuminated weld joint. The algorithms extract each stripes feature points, reduce the information to a smaller set of weld feature points, and then generate the robot program path points. Calibration information within the image is used as part of the latter transformation process. These software based techniques may be implemented into specialised computer hardware to reduce the sensor cycle time, giving the capability of high speed operation. An application specific multistripe sensor has been validated through the integration of the sensor within an existing industrial robot workcell welding bicycle forks. Experimental results have shown the multistripe sensor to be accurate to within +/- 0. 4 mm of the weld joint for 93 % of the feature points. The use of the multistripe sensor for: weld process capability trials, weld parameter investigation, and on-line <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> are presented. The results when used for on-line weld path determination have shown the multistripe sensor to be both effective and reliable when performing the joint analysis on a non- optimal low-cost host platform...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{existing}} state-of-the-art of turbine blade manufacture highlights two operations {{that have not been}} automated namely that of loading of a turbine blade into an encapsulation die, and that of removing a machined blade from the encapsulation block. The automation of blade decapsulation has not been pursued. In order to develop a system to automate the loading of an encapsulation die a prototype mechanical handling robot has been designed together with a computer controlled encapsulation die. The robot has been designed as a mechanical handling robot of cylindrical geometry, suitable for use in a circular work cell. It is the prototype for a production model to be called `The Cybermate'. The prototype robot is mechanically complete but due to unforeseen circumstances the robot control system is not available (the development of the control system did not form a part of this project), hence it has not been possible to fully test and assess the robot mechanical design. Robot loading of the encapsulation die has thus been simulated. The research work with regard to the encapsulation die has focused on the development of computer controlled, hydraulically actuated, location pins. Such pins compensate for the inherent positional inaccuracy of the loading robot and reproduce the dexterity of the human operator. Each pin comprises a miniature hydraulic cylinder, controlled by a standard bidirectional flow control valve. The precision positional control is obtained through pulsing of the valves under software control, with <b>positional</b> <b>feedback</b> from an 8 -bit transducer. A test-rig comprising one hydraulic location pin together with an opposing spring loaded pin has demonstrated that such a pin arrangement can be controlled with a repeatability of +/-. 00045 '. In addition this test-rig has demonstrated that such a pin arrangement can be used to gauge and compensate for the dimensional error of the component held between the pins, by offsetting the pin datum positions to allow for the component error. A gauging repeatability of +/- 0. 00015 ' was demonstrated. This work has led to the design and manufacture of an encapsulation die comprising ten such pins and the associated computer software. All aspects of the control software except blade gauging and positional data storage have been demonstrated. Work is now required to achieve the accuracy of control demonstrated by the single pin test-rig, with each of the ten pins in the encapsulation die. This would allow trials of the complete loading cycle to take place...|$|E
