All samples were negative for Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes; although a low count of coagulase-positive staphylococci (no. 5 samples) and E. coli (no. 3) was found. We proceeded with the identification of the isolates on every sample with high, moderate and low-count of Enterobacteriaceae, to better understand the microbial ecology. The Enterobacteriaceae species most frequently detected were Pantoea spp. (29. 62 %), Enterobacter cloacae (20. 37 %) and Serratia liquefaciens (12. 96 %); other different species of Enterobacteriaceae were detected with a < 10 % presence. Since there are no legal regulations indicating tolerance or limit values or this kind of microorganisms related to the samples, it would be appropriate, in the presence of high count of Enterobacteriaceae or by type of ready-to-eat and <b>precooked</b> <b>food,</b> to proceed with the identification of every microorganism...|$|E

40|$|To screen some {{cardiovascular}} {{risk factors}} in institutionalized elderly {{persons of the}} Spanish Northwest who consume the Atlantic variant of the Mediterranean diet, rich in vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, olive oil and dairy products, anthropometric and dietary measurements were carried out and serum glucose and lipoprotein values were determined in 94 subjects. Men consumed significantly more legumes, fruit, meat, alcohol and <b>precooked</b> <b>foods</b> but fewer vegetables than women. Significant positive correlations were found between total fat and MUFA consumption and HDL-cholesterol. Fish intake correlated negatively with total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol. The prevalence of high TC, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and TC/HDL-cholesterol levels was 29 %, 37 %, 21 %, 25 % respectively, and that of low HDL-cholesterol was 15 %. Women displayed a higher prevalence of dyslipemia, with significantly higher TC and higher LDL-cholesterol levels than men. Fifty {{percent of the women}} aged 75 - 80 presented concurrent hyperglycemia, excess weight and hypertriglyceridemia, predisposing them to the metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, as regards the lipoprotein profile, the Atlantic diet appears appropriate for most institutionalized elderly persons. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Daily intakes of some mineral {{nutrients}} {{were calculated}} from the data in the standard table of food composition in Japan (2000) on trial menus of our students. On the other hand, all of the cooked foods prepared for each trial menu by the students were well mixed and ground down into uniform sludge. The contents of some mineral elements were determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry by use of acid sample solutions dissolving ashes {{of each of the}} sludgy food samples. Students' menus were of four different styles; Japanese food which was westernized and fatty at present; convenience store food which was composed of daily box lunches, boiled rice-balls, prepared dishes and side dishes from a convenience store; <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> which was composed mainly of instant noodles or prepared food; and high zinc food which was cooked including a considerable number of high zinc foods except oysters, because they has a long off-season in Japan. Except for zinc and sodium (chloride), our analysis showed results which were a little lower results than the sum provided by the standard food composition table. The high zinc food provided much zinc, especially in the summed data. The <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> showed a low zinc level, however, the zinc intake displayed by the analysis of the convenience store food showed a level of the zinc intake second to the analytical result of high zinc food. Eventually, the analytical zinc intake of the convenience store food, 9. 1 mg/day, was within the recommended daily zinc intake of Japanese young women from 18 to 29 years old. On the other hand, the <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> showed a low level of zinc intake, 3. 1 and 3. 9 mg/day, in the summed intake from the food composition table and our analytical result, respectively. In the present study, renewing the standard table of food composition in Japan, we attempted to clarify the difference between {{the old and the new}} standard food composition tables by use of nearly the same menus. Although intakes of calcium, phosphorus and iron seemed to decrease, those of magnesium, zinc and manganese looked like to increase in the summed data from the new table. However, this difference between the new and old tables was indistinct and not consistent but partially unavoidable, because insufficient data of the old standard food table had inevitably induced us to use a local food composition table...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{treatability}} of {{two different}} wastes that represent the main refuse streams generated by a frozen food factory (fresh vegetable waste and <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> waste) was assessed. Moreover, the sludge coming from agro-industrial wastewater treatment was codigested with the previously mentioned wastes. Batch tests were performed at different solids content both on the single wastes and on appropriate mixtures of them (also in order to simulate the seasonality of factory production). Both fresh vegetable and <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> wastes strongly inhibited methanogenesis from unacclimated inoculum at 10 % solids content (undiluted waste) and 5 % solids content (eight- to nine-fold diluted waste), respectively. This was due to their high contents of potassium and lipids, respectively. The aerobic sludge from the wastewater treatment plant did not exert inhibitory effect up to 10 % solids content (undiluted waste). Codigestion of the fresh vegetable waste and sludge (60 and 40 % on wet basis) was more effective {{both in terms of}} rate and yield of methane production with respect to the single wastes (due to dilution and synergic effects). On the other hand, methanogenesis remained strongly inhibited from mixtures containing pre-cooked food waste (at 25 and 45 %, on wet basis). Methanogenesis inhibition could be overcome by a long acclimation period. The results showed that fill-and-draw digestion in a 0. 5 L lab-scale reactor of the fresh vegetable waste and sludge mixture after start up with acclimated inoculum allowed higher methane yields (37 % at high organic load and 57 % at low organic load). Better results were obtained in a 1. 7 L micropilot fill-and-draw reactor (yield of 67 %) fed at higher frequency...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} by different partners to identify variability in properties of Bacillus cereus strains {{that contribute to the}} extent of their virulence as part of an EU project. To this end, 100 B. cereus strains were selected and screened for biological properties, such as toxin production, heat resistance, germination and growth curves. This report gives a summary of the experimental data and subsequent analysis to identify the biodiversity within and between certain characteristic B. cereus groups. The 100 strain set was, therefore, divided into 4 categories, i. e. environmental, food, diarrhoeal and emetic strains. Results show that the biodiversity in B. cereus is large, both between and within groups. Yet, emetic strains often form a distinct group. They do not grow at temperatures below 7 degrees C and their spores are more heat resistant compared to the other groups. Emetic strains will, therefore, form a risk when heated products would be kept outside the fridge. Diarrhoeal strains do grow at 7 degrees C and, although their spores are more heat resistant, still they will survive pasteurization processes. They can grow when fridge temperatures reach 7 degrees C, especially in food products having a neutral pH. So, growth of diarrheal strains can be prevented when standard safety measures are being considered; still, this safety margin is small. Statistical analyses revealed that: 1) well regulated fridge temperatures (below 7 degrees C, to prevent growth of diarrhoeal strains during storage), 2) producing food products with a non-neutral pH value and 3) portioned chilling to rapidly lower the temperatures of <b>precooked</b> <b>food</b> (to prevent growth of emetic strains and, with that, emetic toxin production) will contribute to prevent B. cereus foodborne poisoning in Europe...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the European Standards {{for the detection of}} irradiated food by thermo luminescence of silicates, electron-spin resonance spectroscopy of bones or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of 2 -alkylcyclobutanones does not allow the detection of irradiated ingredients included in small quantity in the matrix of a food which has not been irradiated, but which could be subjected to various processing technologies such as cooking, freezing or storage. The use of an enzymatic food hydrolysis carried out at moderated temperature, for the extraction of the food-contaminating silicate minerals and bone fragments, followed by a purification of the extracts by a high-density aqueous solution of sodium polytungstate, allows a simultaneous detection of weak inclusions (0. 1 % m:m) of irradiated spices and mechanically deboned turkey meat (MRM) included in various <b>precooked</b> <b>foods.</b> Moreover, the use of a supercritical fluid extraction procedure for the 2 -alkylcyclobutanones or an additional purification step of the lipid extracts made it possible to lower the detection limit of the 2 -alkylcyclobutanones radiation-induced from triglycerides.

40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} form a {{large group}} of infectious diseases. These substantial diseases are occurring more in developing countries but they do not avoid developed countries. The originators of the disease are bacteria and their toxins, viruses, parasites and prions, whose source is an infected person or animal. The disease is passed on by contaminated soil, contaminated water and food, sometimes contaminated items. Greatest importance in the prevention of foodborne disease are nonspecific measures, protection of drinking water, safe food production, waste disposal, functional sewer system, rodenticides and insecticides measures and of course the principles of personal hygiene, certain standards of hygiene and health education of the population. Intestinal infections are preventable. The consumer can effectively protect by following the fundamental principles established by the World Health Organization. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore knowledge of foodborne disease prevention measures and compliance with these principles by adolescents in the Milevsko region. The theoretical part of the study summarizes the basic information about intestinal diseases and describes their effect on health from a variety of perspectives. The preventive measures which everyone should be aware of and apply them in everyday life to protect health are described in great detail. The paper summarizes the information about the process of spreading foodborne diseases and epidemiological measures focused on supply, routes of transmission and susceptible individuals. The theoretical part includes basic information about specific intestinal infections which are most significant for the population in the Czech Republic. Briefly described are treatment of these diseases and the most important legislative measures. In the research part quantitative research was applied by questionnaire. The research groups were students of higher secondary vocational schools and vocational schools in the region Milevsko. Three hypotheses were formulated. Statistical hypothesis testing was performed using the t test. The values of the achieved significance level are compared with a predetermined level of significance. The first hypothesis assumed that knowledge about prevention of intestinal diseases is higher among girls than boys. This statement has not been confirmed. Knowledge of the principles of prevention does not differ according to the criteria of gender. Two further hypotheses assumed that the observance of hygienic measures in the prevention of foodborne disease is higher among girls than among boys and higher for high-school graduates than apprentices. These hypotheses are valid. Precautionary principles are indeed respected more by girls than boys and high-school graduates than apprentices. The carried out research shows that adolescents in the region Milevsko have a good knowledge of foodborne infections and do known also essential preventive measures. However, knowledge of these rules does not mean they are applied in practice. The results showed that some rules, such as washing fruits and vegetables before eating, adequate boiling or roasting of food, especially hand hygiene before eating food or after contact with an animal are observed by a smaller percentage of respondents than that reported knowledge of these principles. A positive finding is that respondents comply with certain rules, without being aware of them, such as the principle of proper preservation of <b>precooked</b> <b>food.</b> Foodborne diseases are diseases which can be prevented in compliance with precautionary principles. Especially in the Czech Republic, where nonspecific principles are at a high level. It is up to each user/consumer how consistent these principles will be.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of idiopathic nephrolithiasis is increasing in rich countries. Dietary manipulation {{could contribute to}} the prevention of both its first appearance and the recurrence of the disease. The target of dietary treatment is to decrease the “urinary lithogenic risk factors” such as low urine volume, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, hyperphosphaturia, hypocitraturia, hypomagnesuria and excessively alkaline or acid urinary pH. Due {{to the lack of}} randomized controlled trials focused on this problem, there is not ample evidence to confidently recommend dietary changes. Despite this, numerous recent and past experiences support modification of diet as having a primary role in the prevention of nephrolithiasis. In particular, it is recommended to limit animal protein and salt intake, to consume milk and derivatives in amounts corresponding to calcium intake of about 1200 mg/day and to assume fiber (40 g/day), vegetables and fruit daily avoiding foods with high oxalate content. Furthermore, vitamin C intake not exceeding 1500 mg/day plays a protective role as well as avoiding vitamin B 6 deficiency and abstaining, if possible, from vitamin D supplements. Lastly, it is recommended to drink enough water to bring the urinary volume up to at least 2 L/day and, as much as possible, to use fresh or frozen products rather than prepacked or <b>precooked</b> <b>foods</b> which are often too rich in sodium chlorid...|$|R

This study aimed at producing <b>precooked</b> weaning <b>food</b> of high nutrient quality that can alleviate the problem of malnutrition associated with weaning children from quality protein maize, soy bean and cashew nut. METHOD: Three formulations were produced from various mixture of flours produced from QPM, soybean and cashew nut. The blends were reconstituted and precooked at 1100 C. The products were subjected the proximate composition, mineral, functional and pasting properties, sensory, biological assessment tests using standard methods. RESULTS: The {{results showed that the}} addition of both cashew and soybean to QPM improved the level of protein (9. 84 %), fat (4. 50 - 14. 03 %), ash (1. 90 - 2. 30 %) and selected mineral {calcium (280. 50 – 350. 55 mg/ 100 g), potassium (228. 50 - 399. 90 mg/ 100 g), iron (3. 50 - 4. 20 mg/ 100 g), zinc (3. 20 - 4. 15 mg/ 100 g) } of <b>precooked</b> weaning <b>food.</b> The final viscosity and pasting temperature ranged between 142. 25 – 229. 33 RVU and 75. 25 – 80. 630 C respectively. The sensorial quality of the diet showed that the precooked diets were acceptable to the panellists but the control was the best. The in vivo studies showed higher growth rate (30. 82 – 67. 10 g) in the soy and cashew substituted QPM group was the best among the formulated diets while the basal did not support growth (- 15. 22 g). The protein efficiency ratio ranged between 1. 90 and 2. 94. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that QPM substituted with both soy and cashew nut produced weaning food of comparable quality to the commercial weaning food and supported good growth responses in experimental animals...|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} prior to World War II, two factors {{influenced}} {{the design of the}} U.S. Army's M-1926, M-1932, and M-1942 mess kits. First, unlike most other armies of the day, the U.S. mess kit was designed to serve men queuing in feeding lines and served in unit formations from large garrison-type field kitchens when not in actual daily combat operations. Secondly, U.S. soldiers in the field were never expected to either forage or to completely cook their rations, even in daily combat or frontline service. Instead, when not used as a serving tray for company-size or larger units, the mess kit was used to re-heat pre-measured servings of the canned Reserve Ration. After 1938, it was used for the new C-ration, a canned combat ration with several menu <b>precooked</b> or dried <b>food</b> items. Today, though canned and dried combat rations have further evolved into the MRE, these can now be self-heated, and thus only a containment tray is required for most units.|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of staple foods in African countries {{is still a}} very time-consuming job. This is particularly the case in sub-Saharan countries where millet and sorghum form the basic diet and where most grain is processed by hand. As a result of expanding urban populations and higher demand for leavened bread and fast foods, wheat requirements have increased considerably in developing countries. In order to promote the use of local grains, the FAO established the Composite Flour Programme in 1964 and started implementation in 1970 by developing methods and products for commercial production in Senegal. Leavened bread made from wheat flour has been used in the Mediterranean for at least three thousand vears. This staple subsequently spread all over the world. The fascination for Western food encouraged the habit of bread consumption in most of the large cities in developing countries. Over the last few decades wheat flour and the American loaf of bread have become familiar products on markets of all continents. Those developing countries influenced by French culture, however, have shown more interest in the consumption of the French 'baguette'. In many developing countries bread is now part of the daily diet of most urban households. Breadmaking has been widely introduced in several African countries. In Kenya, for example, bread consumption has been increasing by 15 % per year since 1978. In some parts of Zaire notably around Kinshasa, bread has virtually replaced the traditional starchy staple 'shikwanga' derived from locally-grown cassava. The popularity of bread encouraged women in several countries to organize baking cooperatives. These efforts were not only in order to produce bread locally but also for making a little extra income. Many of these initiatives have come up against serious problems such as high costs of both transporting flour and fuel for firing the poorly designed ovens. It is true that bread has several advantages over traditional staple foods. It requires no further preparation once purchased and it can be kept for several days in a range of environmental conditions. Moreover, the nutritional value of bread is higher than that of other staple foods such as cassava, rice or potatoes. Nevertheless, bread remains a luxury as far as developing countries are concerned, given the fact that wheat imports and their subsidies are a major drain on local budgets. Wheat accounts for nearly three quarters of all grain imported by African countries. Almost all of Zaire's country's wheat is imported from the American mid-west. For climatic reasons, wheat suitable for breadmaking can be grown in very few countries in tropical areas. Wheat substitutes could be a solution to these problems but many difficulties are encountered in making bread with non-wheat materials. The secret of bread making The main problem is that non-wheat materials do not possess glutenforming protein which, through kneading, gives bread its unique texture and flavour. Only two cereals, wheat and rye, contain this extensible protein. For breadmaking, one requires a flour from a wheat of fairly high gluten content. When the dough is mixed, and subsequently fermented, the protein chains produce a lattice network which holds the carbon dioxide gas released during fermentation. During baking, the carbon dioxide is driven off leaving behind the open crumb texture of leavened bread Making bread by substituting part of the wheat, rather than all of it is not new. The {{preparation of}} such composite flours, however, generally demands a more complex processing. Non-wheat materials require dry extraction milling to remove fibre and fat. In times of scarcity, non-wheat materials were generally used to extend bread supplies. In ancient times, barley was frequently added and bread containing a large amount of barley flour was often the staple food of the poor. The use of flour from barley, potatoes, rye and maize occurred throughout the two World Wars. It {{is important to note that}} these additives were crops grown in temperate regions. It is known that tropical and subtropical cereals. tuber and root starches have often been added to wheat flour but, unfortunately, there are very few reports about these experiences. More recently, the use of composite flour has become fashionable in the West. This has perhaps helped in reconsidering breadmaking with blends of wheat and non-wheat materials of tropical origin. International efforts for local bread Gluten-free flour has long been used for the preparation of dietetic bread types, especially for patients suffering from coeliac diseases. Going even further, the Dutch Institute for Grain, Flour and Bread Research (TNO), in Wageningen, developed bread made entirely made from non-wheat material. The FAO Composite Flour Programme was designed to effect savings in foreign exchange by reducing wheat imports. Following this initiative, several programmes at the national level have been set up. At the Food Technology Institute (Institut de Technologie Alimentaire, ITA), Dakar, a project was established in 1970 to develop processing techniques for the commercialization of millet products. A similar experience started in Sudan in the late 1970 's, with special emphasis on the use of sorghum. The volume of a loaf of bread made with millet flour is generally smaller than that of genuine wheat flour loaf. At the end of the ITA project in Dakar, around 1974, millet bread was produced daily for sale and a commercial bakery was opened. An original method for making French type millet bread, using 30 % millet flour and 70 % wheat flour, was developed by experimental research on the use of millet flour. In 1979 Senegal made it obligatory to use 15 % millet flour and 85 % wheat flour in bread baked in Dakar and the Cape Verde region. By the end of 1982 two commercial mills in Dakar were equipped for millet milling with a capacity of approximately 100 tonnes per day. They produce millet/ wheat flour mixtures following the official requirements for breadmaking Based on the experience in Senegal, a project was launched at the Food Research Centre (FRC) in Khartoum, Sudan, including a sorghum milling and bakery pilot plant. It is interesting to note that another project has been started this year in Burkina Faso to mix wheat with 5 % of maize flour. Insofar as the FRC Sudan project is concerned, a survey showed that bread made with 30 % sorghum flour and 70 % wheat flour was evaluated as palatable to excellent. As with millet bread, the volume of a sorghum loaf remains small and the texture is drier and less elastic. However, it can be kept longer than bread made out of wheat alone. Neither the texture nor the flavour are much affected by the addition of sorghum flour. The capacity of the pilot bakery could reach a maximum of about 15, 000 loaves per 24 hours (3, 000 kg of flour per day). The distribution of the bread made with up to 25 % sorghum flour was limited to selected clients. Disadvantages of composite flour processing Bread made from composite flour containing low protein materials will require enrichment. Cottonseed flour, fish meal, groundnut and cowpeas are among the products that can be used as protein supplements. Such concentrates should be free from materials which might spoil the flavour, volume and texture of the bread. They should also be free from harmful substances such as gossypol in cottonseed and trypsin inhibitor in soya. Composite flours can also be used for other diverse food commodities. A large percentage of local grains (up to 50 %) can be used in the manufacturing of biscuits and noodles. Non-wheat flours have different milling characteristics. Sorghum and millet flours, for example, have a higher ash and fat content in fine fractions than in coarse fractions, contrary to wheat. The outer layers should be removed by decortication before grinding the endosperm to flour. In Senegal, millet is always decorticated before it is milled. Many consumers dislike the product made by mechanical decortication, so most of the millet in Senegal is decorticated and ground by hand. Specific studies on millet decortication show that dry milling techniques increase the yield by 10 - 20 % compared with traditional pounding; they lighten the workload and also improve flour quality. In Sudan, decorticating sorghum is less cumbersome and in towns most sorghum is ground in stone mills without decortication to produce 100 % extraction flours. A fluffy bread texture is difficult to obtain with local cereals. Many years of research have been devoted to this subject, e. g., by the TDRI (Tropical Development and Research Institute) in London, the IDRC (International Development Research Centre) in Canada, by several research institutes in France and by two Belgian universities, the Catholic University of Louvain and the University of Leuven. The latter developed a leavening agent, utilizing pentosan (a rye extract) that raises the dough. Nevertheless, the loaves are still quite different in form from wheat products and also have Inwer nutrient value. Not all sorghum varieties can be used with success in industrial processing. Many popular varieties generally used for traditional dishes are not suitable for mechanical processing due to their softness and the difficulties encountered in separating the bran. The softness of the grain is probably the most important criterion. The consumer prefers a white color and fine flour irrespective of the variety from which it is produced. For efficient production, quality control is essential in purchasing sorghum suitable for milling. White varieties are often mixed with small amounts of coloured kernels, which diminish considerably the quality of the flour. Today deliveries with an impurity rate exceeding 3 % are no longer accepted. New products Traditionally, millet and sorghum are primarily eaten with vegetables and a meat sauce in the form of millet couscous or porridge in several northern and western African countries; sorghum ugi in Kenya or kisra in Sudan. In Sudan, four sorghum mills with a capacity of 150 tonnes per day are producing commodities for traditional dishes. Sorghum flours are more appropriate for producing biscuits and other commodities where the volume is not of prime importance. Snack foods, such as chips, have been developed at the FRC and it was found that they have a good market potential. Research on foodstuffs sometimes lead to new products. Pearl aura is a new polished sorghum product developed at the FRC. It is an attractive ready-to-use cereal, similar to rice, and costs approximately one third as much as rice for the Sudanese consumer. Furthermore, it has a white colour and a good taste. The only disadvantages are the fact that pearl aura requires more water and a longer cooking time than rice. The nutritive value has been estimated to be about the same as rice. Marketing tests suggest that this product may have a promising future. Another example of the use of local varieties for commercial food manufacturing is a project on weaning foods in Benin. Baby food flours which are manufactured in Ouando are made out of locally grown maize, sorghum and soya. Only rice is imported for some products in this project. This semi-industrial manufacturing plant can even be operated manually. The marketing is organized by small traders and the products have been readily accepted by families. Efforts for the future After thirty years of research and development on breadmaking and the use of non-wheat flour compounds, it has become clear that these programmes have not led to concrete results. This is perhaps why projects are now more oriented towards commercial processing of traditional dishes which utilize local grain types. Food emergencies, particularly those involving large numbers of refugees, have become increasingly frequent in recent years. Doubts are still expressed about the impact of food aid, especially its possible detrimental effects on production in the recipient country, its failure to reach the most needy and its influence on food eating habits. The European consumption pattern has also been given too much attention. While focussing research mainly on technical constraints and problems, cultural and economic aspects have been overlooked. Pilot projects conceived to cover demands at national levels were often set-up on too large a scale requiring considerable amounts of local grain necessitating a steady production and reliable quality. Moreover, imported commodities are available at anytime and subsidies make their purchase less expensive. It is cheaper and easier to feed bread to a growing and influential urban population than to increase agricultural production in the countryside and improve transportation and distribution systems. It has to be acknowledged that most of the composite flour breadmaking projects in Africa did not succeed. A report on this subject published by the FAO in 1982 states that :None of these projects actually succeeded in applying large scale flour processing plants over the long term. Most of these research operations did not get beyond the laboratories or pilot installations. The main target of all these efforts was primarily the making of bread. More work is now needed on local dishes and the commercial processing and distribution of ready-to-use traditional food commodities. The first steps in this direction have already been taken in Togo with the support of the French CEEMAT (Study and Experimentation Centre for Agricultural Mechanization) on ready-to-use gari made from cassava. Marketing efforts have already proved successful.
