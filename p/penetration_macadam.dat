40|$|The {{study was}} {{particularly}} concentrated on identifying {{the causes of}} road deterioration, road defects and determining the most important parameters {{which could be used}} to predict the rate of deterioration particularly in Bitumen <b>penetration</b> <b>macadam</b> roads. A comprehensive literature review was conducted with literature related to both local an international context to determine the road deterioration factors, road defects, rate of deterioration [...] . etc both locally and foreign countries. Moreover, the literature review was accompanied with the road condition surveys where sophisticated equipments were used in developed countries while manual data collection methods were used in developing countries like ours. In achieving the above objectives, a suitable surface condition survey form was developed. Surface condition survey form was accompanied with road surface information, road geometry, sand sealing history and road deformations. Traffic data and sand sealing history were obtained from Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) and the rest was obtained by field observations. Data collection was carried out in selected Bitumen <b>penetration</b> <b>macadam</b> roads for about nine months. Cracks, potholes, edge defects, depressions, corrugations are the significant road defects observed in the field. Traffic, age, road geometry, weather, drainage, construction quality as well construction material, maintenance policy play the major role as road deteriorate agents. Potholes and cracks were mainly considered in the field observations of road deformations. The data was analysed by usingthe statistical softwares SPSS and SAS. Category data was used for data analysis and statistical tests were carried out to check the significance of the road deterioration agents. It was found that both potholes and cracks were having significant relationship with age as well as traffic...|$|E
40|$|The Highway Development and Management Tool (HDM- 4) is a {{powerful}} system {{for the analysis of}} road management and investment alternatives and it is used to prepare road investment programmes and to analyse road network strategies. In this study, the HDM- 4 tool is used to find the AADT thresholds based on traffic, subgrade and climate for upgrading low volume roads to maximize economic benefits in Sri Lanka. Several road sections were defined based on different possible traffic, subgrade and climatic conditions for Gravel, <b>Penetration</b> <b>Macadam</b> (PM), Surface Dressed (SD), Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) and Asphaltic Concrete (AC) pavement types. Altogether more than 120 sections were modelled in HDM- 4. Level- 1 calibration was done in HDM- 4 to harmonize with the Sri Lankan condition. Using HDM- 4 strategy analysis, different rehabilitation and improvement alternatives were analysed. Maintaining existing pavement considered as the base case. Analysis was done for a 20 -year period and optimized for maximum NPV. The outcomes of the analysis EIRR was compared in tabular and graphical forms in order to identify the AADT thresholds for traffic, subgrade and climate for upgrading each pavement type. This shows that traffic volume and growth rate are significantly affected and whereas the effect of climate and of subgrade condition are negligible. Upgrading threshold of low volume road can be decided based on traffic volume in AADT with a fair assessment of the number of heavy vehicles, traffic growth rate and climate condition. According to the study, AADT ranges were defined to get maximum economic benefit for different pavement types of low volume roads in Sri Lanka. Furthermore it can be concluded that low volume roads (AADT less than 1000) in Sri Lanka can use Gravel, PM or SD pavement type with proper maintenance and it is more economical than upgrading to AC or PCC.
