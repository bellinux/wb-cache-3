5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E

After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{cascading}} regulatory {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.|$|E

Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or scalloped <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and <b>pattern</b> <b>to</b> break up the animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour {{to create the illusion}} of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E

Their only other goal came in a 3–1 home defeat by the Faroe Islands; the two wins over San Marino were the only points gained by the Faroe Islands in the group. In the return match, a 3–0 scoreline in Toftir, is the Faroe Islands record competitive win.|$|E

In particular, we propose new patterns for 3 - and 5 -connectivity. We also discover that there exists a hexagon-based universally elemental pattern that can generate all known optimal patterns. The previously proposed Voronoibased approach can not be applied to prove the optimality of the new <b>patterns</b> due <b>to</b> their special features. We propose a new deployment-polygon based methodology. We prove the optimality of deployment <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> achieve three-connectivity, fourconnectivity and five-connectivity for certain ranges of Rc/Rs, respectively, and prove the optimality of deployment <b>patterns</b> <b>to</b> achieve six-connectivity under all ranges of Rc/Rs...|$|R
