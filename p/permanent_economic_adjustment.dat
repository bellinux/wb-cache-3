40|$|Economists {{disagree}} {{on the influence of}} time on the probability of success of economic sanctions. Some argue that it takes time to convince the sanction target. Others stress that <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> will reduce incentives to comply. We seek to reconcile these different literatures, modelling the target's decision to comply as a function of both (anticipatory) <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> and Bayesian learning. We show that sanctions which do not work instantaneously (ie there is neither political compliance nor <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment)</b> can work in the long run, but only if the learning effect dominates the adjustment effect. A sufficient condition for ultimate compliance is that (potential) sanction damage that cannot be avoided by adjustment in the long run exceeds the yield of misconduct...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} whether {{the potential of}} Greece's exit (GrExit) from the Eurozone {{has an impact on}} Greece's <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> program and vice versa. In particular, we ask the question whether the “GrExit” d iscussion is leading into a Catch- 22 situation: Greece is expected to default if it does not follow through with the <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> program, when, at the same time, the <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment</b> program appears to be an unsustainab le strategy for revers ing the Greek economic downfall. Our find ings are based on analyzing the literature regard ing (a) the possibility and consequences of a Greek exit from the Eurozone, (b) the viab ility of the Greek economy given the adjustment program, and (c) the magnitude of the discussion regarding Greece's troubled economy before and during the crisis period...|$|R

Contrary to some US findings the relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> & change in depressive symptoms was strongest among those who reported having the strongest sense of personal control (mastery) & the highest perceived social support. Compared with the US sample, married Czech women reported more depressive symptoms, had more health problems, & were lower in feelings of mastery. In addition, Czech women recorded significantly stronger paths linking education to changes in health conditions & depressive symptoms, whereas US women had significantly stronger paths linking actual economic conditions to subsequent <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Data suggest that the US stress-distress model applies in the Czech Republic as well, but further understanding of the differentiated role of social support & mastery for Czech & US women is necessray to more completely interpret the observed interactions...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{expatriate}} adjustment {{have traditionally}} focused on corporate expatriate assignments where foreign employees {{are often the}} only expatriate, or {{one of a handful}} in a host organisation. Multicultural not-for-profit organisations such as United Nations organisations have largely been ignored. It was hypothesised that classic predictors of expatriate adjustment – Spousal Adjustment, Culture Novelty and Acculturation Style, and novel variables of <b>Economic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Stage in Assignment would predict Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw prematurely from the assignment. 181 expatriates representing 38 countries from all economic levels completed an online survey investigating their experiences on assignment to a United Nations Organisation in Rome, Italy. Black & Stephens (1989) classic scales of Expatriate Adjustment, Spousal Adjustment, Culture Novelty and Cognitions to Withdraw were employed along with Acculturation Style, <b>Economic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Stage in Assignment measures designed for this study. Qualitative data was also collected around expatriates’ cognitions to withdraw from their assignment and reasons to stay in order to gain a richer understanding of the expatriate experience. The best predictors of Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw for United Nations expatriate employees in Rome were classic predictor Culture Novelty and novel predictors <b>Economic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Stage in Assignment. Structural Equation Modelling indicated the best fitting model of Expatriate Adjustment and subsequent Cognitions to Withdraw demonstrated moderate fit (! 2 = 1045. 19, df = 486, p =. 000, TLI =. 80, CFI =. 82, RMSEA =. 08) with Culture Novelty predicting General and Interaction Adjustment; <b>Economic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> predicting General Adjustment; and Adjustment Stage predicting General, Interaction and Work Adjustment. General Adjustment was the only significant predictor of Cognitions to Withdraw. Qualitative analysis suggested that the classic adjustment measures used did not adequately capture the experiences of these expatriates and that caution should be taken in generalising the literature to not-for-profit populations. Furthermore the outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} the inclusion of novel variables of <b>Economic</b> <b>Adjustment</b> and Stage in Assignment as predictors of expatriate adjustment could be warranted for future research. Sample size and adequacy of measures both limited the extent to which analysis could be conducted and results generalised.

40|$|The Latvian {{economy has}} been the most crisis {{affected}} economy so far in the whole territory of the EU. The expected GDP fall during the year 2009 is close to 20 %, the unemployment rate is approaching 20 %, and prices have already started to fall. There are major fiscal problems in the economy. For the second year Latvian society has lived under the threat of devaluation of the national currency. The country has applied for serious external financial assistance from the IMF and the European Commission. The sharp decrease in the economic activity is strongly related to the high current account deficit in the balance of payments which developed during the previous years of a high growth thus making the Latvian economy extremely vulnerable. As a financial inflow has strongly decreased, there is a rapid decline in both private and government consumption and investment. This paper is aimed at analysing and explaining the roots of the drastic changes in almost all macroeconomic indicators that have led to serious <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> and strict changes in the economic policy.
