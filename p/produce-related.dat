40|$|In general, {{contamination}} of food by pathogens {{of animal origin}} is well established, but awareness is growing that fresh or minimally processed fruit and vegetables can also be sources of pathogenic bacteria. In particular Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp {{are known to be}} emerging human pathogens and are strongly associated with <b>produce-related</b> outbreaks. To better understand whether surface irrigation waters might be a source of these two pathogens, five irrigation ponds were studied. Water microbiological, environmental and chemical factors were studied to determine if there was a correlation between any of these factors and the presence of pathogens. The methodology for pathogens detection combined a Most Probable Number (MPN) method, a filtration technique for large volumes of surface water, a standard selective media and a real-time PCR TaqMan assay. E. coli O 157 :H 7 concentrations ranged from not detectable to 0. 98 MPN per L and from below detection limit to 2. 07 MPN per L for Salmonella spp. With variables at disposal, it was found that E. coli presence seems to be related with water temperatures whereas Salmonella with nutrients in the water.

40|$|The consumers' {{demand for}} {{fresh fruits and}} {{vegetables}} has increased in recent years. These foods may be consumed raworminimally processed, and therefore can be a vehicle of several pathogens. Themicroorganisms most frequently linked to <b>produce-related</b> outbreaks include bacteria (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Shigella spp.), viruses and parasites. There are many traditional technologies to reduce/eliminate the microorganisms present in food products. However, further research on this topic is still required, since none of the methods reported can control all the parameters necessary to achieve produce with an extending shelf-life, without compromising its quality. In this paper, an analysis of the alternative and traditional methodologies is made, pointing out the significant advantage and limitations of each technique. Industrial relevance: The significant increase in the incidence of foodborne outbreaks caused by contaminated minimally processed produce in recent years has become of extreme importance. The extensive knowledge of gentle (non-thermal) processes to enhance safety, preservation and shelf-life of these products is crucial for the food industry.

40|$|A multistate Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{outbreak}} in August and September 2006 {{was found to}} be associated with consumption of fresh bagged spinach traced to California. The California Food Emergency Response Team (CALFERT), consisting of personnel from the California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch (FDB) and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) undertook an environmental investigation to determine how and why the spinach became contaminated. At the invitation of FDA and FDB, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also participated in the environmental investigation. This paper presents findings from the portion of the environmental investigation focusing on environmental factors related to irrigation water that may have contributed to contamination of the spinach and hence to the outbreak. Analysis of the available data suggests that depths to groundwater and groundwater-surface water interactions may pose risks to ready-to-eat crops. These risks should be further evaluated and quantified to understand and identify the factors that contributed to this and similar outbreaks. One implication of this analysis is the need to continue to conceptually broaden the scope of <b>produce-related</b> {{outbreak in}}vestigations. Where feasible, investigation strategies should integrate possible contamination sources beyond those actually found on the farms that are identified as sources of produce involved in outbreaks.

40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of <b>produce-related</b> foodborne illness have increased consumer {{awareness of the}} potential health risks associated with the consumption of fresh leafy greens. Additionally, microbial spoilage of fruit juice and juice beverages through contamination with Alicyclobacillus spp. has caused significant economic losses worldwide. The {{first part of the}} study focused on methods to enhance the safety of minimally processed green onions and baby spinach. The individual and combined inactivation efficacies of ultraviolet light (254 nm), acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), and mild heat treatments were evaluated and optimized for surface and infiltrated E. coli O 157 :H 7 contamination on green onions and baby spinach. Due to the limited efficacies of these methods for infiltrated pathogens, a novel method utilizing gaseous antimicrobial ethyl pyruvate (EP) was proposed. In {{the second part of the}} study, the distribution of Alicyclobacillus spp. allelic types (ATs) collected from fruit juices, beverages, ingredients, and environmental samples over a period of ten years was analyzed. Our results suggest a predisposition for certain ATs of Alicyclobacillus spp. depending on the juice or ingredient isolation source. A further characterization of the thermal resistance, guaiacol production, and genetic properties of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, the most common Alicyclobacillus species implicated in juice spoilage, was investigated. This iii information will assist in controlling Alicyclobacillus spp. contamination through the development of thermal processing regimes tailored to the relevant Alicyclobacillus spoilage organisms in different juice and beverage products, while avoiding excessive processing that would lead to diminished quality in the final product. i...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This study {{surveyed}} {{the extent of}} microbial contamination on lettuce and tomatoes purchased from farmers markets, an increasingly popular source of local produce. Foodborne outbreaks in the U. S. have implicated Salmonella and E. coli as etiologic agents associated with raw <b>produce-related</b> illness; lettuce and tomatoes in particular have been implicated as common vehicles for Salmonella and E. coli. 126 samples of lettuce and tomatoes were collected from 5 major farmers markets in the Seattle metropolitan area throughout the 2012 summer/fall harvest season. Samples were analyzed for surface contamination of Salmonella spp. and generic E. coli as an indicator for fecal contamination. Whole tomato and 50 g lettuce samples were enriched or eluted in sterile Whirl-Pak® bags. Surfaces of samples were manually rubbed in liquid media to aid in removal of surface attached particles. Samples were pre-enriched in Universal Pre-enrichment Broth {{for the detection of}} Salmonella spp., followed by selective enrichment with Tetrathionate (TT) broth and plating onto XLD agar for isolation. Presumptive colonies were confirmed with API and qPCR targeting the Salmonella invA gene. Rapid Colilert® tests, paired with Quanti-Tray®/ 2000 (IDEXX), were adapted for qualitative and quantitative detection of generic E. coli on produce. Following elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), positive wells were enumerated after 24 hrs and E. coli levels expressed as MPN/ 100 mL per sample. No Salmonella was detected; presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed to be Citrobacter. Escherichia coli, indicating fecal contamination, was present on 62 % of lettuce and 6. 4 % of tomatoes samples. No significant differences were found in E. coli contamination by sampling date or between organic and conventional production methods. There were significantly more lettuce samples contaminated with E. coli than tomatoes (p Salmonella on farmers markets produce. However, good agricultural practices should be promoted to reduce levels of E. coli indicating fecal contamination on produce...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} number of <b>produce-related</b> outbreaks, greater attention has been given to interventions that remove human pathogens on fresh produce. Survival of Salmonella Poona on the surface and stem scar portions of inoculated cantaloupe, effect of chlorine or lactic acid or ozone on the survival of bacteria, transfer of pathogen from the rind to the fresh-cut tissue during cutting and growth and survival of Salmonella Poona on the fresh-cut tissues during 15 days of refrigerated storage were investigated. Preliminary studies were conducted to confirm that the rifampicin-resistant strain used in the study was indistinguishable from the parent strain of Salmonella Poona. Growth curve, heat tolerance and lactic acid resistance studies were performed, all of which showed no differences in behavior between the organisms. Cantaloupes were immersed in an inoculum containing rifampicicn-resistant strain of Salmonella Poona (107 CFU/ml) for 3 min and then dried for 12 h. The inoculated melons were washed with chlorine (200 ppm) for 3 min or lactic acid (2 %) for 2 min or ozone (30 ppm) for 5 min and fresh cut tissues were prepared by peeling the rind and cutting into pieces or cutting the melon and removing the rind. Results obtained indicate that the levels of Salmonella Poona recovered were higher when the sample was obtained from the scar portion than the surface. Surface treatment with tap water or chlorine did not reduce Salmonella Poona. However treatment with lactic acid or ozone reduced the levels by 2. 5 and 2. 3 log 10 CFU/cm 2 respectively on the surface. Fresh-cut tissue prepared from melons sanitized with lactic acid resulted in less transfer during cutting and reached below detectable limits after 9 days of refrigerated storage. Cutting melons after peeling the rind was found effective in reducing the transfer of Salmonella Poona into the tissue in comparison with cutting of melons and removing the rind later. Thus these data suggest that treatment with lactic acid and ozone may be effective in reducing Salmonella {{from the surface of the}} cantaloupe where as lactic acid was effective in reducing the transfer from the surface to the flesh...|$|E
40|$|Produce (fruits and vegetables) {{has been}} {{frequently}} linked to foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States and worldwide. <b>Produce-related</b> outbreaks have been {{traced back to}} contamination occurring at pre-harvest production level. The overall goal of this dissertation was to identify risk factors for produce pre-harvest contamination and develop models to predict the introduction, survival, and persistence of enteric foodborne bacteria in produce at the pre-harvest level. Produce from mixed farms, where vegetable crops and animals are grown at the same premise, is potentially at higher risk of microbial contamination due to its proximity to environmental reservoirs such animal enclosures and composting facilities. Such contamination can be affected by meteorological factors such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. By integrating microbial sampling and meteorological data, the effects of meteorological factors on prevalence and concentration of Listeria species and generic Escherichia coli in samples collected from a mixed produce and dairy farm were analyzed using logistic regression and tree-based methods. The developed models have robust predictive ability {{and can be used}} to estimate the risk of microbial contamination in mixed farms under different weather conditions. Survival and persistence of pathogens in field soil is a food safety concern as soil can serve as a source and route for microbial contamination in produce. Regression models were developed to evaluate the effects of meteorological factors, cover cropping, and farming system on the survival and persistence of generic E. coli and L. innocua in produce field soil. The models revealed that survival of E. coli and persistence of L. innocua were predominately influenced by temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. Further, data from a large microbial sampling study were used {{to determine the effects of}} a variety of meteorological, environmental, and farm management factors on the presence and concentration of food safety and quality bacteria indicator in tomatoes and tomato environmental samples. The results suggest that microbial contamination in tomatoes and in tomato production environments can be significantly affected by certain meteorological conditions, environmental factors, and farm management practices. In conclusion, this study identified potential risk factors associated with the presence, concentration, survival, and persistence of enteric foodborne bacteria in produce and in produce production environments. The developed models can be used to predict the risk of microbial contamination in produce farms under different meteorological conditions, geographical regions, and farm management practices. Such information and tools will help growers to improve farm management practices to reduce potential contamination of produce...|$|E
40|$|The multibillion dollar {{agricultural}} industry {{is an important}} part of the United States economy, and the management of factors that affect crop and human health is imperative to maintaining this economic sector. The fungi Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium pallidoroseum, and Fusarium moniliforme are the causative agents of several plant diseases and can cause significant crop loss both before and after harvest in commodities such as strawberries, lettuce, citrus, and grains. Fungicides are employed to control these phytopathogens, but the use of these chemicals has led to an increase in fungicide resistance and may negatively affect the environment and human health. In addition to plant pathogens, foodborne pathogens also have a substantial impact on the {{agricultural industry}}. Foodborne disease outbreaks involving Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 not only cause considerable economic losses, but can also result in devastating health problems for consumers. The increase in fungicide resistance and number of <b>produce-related</b> foodborne disease outbreaks warrants investigation into additional methods of microbial control for use in the agricultural industry. Many bacterial species, including Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and Bacillus species, produce antifungal and antimicrobial compounds, thus the use of biological control agents pre- and postharvest could augment current methods of pathogen management. The purpose of this study was to screen 22 bacterial isolates for inhibitory activity against the fungal phytopathogens Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium pallidoroseum, and Fusarium moniliforme and the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in vitro, then evaluate antimicrobial efficacy of select isolates against the foodborne pathogens on fresh produce. To evaluate antifungal activity, the bacterial isolates were individually spot-inoculated onto Tryptic Soy Agar, Potato Dextrose Agar, or MRS agar, depending on isolate growth requirements and then a plug of fungal-colonized agar was placed onto the center of the isolate-inoculated plate. Plates were incubated at 24 °C for 10 days; fungal growth was evaluated daily, beginning on Day 3. Nine of the 22 isolates screened inhibited all three fungi; inhibition by these isolates ranged from 51 - 62 % for B. cinerea, 60 - 68 % for F. pallidoroseum, and 40 - 61 % for F. moniliforme. Isolates were also screened for biosurfactant activity using the drop-collapse test. Biosurfactant production was detected in seven of the nine isolates. Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus thuringiensis BT 2 and three Bacillus amyloliquefaciens isolates demonstrated strong biosurfactant activity and suppression of all three fungi, and therefore are recommended for further study. Antimicrobial activity of the isolates was assessed using two methods: LAB isolates were screened using a seeded-overlay method and all other isolates were evaluated by spot inoculating the isolate on pathogen-seeded TSA. Three LAB isolates and six Bacillus isolates suppressed L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 in vitro. Based on the results of the screening, three LAB isolates—Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Pediococcus pentosaceus—were selected for further evaluation and use in challenge studies on fresh produce. The role of organic acids in pathogen inhibition was evaluated by incubating L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 cultures in the cell-free supernatant (CFS; pH 3. 81 - 4. 27) or the neutralized cell-free supernatant (pH adjusted to 6. 5 - 7. 0) of each isolate. When neutralized, the antimicrobial activity of the CFS of the three LAB isolates was greatly diminished, illustrating the role of lactic acid in the inhibition of pathogen growth. To assess antimicrobial efficacy on Iceberg lettuce, a cocktail of the three LAB isolates (7 - 8 log CFU/g) was sprayed onto lettuce spot-inoculated with L. monocytogenes (2 - 3 log CFU/g); lettuce was incubated at 10 °C for 14 d. L. monocytogenes levels were 1. 84 log lower on LAB-treated lettuce than on untreated lettuce at the end of incubation. Because the LAB cocktail suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes on lettuce, testing on fresh produce continued using DF 1, which was a powdered product comprised of the three LAB isolates and media components. Because DF 1 caused substantial browning of Iceberg lettuce after 2 d, Gala apples were chosen to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of DF 1 against L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O 157 :H 7. The effect of DF 1 on L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 on Gala apples was determined by spraying a Gala apple spot-inoculated with pathogen (6 - 7 log CFU/plug) with approximately 3 mL of a 20 % DF 1 solution, then incubating at 20 °C for 5 d. After 5 d incubation, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 levels on DF 1 -treated apples were approximately 4, 2, and 2 log higher than the control, respectively. Based on the results of these experiments, DF 1 is not the optimal formulation for the biocontrol of foodborne pathogens on fresh produce. This study identified several bacterial isolates with potential for use in the biocontrol of plant and foodborne pathogens. Further investigation is required to assess possible use in the agricultural industry, including characterization of bioactive compounds, optimization of biocontrol product formulation, and evaluation of the commercial viability of the biocontrol produc...|$|E
