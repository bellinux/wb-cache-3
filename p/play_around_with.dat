500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way I See It and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way I See It, everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E

Popjustice saw the music video in progress on October 22, 2008, in the edit they reported that the music video was produced on a green screen, but the concept of the video was to be Aguilera in an edit suite pressing various flashing buttons, editing what was her own music video. Aguilera herself discussed the production of the video, saying [...] "I really enjoyed making the video for 'Keeps Gettin' Better', being an artist who likes to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> different looks, it was a lot of fun to portray various characters within the same shoot."

500|$|Four {{years after}} its publication, The Kite Runner was adapted as a motion picture {{starring}} Khalid Abdalla as Amir, Homayoun Ershadi as Baba, and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada as Hassan. It was initially scheduled to premiere in November 2007, but the release date was pushed back six weeks to evacuate the Afghan child stars from the country after they received death threats. Directed by Marc Forster and with a screenplay by David Benioff, the movie won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award, the BAFTA Film Award, and the Critics Choice Award in 2008. While reviews were generally positive, with Entertainment Weekly deeming the final product [...] "pretty good", the depiction of ethnic tensions and the controversial rape scene drew outrage in Afghanistan.

500|$|The German V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{demonstrated}} a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD {{had some success}} developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field {{that had been left}} to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2.

In an interview with MTV UK, Derulo commented on the [...] "Show Me Love" [...] sample: [...] "I'm in love with that bassline, it's just really hypnotic and I just wanted to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> it in the studio.

500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E
500|$|Erik Kain {{felt the}} episode {{fell short of}} The Flash part, criticizing the [...] "silly drama" [...] between Oliver and Felicity in [...] "Legends of Yesterday". But, he felt both episodes were [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and {{entertaining}} as the characters interact, and Barry and Oliver [...] "play well against one another". Mark Rozeman of Paste gave the Arrow episode an 8.8 out of 10, saying, the episode: [...] "has the freedom to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> its toys a bit more" [...] compared to the [...] "unavoidable amount of world building and backstory [...] ended up massively bogging down the crossover's first installment." [...] He felt the crossover was fun and a [...] "rollicking good time". Kain praised the shows' creative team for [...] "making the special feel like a legitimate event, {{as opposed to just}} a half-assed stab at ratings gold". Mike Cecchini was pleased that the episode was not [...] "another hour of fan service with little substance," [...] and felt [...] "Legends of Yesterday" [...] was a [...] "really good" [...] Arrow/Oliver Queen episode. He praised Amell's performance and highlighted that: [...] "The two teams really gelled nicely, and just as Barry and Ollie felt like real friends during the episode's dramatic moments, Flash and Green Arrow felt like natural teammates during the superheroic moments."

500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with.</b> It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, and opined, [...] "With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee {{the series was}} {{able to have a}} little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development." [...] He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, [...] "I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] by Queen. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of [...] "A−": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There’s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it’s the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to <b>play</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard." [...] In conclusion of his review, he wrote, [...] "The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps." ...|$|E

[...] George also designed Mason's suit to look [...] "a typical conservative politician shape and style" [...] with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire.
