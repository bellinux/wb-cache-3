50|$|In Constitutional law, the Last Resort Rule is {{a largely}} <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> which gives {{a federal court}} the power to avoid a {{constitutional}} issue in some circumstances. This rule dictates that, even if all other jurisdictional and justiciability obstacles are surmounted, federal courts still must avoid a constitutional issue {{if there is any}} other ground upon which to render a final judgment. The last resort rule can function as a distinct barrier to Constitutional avoidance. It is articulated by Justice Brandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority.|$|E

[...] The Court concluded: [...] "Given this posture of the case, we think the <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> of avoiding constitutional questions has no application. The fact {{that there may be}} buried in the record a nonconstitutional ground for decision is not by itself enough to invoke this rule."

The dissenters would have heeded the avoidance doctrine by vacating and remanding the case for consideration of the nonconstitutional questions, despite the parties' failure to brief these issues: [...] "The obligation to avoid unnecessary adjudication of constitutional questions does not depend upon the parties' litigation strategy, but rather is a 'self-imposed limitation on the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction that has an importance to the institution that transcends the significance of particular controversies.'" [...] The dissent asserted that the avoidance doctrine is the most [...] "deeply rooted" [...] doctrine of constitutional adjudication. The doctrine amounts to a [...] "fundamental rule of judicial restraint," [...] which has received the sanction of time and experience. The dissent imbued the avoidance doctrine with constitutional weight by relying on earlier Supreme Court precedent relating the avoidance doctrine to the case or controversy requirement. The dissenters also likened it to the [...] "policy against entertaining political questions." [...] Despite those constitutional linkages, however, the avoidance doctrine is most commonly classified as a <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> of judicial self-restraint.|$|E

That he has done so much to re-work modern litigation in the name of fidelity to the workways of eighteenth century lawyers “in the English courts at Westminster” testifies to his considerable rhetorical skills.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} regulatory gaps that are created through imprecise preemption rulings. It begins with a detailed case study of how railroads were able to enter the highly regulated solid waste industry, to claim that all state oversight is preempted by a federal statute intended to deregulate railroad economics, and to obtain the economic benefits of operating in a regulatory gap. The net result of current preemption doctrine in those cases has been to strip citizens of the power to ensure that waste transfer stations are safe, and this fundamental injustice serves as a backdrop to analyzing current preemption jurisprudence. The Court’s reliance on a presumption against preemption of state laws to interpret federal statutes has declined over time, and this article provides an additional explanation for the presumption’s decline based upon flaws in the original formulation of the doctrine. The article also explores the Court’s current use of regulatory gaps as marking the plausible limits of Congressional intent to preempt, particularly {{when faced with the}} preclusion of all tort remedies for individual victims, and argues that the Court’s concern about regulatory gaps should extend to preventive measures that are also based on the states’ police powers and that are the expression of collective rights of self-protection. In addition to the standard federalism concerns that animate restraints on preemption, the article builds on scholarship that suggests additional Constitutional limitations on Congress’s powers to strip remedies from citizens. Finally, the article proposes to correct these trends through a revitalized presumption against preemption, whereby courts would consider whether a preemption ruling will create a regulatory gap, and in those circumstances should require a clear statement that Congress intended to strip remedies designed to prevent the underlying conduct at issue. Such a <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> of construction would avoid potential Constitutional issues...|$|E

These individual annuities are provided by numerous and heterogeneous institutions that rely on more or less rigorous <b>prudential</b> <b>rules</b> and are subjected to highly disparate fiscal laws.

Indeed, various restrictive institutional factors tend to strengthen the natural propensity of individuals to favour liquid and transferable assets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 87 - 91) The {{purpose of}} this research was to investigate children's conceptions of reciprocity and mutuality in peer relations. Previous research has indicated that children's ideas regarding reciprocity may be an important product of children's social experience, which may in turn play a role in reasoning about social issues. The first part of the study focused on children's evaluations of issues pertaining to victims' and witnesses' active responses to moral transgressions. The second part of the study involved children's evaluations of punishments alloted in response to moral, conventional, and <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> violations. Ninety children participated in the study. There were 30 children (15 girls and 15 boys) in each of three grades: second, fourth, and sixth. The children were individually administered a set of guestions {{in the context of a}} story about school rules. The subjects were asked what a peer would do and should do when he/she is a victim of a moral rule violation (e. g., when the child is pushed down), what a child would do and should do when he/she is a witness to moral transgression, and whether it would have been all right for a victim to have retaliated. The children were also asked to justify their responses to these questions. In the second part of the study, the children were asked whether a child should be punished for violating moral, conventional, and prudential rules. The children were additionally asked why the child should or should not be punished. In the final question, the children were asked to rate the importance of having a punishment for each of the violations. The findings of this study support previous research showing that children utilize direct reciprocity in monitoring peer relations. However, children also are able to conceptualize reasons for why retaliation is not legitimate. Children also demonstrate an understanding of punishment devoid of notions of direct reciprocity, and instead attempt to alleviate future negative consequences by educating peers about regulations.

40|$|On November 26, 2013, the Supreme Court {{agreed to}} decide whether for-profit {{corporations}} or their shareholders have standing to challenge federal regulations that implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). At issue in the two cases consolidated for appeal, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, are regulations mandating that employers with fifty or more employees offer health insurance that includes coverage for all contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The plaintiffs assert that providing certain types of contraceptive care would be contrary to their religious beliefs and allege, therefore, that the mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) {{as well as the}} First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause. The government does not dispute that the family owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties are sincere in their religious objections. However, the mandate applies only to employers and imposes no direct duties upon corporate shareholders. Thus, a threshold issue in these cases and dozens of other pending cases involving for-profit corporations is whether any plaintiff has standing to challenge the mandate. Some courts have concluded that religious objections to the mandate are simply nonjusticiable. Other courts have found standing, either by endorsing the novel proposition that a for-profit business corporation is, itself, a person capable of religious exercise, or by allowing individual owners who have no personal obligations or liability under the ACA’s mandate to nevertheless interpose a religious objection. We offer the Court a way to resolve the cases before it that, unlike the approaches advocated by the parties, avoids the need to decide questions of ﬁrst impression regarding the free exercise rights of for-proﬁt corporations. Under well-established exceptions to the <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> against third-party standing, one party can sometimes assert the interests of a third party. Allowing Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties to litigate religious objections to the mandate on behalf of their shareholders obviates the need for the Court to venture into uncharted territory. The crucial insight is that the corporation’s injury need not be religious in nature for the religious objections to the ACA regulations to be adjudicated. So long as the corporate plaintiff is injured economically by the regulations, it has standing under Article III to challenge them. At that point, the corporation’s assertion of the constitutional or statutory rights of absent third parties is properly analyzed under the rubric of third-party standing...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the medium term {{economic impact of the}} new capital regulatory standards (the Basel III reform) for Norway using a standard semi-structural dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with credit market imperfections. The following questions are answered: (i) what are the major expected effects of higher minimum capital requirement on the Norwegian banking sector and on medium-term economic performance? (ii) How is the inclusion of a proposed countercyclical capital buffer, when made dependent on either the credit-to-GDP or the real credit growth as common reference point, affecting the model economy and in particular GDP and credit growth? The main findings of this study are the following: (1) each percentage point increase in the capital adequacy ratio translates into a 0. 50 per cent loss in the level of steady state output. The long-run effect of a persistent shock to the capital adequacy ratio equation propagates through the banking sector block in the model to the real sector, affecting output by as much as - 0. 55 percentage points at its peak before shifting output to a new steady-state level between 0. 50 and 0. 55 percentage below its initial level. (2) The application of a countercyclical capital buffer based on a <b>prudential</b> <b>rule</b> that increases the capital requirement when the credit-to-GDP ratio rises seems capable of moderating credit growth in the model, but it increases the output volatility. More up to date findings in the literature suggest that the use of credit-to-GDP gap as a common reference point could be flawed and at worst increase the inherent pro-cyclicality of bank capital regulation. Reproducing the same methods to investigate this issue for Norway seems to confirm this undesirable property. Findings from the estimated model suggest that the use of a buffer, with credit-to-GDP gap as a reference point alters the sign of the correlation between output growth and bank capital, producing a strong negative correlation of - 0. 61. In order to circumvent this issue, real credit growth is employed as an alternative indicator. The use of real credit growth, both as a leading indicator of systemic risk and as a common reference point, seems to moderate credit growth in a sizeable way and output growth to some extent. Finally, the model seems to generate a slightly higher correlation between output and bank capital, confirming that the use of real credit growth, next to having some desirable properties, also seems able to produce results in the model economy that are closely in line with the main objectives of Basel III and its mandate...|$|E

This book takes {{stock of the}} developments in EU legislation, case-law and institutional structures with regards to banking regulation and supervision, which preceded and followed the recent financial crisis. It does not merely provide an update, but anchors these developments in the broader EU law context, challenging past paradigms and anticipating possible developments. The author provides a systematic analysis of the interactions between the content of <b>prudential</b> <b>rules</b> and the mechanisms behind their production and application. European Prudential Banking Regulation and Supervision includes discussions of the European banking market structure and of regulatory theory that both aim to circumscribe prudential concerns. It scrutinises the content of prudential norms, proposes a qualification of these norms and an assessment of their interaction {{with other types of}} norms (corporate, auditing and accounting, consumer protection, competition rules). It also features an analysis of the underpinning institutional set-up and its envisaged reforms, focusing on the typical EU concerns related to checks and balances. Finally, the book attempts to revive the debate on supervisory liability, in light of the developments discussed. This book will be of great value to all those interested in financial stability matters (practitioners, policy-makers, students, academics), as well as to EU law scholars. Introduction.
