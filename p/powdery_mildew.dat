Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> can infect {{the leaves}} and shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season.

50|$|Ampelomyces quisqualis is an {{anamorphic}} fungus {{that is a}} hyperparasite of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> This parasitism reduces {{growth and}} may eventually kill the mildew, so investigations on biological control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> (especially in high-value crops such as grapes) have taken place for over 50 years, resulting {{in the development of}} products such as 'AQ10'.|$|R

5|$|Microorganisms {{including}} bacteria, fungi, {{and viruses}} are important as plant pathogens, causing disease to crop plants. Fungi cause serious crop {{diseases such as}} maize leaf rust, wheat stem rust, and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Bacteria cause plant diseases including leaf spot and crown galls. Viruses cause plant diseases such as leaf mosaic. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes potato blight, contributing to the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew)</b> and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E

50|$|Erysiphales are obligate parasites on {{leaves and}} fruits of higher plants, causing {{diseases}} called <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> Most attempts to grow them in culture have failed.|$|R
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the <b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E
40|$|We {{detected}} common genomic hallmarks in the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> {{associated with}} obligate biotrophy. These include gene losses and exten-sive gene reshuffling correlated with expansion in (retro-) transposon number and genome size. Together, these hallmarks {{may represent a}} tradeoff between advantages of increased genetic variation independent of sexual recombination and irreversi-ble deletion of genes dispensable for biotrophy. Hence, their evolution provides a notable example of Dollo’s law of evolutionary irreversibility (15). This may explain why <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> and pos-sibly other biotrophic parasites became obligate. References and Note...|$|R
5000|$|The {{third group}} are the downy mildews, which are easily {{identifiable}} {{by the appearance}} of white, brownish or olive [...] "mildew" [...] on the leaf undersides (although this group can be confused with the unrelated fungal <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews).</b>|$|R
40|$|Fungi of {{the genus}} Ampelomyces are the major antagonists of Erysiphales fungi being a {{significant}} group of phytopathogens. The hyperparasites attack various developmental stages of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> As a result the infested ascomata do not reach the stage of maturity, do not form appendages nor ascospores, which is linked with a reduction {{of the source of}} primary infections. Studies conducted so far have mainly been devoted to Ampelomyces fungi application in the biological control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> on crops, whilst a few only have been focused on the ecology of these mycoparasites on Erysiphales fungi infecting plants, especially in the urban environment. The present study addresses the natural occurrence and effect of Ampelomyces fungi on the development of ascomata of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> species. The material was collected in 2005 – 2009 in several cities of the northeastern Poland. First time ever Ampelomyces spores are reported in mature ascomata of Erysiphales with fully developed appendages. This phenomenon has been observed in the case of two species, viz. : Erysiphe flexuosa on Aesculus spp. and E. vanbruntiana var. sambuci-racemosae on Sambucus racemosa and is presumably linked with improved implementation, propagation and probably better survival during winter months...|$|R
