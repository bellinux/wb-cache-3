5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare <b>Prescription</b> <b>Drug,</b> Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

A 2008 congressional hearing by the Joint Economic Committee drew attention to some small market <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> that had an extraordinary price increase [...] a price increase of 100 percent or more at a single point in time. GAO was asked to examine extraordinary price increases for brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Specifically, GAO examined the: (1) frequency of extraordinary price increases for brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> from 2000 to 2008, (2) characteristics of the brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> that had extraordinary price increases, and (3) factors {{that contributed to the}} extraordinary price increases experienced by these brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> To determine the frequency and characteristics of the brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> that experienced an extraordinary price increase, GAO reviewed drug pricing and other data from a pharmaceutical industry compendium. To illustrate the factors that may contribute to extraordinary price increases, GAO developed case studies of six brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> identified from the analysis of drug pricing data. These brand-name <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> were selected based on factors including price, and the percentage and number of price increases. ...|$|R

5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W.

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

5|$|In November 1956, Presley {{made his}} film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, {{he was drafted}} into {{military}} service.

In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result.

5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, Love {{was banned}} from Virgin Airlines by founder Richard Branson after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, {{in the midst}} of what Love would later admit was a serious cocaine and <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> addiction, she was arrested in Los Angeles after {{breaking}} several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her losing custody of her daughter. On March 18, 2004, Love was arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October 2004.|$|E
40|$|Authorization of the {{importation}} of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> from countries with lower prices than the United States is an increasingly attractive proposition for state and federal policymakers. The short-run benefit of reductions in prices of selected <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> for selected patients {{may be viewed as}} a sufficient reason to favor importation. However, there may be longer-run effects of importation of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> that are less desirable, including reduced investments and altered regional investments in pharmaceutical research and development. With separate approval processes used in different markets, pharmaceutical companies practice price discrimination. Prices of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> are higher in the United States than in most countries that have negotiated discounts or set prices. Differences in prices between the United States and other countries of one-third to one-half may provide the opportunity for firms in a low-price country to export a drug to high-price country at a profit – giving rise to the concept of “importation ” {{from the perspective of the}} high-price country. Currently, importation of <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> from Canada to the United States may exceed $ 1 billion.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "American consumers are increasingly drawn to the convenience, privacy, and cost advantages that might be accrued by purchasing <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> over the Internet.
