5000|$|Because {{dock work}} was {{generally}} unskilled (with {{the notable exception}} of screwmen) and of a short-term contractual nature, an employer could readily replace workers who refused to bend to the employer’s terms. Black laborers were both numerous and available for work. In this type of competitive market, blacks and whites were pitted against each other by ship owners {{in an effort to}} keep wages down: if whites would not work for a lower wage, owners would look to blacks who would. [...] Following this reasoning, “only control of the labor supply and solidarity across trade and racial lines could reduce this possibility. That meant that alliances between unions and, most importantly, between black and white unions, were essential to reducing competition between different groups for jobs.” [...] Alliances between the groups allowed both to exercise more control over the terms and conditions of their work, including wage rates and <b>production</b> <b>expectations.</b> Union leaders of both races recognized the difference that an alliance made in those terms and conditions, prompting a pragmatic continuation of the biracial system.|$|E

Previous research has studied the predictive content of the expectation variables included in those surveys through bivariate, within-country, Granger-causality tests. These tests have resulted in mixed conclusions. We extend previous research in various ways, as we (i) explicitly allow for cross-country influences, and (ii) do so using both bivariate and multivariate Granger-causality tests. Specifically, the multivariate El Himdi-Roy (HR) test is adapted to jointly test the forecasting value of multiple <b>production</b> <b>expectation</b> series, to assess whether part of this joint effect is indeed due to cross-country influences, and to determine which countries' expectation series have the most "clout" in predicting the production levels in the other member countries, or have the highest receptivity, in that their production levels are Granger caused by the other countries' expectations.

This study investigates underlying assumptions on resource availability and future <b>production</b> <b>expectations</b> to determine whether exaggerations {{can be found in the}} present set of emission scenarios as well. It is found that the SRES unnecessarily takes an overoptimistic stance and that future <b>production</b> <b>expectations</b> are leaning towards spectacular increases from present output levels.

The current set, SRES, is biased toward exaggerated resource availability and unrealistic expectations on future production outputs from fossil fuels...|$|E
40|$|Decomposing Granger {{causality}} {{over the}} spectrum {{allows us to}} disentangle potentially different Granger causality relationships over different frequencies. This may yield new and complementary insights compared to traditional versions of Granger causality. In this paper, we compare two existing approaches in the frequency domain, proposed originally by Pierce [Pierce, D. A. (1979). R-squared measures for time series. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, 901 – 910] and Geweke [Geweke, J. (1982). Measurement of linear dependence and feedback between multiple time series. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 77, 304 – 324], and introduce a new testing procedure for the Pierce spectral Granger causality measure. To provide insights into the relative performance of this test, we study its power properties by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we apply the methodology {{in the context of}} the predictive value of the European <b>production</b> <b>expectation</b> surveys. This predictive content is found to vary widely with the frequency considered, illustrating the usefulness of not restricting oneself to a single overall test statistic. status: publishe...|$|R

However, the soybean crop cultivation contains risks associated with the geographic location, characteristics of the soil and the chosen rice management, main culture in lowland areas.
