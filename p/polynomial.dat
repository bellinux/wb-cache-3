5|$|The <b>polynomial</b> pA in an {{indeterminate}} X {{given by}} evaluation the determinant det(XIn−A) {{is called the}} characteristic <b>polynomial</b> of A. It is a monic <b>polynomial</b> of degree n. Therefore the <b>polynomial</b> equation pA(λ)=0 has at most n different solutions, that is, eigenvalues of the matrix. They may be complex even if the entries of A are real. According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, pA(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic <b>polynomial</b> yields the zero matrix.|$|E
5|$|Although no <b>polynomial</b> time {{algorithm}} {{is known for}} this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known.

5|$|Resolution, {{a method}} for {{combining}} pairs of constraints to make additional valid constraints, also leads to a <b>polynomial</b> time solution. The 2-satisfiability problems provide one of two major subclasses of the conjunctive normal form formulas that can be solved in <b>polynomial</b> time; the other of the two subclasses is Horn-satisfiability.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a single fixed graph G on left side of input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |V(H)|O(|V(G)|), so <b>polynomial</b> {{in the size of}} the input graph H.

25|$|A <b>polynomial</b> is an {{expression}} that {{is the sum of}} a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a <b>polynomial</b> in the single variable x. A <b>polynomial</b> expression is {{an expression}} that may be rewritten as a <b>polynomial,</b> by using commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a <b>polynomial</b> expression, that, properly speaking, is not a <b>polynomial.</b> A <b>polynomial</b> function is a function that is defined by a <b>polynomial,</b> or, equivalently, by a <b>polynomial</b> expression. The two preceding examples define the same <b>polynomial</b> function.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{the ratio}} of two {{alternating}} polynomials is a symmetric function, possibly rational (not necessarily a <b>polynomial),</b> though {{the ratio of}} an alternating <b>polynomial</b> over the Vandermonde <b>polynomial</b> is a <b>polynomial.</b>|$|E

25|$|Symmetric polynomials arise {{naturally}} {{in the study}} of the relation between the roots of a <b>polynomial</b> in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by <b>polynomial</b> expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric <b>polynomial</b> can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric <b>polynomial</b> expression in the roots of a monic <b>polynomial</b> can alternatively be given as a <b>polynomial</b> expression in the coefficients of the <b>polynomial.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>polynomial</b> 0, {{which may}} be {{considered}} to have no terms at all, is called the zero <b>polynomial.</b> Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather the degree of the zero <b>polynomial</b> is either left explicitly undefined, or defined as negative (either −1 or −∞). These conventions are useful when defining Euclidean division of polynomials. The zero <b>polynomial</b> is also unique {{in that it is}} the only <b>polynomial</b> having an infinite number of roots. The graph of the zero <b>polynomial,</b> , is the -axis.|$|E

25|$|A {{term with}} no indeterminates and a <b>polynomial</b> with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a {{constant}} term and a constant <b>polynomial.</b> The degree of a constant term {{and of a}} nonzero constant <b>polynomial</b> is 0.

25|$|The {{opposite}} of integer factorization is integer multiplication {{to obtain a}} product. The {{opposite of}} <b>polynomial</b> factorization is expansion, the multiplying together of <b>polynomial</b> factors to an “expanded” <b>polynomial,</b> written as just a sum of terms.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>polynomial</b> {{interpolation}} {{also has}} some disadvantages.
