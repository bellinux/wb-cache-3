However those banks with diversified borrowing structures {{are also more likely}} to participate in the auction.

30|$|In {{the above}} example, only one lender was {{cognizant}} of credit hunger. In such a case, notions of credit hunger will only affect the final rate if the cognizant lender gains by lowering her rate and increase her utility in the process. This has policy implications for marketplaces wanting to benefit borrowers through lower final rates. For example, such marketplaces can set training policies to increase awareness of credit hunger. If more lenders are cognizant of credit hunger, those lenders may revise their <b>bidding</b> <b>rates</b> {{down for a}} patient borrower. This will result in greater situations where r_i^ 1 < p_ 1 < r_i^ 0 and thereby increasing the probability of lowering the final lending rates between time t= 1 and t= 2.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of the Eurosystem in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum <b>bid</b> <b>rate</b> on the main refinancing operations. The article explains how the Eurosystem steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how the Eurosystem’s liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum <b>bid</b> <b>rate</b> on the main refinancing operations {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, the Eurosystem nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, the Eurosystem decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the main refinancing operations early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, the Eurosystem also decided to increase the share of longer-term refinancing operations in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil. These movements cannot be controlled directly by central banks as they are determined predominantly by private sector behaviour. However, when assessing the appropriate monetary policy stance, the Governing Council of the ECB takes these possibly changing financing conditions into account. monetary policy implementation, Eurosystem, open market operations...|$|R

We employ a unique data set comprising repo auctions from March 2004 to October 2008 with bidding data from 877 counterparties.
