The periodicals under study include newspapers, news magazines, journals, community papers, serials, etc. Data was retrieved from the official website of the Registrar of Newspaper for India on July 31, 2013. Altogether, there were 116, 531 periodical titles. India’s 1. 2 billion population are served by 373, 839, 764 copies of newspapers daily, which is the largest number in the world. More than 23 different periodicities are registered with the RNI, under which different periodicals are published in more than 130 languages. The other areas covered under the study include: distribution of periodicals across the different states and union territories of India, languages used by each state, <b>periodicity,</b> <b>annual</b> and decade growth rate of periodicals, ranking of states on the basis of newspapers published from each individual state. Many other similar areas have been explored to understand the information dissemination pattern across India by these primary sources of information...|$|E

40|$|Urophycis mystacea, RIBEIRO, 1903, (Phycidae; Gadiformes) é uma espécie demerso-bentônica presente na plataforma externa e no talude da região Sudeste-Sul do Brasil. Desde 2001 é alvo das pescarias em águas profundas e seu estoque vem diminuído. A idade da espécie foi analisada em exemplares com comprimentos totais (Ct) entre 187 e 632 mm, através da contagem de anéis de 201 cortes de otólitos. A periodicidade (anual) e a época de formação dos anéis (outono) foram verificadas pela porcentagem relativa do tipo de borda. U. mystacea apresenta crescimento lento e longevidade moderada. Foram encontrados machos com 1 a 6 anos e fêmeas com 1 a 12 anos. Os parâmetros de crescimento foram obtidos pelos métodos de Ford-Walford e Iterativo dos Mínimos Quadrados. As equações de crescimento mais adequadas foram: Ct = 549. 16 (1 -exp- 0. 203 (t-(- 0. 9)) para machos e, Ct = 738. 08 (1 -exp- 0. 134 (t-(- 1. 08)) para fêmeas.

Since 2001 it has been a target {{fisheries}} on deepwater and its stock has been decreased. The age of the species was investigated in specimens with total lengths (Lt) between 187 and 632 mm by counting the rings of 201 otoliths slices. The <b>periodicity</b> (<b>annual)</b> and the time of ring formation (autumn) were verified by the relative percentage of the edge type. U. mystacea presents slow growth and moderate longevity. Males from 1 to 6 years and females from 1 to 12 years were found. Growth parameters were obtained by the methods of Ford-Walford and Iterative Least Squares. The most appropriate growth equations were: Lt= 549. 16 (1 -exp- 0. 203 (t-(- 0. 9)) for males and Lt= 738. 08 (1 -exp- 0. 134 (t-(- 1. 08)) for females.

Compared to risk-based strategies, the uniform ones result in a much lower benefit for a specific cost. Reductions close to 10 % in costs and higher than 20 % in false-positive results and overdiagnosed cases were obtained for risk-based strategies. Optimal screening is characterized by quinquennial or triennial periodicities for the low or moderate risk-groups and annual periodicity for the high-risk group. Risk-based strategies can reduce harm and costs. It is necessary to develop accurate measures of individual risk and to work on how to implement risk-based screening strategies.

40|$|Northern Hemisphere {{studies of}} first admissions for {{schizophrenia}} have shown {{an excess of}} summer admissions (June, July and August) compared to other times of the year. The within-year fluctuations in first admissions {{could be related to}} meteorological factors that fluctuate between seasons (e. g. temperature, photoperiod) and/or social factors (e. g. holidays, religious events). If meteorological factors were primarily responsible for the fluctuation, then Southern Hemisphere studies should find excess first admissions in December, January and February. This paper presents the first season of first admission study of schizophrenia in the Southern Hemisphere. The month and year of first admission for schizophrenia (ICD 8 / 9) for 4487 male and 3252 female, Australian-born individuals were extracted from a Queensland mental health register. Spectral analysis showed a strong <b>annual</b> <b>periodicity</b> of first admissions for males with the peak in August (Southern Hemisphere winter) and a trough in the summer months (December to February).

The green turtle {{has a long history of}} human exploitation with some stocks extinct. Here we report on a 30 -year study of the nesting abundance of the green turtle stock endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. We show that there has been a substantial long-term increase in abundance of this once seriously depleted stock following cessation of harvesting since the 1970 s. This population increase has occurred in a far shorter period of time than previously thought possible. There was also a distinct 3 - 4 year <b>periodicity</b> in <b>annual</b> nesting abundance that might be a function of regional environmental stochasticity that synchronises breeding behaviour throughout the Archipelago.

The growth analysis of 120 individual shells showed that 90. 8 % of collected shells were less than 4 {{years of age and}} only two shells (1. 6 %) were older than 6 years. Population structure was described and generalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters were calculated: asymptotic length (L) was 38. 22 mm and the growth constant (K) was 0. 30 year- 1. Growth performance index value of P. rustica (Ø’) was 2. 64, among the lowest ranges reported for limpet species. Patella rustica shells were degraded to different degrees by microbial bioerosion. The damage was most often restricted to the oldest parts of the shell, i. e. apex of the shell, posing difficulties in determining the exact position of the first growth line. The microboring organisms identified were pseudofilamentous and filamentous cyanobacteria Hormathonema (Solentia) paulocellulare, Hyella caespitosa, Mastigocoleus testarum and Leptolyngbya sp. The overall intensity of infestation was relatively low, but increased in severity with shell age and length.
