5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a {{comprehensive}} study of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered the potential for cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for <b>Parasitology</b> and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E
25|$|Gordon was a {{part-time}} lecturer in Veterinary <b>Parasitology</b> at the University of Sydney from 1937 until 1970. During {{this time he}} was responsible for teaching more than 1000 future veterinarians. Following his retirement from the CSIRO in 1974, he resumed teaching at the University of Sydney as {{a part-time}} demonstrator in Veterinary <b>Parasitology.</b> He continued in this role until 1996.|$|E
25|$|He divided {{his time}} between the Veterinary Science faculty, {{where he was a}} {{demonstrator}} in <b>parasitology</b> practical classes, and the Max Henry Memorial Library, where he was Honorary Librarian. He continued to devour scientific journal articles on <b>parasitology,</b> keeping abreast of new developments and discoveries. In 1995 the Max Henry Memorial Library was disbanded much to Hugh's dismay. This marked the end of his time at the University of Sydney, 21 years after his official retirement and 64 years after he started at the McMaster Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary <b>parasitology</b> studies both {{external}} and internal parasites in animals. External parasites, such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal parasites.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{graduated}} with Honours in 1930 and {{was awarded the}} William Cooper & Nephews Prize for <b>Parasitology,</b> and the Baker and Ridley Memorial Prize for Animal Husbandry. He won University Blues for hockey in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
25|$|Such was Gordon's {{dedication}} to veterinary science and <b>parasitology,</b> {{he continued to}} devote his time to these pursuits following his official retirement from the CSIRO in 1974. He continued to make his daily trek from Manly, taking the Manly Ferry then the 440 bus to the Camperdown campus of the University of Sydney.|$|E
25|$|González Martínez was {{interested}} in <b>parasitology,</b> a new medical concept in the island, and worked with Dr. Bailey Ashford in the Anemia Commission. Ashford {{was a member of}} the United States Army Medical Corps, who accompanied the military expedition to Puerto Rico during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Following graduation, Gordon {{was granted}} a Walter and Eliza Hall Fellowship to {{continue}} postgraduate studies in Veterinary <b>Parasitology.</b> From 1931 to 1933 he worked on parasitic diseases of sheep with Dr (later Sir) Ian Clunies Ross at the McMaster Laboratory of the CSIRO located on the Camperdown campus of the University of Sydney.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} activities of Luigi Pagliani, professor of Hygiene and founder in 1878 of the Hygiene Society, {{were at the}} basis of the strategies of public health in Italy, while discoveries made by Edoardo Bellarmino Perroncito, the first to hold a Chair of <b>Parasitology</b> in Italy (1879), saved the lives of thousands of miners all over Europe.|$|E
25|$|Gordon had a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} career in veterinary research, becoming a world-renowned expert {{in the field of}} veterinary <b>parasitology.</b> Amongst his most important contributions in that field was the discovery that phenothiazine was a safe and effective anthelmintic in sheep and cattle. This discovery, along with the recognition that this compound could be manufactured locally, saved Australian sheep farmers millions of dollars.|$|E
25|$|González Martínez {{conducted}} many {{investigations and}} experiments in <b>parasitology,</b> bilharzia, lepra and typhoid fever. During his {{years at the}} institution, González Martínez founded Anales de Medicina de Puerto Rico, a scientific journal. He {{was elected president of}} the Medical Academy of Puerto Rico in 1917. In 1919, he published a chapter on his findings of the Intestinal Bilharzias in the book La Práctica de la Medicina en el Trópico.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Dr. Iain McInnes et al. {{found that}} arthritic-induced mice {{experienced}} less inflammation and other arthritic effects when infected with ES-62, a protein derived from filarial nematodes, {{a kind of}} parasitic worm. Similarly, in the International Journal for <b>Parasitology,</b> Dr. Osada et al. published their experimental findings that arthritis-induced mice infected with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni had down-regulated immune systems. This led to resistance to arthritis.|$|E
25|$|A single {{parasite}} species {{usually has}} an aggregated distribution across host individuals, {{which means that}} most hosts harbor few parasites, while a few hosts carry {{the vast majority of}} parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders parametric statistics invalid. Log-transformation of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of non-parametric statistics is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative <b>parasitology</b> is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Veterinary Pathobiology ("VTPB") at Texas A University {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most active in the country. The Department offers {{programs}} of graduate instruction and research leading to the degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics, Microbiology, and Pathology, and the Master of Science degree in <b>Parasitology.</b> These degree programs provide the opportunity for coursework of suitable breadth and depth within the major and supporting fields in conjunction with research experience in an area of interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 several {{units were}} created {{including}} a separate Neonatal Unit, a Department of tropical disease, a Department of Gastroenterology, a Department of <b>Parasitology</b> and Department of Clinical Oncology. A year later, the ear-nose-throat clinic {{changed its name}} to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology as it was no longer part of the Surgical Clinic Department of Pediatric Surgery and Department of Neurosurgery. The Skin Clinic was renamed the Department of Dermatology and the Women's Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Department became the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Isaac González Martínez (1871–1954) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{urologist}} in Puerto Rico and pioneer in the fight against cancer in the island. Dr. González Martínez conducted many investigations and experiments in <b>parasitology,</b> bilharzia, lepra and typhoid fever. Dr. González Martínez and Dr. Bailey K. Ashford formed the first commission in Puerto Rico to study the causes of anemia. In 1914, he was named director of the biological laboratory of the sanitation service of Puerto Rico. In 1935, Dr. González Martínez founded The Puerto Rican League against Cancer. He also promoted the construction of Puerto Rico's first hospital specializing in oncology.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, when Hawking's father became {{head of the}} {{division}} of <b>parasitology</b> at the National Institute for Medical Research, Hawking and his family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire. In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book. They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab. During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa, {{the rest of the family}} spent four months in Majorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.|$|E
25|$|Rantisi {{was born}} in Yibna, near Jaffa on 23 October 1947. In 1948 Arab-Israeli War, his family fled to the Gaza Strip. In 1956, when he was nine, Israeli {{soldiers}} killed his uncle in Khan Younis: as he explained to Joe Sacco, this fact was very important for his future life. He studied pediatric medicine and genetics at Egypt's Alexandria University, graduating first in his class. He was a certified physician. In his time in Egypt he became a deeply convicted member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1976, he returned to Gaza to teach <b>parasitology</b> and genetics at the Islamic University.|$|E

25|$|Israel Jacob Kligler (24 April 1888 – 23 September 1944) was a microbiologist. A Zionist and humanist, he {{was born}} in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, educated in the United States and spent most of his career in Mandatory Palestine, but died before the {{creation}} of the State of Israel. He {{was one of the first}} four professors of the Hebrew University and the founder of Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology of the university, which he headed until his death in 1944. Kligler was one of the pioneers of modern medical research in Mandatory Palestine, studying as varied a field as Bacteriology, <b>Parasitology,</b> Virology, Nutrition, Epidemiology and Public Health. He developed the Kligler Iron Agar medium for the isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria, which is still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Ryan {{is a staff}} Physician and Pediatrician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is Board {{certified}} in both Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, and has expertise in global infectious diseases and tropical medicine, including clinical <b>parasitology,</b> virology, bacteriology and mycology. Ryan is the Director of Global Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, and in 2006 isolated a new bacterial species (Bartonella rochalimae) {{in the blood of}} a woman with fever and splenomegaly who had recently been in Peru. The bacterium was characterized with colleagues at the University of California at San Francisco and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ryan served with the Massachusetts General Hospital field deployment team aboard the USNS Mercy hospital ship in Banda Aceh, Indonesia following the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary school {{curricula}} are not standardized, with programs lasting {{from three to}} six years. In the United States and Canada the program is generally four years long, usually after a four-year pre-vet undergraduate degree). For the first three years, students learn anatomy, physiology, histology, neuroanatomy, pharmacology, immunology, bacteriology, virology, pathology, <b>parasitology,</b> toxicology, herd health (also called population health), nutrition, radiography, and epidemiology. During the third year, students learn anesthesiology, diagnostics, surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dentistry. For the fourth year, often 12 months long instead of nine, students care {{for a wide range}} of animals. Clinical education is a focus of most veterinary {{school curricula}} worldwide. In 2005, for the first time in its 104-year-history, the Veterinary Medicine Programme at University College Dublin instituted a lecture-free final year focusing on clinical training. The Institute of Veterinary Pathology at the University of Zurich has implemented a curriculum for teaching pathology with an extensive clinical component. Veterinary schools in Israel, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia also emphasize clinical training.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of dipteran flies {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. Veterinary <b>parasitology</b> also covers arthropods in the Class Acari, the ticks of domestic animals and mites of livestock which have distinctly different structure from arthropods in the Class Insecta. However, flies in the Order Diptera show clear division of the body into head, thorax and abdomen with distinct segmentation of the thorax and abdomen. The thorax contains large blocks of muscle that power the single pair of wings. Digestive and reproductive organs fill the abdomen. Also unique to the Diptera {{is a pair of}} halteres (derived from wings during evolution) that aid agile flight by these flies. Mosquitoes have veined and scaled wings, long legs, long hypodermic mouthparts sheathed in a protective labium (see photograph of Aedes female engorged with blood). Adult females lay eggs in batches on surface of stagnant water. Larvae feed on microorganisms and organic detritus in water. Pupation occurs at the surface of the water. Feeding by females is {{on a wide variety of}} mammals and birds, whilst males feed on plant sugars.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni Battista Grassi (27 March 1854 – 4 May 1925) was an Italian {{physician}} and zoologist, most {{well known for}} his pioneering works on <b>parasitology,</b> especially on malariology. He was Professor of Comparative Zoology at the University of Catania from 1883, and Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Sapienza University of Rome from 1895 until his death. His scientific contributions covered embryological development of honey bees, on heminth parasites, the vine parasite phylloxera, on migrations and metamorphosis in eels, and on termites. He {{was the first to}} describe and establish the life cycle of the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and discovered that only female anopheline mosquitoes are capable of transmitting the disease. His works in malaria remain a lasting controversy in the history of Nobel Prizes, because a British army surgeon Ronald Ross, who discovered the transmission of malarial parasite in birds was given the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. But Grassi, who demonstrated the complete route of transmission of human Plasmodium, and correctly identified the types of malarial parasite as well as the mosquito vector, Anopheles claviger, was denied.|$|E
25|$|Paul Bujor (born Pavel Bujor; August 2, 1862 – May 17, 1952) was a Romanian zoologist, {{physiologist}} {{and marine}} biologist, also noted as a socialist writer and politician. Hailing from rural Covurlui County, he studied biology in France and Switzerland, {{where he was}} attracted by left-wing ideas; his evolutionary biology, informed {{by the work of}} Karl Vogt, veered into Marxism and irreligion. Returning to the Kingdom of Romania, he was a junior member of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party, active on its moderate wing. He earned the critics' attention in the 1890s as a short story writer with a socialist and pacifist message, but only returned to fiction writing briefly, in the 1930s. An award-winning ichthyologist, Bujor was hired by the University of Iași, where he taught for 41 years, and throughout the period worked on documenting the Black Sea fauna, and made discoveries concerning the environment of Techirghiol Lake. He inaugurated the Romanian study of animal morphology, while also contributing to histology, embryology, and <b>parasitology,</b> and gave popular lectures on evolution and physical culture.|$|E
25|$|In most medical programs, {{the first}} two years deal with basic {{scientific}} courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, <b>parasitology,</b> immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In {{the first two}} years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include {{but are not limited to}} internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools. This is important in terms of the medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.|$|E
