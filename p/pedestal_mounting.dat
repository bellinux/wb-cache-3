The wing was a cantilever structure, without the earlier lift struts, continuously tapered in plan from root to tip with no externally distinct centre section and with 2° of dihedral. There was continuous taper in wing section also; Rotter returned to Göttingen airfoils using Gö 646 with a thickness to chord of 19% at the root, varying through Gö 535 to a thinner, less cambered, tip. [...] Like the Karakán, the Nemere had a plywood covered D-box ahead of the main spar but, with the external struts absent, plywood covered more of the inner wing back to a diagonal internal drag strut. The wings were fabric covered aft. Broad chord ailerons occupied the outer 60% of the wings, which ended in elliptical tips.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{emergence}} of small fast attack craft during World War I, {{it was decided that}} the British Royal Navy Dockyards were vulnerable to attack by motor torpedo boats which had the speed to evade the heavy coast defence guns which defended them. In 1925, a design was adopted for a twin barrelled weapon capable of sustained semi-automatic fire. Both barrels of the weapon could be fired singly or they could be combined. The <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting</b> and the gun crew were enclosed to the front, sides and top in a reinforced-steel barbette.|$|E

50|$|The 5-inch gun M1897 (127 mm) and its variant the M1900 were coastal {{artillery}} pieces installed {{to defend}} major American seaports between 1897 and 1920. For {{most of their}} history they were operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. They were installed on balanced pillar (a form of disappearing carriage) or pedestal (aka barbette) mountings; generally the M1897 was on the balanced pillar mounting and the M1900 was on the <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting.</b> All of these weapons were scrapped {{within a few years}} after World War I.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{nations and}} {{services}} operated {{a number of}} mounting types for the same basic gun. In a typical single-barrel naval version, it is free-swinging on a fixed <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting</b> with a flat armored shield affording some protection for the crew. The cannon is aimed and fired by a gunner using, in its simplest form, a ring-and-bead sight. The gunner {{is attached to the}} weapon by a waist-belt and shoulder supports. For this reason, some mountings existed with a height-adjustment feature to compensate for different sized gunners. A [...] "piece chief" [...] designates targets and the feeder changes exhausted magazines.|$|E
50|$|As {{originally}} planned, the Tone-class vessels were to {{have five}} triple 155 mm turrets, three forward and two aft. However, the capsizing of the torpedo boat Tomozuru called into question the stability of all Japanese warship designs. As {{a result of the}} redesign, and to improve accuracy of gunfire, all five turrets in the new design were concentrated on the forecastle. When Japan abrogated the Washington Naval Treaty on 31 December 1936, the main armament was revised to eight 203 mm guns in four twin turrets with maximum 55-degree elevation, as was installed on the Mogami-class vessels. No. 1 was forward firing, No. 3 and No. 4 turrets trained through after arcs, while No. 2 was on a superfiring <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting</b> overlooking No.1 and No.3.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prototype}} {{was ready}} in early 1941 {{leading to the}} designation 8.8 cm Flak 41. The new gun fired a 9.4 kg shell at a muzzle velocity of 1,000 m/s (3,280 ft/s), giving it an effective ceiling of 11300 m and a maximum of 14700 m, which General Otto Wilhelm von Renz said to be [...] "almost equal to the 128-mm." [...] It featured a lower silhouette on its turntable mounting than did the 8.8-cm Flak 18/36/37 on its <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting.</b> The barrel was at first a three-section one with a length of 74 calibers, and then redesigned to dual-section with a length of 72 calibers. Improvements in reloading raised the firing rate, with 20 to 25 rounds a minute being quoted.|$|E
5000|$|In World War I, it {{was used}} as an early {{anti-aircraft}} gun in the home defence of Britain. It was adapted as the Mk I*** and Mk II on high-angle pedestal mountings and deployed along London docks and on rooftops on key buildings in London, others on mobile motor lorries at key towns in the East and Southeast of England. 25 were employed in August 1914, and 50 in February 1916. A Mk II gun (now in the Imperial War Museum, London) on a Naval <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting</b> was the first to open fire in defence of London during the war. However, the small shell was insufficient to damage the German Zeppelin airships sufficiently to bring them down. The Ministry of Munitions noted in 1922: [...] "The pom-poms were of very little value. There was no shrapnel available for them, and the shell provided for them would not burst on aeroplane fabric but fell back to earth as solid projectiles ... were of no use except at a much lower elevation than a Zeppelin attacking London was likely to keep".|$|E

There was continuous taper in wing section also; Rotter returned to Göttingen airfoils using Gö 646 with a thickness to chord of 19% at the root, varying through Gö 535 to a thinner, less cambered, tip. [...] Like the Karakán, the Nemere had a plywood covered D-box ahead of the main spar but, with the external struts absent, plywood covered more of the inner wing back to a diagonal internal drag strut. The wings were fabric covered aft. Broad chord ailerons occupied the outer 60% of the wings, which ended in elliptical tips. [...] The fuselage was a ply-covered semi-monocoque, teardrop shaped in cross-section, which tapered markedly behind the wing. The canopy was a wood framed multi-transparency unit, similar to that on the Karakán, but with more panels, which preserved the contours of the upper forward fuselage back almost to the wing leading edge. The tail was conventional, with an all-moving tailplane, mostly fabric covered. The rudder, mounted on a short, narrow fin, was balanced, rounded and full. The Nemere took off from a small, two wheeled dolly and landed on a long skid under the forward fuselage, assisted by s steel tailskid at the rear.|$|E

The objective of the research described in this thesis was to measure the vibration of a prototype forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera stabilizer system during live-fire tests to evaluate its performance. Uniaxial, triaxial, and angular accelerometers were mounted at 19 different locations on the stabilizer and on the camera. Acceleration data were collected during eight live fire tests conducted at a Navy range, and the results analyzed. The power spectral densities (PSD) of the input linear accelerations at the stabilizer mounting points and the resulting linear accelerations at key locations on the stabilizer were calculated. The azimuth and elevation angular displacements of the FLIR camera mount were also calculated. The azimuth and elevation angular displacement of the plane of the stabilizer <b>pedestal</b> <b>mounting</b> points were also calculated. Recommendations are made for follow-on studies.
