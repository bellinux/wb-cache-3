40|$|Background: The {{situation}} for Swedish agricultural production today {{is characterized by}} an increased competition, particularly after the country joined the European Union. Swedish agricultural <b>production</b> <b>laws</b> guarantee safe, high quality foodstuffs. However, due to these strict laws, Swedish farmers face higher production costs than their competitors. Meanwhile, cheaper imported goods compete freely on the Swedish market. Swedish agricultural production must {{find new ways to}} survive in the increasing competition. Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to se if, and if that is the case, how Swedish agricultural production can compete on the Swedish market, maintaining its high quality. The focal point is the Swedish poultry producer, Kronfågel. Procedure: The empirical material has been collected through contacts with Kronfågel.

40|$|The {{essence of}} a {{competition}} as an objective law for development of the commodities production based on private ownership {{of the means of}} production and commodity exchange has been revealed in the paper. The paper presents an economic basis of market economy (private ownership) which generates a corresponding production objective. Such purpose is a maximization of profit and a minimization of market subject expenses. Therefore, a struggle for the most favourable conditions on commodity production and sales is inevitable in such situation. The struggle is considered in the community with developed market economy as a competition. The competition is regarded not as an exogenic factor exerting its influence on market economic system from the outside, but as an objective phenomenon which is inherent to management market system in itself. Such treatment is substantiated by economic disintegration of individual commodity producers. Being an important engine of market economy, the competition does not establish its laws, and its role is to be an executive of data which are internally inherent in commodity <b>production</b> <b>laws</b> and firstly it concerns a profit maximization law which defines a purpose and guiding motif of economic entities in the given economy. The competition plays a contradictory role under conditions of market economy. On the one hand, it makes manufacturers constantly to aspire to expense reduction for the sake of profit increase. This has resulted in labour productivity increase, production cost decrease and a company receives an opportunity to reduce retail price for its products. Consequently, the competition acts as a potential factor for lowering of prices while increasing production efficiency. On the other hand, sellers have more freedom in price fixing under conditions of imperfect competition as they sell their products under the conditions of a monopolistic competition or an oligopoly. This is the main weakest point of the market economy system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) involves striving for balance between environmental, {{social and economic}} performances of business. Encouraged by growing pressure for transparency and accountability in business, CSR constitutes an overall contribution of business to sustainable development; hence, healthy business requires a healthy community. The research asks if the law can assist CSR to deliver sustainable development to the underdeveloped but oil-rich Niger Delta, establishing areas of good practice whereby oil companies support the region's economy and social needs through their CSR activities. However, regulations do bring about social change thus business are obliged to obey the laws, codes of good practice and initiatives. Although CSR is not business' primary responsibilities, business can encourage poverty reduction and societal development. The analysis of Nigerian oil <b>production</b> <b>laws</b> reveals that court interpretations regarding rising number of oil-related litigations and procedures of settlements, neglects of oil commuities and compensation payments have become difficult. While the outcomes of Joint Venture Arrangement (JVAs) crucially affect CSR performance, the need for reforms is necessary. Using the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) criteria, the analysis of Shell Petroleum Development Corporation (SPDC) 's CSR performance in Nigeria reveals that while improvements are needed in some areas including envitonmental and human rights protections, consultation and dialogue, overall, the {{research shows that the}} company positively affects the region. The research establishes that through effective enforcement, the law can assist CSR to deliver sustainable societal development. It is concluded that until CSR is made compulsory supported by legislations to guide businesses, the full gains of CSR cannot be achieved. Hence, the research offers a detailed novel definition of CSR to make businesses become more liable as the existing model allows them to act voluntarily. Using novel models, the research demonstrates how sustainable development can be attained through CSR and considering compulsory legislations, enforcement, compliance, stakeholders' integration, consultation, dialoge and prolific partnerships. The research also offers Government Social Responsibility (GSR), a concept to further governments' commitments to their citizens. ...|$|E

40|$|Theme 4 : Governance & Climate Mitigation: no. 35. 5 Cleaner Production (CP) {{is defined}} by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as “the {{continuous}} application of an integrated preventive environmental strategy to processes and products to reduce risks to humans and the environment”. Since 1994, UNEP in cooperation with United Nations Industry Development Organization (UNIDO), started to promote the application of CP by enterprises in developing and transition countries by setting up National Cleaner Production Centers (NCPCs) and National Cleaner Production Programmes (NCPPs). The China National Cleaner Production Centre (CNCPC) under the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) was established in December 1994 with an aim to promote China’s CP research and consultation. In 1995, CNCPC launched the “Ten, One Hundred, One Thousand, Ten Thousand” programme which aimed to promote CP in 10 heavily polluting industrial sectors in 100 cities throughout China. The target is to have CP in place in 1000 enterprises and train 10000 people in CP concepts and methods. Since then, the Chinese government has seriously considered a cleaner <b>production</b> <b>law,</b> which signified its intention to shift away from traditional reliance on end‐of‐pipe solution as the principle environmental protection strategy.

40|$|Legislative {{scholars}} have debated what factors (e. g. divided government) {{account for the}} number of important laws a legislative body passes per year. This paper presents a monopoly model for explaining legislative production. It assumes that a legislature adjusts its <b>law</b> <b>production</b> so as to maximize its utility. The model predicts that socio-economic and political changes increase the marginal benefit of <b>law</b> <b>production,</b> whereas low negotiation costs and ample legislative resources decrease the marginal cost of <b>law</b> <b>production.</b> The model is tested in two ways. The first approach compares the legislatures of 42 developed and developing countries.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} drift-diffusion-recombination systems, where the recombination of electrons and holes is facilitated by an intermediate energy-level for electrons in so-called trapped states. In particular, it has been proven in [GMS 07] that the associated quasi-stationary state limit of an instantaneously fast trapped dynamics yields the famous Shockley [...] Read-Hall model for electron and hole recombination in semiconductor devices. The main result of this paper proves exponential convergence to equilibrium uniformly in the fast reaction limit for the drift-diffusion-recombination systems and the limiting Shockley-Read-Hall model. The proof applies the so-called entropy method and the key results is to establish an entropy-entropy production inequality uniformly in the fast reaction limit. Moreover, we prove existence of global solutions and show a-priori estimates, which are necessary to rigorously verify that solutions satisfy the entropy-entropy <b>production</b> <b>law.</b> Comment: 43 page...|$|R
