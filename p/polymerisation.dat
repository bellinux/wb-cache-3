5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during <b>polymerisation.</b> One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the <b>polymerisation</b> process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the <b>polymerisation</b> process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after <b>polymerisation.</b> For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E

5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and <b>polymerisation</b> (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution <b>polymerisation</b> continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the <b>polymerisation</b> usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{approaches are}} in use or under investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin <b>polymerisation</b> defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin <b>polymerisation</b> in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, {{which is}} {{normally}} used to move organelles inside the cell.

5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of biological processes, including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin <b>polymerisation</b> not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E
50|$|Emulsions {{are used}} to {{manufacture}} polymer dispersions - polymer production in an emulsion 'phase' {{has a number of}} process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product. Products produced by such <b>polymerisations</b> may be used as the emulsions - products including primary components for glues and paints. Synthetic latexes (rubbers) are also produced by this process.|$|R

To the best of our knowledge, the only direct and the most precise analytical procedure to clarify this question is the Karl Fischer titration/determination of SiOH groups. This determination was performed on a model system consisting of trimethylsilyl terminated polysiloxanes, and it was shown that the obtained polymers contained no SiOH groups...|$|R
5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin <b>polymerisation</b> into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet <b>polymerisation).</b> These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E

40|$|Chain <b>polymerisations</b> {{used for}} the {{synthesis}} of poly(arylene vinylene) s have in common that they proceed via a quinoid compound. The formation of this compound is a high-energy step that involves {{the loss of the}} aromatic resonance energy of the monomer and hence must be compensated by a driving force. In order to comprehend this driving force monomers with a growing aromatic resonance energy are polymerised via the sulphinyl precursor route described. Next the conversion of the synthesised polymers to their corresponding conjugated polymer is followed with different techniques and the u. v. – vis. absorbance and photoluminescence spectra are determined. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stereolithography is a high resolution rapid prototyping technique by which designed 3 D objects can be built using photo-initiated radical <b>polymerisations.</b> Poly(D,Llactide) (PDLLA) networks can be obtained by photopolymerisation of oligomers functionalised with unsaturated groups. In this work, PDLLA oligomers of varying architectures (arm lengths, numbers of arms) were synthesised and end-functionalised with methacrylate groups.

25|$|TEMED (N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine) (C6H16N2; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free {{radicals}} and improves polymerization. The rate of <b>polymerisation</b> and {{the properties of}} the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of {{free radicals}}. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average polymer chain length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow <b>polymerisation</b> in a reasonable period of time should be used.

He rapidly developed the techniques required to further such studies and the theory to interpret the results. This was world-leading research which established his reputation in the field.

25|$|As with {{unimolecular}} reactions, {{the keys}} to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the many processes in emulsion <b>polymerisation</b> are the rate coefficients of the individual steps. These steps are initiation (how quickly a growing chain starts), propagation (how quickly individual monomer units are added), radical loss processes (the termination and transfer of radical activity), and particle formation (nucleation). With Prof D Napper, Gilbert applied equations that he had solved in gas-phase chemistry to the area of emulsion <b>polymerisation.</b> This opened the way for him to develop—initially in collaboration with Napper—new theoretical and experimental methods for extracting the rate coefficients of elementary processes. He produced targeted data using these methods, particularly the time evolution of reaction rates and molecular-weight and particle-size distributions. This included novel types of systems, such as γ-radiolysis relaxation, in which events such as radical loss can be separated from radical propagation and growth.|$|E

In the presence of DTHP and DTCO, the propagation rate coefficient, kp, of MMA was found to be 25 % to 100 % higher compared to bulk <b>polymerisations</b> under the same conditions. The significant increase of kp was explained by electron donation from the sulfur-containing solvents, which increased the reactivity of the macroradicals. MDOP had no observable effect on kp.

Polymers derived from cyclic esters such as; lactide, valerolactone and caprolactone are of interest. An industrially viable method of producing stereocontrolled polylactide (PLA) from rac-lactide is desired. Previous work on poly(cyclic esters) is overviewed in chapter 1 with an emphasis upon PLA. Chapter 2 reports the coordination of Ti(OiPr) 4 to homo/piperazine bridged bis(phenol) (salan) ligands. Under ambient conditions bimetallic structures were produced and a steric dependent equilibrium system is discussed. Forcing conditions resulted in monometallic homopiperazine salan complexes. Their application for the ring-opening-polymerisation (ROP) of rac-lactide is investigated. Homo/piperazine salan titanium catecholates were synthesised and their cytotoxicity investigated by collaborators. Chapter 3 details the synthesis of monometallic homopiperazine salan zirconium/hafnium isopropoxide complexes. Their utility for the ROP of rac-lactide in solution and solvent free systems are discussed. Bimetallic or tetrametallic solid state structures from attempts to coordinate Zr(IV) /Hf(IV) metals to piperazine salan ligands are also discussed. Chapter 4 discusses the complexation of AlMe 3 with homopiperazine salan ligands. The resulting monometallic complexes were inactive for the ROP of lactide. Benzyl alcohol derivatives were synthesised and trialled for solvent free ROP of rac-lactide, δ-valerolactone, ε-caprolactone. Co-polymerisations were investigated and a tri-block polymer of poly(ε-caprolactone/δ-valerolactone/rac-lactide) was prepared.

Bimetallic Al(III) and Ti(IV) structures were characterised and trialled for the ROP of rac-lactide. Isotactic PLA was reported for aluminium complexes, dependent upon phenoxy substituents, and these <b>polymerisations</b> were shown to be immortal in nature. Chapter 6 details the synthesis of trans- 1, 2 -DACH salalen ligands which were complexed to AlMe 3, these initiators were investigated for the solution ROP of rac-lactide.
