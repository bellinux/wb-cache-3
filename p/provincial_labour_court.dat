40|$|Canada's high {{reliance}} on commodities can work against its constitutionally mandated goal of regional equity in economic development, while also inhibiting macroeconomic performance and limiting monetary policy effectiveness. Yet, flexible and integrated regional labour markets can help achieve both equity and macroeconomic goals. Therefore, {{this study examines}} the dynamics of Canadian <b>provincial</b> <b>labour</b> markets using a long-run restrictions structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. Labour market fluctuations are decomposed into the parts arising from shocks to labour demand (new jobs), labour supply through migration (new people) and internal labour supply (original residents). The results suggest that demand innovations primarily underlie <b>provincial</b> <b>labour</b> market fluctuations. Despite significant geographic and language barriers that could impede their performance, there also is little overall {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>provincial</b> <b>labour</b> markets are more sluggish or less flexible than US state labour markets. Finally, original residents benefit slightly more from increased <b>provincial</b> <b>labour</b> demand compared to findings for US states. ...|$|R

50|$|This {{finding was}} taken on review to the <b>Labour</b> <b>Court.</b> The <b>Labour</b> <b>Court</b> {{confirmed}} {{the unfairness of}} the dismissal, but ordered compensation rather than reinstatement. This order was then taken on appeal to the <b>Labour</b> Appeal <b>Court</b> by the employee. In that court the employer ultimately accepted that the employee’s dismissal was substantively unfair. In upholding the appeal, the <b>Labour</b> Appeal <b>Court</b> restored the commissioner’s award, based on {{the finding that the}} <b>Labour</b> <b>Court</b> had wrongly treated the matter as an appeal rather than a review, and accordingly ordered that the commissioner’s arbitration award be restored.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the arbitration of dismissal disputes by Australian <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> over a 15 years' {{time span}} characterized by two major legal reforms to unfair dismissal statutes. We isolate two channels {{by which we}} think the social values of the Federal government affected {{the decisions of the}} courts: (i) through changes to established rules (the legal standards guiding decisions) and (ii) through <b>labour</b> <b>court</b> appointments (changing the composition of decision-makers). We study these two questions by analysing the probability of plaintiffs' victory in Australian <b>labour</b> <b>court,</b> using a panel of 81 judges and 2, 223 decisions. We test for and subsequently exploit the randomized matching of <b>labour</b> <b>court</b> judges with unfair dismissal cases. We also test for and address the Priest-Klein selection effect, which is known to potentially invalidate analysis of trial cases. Using several model specifications we find significant effects from both channels: statutory reforms and judges' work background have strong and significant effects on case outcomes...|$|R
