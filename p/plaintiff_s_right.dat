40|$|This project {{focuses on}} assisted-dying policy in Canada; assisted-dying was legalized in February 2015 as per the Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) (2015) ruling, because the longstanding blanket {{prohibition}} of assisted-dying {{was found to}} be unconstitutional as it violated the <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>s.</b> 7 <b>right</b> to life, liberty and security of the person. In June 2016, Bill C- 14 : An Act to Amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other Acts (2016) was enacted federally. One of the main concerns from various sources regarding this legislation is that an individual’s natural death must be reasonably foreseeable to access MAID. Bill C- 14 (2016) excludes individuals who do not have a ‘foreseeable natural death’ from accessing medical assistance in dying. The current policy has not found a balance between the need to protect vulnerable populations from becoming victims to assisted-dying and is not accessible to those who are suffering from non-terminal illnesses or are deemed vulnerable. The methodology used in this research was a policy analysis, using court cases/rulings, federal legislation, provincial policies, transcripts, and legislative backgrounds/summaries. In addition, the co-investigator conducted two one-on-one semi-structured interviews to supplement the main data. policyassisted-dyingphysician assisted-dyingmedical assistance in dying (MAID) euthanasiaCharter rightsprinciples of fundamental justiceCarter v.

40|$|Simply stated, the {{international}} children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> movement asks individual governments to take children 2 ̆ 7 s interests seriously when enacting laws for them. In order to enact policies that take children 2 ̆ 7 s interests seriously, all laws must be evaluated and examined {{from the child}} 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. An examination of the current international children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> movement from the child 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, however, reveals considerable schisms between international principles {{and the state of}} the world 2 ̆ 7 s children.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} {{that one of the most}} {{contentious}} terrains of contestation in the supposed clash of values between Islamism and western values is the role of women in society. Thus, the issue of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> has become the litmus test for Arab societies with respect to the current zeitgeist of human rights in the age of democracy and liberalism. There is today a stereotypical view of debates surrounding women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> in the Arab world where two distinct camps are in conflict with each other. On the one hand there are 2 ̆ 7 globalised 2 ̆ 7 liberal and secular actors that strive for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and therefore democracy, while on the other are obscurantist movements that are anchored in religious tradition, resist globalisation and are therefore autocratic by assumption. This article challenges this view and through an empirical study of the changes to the Code of Personal Status in Tunisia and Morocco it demonstrates that the issue of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> is far more complex and, in particular, it finds that there is a very significant decoupling between women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in the region, despite a progressive liberal shift in the gender equality agenda...|$|R

40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The doctrine of marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the right of subrogation to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>right</b> of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>right</b> of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>right</b> of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>right</b> of subrogation. It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>right</b> of subrogation is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right of subrogation vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor.

40|$|While {{there has}} been a {{significant}} amount of research on transnational feminist activism at the global level, many feminist transnational advocacy networks are mobilizing within world regions. The lack of attention to the regional level has created a considerable imbalance in research on transnational activism. This article 2 ̆ 7 s first objective is to define regional advocacy networks (RANs) as a collection of individuals and organizations from the same world region working together toward a common goal. The article 2 ̆ 7 s second objective is to explore the conditions under which RANs are influential. We investigate conditions for RAN success through a case study of an African network that helped create one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most progressive treaties on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights,</b> the African Union Protocol to the Charter on Human and People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Rights</b> on the Rights of Women in Africa.

The broader implication of our study is that scholars seeking to understand the creation of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> commitments, the diffusion of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> norms, and compliance with women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> treaties need to look beyond the international and domestic levels of action to include the regional level in their analyses...|$|R
