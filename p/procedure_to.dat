5|$|Prior to 1966, air-pollution control {{had largely}} been the {{responsibility}} of states and political subdivisions of states like counties and municipalities (cities and towns). The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, {{and to the extent}} that it did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference <b>procedure</b> <b>to</b> convene agencies and polluters under the guidance of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the <b>procedure</b> <b>to</b> a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection <b>procedure</b> <b>to</b> insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the influence of auditor's industry specialization, auditor's independence and audit <b>procedures</b> <b>to</b> detect fraud towards audit quality. This study applies explanatory research in which questionnaires and interviews serve as the primary data.

The results of this study depicted that auditor's industry specialization and auditor's independence have significant influence on the implementation of audit <b>procedures</b> <b>to</b> detect fraud, and the auditor's industry specialization, auditor's independence, and audit <b>procedures</b> <b>to</b> detect fraud have significant influence on the audit quality.
