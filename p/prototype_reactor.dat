25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed. The extra rod worth was {{in part due to}} the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the <b>prototype</b> <b>reactor</b> core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds. That was too fast for the heat from the fuel to get through the aluminum cladding and boil enough water to fully stop the power growth {{in all parts of the}} core via negative moderator temperature and void feedback.|$|E

25|$|India {{has been}} using {{imported}} enriched uranium and are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed {{various aspects of the}} nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows Uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment capabilities. India has also done a great amount of work {{in the development of a}} Thorium centred fuel cycle. While Uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of Thorium and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that Thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A <b>prototype</b> <b>reactor</b> that would burn Uranium-Plutonium fuel while irradiating a Thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a FP 7 project (DEMCAMER) that developed materials (catalysts and membranes) and new processes for four industrially relevant reaction processes. In this project, active, stable, and selective catalysts were developed for the reaction systems of interest and their production scaled up to kg scale (TRL 5 (TRL: Technology Readiness Level)). Simultaneously, new membranes for gas separation were developed; in particular, dense supported thin palladium-based membranes for hydrogen separation from reactive mixtures. These membranes were successfully scaled up to TRL 4 and used in various lab-scale reactors for water gas shift (WGS), using both packed bed and fluidized bed reactors, and Fischer-Tropsch (FTS) using packed bed <b>reactors</b> and in <b>prototype</b> <b>reactors</b> for WGS and FTS. Mixed ionic-electronic conducting membranes in capillary form were also developed for high temperature oxygen separation from air. These membranes can be used for both Autothermal Reforming (ATR) and Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) reaction systems to increase the efficiency and the yield of the processes. The production of these membranes was scaled up to TRL 3 – 4. The project also developed adequate sealing techniques to be able to integrate the different membranes in lab-scale and <b>prototype</b> <b>reactors...</b>|$|R
