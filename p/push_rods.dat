2500|$|Both inlet and {{exhaust valves}} {{were in the}} {{cylinder}} heads. The automatic inlet valves of earlier Anzani engines, opened by atmospheric pressure and closed by valve springs were retained, but fuel was fed from a mixing chamber in the crankcase via inlet tubes placed {{at the rear of}} the engine to avoid cooling of the mixture by the oncoming airflow. [...] This arrangement placed the exhaust valves at the front of the engine, where they were operated from a cam in the rear of the crankcase via <b>push</b> <b>rods</b> and rockers. [...] A single carburettor fed the crankcase chambers from below. [...] Some versions used a single Gibaud magneto, running at 3,000 rpm, though others built by British Anzani had a pair of Bosch magnetos, running slower. [...] Plugs (K.L.G. for the British variant) were mounted in the sides of the cylinder heads, sloping upwards to avoid plug fouling by lubricating oil. The exhaust was collected by a prominent pair of semi-circular manifolds.|$|E
2500|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by <b>push</b> <b>rods</b> running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. [...] All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. [...] The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces for inlet and exhaust manifolds and <b>push</b> <b>rods.</b> [...] The exhaust stubs were vertical, each bank of cylinders feeding its own horizontal pipe. The inlet stubs entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. [...] Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. [...] Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. [...] The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. [...] These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. [...] The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. [...] The crankshafts of the D and F types had five ball race bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output thrust bearing was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. [...] The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. [...] The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. [...] The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter thrust bearing to be used.|$|E

The analysis and research on the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> are an important process of aerospace relay reliability design. In the past, most researches were done for electromagnetic systems and spring systems of aerospace relays. However, there was not any research on the position of the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod.</b> An analytical method for the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is presented in this paper.

40|$|A side-slide {{actuator}} and a corrugated diaphragm actuator will {{be analyzed}} and optimized this summer. Coupled electrostatic and fluid analyses {{will also be}} initiated. Both the side-slide actuator and the corrugated diaphragm actuator {{will be used to}} regulate the flow of fuel in a jet engine. Many of the side-slide actuators will be placed on top of a fuel injector that is still in the developmental stage as well. The corrugated diaphragm actuator will also be used to regulate the flow of fuel in fuel injectors. A comparative analysis of the performance matrix of both actuators will be conducted. The side-slide actuator uses the concept of mechanical advantage to regulate the flow of fuel using electrostatic forces. It is made from Nickel, Silicon Carbide, and thin layers of Oxide. The slider will have a hole in the middle that will allow fuel to pass through the hole underneath it. The goal is to regulate the flow of fuel through the inlet. This means that the actuator needs to be designed so that when a voltage is applied to the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> the slider will deflect in the x-direction and be able to completely block the inlet and no fuel can pass through. Different voltage levels will be tested. The parameters that are being optimized are the thickness of the diaphragm, what kind of corrugation the diaphragm should have, the length, width, and thickness of the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> and what design should be used to return the slider. The current possibilities for a return rod are a built in spring on the slider, a return rod that acts like a spring, or a return rod that is identical to the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The final actuator design should have a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> that has rotational motion and no translation motion, a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> thickness that prevents warping due to the slider, and a large ratio of the displacement {{on the bottom of the}} <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> to displacement on the top of the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The corrugated diaphragm actuator was optimized last winter and this summer will be spent completing the optimization of the coupled electrostatic and fluid flow parameters. It was found that Nickel is the best material to use for the diaphragm because it has a higher yield strength and allows for a larger stress, deflection and applied pressure. The parameters that were optimized were the wavelength and thickness of the diaphragm...|$|R

25|$|Unfortunately, {{when the}} gear was fitted to types {{such as the}} Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun {{in front of the}} cockpit, the long <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> linking the gear to the gun had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to {{twisting}} and deformation (not to mention expansion and contraction due to temperature changes). For this reason the B.E.12 and the R.E.8, not to mention Vickers' own FB 19, mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> could be linked directly to the gun.|$|R

This engine utilizes an old-school <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> valve system to ensure long-distance engine endurance, eliminating risks of timing chain failure due to the piling heat during a long-distance travel. Yet, the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> design is a compromise to its top speed, allowing it to settle {{to a maximum of}} 120 km/h speed capability.
