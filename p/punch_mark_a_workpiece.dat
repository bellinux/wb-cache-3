50|$|The stupa {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the eight stupas which contain corporeal remains of Buddha. Excavation of this site was done by K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute 1957-58. Originally it was mud stupa, smaller in dimension, erected by Lichhavis over their share of relic of Buddha in circa 5th century B.C. Ayakas noticed that southern and eastern sides are probably the earliest example of its kind. A soap stone casket found in the core of stupa contains ashy earth, a small conch, two glass beads, a small piece of gold leaf and <b>a</b> chopper <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> on <b>a</b> coin. In Maurya, Shunga and Kushan period the stupa got its enlargement and diameter of stupa was increased by 17.1 meter.|$|R
50|$|Nathaniel Mills the Elder (1746-1843) was {{a partner}} in Mills & Langston, Northwood Jewellers when he {{registered}} his first mark in 1803. In 1825, he registered his well-known now <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> 'N.M' within <b>a</b> rectangle at the Birmingham Assay Office and concentrated on working with silver on his own. Mills contributed to popularization of the so-called castle-top silver vinaigrettes and visiting card cases engraved with British landmarks and sold as souvenirs to tourists; {{he became one of}} the most prolific Birmingham box makers at the time introducing different designs.|$|R
40|$|Laser <b>marking</b> {{produces}} <b>an</b> indelible <b>mark</b> on <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> by {{the energy}} of a laser beam, mostly {{for the purposes of}} product identification and traceability. Being a fast, flexible and clean method, it is superior to other techniques such as ink-marking, mechanical engraving and electro-chemical methods. Workpieces made from metal, plastics and ceramics as well as coated materials and even the smallest electronic components can be marked quickly, efficiently and consistently. In the current study, laser marking is applied with the laser source of a standard RP/RM machine, i. e. a selective laser melting machine. This makes laser marking especially suited for marking parts produced by laser RP/RM techniques. However, there are various process parameters influencing the mark readability, mark contrast and profile. This research enlightens the influences of three main parameters, namely scan speed, laser power and pulse frequency of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Single-factor experimental strategy is applied for marks on grinded AISI 1085 steel workpieces. The physical phenomena causing different profiles at various parameter combinations are discussed including recoil pressure, oxidation and thermal gradients which are present in the melt pool. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|These copper coins of Ramgupta {{are like}} the Naga coins and the coins {{of some of the}} local rulers of the Pre-gupta period. The coins bearing the legend Ramgupta were not issued by a local officer of the {{imperial}} Guptas, nor of any feudal king of the same name. This king Ramgupta was the elder brother of Chandragupta II vikrmaadiya. Coins of Gwalior and Bhopal state have also been found in the excavations. Recently Dr. Mohan Lal Chadhar acquired 460 <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coins in <b>a</b> small earthen pot. These coins are made of silver, copper, tin and bronze alloy metal and are approximately 2300 years old (i.e. 3rd century BC). These coins contain elephant, Sun, Sadara Cakra, Taurine, Tortoise, point in circle, Tree on platform, swastika, ox, hill, fish, Twin snake, Vajra and Ujjain symbol. On these coins the obverse side mainly consists of five signs and the reverse side one or two signs. The most common symbol on reverse is Swastika. Sun, sadara cakra, Fish symbols are displayed on obverse side. Three of the coins having holes were probably used as necklace or ornaments. These symbols prove originality of the coins.|$|R
