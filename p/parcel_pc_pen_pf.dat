40|$|The {{visualization}} {{and analysis}} of the social networks emerging between meeting participants could improve the communication effectiveness and satisfaction. However, accurate data collection is difficult, as it requires tracking all verbal exchanges with their direction, source and addresse(s). The analysis of this data is usually post hoc, after the meeting ends. Virtual Meeting Analyzer is a web application developed to solve these limits when tracking social network relations in small meetings. By using a simple interface, and a tablet <b>PC</b> <b>pen</b> as input modality, users without any specific skill in Social Network Analysis or informatics can extract indices on the spot. The application is divided into four modules: meeting creation, configuration, recording, and analysis (either during the meeting or afterwards).

40|$|A {{transparent}} polymer based {{solar cell}} {{was designed and}} fabricated to utilize the solar energy when exposed to sunlight. The transparent solar cell for window module was composed of a polymeric material PPV (Polyphenylene vinylene), ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and electrode (Al, Mg, Ca). The polymeric sheet of this cell is by casting process, and elec-trode is applied on it by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process. The solar energy collected by this window {{can be used to}} power up small household electrical appliances. Recently, polymeric solar cell is made by a roll-to-roll process without using indium-tin oxide (ITO). A commercially available kapton (Polyimide) foil with an over layer of copper was used as the substrate. Sputtering of titanium metal on to the kapton/copper in a vacuum metalizing process gave the monolithic substrate and back electrode for the devices.

40|$|International audienceOnline {{handwritten}} data, {{produced with}} Tablet <b>PCs</b> or digital <b>pens,</b> consists {{in a sequence}} of points (x, y). As the amount of data available in this form increases, algorithms for retrieval of online data are needed. Word spotting is a common approach used for the retrieval of handwriting. However, from an information retrieval (IR) perspective, word spotting is a primitive keyword based matching and retrieval strategy. We propose a framework for handwriting retrieval where an arbitrary word spotting method is used, and then a manifold ranking algorithm is applied on the initial retrieval scores. Experimental results on a database of more than 2, 000 handwritten newswires show that our method can improve the performances of a state-of-the-art word spotting system by more than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Fitts' law {{has been}} applied in many studies to {{evaluate}} pointing tasks. However, the quantitative effect of using color in the interfaces has not been discussed in the literature. This paper introduces research {{on the effects of}} color in pointing tasks using Fitts' law as the evaluation method. Different colors and color presentation styles are applied in the experiments which are similar in design to the paradigmatic Fitts' law pointing task. The experimental results show that when the subjects use a mouse as the input device, there is no significant difference between an interface with a colored target and one with a white target in the mean performance time. The results also reveal that color presentation styles will offer no significant difference to pointing tasks when the mouse is applied. However, when the interface of tablet <b>PC</b> and <b>pen</b> was applied, subjects without much experience in tablet personal computer usage needed more time to perform the task with colored targets than with a white target. Furthermore, when the colors are changed randomly during the selection process, the difference is even more obvious. These results are confirmed by a Checking Experiment and a Learning Effect Experiment which we performed on different groups of subjects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing student {{architectural}} design project that is investigating the differing effects {{of the use of}} <b>PC's</b> or <b>Pens</b> in the design process. We are interested to see whether designing wholly on the computer with a volume modelling software would produce differing results to a traditional design process with a strong basis in 2 D sketching. To minimize the influence of the participants previous experience in either the use of PCis or the pen, we have been working with very young students that have not yet gone through a traditional training on architectural design and CAAD software. This {{is one of the key}} aspects of our experimental procedure. We have found that recent software developments in the field of CAAD clearly have and will influence the way architects design and brings the computer as a design tool to the “normal architect”. Until very recently the computer was seen as a design tool almost solely for “computer geeks” in the profession, the majority of architects still using it mainly as a drafting machine or to produce visualizations of their projects after a more “conventional” design process had finished. It is now very clear to us that the ongoing change in technology will have a profound effect on the way all of us will work in future undertaking architectural design. It is an important question for every school of architecture what effect these developments will have on our teaching methods and the curricula.   We use the above mentioned ongoing educational project to find out about the benefits and risks of using the computer as a design tool for first year students...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{evidence for}} stratospheric mass transport into, and mass remaining in, the troposphere during an intense midlatitude cyclone. Mesoscale forecast model analysis fields from the Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System were matched with total ozone observations from the Total Ozone Measurement Spectrometer. Combined with parcel back trajectory calculations, the analyses imply that two mechanisms {{contributed to the}} mass exchange: (1) An area of dynamically induced exchange was observed on the cyclone's southern edge. Parcels originally in the stratosphere crossed the jet core and were diluted through turbulent mixing with tropospheric air; (2) Diabetic effects reduced <b>parcel</b> potential vorticity (<b>PC)</b> for trajectories traversing precipitation regions, creating a 'PV hole' signature {{in the center of}} the cyclone. Air with characteristics of ozone and water vapor found in the lower stratosphere remained in the troposphere. The strength of the latter process may be unusual. Combined with other research, these results suggest that precipitation-induced diabetic effects can significantly modify (either decreasing or increasing) parcel potential vorticity, depending on parcel trajectory configuration with respect to maximum heating regions and jet core. The diabetic heating effect on stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) is more important to tropopause erosion than to altering parcel trajectories. In addition, these results underline the importance of using not only PC but also chemical constituents for diagnoses of STE...|$|R
40|$|Lecturers using tablet <b>PCs</b> with {{specialised}} <b>pens</b> can utilise real-time {{changes in}} lecture delivery via digital inking. We investigated student perceptions and lecturer experiences of tablet PC lectures in large-enrolment biomedicine subjects. Lecturers used PowerPoint or Classroom Presenter software for lecture preparation and in-lecture pen-based inking. Using surveys and lecturer interviews, students and lecturers {{were asked to}} reflect on their tablet PC lectures in comparison to non-tablet lectures that used prepared images and a laser pointer. Quantitative survey responses suggested that students felt that the tablet lectures were more interesting, that they were more capable of keeping up with the lecturer, and they enhanced their understanding of the lecture content. Qualitative analysis of written comments indicated that students appreciated the real-time writing and drawings, particularly because these were visible on lecture recordings. When reflecting on their non-tablet lectures, most lecturers used the pen-based writing, drawing and highlighting tablet functions and reduced lecture pace and content for their tablet lectures. Long-term tablet use led to lecturers making more use of digital inking, with less use of prepared images. Our results support the idea that tablet PC-supported lectures are conducive to improved management of cognitive load via reduced lecture pace and content...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{for this}} study was to {{investigate}} if it is less stressful for cow and calves in loose housing systems when separation is made so they can see and touch each other (Physical Contact-PC) instead of just hearing each other (Hearing Contact-HC). The behavior of eight cow- calf pairs (n= 4 pairs per treatment) on an ecological dairy farm with cubicle housing were studied for four hours directly after separation and four hours the day after separation. The first four cows that gave birth were used for treatment PC, and the following four cows that gave birth were used for treatment HC. The only selection criteria used was that both cow and calf were healthy. Separation took place 3 - 4 days after birth and the calves were put separately in two different pens while the mothers were let loose into the cubicle system. For treatment <b>PC</b> the <b>pen</b> was placed in the middle of the cubicle system, and it had two walls and two gates where the cows and calves could touch and see each other but it did not give the calf opportunity to suckle the cow. For treatment HC the pen was next to the original birthplace, and from here the cows were taken into the cubicle system while the calves were moved to the adjacent pen. The animals and their behavior were observed during hours 0 - 4 (day 0) and hours 24 - 28 (day 1) after separation. The results were analyzed with SAS. The results show that the calves in both PC and HC performed more high pitched vocalization on day 1, the calves in PC vocalized more with high pitched both day 0 and day 1 compared to the calves in HC. The cows in PC used less high pitched vocalization day 1 than HC. The cows in HC moved around more, the calves licked more on the surroundings than the calves in PC. The calves in HC lay down relaxed more, and both calves and cows stood more relaxed, showed fewer signs on direct separation anxiety and the calves licked less on themselves. ...|$|R

It was a comparative study with 10 distance learning lecturers, (hereafter referred to as tutors) marking up to a maximum of 600 students' electronic assignments over, two nine month presentations of the UK Open University (OU) course, T 175 Networked Living. Assignments were submitted by students over the internet to a centralised web depository called the electronic tutor marked system (eTMA) at the OU, in Microsoft Word. Tutors downloaded these assignments onto their own computers and in this study; half of the assignments were marked and edited using a Personal Computer (PC) with conventional keyboard input, using word processing software. The other half of the assignments were marked using a Tablet PC in which it is possible to create a layer over, the Microsoft Word submission and then write directly onto the screen of the Tablet <b>PC</b> using a <b>pen,</b> as if writing on paper. The hand-written feedback was saved or converted to typed text and then saved.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study compared eight non-keyboard input devices in conjunction with a standing fatigue study. The rapid growth in the use of graphical user interfaces (GUI's) has caused an increase in the use of nonkeyboard input devices. Further, the limited amount of literature available on non-keyboard input devices, especially studying standing input device usage, has caused concern about the increased usage. Eight subjects (4 male and 4 female) used each of the eight input devices (IBM Options mouse, Logitech Sensa mouse, Microsoft mouse 2. 0, Logitech Trackman trackball, MicroSpeed trackball, Logitech Portable trackball, Glidepoint touch pad, and <b>PC</b> Stylus mouse <b>pen)</b> for two hours on each of two consecutive days. This study used physiological, performance, and subjective measures to determine differences between the input devices. The physiological measures used included the following: finger tip temperature, hand temperature, forearm temperature, arm volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, median nerve conduction velocity, and finger tip vibration sensitivity. The performance measure used was a simple tracking test with three different target presentation speeds, Subjective measures included perceived levels of pain and discomfort (body part discomfort survey), a specific input device features survey and an overall ranking. The following measures showed statistical significance for individual input devices: arm volume, all three presentation speed tracking performance tests, the input device features survey, and overall ranking. Further analysis showed significance for input device types (mice, trackballs, and 'others') for all of these measures except arm volume. The other measures taken during the experiment (arm, hand, and finger temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, vibration sensitivity, nerve conduction time, and body part discomfort), while not showing strict statistical significance for the different devices, all indicated trends away from zero and may be indicators of work load or fatigue. Throughout the experiment, mice were shown to be superior to the other input devices in both performance and preference. There was, however, no one mouse clearly better than the rest. The best trackball was the Logitech Trackman, with performance and preference ratings often not significantly different from the mice...|$|R
