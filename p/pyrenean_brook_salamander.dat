50|$|<b>Pyrenean</b> <b>Brook</b> <b>Salamander</b> {{used to be}} {{included}} in this genus as Euproctus asper, but was moved to Calotriton in 2005. Its superficial similarity with Euproctus likely represents convergent evolution: strongly depressed head and body, and reduction or even absence of lungs, are adaptations to fast-running, well-oxygenated mountain streams.|$|E
40|$|Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) {{telemetry}} {{has recently}} been adapted for locating PIT-tagged fish in shallow waters using portable detectors. In the present study, we tested this method for adult amphibians (<b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Calotriton asper) PIT-tagged with 12 -mm transponders in a headwater rocky stream. PIT telemetry performances were compared with a conventional hand-capture method, i. e. visual searching and overturning movable stones in the streambed. The mean efficiency of the portable detector (88. 2 % ± 5. 2, s. e.) {{was significantly higher than}} hand-capture (51. 1 % ± 6. 4) and the operator progressed, on average, four times faster. Time efficiencies were, on average, 0. 92 (± 0. 15) and 0. 12 (± 0. 04) adult salamanders per minute with the portable detector and by hand-capture, respectively. The efficiency of the portable detector was negatively correlated with the percentage of large stones on the streambed. The time needed to prospect a section was positively correlated with the abundance of PIT-tagged adult salamanders, spring inlets and undercut banks. Because PIT telemetry is less disruptive than hand-capture for both salamanders and their habitat, it is a promising and non-disruptive method for developing studies on the ecology and management of amphibians in shallow waters...|$|R

50|$|Among the amphibians, the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> (Euproctus asper) is {{significant}} but {{not easy to}} spot.

It's necessary to be aware of vipera aspis (Vipera aspis), a viper with a poisonous bite, but it does not usually attack without provocation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> or Pyrenean newt (tritó pirinenc; uhandre piriniarra; tritón pirenaico), Calotriton asper, is {{a largely}} aquatic species of salamander {{in the family}} Salamandridae.

50|$|The Montseny brook newt (tritó del Montseny), Calotriton arnoldi, is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the family Salamandridae. It is endemic to the Montseny Massif (Catalan Pre-Coastal Range) in northeast Spain.

50|$|Pseudoeurycea unguidentis is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to northern Oaxaca, Mexico, where it is known from its type locality, Cerro San Felipe, and some other mountains, although the identity of animals from these other locations is uncertain.

50|$|Pseudoeurycea mystax is {{a species}} of {{salamander}} in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Mexico and only known from the area of its type locality near Ayutla, Oaxaca. Its common name is mustache false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> or mustached false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander.</b> The specific name refers to the whitish protuberances on the lips that resemble a mustache in the frontal view of the male holotype.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{infrequently}} seen, {{though it}} is active by day, {{as well as by}} night. It is mostly aquatic in summer. It feeds on insects and other slow-moving invertebrate prey, and is itself eaten by trout, so it is often scarce in locations in which they are abundant. It is sensitive to pesticides in the water which are absorbed through the skin and accumulate in the tissues.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{endemic to}} the Pyrenees and {{surrounding}} mountains and is found at altitudes ranging from 700 to 2500 m. It is a mostly aquatic species usually frequenting slow-moving streams and shallow mountain lakes. It favours water below 15 °C (59 °F) with scarce vegetation on rocky or pebbly bottoms. Some Pyrenean brook salamanders live entirely inside caves where they breed {{over a long}} period of the year due to lack of day length stimulus.|$|E
50|$|The Pyrenean frog is {{endemic to}} the Pyrenees with most populations {{being on the}} Spanish slopes at altitudes between about 1000 and 1800 m. Its range extends from the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park to the Roncal Valley in the Navarre region. It is also present in limited numbers on the French side of the mountains. It is found in and around fast-moving, rocky streams with little vegetation, sharing this habitat with the <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> (Calotriton asper). It avoids still water ponds and lakes.|$|E

50|$|The {{forests of}} the Néouvielle massif are {{arranged}} in thickets of (mountain pine), the remaining space consists of rhododendrons and lawn. At {{the heart of the}} reserve, mountain pine reaches a European record-breaking 2600 m high. The reserves flora is lush, with 1,250 vascular plants, some of which also reach record-breaking heights, like the foxglove at 1800 m.The vegetation hosts a wide array of fauna with many emblematic breeds like the alpine marmot, the heather cock, the red crossbill, the golden eagle, the griffon, the egyptian vulture, le red kite, the bearded vulture as well as endemical animals: Pyrenean desman, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> and isard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> {{grows to}} about 16 cm in length, {{half of which}} is the {{laterally}} flattened tail. The females are usually larger than the males. The body is sturdy with a flattened head and small eyes, and the limbs are short. There are no parotoid glands and the skin is covered with small, rough tubercles. The colour is very variable, the upper side usually being some shade of olive, grey, charcoal, or muddy brown, sometimes mottled with ochre, with an intermittent yellowish stripe down the spine. The underside has a row of dark splotches at either side and the centre is red, orange, or yellow. The male has a rounded cloacal swelling while the female has a conical one.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> {{sometimes}} aestivates in {{hot weather}} in the lower parts of its range. It hibernates in winter on land at higher altitudes, emerging in the spring. During courtship, the male displays his brightly coloured underparts before grasping the female around the loins with his tail and transferring one to four spermatophores directly into her cloaca {{in a process that}} lasts several hours. The female lays 20 to 40 eggs {{over the course of a}} few weeks, sticking them to rocks or inside crevices with her extensible cloaca. The eggs hatch after about six weeks; the larvae have external gills and are entirely carnivorous. They may overwinter one or more times before metamorphosis and become mature in two or more years, depending on altitude, with the females taking longer. The juvenile newts are a dark colour with a thin, yellow line along the spine.|$|E

50|$|The {{mountain}} regions have peculiar fauna {{relatively little}} influenced by human activities.The northernmost are the Scandinavian mountains. Pyrenees present many instances of endemism. The Pyrenean desman is {{found only in}} some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains, <b>Pyrenean</b> <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among the other peculiarities of the Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Ariège (Anophthalmus, Adelops). The Pyrenean ibex mysteriously became extinct in 2000; the native Pyrenean brown bear was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s but was re-introduced in 1996. Some common animals of the Alps are Alpine ibex, Alpine marmot, Tengmalm's owl and ptarmigan. The Apennine Mountains provide habitat to Marsican brown bear and the Italian wolf. The Carpathian Mountains are a range of mountains forming an arc of roughly 1,500 km across Central and Eastern Europe and are inhabited by the largest populations in Europe of brown bears, wolves and lynxes, as well as chamois and other animals.|$|E

It leaves the commune 200 metres upstream of the Mazzola bridge on the D218 road. The Viru, the main tributary of the commune, is fed by several streams such as that of Paglia Orba and Foggiale bordered in part by the GR 20. At the bottom of the creek beds, there are native species: the Tyrrhenian painted frogs (a bariulata) - toads living up to 1900 m and Corsican <b>brook</b> <b>salamanders</b> (a Tarantella).

50|$|The dwarf false <b>brook</b> <b>salamander</b> {{has been}} little studied but the female is {{believed}} to lay several eggs in a concealed site {{at the beginning of}} the dry season.
