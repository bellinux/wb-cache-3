30|$|Previous {{research}} on emotion {{has focused on}} the negative valences, including hostility, from a functional cerebral systems perspective to determine neuropsychological evidence of laterality effects and of regulatory control mechanisms. Shapiro et al. [76] used single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to measure cerebral blood flow following administration of a stressor (mental arithmetic) to hostile men. These researchers demonstrated that the stressor decreased <b>prefrontal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the left frontal-temporal regions in the high hostile group. The high hostile group also showed marginal increases in heart rate during the stressor. The authors did not appreciate the relative right cerebral deactivation associated with increased heart rate. Shapiro et al. [76] conclude that the prefrontal regions may regulate cardiac changes. Moreover, hostility may exacerbate these conditions with characteristic features of deregulation and reactivity to stress.|$|E
40|$|Background: Symptoms in {{schizophrenia}} cluster into syndromes, each {{of which}} may be associated with a particular pattern of cerebral blood flow. We sought to investigate whether these syndromes are also related to neuroanatomical changes. Method: A semi-automated method was used to examine structural magnetic resonance images in 12 patients with schizophrenia. The relationship between the relative regional grey matter volume and ratings of the syndromes of psychomotor poverty, disorganization and reality distortion was investigated. Results: There was a significant negative correlation between psychomotor poverty score and the relative volume of the left ventro- medial prefrontal grey matter, and a significant positive correlation between disorganization and the relative volumes of the hippocampus, and the parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus bilaterally. Conclusion: The correlation between psychomotor poverty and left prefrontal grey matter volume resembles that previously seen with <b>prefrontal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the same patients, suggesting that this functional abnormality is related to an underlying anatomical change. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examined}} 46 nondemented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients {{by means of}} perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neuropsychological testing. The aim was to detect correlations of regional cerebral blood flow with episodic memory performance, using an operator-independent technique {{for the analysis of}} SPECT data. A significant positive correlation was found between <b>prefrontal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and episodic memory performances. However, age was the most important determinant of memory scores. Age also correlated significantly negatively with prefrontal perfusion. Our methodology also allowed detection of an inverse correlation of left medial temporal lobe perfusion with the memory score. This had not been found in previous studies and might indicate compensatory mechanisms in the brain of PD patients. It is concluded that episodic memory in nondemented PD patients is most dependent on the effects of aging and that the aging effects on cerebral perfusion in the PD brain parallel to a large extent the findings in normal controls. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{was used to}} examine two questions: (i) which structures of the intact human brain change their activity with the direction of attention to left or right visual field; and (ii) how does activity in these structures, and in parietal cortex in particular, depend on the frequency of attentional shifts? Subjects were required to discriminate the orientation of peripheral gratings. The two main experimental variables were the attended hemifield (left or right) and the proportion of trials requiring a shift within that hemifield (20 % or 80 %). A detection control condition was also included. Behaviourally, subjects were less accurate and significantly slower when a trial required a shift than when it did not. Ventral and lateral occipital areas showed significantly higher <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> levels contralateral to the direction of attention. Replicating previous work, there was also a significant main effect of the direction of attention in left lateral <b>prefrontal</b> cortex: <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> levels were higher during leftward attention in comparison both to baseline and to rightward attention. This left frontal effect reached significance in single subjects in whom several activation sites could be distinguished within left middle and inferior frontal gyrus. Right and left parietal cortex were activated during both left- and right-field attention conditions, with a tendency for higher activity levels when attention was directed contralaterally. Contrary to the experimental hypothesis, however, parietal regions were not activated differentially by high versus low numbers of attentional shifts. The current experiment confirms that left frontal convexity is sensitive to manipulations of the direction of visuospatial attention. The results do not indicate a specific role of parietal cortex in attentional shifting. status: publishe...|$|R

The review had a specific focus on neuroimaging findings associated with acute and chronic use of the drug and covers litera-ture published up until May 2012. Seventeen studies were identified, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria; three studies investigated acute effects of cannabis (1 fMRI, 2 PET), while six studies investigated non-acute functional effects (4 fMRI, 2 PET), and four studies investigated structural alterations. Functional imaging studies of impulsivity studies suggest that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is lower in chronic cannabis users than in controls. Studies of acute administration of THC or marijuana report increased brain metabolism in several brain regions during impulsivity tasks. Structural imaging studies of cannabis users found differences in reduced prefrontal volumes and white matter integrity that might mediate the abnormal impulsivity and mood observed in marijuana users. To address the question whether im-pulsivity as a trait precedes cannabis consumption or whether cannabis aggravates impulsivity and discontinuation of usage more longi-tudinal study designs are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Background We {{conducted}} a systematic review {{to assess the}} evidence for specific effects of cannabis on brain structure and function. The review focuses on the cognitive changes associated with acute and chronic use of the drug. Method We reviewed literature reporting neuroimaging studies of chronic or acute cannabis use published up until January 2009. The search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and PsycLIT indexing services using the following key words: cannabis, marijuana, delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, cannabidiol, CBD, neuroimaging, brain imaging, computerized tomography, CT, magnetic resonance, MRI, single photon emission tomography, SPECT, functional magnetic resonance, fMRI, positron emission tomography, PET, diffusion tensor MRI, DTI-MRI, MRS and spectroscopy. Results Sixty-six studies were identified, of which 41 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three were functional (SPECT/PET/fMRI) and eight structural (volumetric/DTI) imaging studies. The high degree of heterogeneity across studies precluded a meta-analysis. The functional studies suggest that resting global and <b>prefrontal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> are lower in cannabis users than in controls. The results from the activation studies using a cognitive task are inconsistent because of the heterogeneity of the methods used. Studies of acute administration of THC or marijuana report increased resting activity and activation of the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex during cognitive tasks. Only three of the structural imaging studies found differences between users and controls. Conclusions Functional neuroimaging studies suggest a modulation of global and prefrontal metabolism both during the resting state and after the administration of THC/marijuana cigarettes.

METHODS: Retrobulbar <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocities and finger nailfold capillary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocities were assessed in 15 hypercholesterolemic subjects and in 15 age-matched and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In addition, the change in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocities after a 3 -month period of lipid-lowering therapy was evaluated. RESULTS: No alterations in retrobulbar <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocities after lipid-lowering therapy could be observed in hypercholesterolemic patients.

BackgroundAn array of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents {{have the potential}} to control intrarenal circulation; however, their relative functional importance is unclear. We compared here the importance of nitric oxide and renal nerves in studies involving sequential blockade of nitric oxide synthesis and renal denervation. MethodsIn anesthetized rats, N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) was used for nonselective inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis and 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI) for inactivation of neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Acute unilateral renal denervation was performed noninvasively enabling observation of rapid changes. Renal cortical and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was determined by laser Doppler flowmetry. ResultsL-NAME decreased medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> by 22 % to 24 %, whereas after 7 -NI, medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> decreased by 22 % and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> about 10 % (all changes significant). In untreated rats denervation significantly increased cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (10 % to 15 %) but not medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> In rats treated with L-NAME denervation partly prevented the post-inhibitor decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> but not in medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> After 7 -NI treatment, the decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> did not occur or a partial restoration of flow was seen. The denervation natriuresis was intact under L-NAME but attenuated following 7 -NI. ConclusionA reduction of medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after 7 -NI, similar as after L-NAME, suggests that nitric oxide generated by nNOS is mainly responsible for adequate perfusion of the medulla whereas activity of nNOS and other isoform(s) is required to maintain cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Renal denervation partly restored cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduced by nitric oxide blockade.

We also analyzed the three-dimensional morphology of the skin surface (sWa, sWp, sWt, sWq) in replicas obtained from foreheads, cheeks, and other sites {{on the faces of}} those subjects. In addition, we measured the skin elasticity and water content of the stratum comeurn on the cheeks of those women. No correlation was observed between the parameters of the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the surface morphology of the forehead. On the cheek, however, significant negative correlations were observed between those parameters. Among the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> parameters, the resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during cooling showed particularly high correlations. Concerning the surface morphology parameters, high correlations were observed in parameters related to local changes uch as sWp and sWt. None of the cutaneous properties examined (including the skin elasticity and water content of the stratum corneum) correlated with the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> or the surface morphology parameters of the cheek. Facial wrinkles are classified into linear grooves, which develop {{at the corner of the}} eye and on the forehead, and glyphic wrinkles, which develop as deep grooves in areas such as the cheek. These results suggest hat a reduction in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is one of the putative causes of local irregularities observed in the cheek, that is, the glyphic wrinkles, of elderly women...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{regarding the}} effect of nicotine and cigarette smoke on gastric <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is conflicting. The hydrogen gas clearance technique {{was used to measure}} the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke on basal gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in anesthetized rats. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured before, during, and after treatment with either intravenous nicotine (4 or 40 μg/kg/min) or inhaled cigarette smoke (nicotine or nicotine free). Neither intravenous nicotine nor cigarette smoke significantly altered gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> On the other hand, hypotension produced by hemorrhage significantly decreased mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (P < 0. 05). Thus the technique used could detect a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> These findings indicate that in the anesthetized rats, hypotension but not intravenous nicotine or cigarette smoke, in the doses given, reduce gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives and Methods] Impaired <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of {{the upper}} end of the gastric tube is one of the major causes of anastomotic leak {{following}} esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer. We applied an additional microvascular anastomosis procedure-the supercharging technique-to improve <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> We investigated <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> improvement in 15 patients who underwent the supercharging technique after total excision of the thoracic esophagus and gastric tube reconstruction through the posterior mediastinal route from August 2003 to March 2005. [ResultsTissue] <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry during surgery and was improved after microvascular anastomosis. Patency and <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of anastomosed arteries were evaluated with computed tomography and ultrasonography, respectively. Patency and stable <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of anastomosed arteries were confirmed more than 1 month after surgery. Therefore, microvascular anastomosis improved the tissue <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{of the upper}} end of the gastric tube. Long-term <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> improvement was confirmed, which suggests that microvascular anastomosis contributes to reducing the risk of anastomotic leak...|$|R

The percentage of the injected SI'KI>taken up per g of tumor tissue and the '"ø clearance rate were used as parameters for <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> The results achieved with these two methods were consistent. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> differed significantly among individual tumors of the same line, even for tumors of similar size. All lines showed a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> with increasing tumor volume. This was due {{to an increase in}} necrotic fraction as well as a decrease in blood supply per viable tumor cell. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> also differed significantly among the xenograft lines. All lines showed a lower <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> than the kidney, spleen, liver, and foot. The <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was generally lower in the xenograft lines than in the EMT...|$|R

This cross-sectional study performed on 70 normal patients. Color Doppler sonography (CDS) and spectral Doppler sonography (SDS) of right and left VAs (RVA and LVA), right and left CCAs (RCCA and LCCA), right and left ICAs (RICA and LICA), were performed. The mean PSV, EDV, and RI values of RVA <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> were as 41. 60 ± 9. 6 cm/s, 14. 60 ± 3. 7 cm/s and 0. 65 ± 0. 06, and the mean PSV, EDV and RI values of LVA <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> were as 42. 20 ± 10. 2 cm/s, 15. 20 ± 4. 2 cm/s, and 0. 64 ± 0. 05, respectively.

40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> to each uterine horn of cows {{during the}} oestrous cycle and early {{pregnancy}} was determined daily {{by use of}} electromagnetic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> probes placed around both middle uterine arteries. The pattern of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to uteri of pregnant and non-pregnant cows was similar until Day 14 after mating or oestrus. Between Days 14 and 18 of pregnancy <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the uterine horn containing the conceptus increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) 2 - to 3 -fold, whereas <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the non-gravid uterine horn in these cows remained constant. No corresponding increase in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary bearing the CL was observed in non-pregnant cows during this 4 -day period. By Day 19 of pregnancy, <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the gravid uterine horn had returned to a level similar to that observed on Day 13. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> to both uterine horns of pregnant cows remained constant from Days 19 to 25 and then increased to the gravid horn (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) markedly until Day 30 whereas <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the non-gravid horn remained low. Uterine <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during the oestrous cycle of non-pregnant cows was positively correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with systemic concentrations of oestradiol and the ratio of oestradiol (pg/ml) to progesterone (ng/ml).

40|$|Regional {{cerebral}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (rCBF) {{was measured}} with xenon-enhanced CT(Xe-CT) in 21 cases of intracranial tumors (13 meningiomas, 5 gliomas, 3 metastatic brain tumors). Peritumoral edema was graded as mild, moderate or severe based {{on the extent of}} edema on CT and MRI. According to intratumoral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution patterns, three patterns were classified as central type with relatively high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{at the center of the}} tumor, homogeneous type with an almost homegeneous <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution, and marginal type with relatively high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at the periphery of the tumor. High grade astrocytoma and metastatic brain tumor showed marginal type <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and moderate or severe edema except in one case. Five meningiomas with severe peritumoral edema revealed marginal type <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and four with mild peritumoral edema showed central type <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> except for one cace. No correlation was found between the extent of peritumoral edema and histological subtype, tumor size, locaton, duration of clinical history, vascularization on angiogram, and mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the tumor. These results suggest that <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution patterns within the tumor may affect the extension of peritumoral edema. Pre-and postoperative rCBFs were evaluated with Xe-CT and IMP-SPECT in 7 cases. mean rCBF of peritumoral edema was 6. 2 ml/ 100 g/min preoperatively, and discrepancy between rCBF on Xe-CT and that on IMP-SPECT was shown in the remote cortical region ipsilateral to the tumor.
