Although hybrid sterility occurs almost universally among animal and plant species, most of our current knowledge comes from the classical genetic studies on Drosophila interspecific crosses or introgressions. With the house mouse subspecies Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus as a model, new research tools have become available for studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic networks underlying HS. Here we used QTL analysis and intersubspecific chromosome substitution strains to identify a 4. 7 Mb critical region on Chromosome X (Chr X) harboring the Hstx 2 HS locus, which causes asymmetrical spermatogenic arrest in reciprocal intersubspecific F 1 hybrids. Subsequently, we mapped autosomal loci on Chrs 3, 9 and 13 that can abolish this asymmetry. Combination of immunofluorescent visualization of the proteins of synaptonemal complexes with whole-chromosome DNA FISH on pachytene spreads revealed that heterosubspecific, unlike consubspecific, homologous chromosomes are predisposed to asynapsis in F 1 hybrid male and female meiosis. The asynapsis is under the trans- control of Hstx 2 and Hst 1 /Prdm 9 hybrid sterility genes in <b>pachynemas</b> of male but not female hybrids. The finding concurred with the fertility of intersubpecific F 1 hybrid females homozygous for the Hstx 2 (Mmm) allele and resolved the apparent conflict with the dominance theory of Haldane's rule.

In mammals, spermatocytes that display recombination defects experience a so-called recombination-dependent arrest at the pachytene stage, which {{relies on the}} MRE 11 complex-ATM-CHK 2 pathway responding to unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we asked if p 53 family members-targets of ATM and CHK 2 -participate in this arrest. We bred double-mutant mice combining a mutation {{of a member of}} the p 53 family (p 53, TAp 63, or p 73) with a Trip 13 mutation.

The karyotype appears to be autotetraploid. This conclusion is also supported by presynaptic alignment of axial cores in groups of four and partner trades between pairs of SCs. Numerous early nodules are distributed all along axial cores and SCs during zygonema, but they are lost by late zygonema - early <b>pachynema.</b> Late (recombination) nodules (RNs) are present on SCs near kinetochores throughout the remainder of <b>pachynema.</b> This pattern of RNs corresponds to the pattern of pericentric chiasmata.

40|$|Meiosis is the {{biological}} process that, after {{a cycle of}} DNA replication, halves the cellular chromosome complement, leading {{to the formation of}} haploid gametes. Haploidization is achieved via two successive rounds of chromosome segregation, meiosis I and II. In mammals, during prophase of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes align and synapse through a recombination-mediated mechanism initiated by the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the SPO 11 protein. In male mice, if SPO 11 expression and DSB number are reduced below heterozygosity levels, chromosome synapsis is delayed, chromosome tangles form at <b>pachynema,</b> and defective cells are eliminated by apoptosis at epithelial stage IV at a spermatogenesis-specific endpoint. Whether DSB levels produced in Spo 11 (+/-) spermatocytes represent, or approximate, the threshold level required to guarantee successful homologous chromosome pairing is unknown. Using a mouse model that expresses Spo 11 from a bacterial artificial chromosome, within a Spo 11 (-/-) background, we demonstrate that when SPO 11 expression is reduced and DSBs at zygonema are decreased (approximately 40  % below wild-type level), meiotic chromosome pairing is normal. Conversely, DMC 1 foci number is increased at <b>pachynema,</b> suggesting that under these experimental conditions, DSBs are likely made with delayed kinetics at zygonema.

40|$|Gametogenesis is {{a sexually}} dimorphic process {{requiring}} profound differences in germ cell differentiation between the sexes.

Here, we investigate the function of DMRT 7, a mammal-specific protein related to the invertebrate sexual regulators Doublesex and MAB- 3. We find that DMRT 7 preferentially localizes to the XY body in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and is required for male meiosis.

40|$|Bloom’s {{syndrome}} (BS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of humans characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immunodeficiency, genomic instability, and a predisposition {{to a wide variety}} of neoplasms. The genomic instability is evidenced in BS somatic cells as a high incidence of gaps and breaks, chromatid exchanges, chromosome rearrangements, and locus-specific mutations. BS arises from a mutation in BLM, a gene encoding a protein with homology to the RecQ helicase family. Men with BS are sterile; women have reduced fertility and a shortened reproductive span. The current immunocytological study on mouse spermatocytes shows that the BLM protein is first evident as discrete foci along the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of homologously synapsed autosomal bivalents in late zygonema of meiotic prophase. BLM foci progressively dissociate from the synapsed autosomal axes during early <b>pachynema</b> and are no longer seen in mid-pachynema. BLM colocalizes with the single-stranded DNA binding replication protein A, which has been shown to be involved in meiotic synapsis. However, there is a temporal delay in the appearance of BLM protein along the SCs relative to replication protein A, suggesting that BLM is required for a late step in processing of a subset of genomic DNA involved in establishment of interhomologue interactions in early meiotic prophase.

To test whether these localization patterns reflect a function for Pol beta in recombination and/or synapsis, we used conditional gene targeting to delete the PolB gene from germ cells. We find that Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis and undergo apoptosis during Prophase I. We also find that SPO 11 -dependent gammaH 2 AX persists on meiotic chromatin, indicating that Pol beta is critical for the repair of SPO 11 -induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes yielded reduced steady-state levels of the SPO 11 -oligonucleotide complexes that are formed when SPO 11 {{is removed from the}} ends of DSBs, and cytological experiments revealed that chromosome-associated foci of replication protein A (RPA), RAD 51 and DMC 1 are less abundant in Pol beta-deficient spermatocyte nuclei. Localization of Pol beta to meiotic chromosomes requires the formation of SPO 11 -dependent DSBs. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Pol beta is required at a very early step in the processing of meiotic DSBs, at or before the removal of SPO 11 from DSB ends and the generation of the 3 ' single-stranded tails necessary for subsequent strand exchange. The chromosome synapsis defects and Prophase I apoptosis of Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are likely a direct consequence of these recombination defect...|$|E

40|$|Most {{mutations}} that compromise meiotic recombination or synapsis in mouse spermatocytes {{result in}} arrest and apoptosis at the pachytene {{stage of the}} first meiotic prophase. Two main mechanisms are thought to trigger arrest: one independent of the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination, and another activated by persistent recombination intermediates. Mechanisms underlying the recombination-dependent arrest response are not well understood, so we sought to identify factors involved by examining mutants deficient for TRIP 13, a conserved AAA+ ATPase required for the completion of meiotic DSB repair. We find that spermatocytes with a hypomorphic Trip 13 mutation (Trip 13 mod/mod) arrest with features characteristic of early <b>pachynema</b> in wild type, namely, fully synapsed chromosomes without incorporation of the histone variant H 1 t into chromatin. These cells then undergo apoptosis, possibly {{in response to the}} arrest or in response to a defect in sex body formation. However, TRIP 13 -deficient cells that additionally lack the DSB-responsive kinase ATM progress further, reaching an H 1 t-positive stage (i. e., similar to mid/late <b>pachynema</b> in wild type) despite the presence of unrepaired DSBs. TRIP 13 -deficient spermatocytes also progress to an H 1 t-positive stage if ATM activity is attenuated by hypomorphic mutations in Mre 11 or Nbs 1 or by elimination of the ATM-effector kinase CHK 2. These mutant backgrounds nonetheless experience an apoptotic block to further spermatogenic progression, most likely caused by failure to form a sex body. DSB numbers are elevated in Mre 11 and Nbs 1 hypomorphs but not Chk 2 mutants, thus delineating genetic requirements for the ATM-dependent negative feedback loop that regulates DSB numbers. The findings demonstrate {{for the first time that}} ATM-dependent signaling enforces the normal pachytene response to persistent recombination intermediates. Our work supports the conclusion that recombination defects trigger spermatocyte arrest via pathways than are genetically distinct from sex body failure-promoted apoptosis and confirm that the latter can function even when recombination-dependent arrest is inoperative. Implications of these findings for understanding the complex relationships between spermatocyte arrest and apoptosis are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian meiotic progression, like {{mitotic cell}} cycle progression, is {{regulated}} by cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). However, the unique requirements of meiosis (homologous synapsis, reciprocal recombination and the dual divisions that segregate first homologues, then sister chromatids) have led to different patterns of CDK expression. Here we show that Cdk 4 colocalizes with replication protein A (RPA) on the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of newly synapsed axes of homologously pairing bivalents, but disappears from these axes by mid-pachynema. The switch from the mitotic pattern of expression occurs {{during the last two}} spermatogonial divisions. Cdk 2 colocalizes with MLH 1, a mismatch repair protein at sites of reciprocal recombination in mid-late <b>pachynema.</b> In addition Cdk 2 localizes to the telomeres of chromosomal bivalents throughout meiotic prophase. The mitotic pattern of expression of Cdk 2 remains unchanged throughout the spermatogonial divisions, but is altered in meiosis of the spermatocyte...|$|E
40|$|Cytological {{study of}} meiotic {{chromosomes}} heterozygous for the T(I→II) 39311 translocation confirm genetic evidence (Perkins 1972) that {{a section of}} linkage group I including the mating type locus has been inserted into linkage group II. Pachytene chromosomes when fully paired show that a segment from chromosome 1 has been inserted into chromosome 6. When pairing fails between the translocated segment in 6 and its homologous region in chromosome 1, buckles or loops are formed at <b>pachynema</b> in the deletion or insertion areas of the bivalents. —Acentric fragments and anaphase bridges occur at both meiotic divisions and in the subsequent two mitotic divisions in the ascus. These provide supporting evidence that the translocated segment is inverted with respect to centromere in its new location. —Unexpectedly the acentric fragment, formed by crossing over in the inverted translocated segment, persists without degradation in a micronucleus, and it replicates and divides in synchrony with the centric chromosomes in adjacent nuclei...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the cytotoxic effect of effluents at inducing chromosomal aberrations, using this as a biomarker tool in wild Clarias <b>pachynema</b> for assessing and monitoring pollution of the aquatic environment. A total of 60 live fish (30 each downstream and upstream) were obtained and subjected to chromosomal analysis. Chromosomal aberration in the fish samples from the downstream sector was recorded at a rate of 30 %, while there were no aberrations in the samples collected upstream the effluent discharge point. Water sample analysis revealed a high concentration of Ammonia and Nitrates above permissible standards of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) guidelines. Heavy metal analysis also revealed the presence of Cr (0. 05), Cu (0. 01), Pb (0. 05), Zn (5. 0) and Fe (0. 3) above permissible standards from the downstream section of the river. This study shows clearly that the ever increasing discharge of effluents from the industry could increase chromosomal damage in the aquatic components...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosomes}} of {{specimens of}} Oryctes nasicornis from three locations in France and two locations in Greece were studied. All karyotypes have an X-Y-autosome translocation: 18, neoXY. Two male specimens from France (subspecies nasicornis) displayed an unusual behaviour of their meiotic chromosomes in 30 – 50 % of spermatocytes, with asynapsis at <b>pachynema,</b> premature bivalent and chromosome split at metaphases I and II. The karyotypes remained balanced at metaphase I, {{but not at}} metaphase II. These particularities mimic the meiotic behaviour of B chromosomes and question about their existence, reported earlier in Spanish specimens. Due to the variable character of B chromosomes, complementary analyses are needed. To our knowledge, such meiotic particularities have not been described, beside cases of infertility. In specimens from Corsica (subspecies laevigatus) and Greece (subspecies kuntzeni), all spermatocytes I and II had a normal appearance. The meiotic particularity may thus be limited to male specimens from subspecies nasicornis...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is based on the}} {{distribution}} and abundance of fresh and dry weights of seaweeds from the rocky ledge of Pacha. The study lasted for one year from April, 1993 to March, 1994. A total of 85 species of seaweeds were collected. The abundant seaweeds were: Codium iyengarii, Iyengaria stellata, Sargassum latifolium, S. binderi, S. boveanum, Enteromorpha procera, Padina pavonia, Gelidium usmanghani, Colpomenia sinuosa, Valoniopsis <b>pachynema,</b> Jania capillacea, Caulerpa racemosa and Hypnea musciformis. Their highest fresh (42230. 3 g/m 2) and dry weights (21313. 36 g/m 2) occurred in the low-tide zone. The latter zone supported the largest algal population. In winter maximum algal vegetation (58976. 5 g/m 2) was noted and the peak growth (21854. 1 g/m 2) of seaweeds was observed in January. The maximum biomass was contributed by brown seaweeds. The highest species diversity (2. 05) occurred in August, and the highest Shannon-Weiner (0. 46) and Evenness indices (0. 97) were noted in November...|$|E
