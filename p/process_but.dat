5|$|As the Martians ravage Las Vegas with Art Land, a Las Vegas developer, {{being among}} their victims, Byron Williams, a casino {{employee}} and former world champion boxer, leads {{a small group}} of survivors consisting of Barbara Land (Art's wife), Tom Jones, a beautiful waitress named Cindy, and a gambling lawyer to an airfield in the hopes of flying a small jet to safety. They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the <b>process,</b> <b>but</b> discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E

Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E

5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.

5|$|Maheshinte Prathikaaram {{development}} {{began in}} 2013, when Pothan {{was working as}} an associate director for Abu (who was directing Idukki Gold, co-written by Pushkaran).

At Pothan's insistence, Pushkaran wrote the screenplay that year and Abu later became interested in producing the film. Production was scheduled to commence from December 2014 after completing the casting <b>process</b> <b>but,</b> due to scheduling conflicts, it was postponed to August 2015. Principal photography began in early August in Idukki and nearby locations, where it was predominantly filmed. Shooting was completed in late October.|$|E

5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the <b>process,</b> <b>but</b> the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E
