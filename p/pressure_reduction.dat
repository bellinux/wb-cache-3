5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} caisson or a {{mine that}} has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure.

5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow <b>pressure</b> <b>reduction,</b> {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>reduction</b> may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

40|$|Thiazide diuretics are {{recommended}} as first-line therapy for hypertension and {{are among the}} most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. According to their molecular structure, thiazide diuretics can be divided in thiazide-type (TT) and thiazide-like (TL) diuretics. TL diuretics have a longer elimination half-life compared with TT diuretics and have been shown to exert additional pharmacological effects, which may differently affect cardiovascular risk. In this meta-analysis, we compared the effects of TT and TL diuretics on cardiovascular events and mortality. Randomized, controlled studies in adult hypertensive patients that compared TT or TL diuretics with placebo or antihypertensive drugs and had ≥ 1 year follow-up were included. Primary outcome was cardiovascular events; secondary outcomes included coronary events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify confounders and correct for the achieved blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions.</b> Twenty-one studies with > 480 [*] 000 patient-years were included. Outcomes were not affected by heterogeneity in age, sex, and ethnicity among included studies, whereas larger blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> were significantly associated with increased risk reductions for all outcomes (P < 0. 001). Corrected for differences in office blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> among trials, TL diuretics resulted in a 12 % additional risk reduction for cardiovascular events (P= 0. 049) and a 21 % additional risk reduction for heart failure (P= 0. 023) when compared with TT diuretics.

40|$|Introduction: The {{training}} stimulus {{responsible for}} blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> after isometric training remains equivocal. It {{has previously been}} suggested that increased exposure to shear stress during isometric exercise may mediate endothelial adaptations, similar to that seen in dynamic exercise training. This {{may lead to a}} reduced peripheral resistance and thus a lower resting blood pressure (McGowan et al, 2007). However the role of shear stress in isometric training induced blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> remains uninvestigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to train participants at two intensities that either elicited a high or low shear stress stimulus to determine the role of conduit femoral artery shear stress in blood <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> after an isometric leg training intervention. Methods: 35 male normotensive participants (age = 23. 79 ± 6. 30 yrs, height = 180 ± 5. 71 cm, mass = 75. 70 ± 11. 11 kg) were allocated to one of three groups: high shear stress (HI), low shear stress (LO) or control (CON). The HI and LO groups undertook an 8 week training programme of 4 x 2 minute bilateral-leg isometric contractions, 3 times per week. Mean shear rate (MSR), peak shear rate (PSR) and change in shear rate (△SR) were used as an estimation of shear stress, and was measured using doppler ultrasound during training intervention in the common femoral artery. Resting systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MAP) blood pressure parameters were measured at baseline, mid-point (4 weeks) and post-training (8 weeks). Results: Repeated measure ANOVA demonstrated that the changes in SBP after training were not significant in any group. There were significant differences in DBP for the LO group pre-mid, mid-post and pre-post (P 0. 05). Discussion: These results suggest that training according to different levels of shear stress in the common femoral artery does not provide a strong training stimulus for reductions in resting blood pressure after isometric leg exercise intervention. Although shear stress is accepted as an important training stimulus in dynamic exercise, these findings indicate that shear stress might not be the main stimulus for reductions in resting blood pressure after isometric training...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Although {{cigarette}} smoking {{is known to}} lead to widespread augmentation of sympathetic nervous system activity, {{little is known about}} the effects of smoking on directly measured human sympathetic activity and its reflex control. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied the acute effects of smoking two research-grade cigarettes on muscle sympathetic nerve activity and on arterial baroreflex-mediated changes of sympathetic and vagal neural cardiovascular outflows in eight healthy habitual smokers. Measurements were made during frequency-controlled breathing, graded Valsalva maneuvers, and carotid baroreceptor stimulation with ramped sequences of neck pressure and suction. Smoking provoked the following changes: Arterial pressure increased significantly, and RR intervals, RR interval spectral power at the respiratory frequency, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity decreased. Plasma nicotine levels increased significantly, but plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and neuropeptide Y levels did not change. Peak sympathetic nerve activity during and systolic pressure overshoots after Valsalva straining increased significantly in proportion to increases of plasma nicotine levels. The average carotid baroreceptor-cardiac reflex relation shifted rightward and downward on arterial pressure and RR interval axes; average gain, operational point, and response range did not change. CONCLUSIONS. In habitual smokers, smoking acutely reduces baseline levels of vagal-cardiac nerve activity and completely resets vagally mediated arterial baroreceptor-cardiac reflex responses. Smoking also reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity but augments increases of sympathetic activity triggered by brief arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions.</b> This pattern of autonomic changes is likely to influence smokers' responses to acute arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> importantly...|$|R

Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded directly from the peroneal nerve in 16 patients during diagnostic induction of 19 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (average rate 189 beats/min, range 130 to 250). Average systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 149 / 78 to 61 / 49 mm Hg by 10 s and increased toward baseline levels to 88 / 64 mm Hg by 1 min of ventricular tachycardia. Average sympathetic nerve activity increased by 92 % at 10 s in direct proportion to arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>reductions</b> and in inverse proportion to ventricular rate and remained 83 % above baseline levels at 1 min. The late recovery of arterial pressure during ventricular tachycardia was related significantly to the magnitude of early sympathetic responses. Sympathetic activity tended to lose its discrete bursting pattern during ventricular tachycardia, and power spectral analysis showed that the large sympathetic peaks at the heart rate frequency present during sinus rhythm are absent during ventricular tachycardia. This study is the first to delineate human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia. The results suggest that in the patients studied, large early sympathetic surges differed from those that occur during sinus rhythm and contributed to hemodynamic stability during ventricular tachycardia...|$|R
