Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide.

25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{gasoline}} on the environment, {{aside from the}} complications of its extraction and refining, is the potential effect on the climate through the production of carbon dioxide.

At higher concentrations of ethanol above 10%, the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease.

Both strong local photochemical production within thetroposphere and transport from the stratosphere can lead to elevated tropospheric O 3 concentrations. These have increased globally {{over the last century}} due to enhanced anthropogenic precursoremissions. Monitoring of tropospheric O 3 is therefore essential to understand its impact on airquality, chemical composition and climate change. Although quantifying tropospheric O 3 from space is difficult because of the abundance of ozone inthe stratosphere, over the past decade satellite instruments have provided valuable information on itsdistribution and temporal evolution. Here, we use the IASI instrument to retrieve tropospheric O 3 from space and assess its ability to detect ozone in the lower troposphere during exceptional events,such as <b>photochemical</b> <b>smogs.</b> We use the WRF-Chem chemical transport model to interpretobservations of tropospheric O 3 from IASI, and to assess the meteorological and dynamical processesinvolved in such extreme events...|$|R

40|$|The {{basis of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the relative environmental impacts of various power generators knowing that all plants are located in totally different environments and that different receptors will experience different impacts. Based on IChemE sustainability metrics paradigm, we calculated potential environmental indicators (P-EI) that represent the environmental burden of masses of potential pollutants discharged into different receiving media. However, a P-EI may not be of significance, as it may not be expressed at all in different conditions, so to try and include some receiver significance we developed a methodology to take into account some specific environmental indicators (S-EI) that refer to the environmental attributes of a specific site. In this context, we acquired site specific environmental data related to the airsheds and water catchment areas in different locations for a limited number of environmental indicators such as human health (carcinogenic) effects, atmospheric acidification, <b>photochemical</b> (ozone) <b>smog</b> and eutrophication. The S-EI results from this particular analysis show that atmospheric acidification has highest impact value while health risks due to fly ash emissions are considered not to be as significant. This {{is due to the fact}} that many coal power plants in Australia are located in low population density air sheds. The contribution of coal power plants to <b>photochemical</b> (ozone) <b>smog</b> and eutrophication were not significant. In this study, we have considered emission related data trends to reflect technology performance (e. g., P-EI indicators) while a real sustainability metric can be associated only with the specific environmental conditions of the relevant sites (e. g., S-EI indicators) ...|$|R

Unlike Los Angeles, which is surrounded by mountains that tend to trap airborne pollutants, New York City's open topography and favorable wind conditions usually dispersed pollutants before they could form concentrated smogs. If 1960s New York City had surroundings and a climate like those of Los Angeles, pollutants would not have escaped as easily and smog would have made the city uninhabitable.|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{measurements are}} aimed at improving {{our understanding of the}} chemical properties of the atmosphere, addressing mainly three issues with very different space and time scales: • Measurement of critical or peak values of air pollutant in densely urbanized/industrialized sites. • Long term observation and trend analysis on air quality. • Evaluation of <b>photochemical</b> pollution (<b>smog)</b> episodes on a time scale of a few days. For each of these issues, the DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) technique has developed into one of the practical high performance techniques. Based on the UV-visible molecular absorption of atmospheric gases, DOAS is a spectroscopic technique well suited for a simultaneous detection of many atmospheric trace gases including the criteria compounds, NO 2, SO 2, and O 3. Furthermore the DOAS technique is based on the optical absorption of gases over long path lengths ranging from some hundreds of meters up to several kilometers long. Thus the DOAS values, in the case of non-folded optical paths, give in general pollutant concentrations averaged over relatively large distances, thus avoiding large local perturbations that can be observed in point measurements. In the case of photo-smog events, the DOAS system provides an ideal database for comparison with results obtained from a mesoscale eulerian air quality model as the spatial resolution is comparable between model and measurement, and the time resolution of the measurement is short enough for useful comparison. Such models are at this point scientifically the most relevant tools to predict the impact of different air pollution abatement strategies on air pollution events. This paper summarizes the significance of the DOAS technique in air pollution management...|$|R

500|$|The {{long-term}} effects {{from a nearby}} burst are more dangerous. Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxygen and nitrogen molecules, creating first nitrogen oxide then nitrogen dioxide gas. The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels. First, they deplete ozone, with models showing a possible global reduction of 25-35%, with as much as 75% in certain locations, an effect that would last for years. This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated UV index at the surface. Secondly, the nitrogen oxides cause <b>photochemical</b> <b>smog,</b> which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the sunlight spectrum. This would affect photosynthesis, but models show only about a 1% reduction of the total sunlight spectrum, lasting a few years. However, the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth's climate, producing a [...] "cosmic winter" [...] (similar to an impact winter, but without an impact), but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability. Thirdly, the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce nitric acid rain.

40|$|A {{research}} programme is {{being carried out}} at the Institute Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial of Spain, on several aspects {{of the formation of}} nitrogen oxides in continuous flow combustion systems, considering hydrogen and hydrocarbons as fuels.

40|$|The urban hot island {{phenomenon}} {{occurs when}} {{the air in the}} city is 2 - 8 °F hotter than the surrounding countryside. 1 There are several factors that contribute to a city becoming a hot island. Some of these factors are the following; modification of environment due to change of land cover, buildings, roofing materials and pavements made of dark materials absorbing the sun’s rays and converting them into thermal energy instead of reflecting them away from the lands surface, and the heat released into the atmosphere from industrial and communal processes. Each city’s urban hot island varies based on the city structure and thus the range of temperatures within the island vary as well. 2 In many large cities satellite sensed temperatures are 10 - 15 °C warmer than the surrounding rural areas. 3 In a recent change analysis showed that impervious surface (or urban area) increased in the San Antonio study area by 33 % between 1985 and 2003. 4 Some environmental effects of hot island phenomenon are the following; the absorption and storage of solar energy by the urban environment, increase in pollutants creating a <b>photochemical</b> reaction called <b>smog</b> in the lower atmosphere, increase in the use of electrical power and fossil fuels in large cities, and increased energy costs.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{computer}} modelling of the <b>photochemical</b> formation of <b>smog</b> {{products such as}} ozone and aerosol, in a system containing toluene, NOx and water vapour. In particular, the problem of modelling this process in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) smog chambers, which utilize outdoor exposure, is addressed. The primary requirement for such modelling is {{a knowledge of the}} photolytic rate coefficients. Photolytic rate coefficients of species other than N 02 are often related to JNo 2 (rate coefficient for the photolysis ofN 02) by a simple factor, but for outdoor chambers, this method is prone to error as the diurnal profiles may not be similar in shape. Three methods for the calculation of diurnal JNo 2 are investigated. The most suitable method for incorporation into a general model, is found to be one which determines the photolytic rate coefficients for N 02, as well as several other species, from actinic flux, absorption cross section and quantum yields. A computer model was developed, based on this method, to calculate in-chamber photolysis rate coefficients for the CSIRO smog chambers, in which ex-chamber rate coefficients are adjusted by accounting for variation in light intensity by transmittance through the Teflon walls, albedo from the chamber floor and radiation attenuation due to clouds. The photochemical formation of secondary aerosol is investigated in a series of toluene-NOx experiments, which were performed in the CSIRO smog chambers. Three stages of aerosol formation, in plots of total particulate volume versus time, are identified: a delay period in which no significant mass of aerosol is formed, a regime of rapid aerosol formation (regime 1) and a second regime of slowed aerosol formation (regime 2). Two models are presented which were developed from the experimental data. One model is empirically based on observations of discrete stages of aerosol formation and readily allows aerosol growth profiles to be calculated. The second model is based on an adaptation of published toluene photooxidation mechanisms and provides some chemical information about the oxidation products. Both models compare favorably against the experimental data. The gross effects of precursor concentrations (toluene, NOx and H 20) and ambient conditions (temperature, photolysis rate) on the formation of secondary aerosol are also investigated, primarily using the mechanism model. An increase in [NOx]o results in increased delay time, rate of aerosol formation in regime 1 and volume of aerosol formed in regime 1. This is due to increased formation of dinitrocresol and furanone products. An increase in toluene results in a decrease in the delay time and an increase in the rate of aerosol formation in regime 1, due to enhanced reactivity from the toluene products, such as the radicals from the photolysis of benzaldehyde. Water vapor has very little effect on the formation of aerosol volume, except that rates are slightly increased due to more OH radicals from reaction with 0 (1 D) from ozone photolysis. Increased temperature results in increased volume of aerosol formed in regime 1 (increased dinitrocresol formation), while increased photolysis rate results in increased rate of aerosol formation in regime 1. Both the rate and volume of aerosol formed in regime 2 are increased by increased temperature or photolysis rate. Both models indicate that the yield of secondary particulates from hydrocarbons (mass concentration aerosol formed/mass concentration hydrocarbon precursor) is proportional to the ratio [NOx] 0 /[hydrocarbon]...|$|R
