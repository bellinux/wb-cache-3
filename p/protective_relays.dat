25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and <b>protective</b> <b>relays,</b> instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E

A novel approach based on value estimation was investigated for the proposed fuzzy logic based <b>protective</b> <b>relay.</b> In addition to the theoretical aspect of fuzzy logic, mathematical definition of value estimation, detection and measurement of faulty current, determination of its duration, decision mechanism and detailed system architecture were also introduced.

A relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature; inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits, and vacuum tube amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory and}} {{application}} of these protective devices {{is an important part}} of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power system protection. The need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires <b>protective</b> <b>relays</b> to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules. A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{circuit breaker}} must firstly detect a fault condition. In small mains and low voltage circuit breakers, {{this is usually}} done within the device itself. Typically, the heating and/or {{magnetic}} effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with protective relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, <b>protective</b> <b>relays,</b> and an internal control power source.|$|E

Fault diagnosis is one of the important components in power system operation.

Furthermore, in many recent works on power system event analysis, emphasis has been primarily aimed at “fault response analysis ” using data from numerous IEDs rather than analysis on detailed validation and diagnosis of digital <b>protective</b> <b>relay</b> behavior using relay resident data.
