40|$|To satisfy customers’ desires with a {{maintained}} {{efficiency of}} the production process is a challenge for many house construction companies. Houses are one-off projects with a production process characterized by variability and complexity that often lead to unpredicted costs. <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>component</b> solutions could possibly solve these issues through modularization, mass customization and delayed product differentiation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the opportunities and barriers to use <b>prefabricated</b> house <b>components.</b> Interviews were conducted with two industrial house manufacturers to pinpoint these opportunities and barriers. The impact of this research may have value for house construction companies considering the use of <b>prefabricated</b> house <b>components.</b> The use of these components may lead to benefits such as shorter lead-time, higher quality, decreased complexity in coordination and reduced risks of production failures. Moreover, this research may be valuable to house component suppliers in the business development of their product offers to industrial house builders...|$|R

500|$|The {{first batch}} of the Nclass proved {{successful}} in service, and few problems were encountered after settling-in. The Ministry of Supply {{drew up a}} contract for a second batch to the same specification – to be built at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. The government backing came {{as part of a}} proposal to nationalise the railways, which would require a standard fleet of locomotives to promote economies in production and maintenance. The nationalisation proposal was abandoned; instead, the government passed the 1921 Railways Act, which grouped the railways into the [...] "Big Four" [...] in 1923. Building of the second batch went ahead to retain skilled labour at Woolwich, but the fabrication of 119 boilers for allocation to the kits of parts was contracted-out because of limited production capacity at Woolwich and Ashford; the North British Locomotive Company built 85, Robert Stephenson and Company 20, and Kitson & Co. 14. By 1924, the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>components</b> stored at Woolwich formed 100 complete Nclass kits for purchase from the government.|$|E

40|$|The {{urgent need}} for {{sustainable}} buildings calls for the adoption of active building façades that harvest wind and solar energy through on-site wind power generators and solar panels. Particularly interesting {{is the use of}} tensegrity structures for the construction of renewable energy supplies, due to their easy integration with solar and acoustical panels, which can form the special rigid members of the structure. The present study deals with the design of active  façades based on tensegrity units, which supports shading devices and/or solar panels. The tensegrity units are foldable and deployable and are controlled by stretching or relaxing selected cables.  Wind generators to convert the strain energy stored in the cables of wind-excited units into electrical power are also designed. The proposed structures offer portable applications for small spans and are easy to assemble using <b>prefabricated</b> <b>component</b> parts in the case of large spans...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a parametric design approach to simply-supported structures, exhibiting minimal mass tensegrity architectures (axially-loaded prestressible configurations of axially-loaded members) in two-dimensions. This provides minimal mass bridge {{structures in the}} plane. The mass minimization problem considers a distributed loading condition, under buckling and yielding constraints. The minimal mass structure is {{proved to be a}} tensegrity system with an optimal complexity. This optimal complexity (number of structural elements) depends only on material properties and the magnitude of the external load. The fact that the minimal mass structure is a Class 1 Tensegrity substructure has significant economic advantage. Class 1 structures are less expensive to construct, and substructures are easily deployable, offering portable applications for small spans. They can be easily assembled for <b>prefabricated</b> <b>component</b> parts for large spans. This minimal mass theory is then used to design a support structure for a solar panel cover of water canals, stopping evaporative losses and generating power without requiring additional land...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the last}} fifteen years of this period (1960 to 1975), an {{emphasis}} was made for a supply side solution, which assumed that industrialised building methods and high rise housing would be cheaper and quicker than traditional brick-built, low-rise housing. [...] Such methods required manufacturing organisations to produce the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>components</b> and organisations to assemble them on site, both of which planners assumed would employ large numbers of unskilled workers-with powerful political contacts. [...] The lack of participation of eventual customers, the residents, constituted one factor in escalating construction costs and poor quality work. This led to higher demolition rates and higher costs to repair poorly constructed dwellings. In addition, because of poor quality work, a black market arose for building services and materials that could not be procured from state monopolies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{net result}} of the {{modifications}} was a [...] reduction in cargo capacity of about 10percent {{in the case of}} the tankers, but almost 30percent for the grain ships, the higher figure on account of the space taken up by the hangar. [...] The modifications themselves were conceptually simple and with standardised designs and extensive use (about 51percent by weight of steel) of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>components,</b> the average conversion time was just over five months, but there were significant differences between the average time required to convert new-builds (about 14weeks) and existing ships (about 27weeks). [...] There were wide variations within groups; the first 'Triple Twelve', Rapana, was converted in five months while the final one, Macoma, took ten months. [...] Delays arose through a variety of reasons, including labour relations and conflicting priorities in the shipyards, but the supply of arrester gear which was also in high demand for the escort carrier programme was a particular bottleneck that limited the rate at which MACs could be completed.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{barriers}} to more universal acceptance {{of this technology}} differ in their extent for {{different parts of the}} world but generally include: lack of awareness, a limited supply of <b>prefabricated</b> UDDT <b>components</b> and a lack of interest in financing any sanitation services for the non-sewered portions of urban settlements. Existing, affordable piped water supply and sanitary sewer infrastructure may also be an impediment to widespread adoption of UDDTs as their existence not only removes two of the main drivers for UDDTs but also represents a significant public investment. This can restrict efforts to switch to new toilet types and sanitation systems.|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} steel-timber composite {{floor for}} use in multi-storey residential buildings is presented. The research demonstrates the potential of these steel-timber composite systems in terms of bearing capacity, stiffness and method of construction. Such engineered solutions should prove to be sustainable since they combine recyclable materials in the most effective way. The floors consist of <b>prefabricated</b> ultralight modular <b>components,</b> with a Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) slab, joined together and to the main structural system using only bolts and screws. Two novel floor solutions are presented, along {{with the results of}} experimental tests on the flexural behavior of their modular components. Bending tests have been performed considering two different methods of loading and constraints. Each <b>prefabricated</b> modular <b>component</b> uses a special arrangement of steel-timber connections to join a CLT panel to two customized cold-formed steel beams. Specifically, the first proposed composite system is assembled using mechanical connectors whereas the second involves the use of epoxy-based resin. In the paper, a FEM model is provided in order to extend this study to other steel-timber composite floor solutions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{widespread}} use of mechatronic systems mandates a rigorous engineering approach towards embedded software development, i. e. model based development using repositories of <b>prefabricated</b> software <b>components.</b> The main problem {{that has to be}} addressed in this context is to systematically develop the software framework for mechatronic applications, taking into account the true nature of them, which are predominantly continuous-time/discrete-event processes, hierarchical and concurrent systems. The implications of the adopted modelling technique by integration of component-based design and verification are discussed in the context of mechatronic domain systems. The result is a hierarchical-modular signal flow metamodel in which process and control tasks are clearly differentiated. The results have been used to formulate the guidelines used to develop COMDES- a software framework for distributed embedded applications...|$|R
