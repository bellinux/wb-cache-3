The intension of this work is to demonstrate to the reader, a thorough comparison of data and information so that the phenomenon at hand can be understood in depth, rather than superficially. In order to achieve this it is necessary to find basic elements pertaining to the matter, analyse them and apply them to an audible model. To do this one must analised the characteristic of tone color, the <b>piano's</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and finally the psychology of the listner's perception.

50|$|One common {{specialty}} {{store is}} the piano store, which typically sells {{a range of}} upright pianos and grand pianos.

In the 2010s, some piano stores sell high-end digital pianos.|$|E
50|$|Other {{improvements}} of the <b>piano</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{included the}} use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by Jean-Henri Pape in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased.

Marrying an English woman, they had twins John Jr. and Adam ca.1780, George ca 1782, and William ca. 1793. In 1797 he elected to resettle again, to New York. There he established Geib & Company as an organ maker from 1800-02. Following a bankruptcy, he partnered with his son John Jr. to operate Geib & Son, building organs and pianofortes until 1814. John Jr. had another partnership with brother Adam as J. & A. Geib from 1804-08 and again 1816-17.|$|R

50|$|Cristofori {{was also}} the first to {{incorporate}} a form of soft pedal into a <b>piano</b> (the <b>mechanism</b> by which the hammers are made to strike fewer than the maximum number of strings; Cristofori's was a hand stop).

50|$|In 1847, Alexander Bain {{described}} {{a device that}} used a paper roll as a 'travelling valve' that allowed air to flow through the reeds of a reed organ. Simple reed and pipe organs using this sort of system are still being produced. However, the air flow {{is not sufficient to}} drive a <b>piano</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In 1848 Charles Dawson of England {{described a}} more complex travelling valve device which added little to Bain.|$|E
50|$|The first {{device to}} address the {{practical}} requirement of operating a <b>piano</b> <b>mechanism</b> was Forneaux's, of 1863. This recognized that a hard strike was needed to throw the hammer towards the keys. It used a traditional barrel, but tripped a pneumatic device that inflated bellows rapidly to operate the note. In 1871 a perforated cardboard book was substituted for the barrel, {{but it was still}} read using sprung fingers. This device entered manufacture, and is generally regarded as the first practical player device. It was exhibited in Philadelphia in 1876.|$|E

50|$|C.F. Theodore Steinway {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} inventors and patent holders in the history of the piano: more than 45 patents originate from his development work. The most important development is considered to be the single key mechanism fitted to the newly invented tubular frame built with tubes of brass which contain wooden sticks inside to allow accuracy and a simple screwing, patent gained 1871 for Steinway. Since the Vienna mechanism disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, all grand pianos have been built using the single key principle, mainly developed by C.F. Theodore Steinway and his younger brothers. With this system it is possible to replace the hammer and also the wippen of a single defective key without either disturbing the neighbouring keys or disassembling any non-defective elements. Also the reinstallation of the elements is supported with high accuracy on the one hand and on the other a quite simple adjustment to perfect working conditions. The precise bearing of the hammer and the whippen on specially profiled brass tubes is still today one of the core elements of Steinway's grand <b>piano</b> <b>mechanism</b> and has not been modified since 1871: a new hammer fits on a tubular fixture of 1871, and vice versa. Theodore's key innovation was the use of a stiff metal fixture with wooden sticks inserted. These permit the continuation of the old and trusted use of wood screws - but provide much higher precision and stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of animations containing two novel forms of animation cueing that target relations between event units rather than individual entities was {{compared with that}} of animations containing conventional entity-based cueing or no cues. These relational event unit cues (progressive path and local coordinated cues) were specifically designed to support key learning processes posited by the Animation Processing Model (Lowe & Boucheix, 2008). Four groups of undergraduates (N = 84) studied a user-controllable animation of a <b>piano</b> <b>mechanism</b> and then were assessed for mental model quality (via a written comprehension test) and knowledge of the mechanism's dynamics (via a novel non-verbal manipulation test). Time-locked eye tracking was used to characterize participants' obedience to cues (initial engagement versus ongoing loyalty) across the learning period. For both output measures, participants in the two relational event unit cueing conditions were superior to those in the entity-based and uncued conditions. Time-locked eye tracking analysis of cue obedience revealed that initial cue engagement did not guarantee ongoing cue loyalty.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] micromechanical model of nonlinear hysteretic compression between interacting bodies of multibody systems, covered with fibrous structures, has been created and validated experimentally in this work. As an application, a multibody dynamic model of an upright <b>piano</b> action <b>mechanism</b> with felt-covered contacting bodies is considered, and the obtained results were verified using experiments. Felt, as a typical nonwoven fiber assembly, {{has been used in}} various contact surfaces of <b>piano</b> action <b>mechanisms</b> to transfer the force applied on the key to other components, smoothly and continuously. To keep the simulation time tractable in the mechanistic multibody dynamic model, interaction between felt-lined interfaces has to be simplified enough so that in each step of simulation time, contact forces can be calculated as a function of penetration depth between colliding objects. The developed micromechanical approach is capable of estimating nonlinear bulk response of felt in terms of microstructural parameters of the network, assuming a binomial distribution of the number of fiber contacts and bending of constituent fibers. Hysteresis is included based on a fiber-to-fiber friction approach, which generates a speed-independent response to compressive loading schemes, as has been observed in experiments. A computational algorithm is introduced to apply the sophisticated hysteretic micromechanical model to the multibody systems simulation, including transitions between loading–unloading stages.

50|$|Despite their {{apparent}} similarity, {{keyboard instruments}} {{of different types}} require different techniques. The <b>piano</b> hammer <b>mechanism</b> produces a louder note the faster the key is pressed while the harpsichord's plectrum mechanism does not perceptibly vary {{the volume of the}} note with different touch on the keyboard. The pipe organ's volume and timbre are controlled by the flow of air from the bellows and the stops preselected by the player.
