5000|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} using the {{swashplate}} principle (fixed and adjustable displacement) have {{a quality that}} is almost {{the same as the}} bent axis model. They have the advantage of being more compact in design and also allow use of [...] "through-drive" [...] series mounted auxiliary rotating equipment, based on their in-line design. The pumps are easier and more economical to manufacture; the disadvantage is that they are more sensitive to oil contamination. The axial piston pump is likely the most widely used variable displacement type, being found in everything from heavy industrial to mobile applications. By using different compensation techniques, the variable displacement type of these pumps can continuously alter fluid discharge per revolution and system pressure based on load requirements, maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> settings, horsepower/ratio control, and even fully electroproportional systems, requiring no other input than electrical signals. This makes them potentially hugely power saving compared to other constant flow pumps in systems where prime mover/diesel/electric motor rotational speed is constant and required fluid flow is non-constant.|$|E
40|$|It {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges water utilities are facing in striving to reduce and control Non Revenue Water (NRW) within an economic level. While supplying the population with sufficient water, the reduction of NRW has been a key issue in judging the performance of all water utilities. Background loss is one component of physical losses which is the most to contribute to NRW. This study aimed on pressure management method conducted at a site to reduce background loss. The pressure management method used is by the installation of a Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) with timer-based <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> controller as an on-site verification. The BE 59 - Kg. Melayu Pandan, one of the District Meter Area (DMA) in Johor Bahru has been selected as a case study. The Step Tests are carried out to analyse and identify the steps with high background leakage and to find suitable location for the purpose of PRV installation. The DMA meter and a data logger are used to measure and record pressure and flow profiles to determine leakage at each step and to establish leakage baselines, before and after the activation of the PRV. The results indicated a high reduction of background loss and given significant impact on the NRW level in Johor Bahru. In financial terms, volume of water saved and the monthly expenditure shows the return of investment (R. O. I) is in a period of 6 months. This research findings show a higher reduction on background loss can be achieved by optimising the cut-off controller, analysing further excess pressure cutoff based on pressure profiles in the existing or new DMA with a PRV and controller in a large scale. Comparisons with other methods of pipe replacement and Active Leakage Control (ALC), indicate that, the pressure management by excess <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> is the most feasible, economical and effective method in the NRW reduction...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the variation in reported relative risks of coronary heart disease and stroke associated with hypertension and determined reasons for the interstudy variation. Studies published since 1970 were examined that reported the absolute number of events and person-years for men by age and hypertensive status. The data were pooled in Poisson regression models with the coronary heart disease or stroke rate as the dependent variable. Independent variables were hypertensive status, age at entry, age of study, duration of follow-up, diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> point, and interactions of all these variables with hypertensive status. The reported relative risks associated with hypertension ranged from 1. 45 to 2. 77 for coronary heart disease and from 1. 86 to 5. 78 for stroke. Smaller relative risks were found in more recent studies, in studies with long follow-up, and in studies using a lower cut-off point to define hypertension.

40|$|The dual {{cycle is}} a better {{approximation}} to the modern high speed compression ignition engine than either the Diesel cycle or the Otto cycle. Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating the effects of <b>pressure</b> and <b>cut-off</b> ratios on the dual cycle performance with considerations of heat transfer loss, variable specific heat ratio and friction irreversible losses. By using finite-time thermodynamics theory, {{the relations between the}} power output and the compression ratio, between the thermal efficiency and the compression ratio, as well as the optimal relation between power output and the efficiency of the cycle are obtained. The results show that if compression ratio is smaller than certain value, the increase of pressure ratio and the decrease of cut-off ratio make the power output bigger. While if compression ratio exceeds certain value, the power output first increases and then starts to decline as <b>pressure</b> ratio and <b>cut-off</b> ratio are increased. With further increase in compression ratio, the power output decreases with increasing pressure ratio and decreasing cut-off ratio. The effects of <b>pressure</b> and <b>cut-off</b> ratios on the variation of the thermal efficiency with compression ratio are similar to those for the power output.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Incisional hernias can {{be treated}} with laparoscopic and laparotomic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery can be made {{without the use of}} mesh when {{performing}} component separation technique. This technique allows to limit the adverse effects to foreign body and promotes a tension-free closure. We studied intravescical pressure changes during intervention in order to quantify intrabdominal pressure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, non-controlled study (cohort study), was made on thirty patients, treated to repair incisional hernia. Standard panniculectomies and component separation technique were performed in all patients. A standard Foley catheter was inserted in to the bladder in order to measure pressure modification in the peri-/post-operative phases. Statistical significance of modifications of pressure values was evaluated with the Wilcoxon's sum rank test. RESULTS: Bladder pressure increased after hernia repair and skin closure and decreased in the first day after surgery, but without returning to the original values, and these modifications were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: We study intravescical pressure changes as an indirect measurement of intrabdominal pressure. Intrabdominal <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> for the arise of complications is 20 mmHg.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{widespread}} {{availability of}} {{a large body of}} evidence in the area of hypertension, the translation of that evidence into viable recommendations aimed at improving the quality of health care is very difficult, sometimes to the point of questionable acceptability and overall credibility of the guidelines advocating those recommendations. The scientific community world-wide and especially professionals interested in the topic of hypertension are witnessing currently an unprecedented debate over the issue of appropriateness of using different drugs/drug classes for the treatment of hypertension. An endless supply of recent and less recent "drug-news", some in support of, others against the current guidelines, justifying the use of selected types of drug treatment or criticising other, are coming out in the scientific literature on an almost weekly basis. The latest of such debate (at the time of writing this paper) pertains the safety profile of ARBs vs ACE inhibitors. To great extent, the factual situation has been fuelled by the new hypertension guidelines (different for USA, Europe, New Zeeland and UK) through, apparently small inconsistencies and conflicting messages, that might have generated substantial and perpetuating confusion among both prescribing physicians and their patients, regardless of their country of origin. The overwhelming message conveyed by most guidelines and opinion leaders is the widespread use of diuretics as first-line agents in all patients with blood pressure above a certain cut-off level and the increasingly aggressive approach towards diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. This, apparently well-justified, logical and easily comprehensible message is unfortunately miss-obeyed by most physicians, on both parts of the Atlantic. Amazingly, the message assumes a universal simplicity of both diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, while ignoring several hypertension-specific variables, commonly known to have high level of complexity, such as: - accuracy of recorded blood pressure and the great inter-observer variability, - diversity in the competency and training of diagnosing physician, - individual patient/disease profile with highly subjective preferences, - difficulty in reaching consensus among opinion leaders, - pharmaceutical industry's influence, and, nonetheless, - the large variability in the efficacy and safety of the antihypertensive drugs. The present 2 -series article attempts to identify and review possible causes that might have, at least in part, generated the current healthcare anachronism (I); to highlight the current trend to account for the uncertainties related to the fixed blood <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-off</b> point and the possible solutions to improve accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension (II). </p...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal com amostra randomizada da população adulta da cidade de Campo Grande, MS, num total de 892 pessoas. Foi aplicado questionário sobre idade, sexo, escolaridade, tabagismo, etilismo, aspectos sobre o tratamento. Foram colhidos dados antropométricos (peso e altura). Segundo a OMS, foi considerado peso normal: IMC IMC 30. Os critérios para hipertensão foram baseados no VII Joint, com valores de corte de Pressão Arterial de 140 x 90 mmHg. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de hipertensão foi de 41, 4 %, variando conforme idade (até 29 anos: 11, 8 %; 30 - 39 : 24, 8 %; 40 - 49 : 43, 3 %; 50 - 59 : 42, 4 %; 60 - 69 : 48, 6 % e > 70 : 62, 3 %). Houve maior prevalência nos homens (51, 8 %), enquanto nas mulheres foi de 33, 1 %. As pessoas com formação escolar de 1 º grau primário tendem a apresentar maiores índices pressóricos. Nos indivíduos com sobrepeso e obesidade, observou-se maior prevalência de pressão elevada: IMC normal (27, 9 %), sobrepeso (45, 6 %) e obesidade (58, 6 %). A partir dos 60 anos existe um maior porcentual de hipertensão sistólica isolada, representado por 16, 4 % (60 - 69 anos) e de 24, 6 % (> 70 anos).

The historical background and changing definitions of CLI over the last decades are important to know in order to understand why epidemiologic data are so difficult to compare between articles and over time. The prevalence of CLI is probably very high and largely underestimated, and significant differences exist between population studies and clinical series. The extremely high costs associated with management of these patients make CLI a real public health issue for the future. In the era of emerging vascular surgery in the 1950 s, the initial classification of PAOD by Fontaine, with stages III and IV corresponding to CLI, was based only on clinical symptoms. Later, with increasing access to non-invasive haemodynamic measurements (ankle pressure, toe pressure), the need to prove a causal relationship between PAOD and clinical findings suggestive of CLI became a real concern, and the Rutherford classification published in 1986 included objective haemodynamic criteria. The first consensus document on CLI was published in 1991 and included clinical criteria associated with ankle and toe pressure and transcutaneous oxygen <b>pressure</b> (TcPO(2)) <b>cut-off</b> levels < 50 mmHg, < 30 mmHg and < 10 mmHg respectively). This rigorous definition reflects an arterial insufficiency that is so severe as to cause microcirculatory changes and compromise tissue integrity, with a high rate of major amputation and mortality. The TASC I consensus document published in 2000 used less severe <b>pressure</b> <b>cut-offs</b> (≤ 50 - 70 mmHg, ≤ 30 - 50 mmHg and ≤ 30 - 50 mmHg respectively). The thresholds for toe pressure and especially TcPO(2) (which will be also included in TASC II consensus document) are however just below the lower limit of normality. It is therefore easy to infer that patients qualifying as CLI based on TASC criteria can suffer from far less severe disease than those qualifying as CLI in the initial 1991 consensus document. Furthermore, inclusion criteria of many recent interventional studies have even shifted further from the efforts of definition standardisation with objective criteria, by including patients as CLI based merely on Fontaine classification (stage III and IV) without haemodynamic criteria. The differences in the natural history of patients with CLI, including prognosis of the limb and the patient, are thus difficult to compare between studies in this context. Overall, CLI as defined by clinical and haemodynamic criteria remains a severe condition with poor prognosis, high medical costs and a major impact in terms of public health and patients' loss of functional capacity. The major progresses in best medical therapy of arterial disease and revascularisation procedures will certainly improve the outcome of CLI patients.

30|$|It is {{important}} to understand the differences between the stress changes in modelling aftershocks and pressure-induced seismicity. Pressure affects normal stress on faults. Released shear stress, after an earthquake, mostly affects shear stress on faults in its vicinity. The main difference in terms of induced seismicity is that the latter is a sudden change in stress whereas the former is a smooth change provided by pressure diffusion. The implications of this, on RST seismicity is demonstrated in the section on ‘Approximate behaviour of rate and state-dependent Ricatti solutions’. Induced seismicity after pressure shut-in is relevant as seismicity does not stop with shut-in; moreover, in many cases, the maximum magnitudes are observed. The post-shut-in seismicity is controlled by the diffusion constant of the pressure and the lower <b>cut-off</b> <b>pressure</b> below which no seismicity can be triggered. This applies to both theories and does not constitute a major difference. The implications for the seismicity evolution are studied numerically.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{analytical}} {{study has}} been conducted to determine the physical dimensions (i. e. height and diameter) of a cylindrical aerosol generation chamber in which an atomizer is presumed to generate poly-disperse aerosol from a certain solution. The chamber considered here is both structurally and operationally different {{from most of the}} collection devices (e. g. gravitational settling chambers, centrifugal separators, wet scrubbers, filters, electrostatic precipitators etc. reported in the literatures. Expressions for cut-off droplet diameter and subsequently for the velocity and particle displacement history inside the chamber have been developed in this study. For a particular cut-off aerodynamic diameter the motion of the droplets has been realized to be affected by the fluid velocity through the chamber and whether the droplets are in Stoke’s region or not. Finally, it has been concluded that, chamber height is to be determined by the maximum height reached by the largest droplet produced by the atomizer whereas its diameter is determined by fluid velocity within the chamber when atomization <b>pressure</b> and particle <b>cut-off</b> aerodynamic diamete...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is an {{important}} and common problem in family practice, {{but there is no}} general agreement on the systolic and diastolic pressures at which it should be diagnosed and treated. Responses from 273 family physicians surveyed by mail in Metropolitan Toronto showed a wide variation in the <b>pressures</b> used as <b>cut-off</b> points. The probability that in a given patient hypertension would be diagnosed or treated at different systolic and diastolic pressures varied considerably among the physicians, the variation increasing with the age of the patient. There was also wide variation in opinion among the surveyed physicians about how often patients should be screened for hypertension; depending on the patient's age, up to 35 % of the physicians stated that the blood pressure should be measured at every visit. Only one third reported using any one or more methods to ensure that patients with hypertension were not lost to follow-up. The family physicians with an academic appointment used higher cut-off points for diagnosis and treatment, and they screened and scheduled follow-up visits less frequently than those without an academic appointment...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} which parameters could help {{to distinguish the}} "metabolically benign obesity", which is not accompanied by insulin resistance (IR) and early atherosclerosis. METHODS: Eighty two of 124 overweight/obese females formed the study population, which was {{divided into two groups}} (52 and 30 subjects, respectively) with and without IR according to a HO meostatic Metabolic Assessment (HOMA) cut-off of 2, and were studied in a cross-sectional manner. The main outcome measures were waist circumference, serum uric acid, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, blood pressure and the two imaging parameters, hepatic steatosis and longitudinal diameter of the spleen, which were measured in relation to the presence/absence of IR. RESULTS: A variable grade of visceral obesity was observed in all subjects with the exception of three. Obesity of a severe grade was represented more in the group of IR individuals (P = 0. 01). Hepatic steatosis, revealed at ultrasound, was more pronounced in IR than in non-IR subjects (P = 0. 005). The two groups also demonstrated a clear difference in longitudinal spleen diameter and blood pressure, with raised and significant values in the IR group. Metabolic syndrome was frequent in the IR group, and was not modified when adjusted for menopause (P = 0. 001). At linear regression, the beta values of waist circumference and body mass index predicting HOMA were 0. 295, P = 0. 007 and 0. 41, P = 0. 0001, respectively. Measures of spleen longitudinal diameter were well predicted by body mass index (BMI) values, beta = 0. 35, P = 0. 01, and by HOMA, beta = 0. 41, P = 0. 0001. Blood pressure was predicted by HOMA values, beta = 0. 39, P = 0. 0001). HOMA and hepatic steatosis were highly associated (rho = 0. 34, P = 0. 002). Interestingly, IR patients were almost twice as likely to have hepatic steatosis as non-IR patients. Among the MS criteria, blood pressure was very accurate in identifying the presence of IR (AUROC for systolic blood <b>pressure</b> 0. 66, <b>cut-off</b> 125 mm of Hg, sensibility 64 %, specificity 75 %; AUROC for diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> 0. 70, <b>cut-off</b> 85 mm of Hg, sensibility 54. 5 %, specificity 75 %).

40|$|Body {{mass index}} (BMI) and waist {{circumference}} (WC) are important con-tributors to major causes of health risk {{factors such as}} high blood cholesterol, high fasting blood sugar and high blood pressure. This analysis was designed to assess the associations between WC, BMI and each health risk factor in suit-able cut-off points for WC and BMI among middle aged {{men and women of}} Thai population. Cross sectional data from the Second National Health Sur-vey in Thailand was analysed. This set of data collected by the Ministry of Pub-lic Health from 1996 to 1997 was ob-tained from a total of 998 subjects (com-prising 396 men and 602 women) aged 45 - 50. Results from the Receiver Oper-ating Characteristic curve (ROC curve) identified those with health risk factors demonstrating cut-off points for WC between 81. 5 - 84 centimeters for men and 76 - 80. 5 centimeters for women and BMI between 23. 3 - 23. 9 kg/m 2 for both genders, respectively. Results from the Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated lower risks of having high blood cholesterol, high fasting blood sugar and high blood <b>pressure</b> with <b>cut-off</b> points 84 cm for men, 80 cm for women and BMI 23 kg/m 2 for both gen-ders compared to cut-off points 102 cm for men, 88 cm for women and BMI 25 kg/m 2 for both genders as specified for the population in Western countries. This study has proposed a waist circum-ference of 84 cm (33. 6 inches) for middle aged Thai men and 80 cm (32 inches) for middle aged Thai women and BMI of 23 kg/m 2 for both genders. Monitoring changes in the waist circumference over time along with BMI may be convenient and useful for middle aged Thais to pre-vent health risk conditions, {{even in the absence of}} a change in BMI.

An irregular performance of a mechanical-type constant power regulator is considered. In order to find the cause of an irregular discharge flow at the <b>cut-off</b> <b>pressure</b> area, modeling and numerical simulations are performed to observe dynamic behavior of internal parts of the constant power regulator system for a swashplate-type axial piston pump.

The validity of the simulation model of the constant power regulator system is verified by comparing simulation results with experiments. In order to find {{the cause of the}} irregular performance of the mechanical-type constant power regulator system, the behavior of main components such as the spool, sleeve, and counterbalance piston is investigated using computer simulation.

50|$|Meade saw the {{departure}} of Longstreet's Corps as a godsend to at last pin and destroy the army that most symbolized {{the will of the}} Confederacy, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Grant had telegraphed Meade about Lee's concentration at Gordonsville, and on April 13, Meade began to move the Army of Potomac to engage. Lee, with only 2/3 of his strength, was ready to use siege lines and maneuver to outwit and outpace Meade until Longstreet could finish the siege at Fort Monroe. With the Union defeat at Second Big Bethel, Meade was suddenly under significant pressure from General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant to begin his campaign with all haste to relieve the <b>pressure</b> on the <b>cut-off</b> Army of the James. Meade's issue was his unwillingness to march his men into prepared defensive positions constructed by Lee, as the defeat of Fredericksburg had shown. However, Grant saw that if Weitzel's XVIII Corps trapped in Yorktown fell, it would lead to the fall of Fort Monroe and the capture of the X Corps, then the capture of the 50,000 army and navy personnel at Norfolk Naval Base. Therefore, Meade's 120,000 strong Army of the Potomac, bolstered by the 25,000 arriving men of the VI Corps, was to bloodily force its way south to save the Army of the James.|$|R
40|$|Biomass based Indirectly Heated {{combined}} {{heat and}} power plant {{can be an}} excellent option for community scale power generation. The thermal performance of such a plant employing air-turbo generator block and bottoming steam turbine block has been analyzed over a range of pressure ratio (2 - 16) and for different turbine inlet air temperatures (1073, 1273 and 1373 K). The conventional GT combustion chamber is replaced by a burner and heat exchanger. The conventional axial compressor-gas turbine assembly is replaced by double acting reciprocating compressor and a turbo generator assembly. The main objective of using reciprocating compressor is to reduce the work requirement. Double acting reciprocating compressor is used instead of single acting to avoid the pulsating flow. The simulation of thermodynamic model is done by Athena Visual Studio software. For base case configuration, (topping cycle pressure ratio 4, gas flow rate of 90 Nm 3 /hr and turbine inlet temperature (TIT) = 1273 K) the turbocharger unit provides about 35. 9 kW electrical output, while work requirement for compressor and pump unit is about 15. 04 kW respectively. This work is supplies by the steam cycle which is about 17. 05 kW. It is seen from the analysis that up to the <b>pressure</b> ratio 5 (<b>cut-off</b> point) the steam cycle can drive the work consuming components and beyond this pressure ratio an auxiliary power source is required to drive them. It is also seen from the analysis at TIT 1073 K this cut-off point is bellow pressure ratio 4 while at TIT 1373 K the cut-off point is above pressure ratio 5...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The European Consensus Document (ECD) defines {{critical}} ischaemia (CI) {{according to}} clinical (Fontaine) {{and blood pressure}} parameters. However, clinical symptoms may be non-specific and CI may exist without severely reduced blood pressures. This study prospectively investigated the additive value of transcutaneous oxygen tension (pO 2) and toe blood pressure measurements to assess the presence of CI. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with 65 legs clinically classified as Fontaine stages III (n = 23) and IV (n = 26) were studied. Ankle and toe systolic blood pressure and pO 2 were measured to assess the presence of CI (cut-off values were 50, 30 and 30 mmHg, respectively). The surgeon was blinded for the toe pressure and pO 2 results. The treatment received within 1 month after presentation was recorded as being either conservative or invasive (vascular surgery or PTA). RESULTS: An ankle pressure of 50 mmHg were treated invasively, whereas only 32 % of the legs classified as not having CI by means of toe pressure and pO 2 underwent invasive therapy. If the need for invasive treatment is used as the "gold standard" {{for the presence of}} CI, 54 % of the legs would accurately be classified {{on the basis of the}} ankle blood pressure. The combination of toe pressure and pO 2 would have yielded 71 % and the ECD criteria 72 % and accurately classified legs.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the impact of the {{potential}} field of bypass-duct bifurcations on the turbofan tonal noise. The investigation is carried out at take-off condition on a typical rotor-stator fan stage extended with struts, upper and lower bifurcations. the results of quasi- 3 D steady and unsteady RANS calculations at 60 % rotor span are presented and compared to the isolated configuration. Two sorts of impact on noise are observed: on the one hand a direct impact on rotor noise due to the periodic loading of the rotor interacting with the circumferentially non-uniform pressure field imposed backwards by the bifurcations; on the other hand an indirect impact on the noise generation at the stator due to the deformation of the rotor wakes {{under the influence of the}} potential field of the bifurcations. In the present study, tonal noise due to the rotor-wake interaction with the stator vanes appears to be dominant in the bypass duct. Under the effect of the bypass components a dramatic change in the azimuthal structure of the acoustic field is observed at the blade passing frequency and ist harmonics with a significant increase of the sound power level. It is expected that the bypass components will jeopardise the cut-off design of the blade passing frequency in the full- 3 D configuration. In the inlet, the shocks built on the blades do not propagate as the corresponding <b>pressure</b> patterns are <b>cut-off.</b> However one can observe that the shock position moves back and forth during one revolution which certainly should influence the generation and propagation of buzz-saw noise going to the full- 3 D configuration...|$|R

40|$|Public {{expectations}} of lower environmental noise levels, and increasingly stringent legislative limits on aircraft noise, result in noise being a critical technical {{issue in the}} development of jet engines. Noise at take-off, when the engines are at high-power operating conditions, is a key reference level for engine noise certification. ‘‘Buzz-saw’’ noise is the dominant fan tone noise from modern high-bypass-ratio turbofan aircraft engines during take-off. Rotor-alone tones are the key component of buzz-saw noise. The rotor-alone <b>pressure</b> field is <b>cut-off</b> at subsonic fan tip speeds; buzz-saw noise is associated with supersonic fan tip speeds, or equivalently, high power engine operating conditions. A recent series of papers has described new work concerning the prediction of buzz-saw noise. The prediction method is based on modelling the nonlinear propagation of onedimensional sawtooth waveforms. A sawtooth waveform is a simplified representation of the rotor-alone pressure field. Previous validation of the prediction method focussed entirely on reproducing the spectral characteristics of buzz-saw noise; this was dictated at that time by the availability of spectral data only for comparison between measurement and prediction. In this paper, full validation of the method by comparing measurement and prediction of the rotor-alone pressure field is published for the first time. It is shown that results from the modelling based on a one-dimensional sawtooth waveform capture the essential features of the rotor-alone pressure field as it propagates upstream inside a hardwalled inlet duct. This verifies that predictions of the buzz-saw noise spectrum, which are in good agreement with the measured data, are based on a model which reproduces the key physics of the noise generation process. Validation results for the rotor-alone pressure field in an acoustically lined inlet duct are also shown. Comparisons of the measured and predicted rotor-alone pressure field are more difficult to interpret because the acoustic lining significantly modifies the sawtooth waveform, but there remains good agreement with the measured spectral data. The buzz-saw noise prediction code used to generate the simulations in this paper has been used by the Rolls–Royce Noise Department since 2004...|$|R
