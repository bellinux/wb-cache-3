5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the <b>prosecutor</b> general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the <b>prosecutor</b> general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the <b>prosecutor</b> general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E

The naming of <b>prosecutors</b> will shame bad actors, provide a valuable pedagogical lesson for junior <b>prosecutors,</b> and signal to trial judges that certain <b>prosecutors</b> must be monitored more closely to avoid future misconduct...|$|R
