40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{overview}} of the electroweak physics program of the SLD experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). A data sample of 550 K Z 0 decays has been collected. This experiment utilizes a highly polarized electron beam, a small interaction volume, and a very precise pixel vertex detector. It is the first experiment at a linear electron collider. We present a <b>preliminary</b> <b>result</b> for the weak mixing angle, sin 2 (θ eff W) = 0. 23110 ± 0. 00029. We also present a <b>preliminary</b> <b>result</b> for the parity violating parameter, Ab = 0. 898 ± 0. 029. These measurements are used to test for physics beyond th...|$|R
