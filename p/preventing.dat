5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, <b>preventing</b> new attacks, and <b>preventing</b> disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for <b>preventing</b> low back pain. Exercise is also {{probably}} effective in <b>preventing</b> recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in <b>preventing</b> low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} rate, error type, causes and {{clinical}} significance of unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents reported by Welsh National Health Service (NHS) hospital pharmacies. Methods: Details of all unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents occurring over 3 months (September–December 2005) at five district general hospitals across Wales were reported and analysed using a validated method. Rates of unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Reported error types, contributory factors and clinical significance of unprevented and <b>prevented</b> incidents were compared using Fisher's exact test. Key findings: Thirty-five unprevented and 291 <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents were reported amongst 221 670 items. The rate of unprevented (16 / 100 000 items) and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents (131 / 100 000 items; P = 0. 04) was significantly different. There {{was a significant}} difference in the proportions of <b>prevented</b> and unprevented dispensing incidents involving the wrong directions/warnings on the label (<b>prevented,</b> n = 100, 29 %; unprevented, n = 4, 10 %; P = 0. 02) and the wrong drug details on the label (<b>prevented,</b> n = 15, 4 %; unprevented, n = 6, 14 %; P = 0. 01). There {{was a significant difference}} in the proportions of <b>prevented</b> and unprevented dispensing incidents involving supply of the wrong strength (<b>prevented,</b> n = 46, 14 %; unprevented, n = 2, 5 %; P = 0. 02) and issue of expired medicines (<b>prevented,</b> n = 3, 1 %; unprevented, n = 5, 12 %; P = 0. 002). Conclusion: The use of <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents as a surrogate marker for unprevented incidents is questionable. There were significant differences between unprevented and <b>prevented</b> dispensing incidents in terms of rate and error types. This is consistent with the medication error iceberg. Care must be exercised when extrapolating <b>prevented</b> dispensing incident data on error types to unprevented dispensing incidents...|$|R
