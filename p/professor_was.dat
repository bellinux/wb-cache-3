5|$|Her first {{position}} as a <b>professor</b> <b>was</b> at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues {{because she had a}} husband with a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ <b>professor</b> <b>was</b> François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His <b>professor</b> <b>was</b> a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>professor</b> <b>is</b> {{also used}} in the titles {{assistant}} professor and associate <b>professor,</b> which <b>are</b> not considered professor-level positions in some European countries.

50|$|A <b>professor</b> <b>is</b> an {{accomplished}} and recognized academic. In most Commonwealth nations, {{as well as}} northern Europe, the title <b>professor</b> <b>is</b> the highest academic rank at a university. In the United States and Canada, the title of <b>professor</b> <b>is</b> also the highest rank, but a larger percentage achieve it. In these areas, <b>professors</b> <b>are</b> scholars with doctorate degrees (typically Ph.D. degrees) or equivalent qualifications who teach in four-year colleges and universities. An emeritus <b>professor</b> <b>is</b> a title given to selected retired professors with whom the university wishes {{to continue to be}} associated due to their stature and ongoing research. Emeritus professors do not receive a salary, but they are often given office or lab space, and use of libraries, labs, and so on.|$|R
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics <b>professor</b> <b>was</b> Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which Haushofer cited to justify the proposal that Germany should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the pillars of Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School <b>professor,</b> <b>was</b> {{elected as}} the congregation's first female president.

Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation {{decided to make the}} services fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions.|$|E
5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) {{taught the}} {{syllabus}} {{for the final}} examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the reputation of the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian <b>Professor</b> , <b>was</b> appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E

5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued {{common sense and}} fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite <b>professor</b> <b>was</b> James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E
5|$|In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial The Quatermass Memoirs, it is {{revealed}} that the <b>Professor</b> <b>was</b> first involved in rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade prequel serial Quatermass in the Third Reich, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee {{to escape from the}} country. According to The Quatermass Memoirs, during World War II Quatermass conducted top secret work for the British war effort, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.|$|E

Darshan Kumar was finalised as Kom's husband, footballer Onler Kom, after a series of auditions which included three different looks representing three different stages in his life.

5|$|In public, Hand {{discussed}} {{issues of}} democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus {{a series of}} impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he {{was viewed as a}} serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School <b>professor,</b> <b>was</b> among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor of physics at the University of California in 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor. Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a <b>professor,</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
