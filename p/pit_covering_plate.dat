This <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> is locked by a worker {{with the help of}} a spanner. This <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> again needs to be opened after completion of casting process for the extraction of the pipe from the mould. This paper discuss mainly focused on the analysis of locking plate and its new design so that the human interference must be reduced to higher extent. Thus large amount of time can be saved which in turn will increase the productivity & reduce the cost of production...|$|R

40|$|In Centrifugal Pipe Casting machine, hot {{molten metal}} is {{injected}} {{from one end}} and the other end remains closed. This <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> is locked by a worker {{with the help of}} a spanner. This <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> again needs to be opened after completion of casting process for the extraction of the pipe from the mould. The new and improved locking plate is designed by the industry but it is not having any automatic locking or unlocking arrangement. Also after some time <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> breaks because of high temperature. This project discuss mainly focused on the analysis of the same locking plate designed by the industry by using FEM and its remedies so that the human interference must be reduced to higher extent. Thus large amount of time can be saved which in turn will increase the productivity and reduce the cost of production. The design and analysis of a centrifugal casting lock plate is successfully carried out. The operation of the machine was based on the principle of centrifugal force. Suitable design theory, analysis and calculation were adopted carried out in the course of the work. The centrifugal force on the machine was determined to be around 70 N. A test was carried out on the FEM software’s and design is prepared in CAD package...|$|R

40|$|Bumping is a {{prerequisite}} for flip-chip attachment of bare dies. For silicon semiconductors bumping is normally performed on the ICs at wafer scale. Bumping can be performed by micro-plating or vacuum deposition techniques. Mechanical methods are also well-known. In this paper a bumping process based on tin/lead alloy plating is reported. The plating bath presented enables the deposition of both solder composition used for flip-chip attachment, the eutetic and the lead-rich. All key issues of the <b>plating</b> process <b>covering</b> <b>plating</b> equipment, electrolyte characteristics and plating process parameters are discussed. Methods of bump characterisation and quality assurance are reported as {{an important part of the}} bumping process.

50|$|In 1816, the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, {{which had}} earlier {{successfully}} adapted {{new technology to}} shipbuilding with the Charlotte Dundas, authorised {{the development of an}} all-iron ship, and they quickly settled upon building a canal barge. In 1818, Thomas Wilson (1781-1873), was hired as the shipwright. The barge was to be 20 metres (66.5 ft.) long and narrow enough for the canal. The design called for iron sectionals to be riveted together with <b>covering</b> <b>plates.</b> Two blacksmiths were hired to construct the parts. The plating had to be hammered out of puddled iron as no iron rolling mills existed at the time. The iron was supplied by the Monklands Steel Company.|$|R
50|$|Though still used, the conical type of helmet {{declined}} in popularity {{during the latter}} half of the 12th century and round-topped nasal helmets came into fashion. King Richard I of England is depicted wearing a round-skulled nasal helmet on his first Great Seal (1189). A further type of nasal helmet developed in the late 12th century. This helmet had a flat top and a square profile. This form of nasal helmet was the forerunner of deeper, cylindrical helmets with greater facial protection, enclosed helmets, and eventually the great helm. The existing nasal formed the basis for increased facial protection, eventually, by 1200, producing a face <b>covering</b> <b>plate</b> which was pierced for sight and ventilation.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate vibration signals of gears with tooth <b>pitting</b> <b>covering</b> multiple teeth, investigate pitting effects on vibration properties and provide effective features for pitting growth estimation. The scope of this paper is limited to a fixed-axis gearbox with a single pair of spur gears. A dynamic model is used to investigate the effects of tooth pitting growth on vibration properties of a gearbox. The tooth pitting propagation to the neighboring teeth is modeled. Three pitting levels are modeled: slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting. The vibration signals of a gearbox are simulated for each of the three severity levels. The vibration properties are investigated and fault symptoms are summarized. Statistical features are tested on simulated vibration signals. These features are ranked for pitting growth estimation. The features insensitive to gear mesh damping and environmental noise are recommended.|$|R

40|$|Construction of over-track {{buildings}} {{must be done}} {{safely and}} without affecting train operation. Steel frame construction in such construction involves risk of dropping steel frames or other loads onto the track level under artificial ground while hoisting and moving those, and thus it is often done {{in a short time}} at night when no trains are operated. But, such work process in a limited time slot is not efficient, being a major factor that increases the construction period for large-scale over-track buildings. In order to secure safety on the track level under artificial ground even if a steel frame is dropped, and consequently to expand the time in which work is done, we proposed measures using <b>covering</b> <b>plates</b> against to protect against damage in a possible drop of a steel frames, and we carried out drop tests and analytical verification of that method...|$|R

The SAM forms in the unusual (8 נv 3) - 4 superlattice, producing a very complex STM image. Seventy possible structures were considered for the SAM, with the calculated lowest-energy configuration in fact predicting {{the details of the}} unusual observed STM image. The most stable structure involves two R-S-Au-S-R adatom-mediated motifs per surface cell, with steric-induced variations in the adsorbate alignment inducing the observed STM image contrasts.
