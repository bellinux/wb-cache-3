25|$|The {{first step}} was the {{construction}} of a large shaft on the south bank at Rotherhithe, 150feet (46m) back from the river bank. It was dug by assembling an iron ring 50feet (15m) in diameter above ground. A brick wall 40feet (12m) high and 3feet (91cm) thick was built on top of this, with a powerful steam engine surmounting it to drive the excavation's pumps. The whole apparatus was estimated to weigh 1,000 tons. The soil below the ring's sharp lower edge was removed manually by Brunel's workers. The whole shaft thus gradually sank under its own weight, slicing through the soft ground rather like an enormous <b>pastry</b> <b>cutter.</b> The shaft became stuck at one point during its sinking as the pressure of the earth around it held it firmly in position. Extra weight was required to make it continue its descent; 50,000 bricks were added as temporary weights. It was realised that the problem was caused because the shaft's sides were parallel; years later when the Wapping shaft was built, it was slightly wider at the bottom than the top. This non-cylindrical tapering design ensured it did not get stuck. By November 1825 the Rotherhithe shaft was in place and tunnelling work could begin.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{synthetic}} leathers called pormerics were first introduced, and together with fabrics these also had lines of stretch and tension, being {{based on a}} traditional woven base having threads of warp and weft. Following the introduction of electrical/mechanised presses, the sounds changed entirely to a heavy thump and/or crack, with the board pattern with hand-knife being replaced by a 'knife' similar to a <b>pastry</b> <b>cutter,</b> although the operator still needed to learn hand-clicking {{as part of the}} training.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{thinking}} is that [...] "moist" [...] sugar meant dark muscovado, while the lemon may be shredded (after removal of the pips) instead of [...] "boiling and mincing". Once the basic tart is baked and setting, thought is then given to a decorative finish. The original [...] "cross bar over" [...] is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top, but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool's Liver Bird {{in one form or}} another. It is possible to buy bespoke <b>pastry</b> <b>cutters</b> which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste. While these produce the most attractive tarts, they do add yet another level of sweetness, and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms. Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template, which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart, then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view. This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness.|$|R

40|$|Since {{you last}} savoured the sweet words of this column, your trusty chef has packed her <b>pastry</b> <b>cutter,</b> pepper grinder and pans {{and headed for}} Canberra.

Whether I emerge as pap grey as the average Canberra backyard remains to be seen...|$|E
