5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away.

5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> armor of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
5|$|From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson {{worked in}} the {{operational}} counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sega {{redesigned}} the Mark III {{for release}} in North America as the Sega Master System. This {{was followed by}} a European release the next year. Although the Master System was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by Nintendo. With Sega continuing to have difficulty <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> home market, Sega's console R team, led by Masami Ishikawa and supervised by Hideki Sato, began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after that console launched.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1944, the Strachwitz Battle Group {{consisting}} of the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions and tanks, attacked the flanks of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps south of the Tallinn railway, supported by an air strike. The tanks led the attack and the East Prussian grenadiers followed, <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> fortified positions of the Soviet rifle corps. By {{the end of the}} day, the Soviet 72nd and parts of the 109th Rifle Corps in the Westsack (west sack) of the bridgehead were encircled. The rest of the Soviet rifle corps retreated, shooting the local civilians who had been used for carrying ammunition and supplies from the rear.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} was that it {{have the ability to}} penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets.

5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from the various flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and are indications that the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E

His Raider Battalion, with two {{companies}} of the 1st Parachute Battalion attached, were sent to a ridge line a short distance south of Henderson Field. Here, they were supposed to get a short rest but Japanese forces unexpectedly attacked the position on the first evening, <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> left center of his line of resistance, forcing a withdrawal to a reserve position.|$|E

5|$|Although the Panzer IV was {{deployed}} to north Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until the longer gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III {{with respect to}} armor penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> British Matilda II's thick armor, while the Matilda's 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; its major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, armed with the L/43 gun, which he {{deployed to}} spearhead his armored offensives. The longer gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , {{by that time the}} most heavily armored of which was the M3 Grant. Although more of these tanks arrived in North Africa between August and October 1942, their numbers were insignificant compared to the amount of matériel shipped to British forces.|$|E

He aids them in <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. During the final battle, the emperor manages to knock S'jet into a coma, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world {{in contrast to the}} desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, the awakened Karan insists to be the last one to set foot on the planet.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E

The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, San Martino {{collided}} with Regina Maria Pia {{and had her}} ram bow twisted, causing leaks in her hull. Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. San Martino had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which {{did not succeed in}} <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew was able to put the fires out. After the battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Lacking any {{reserves}} and possessing only limited artillery support, the division's engineers prepared the bridges over the rivers for detonation. From 27 March onwards minor actions were fought {{along the line}} as the German advance began to reach the Australians. On 30 March a serious attempt at <b>penetrating</b> <b>the</b> line around Sailly-Laurette was held and broken up by the 11th Brigade, with German losses being assessed at around {{one and a half}} brigades, or roughly between 3 and 4,000 men. On 6 April further attempts were made and in the confusion the charges that had been placed on the Bouzencourt Bridge were fired and it was dropped into the Somme Canal. Nevertheless, the attempt was beaten off by the 10th Brigade. Following this the Australians were able to begin taking the initiative and throughout May they began to slowly recapture some of the ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of peaceful penetration operations.|$|E
