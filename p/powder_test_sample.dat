The study presented herein presents parallel field and laboratory studies conducted at Iowa State University to determine if MMFX reinforcement provides superior corrosion resistance to epoxy-coated mild steel reinforcement in bridge decks.

40|$|In {{classical}} sparse representation based classification and weighted SRC algorithms, the <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> are sparely {{represented by}} all training samples. They emphasize the sparsity of the coding coefficients but without considering the local {{structure of the}} input data. To overcome the shortcoming, aiming at the difficult problem of plant leaf recognition on the large-scale database, a two-stage local similarity based classification learning method is proposed by combining local mean-based classification method and local WSRC. In the first stage, LMC is applied to coarsely classifying the <b>test</b> <b>sample.</b> nearest neighbors of the <b>test</b> <b>sample,</b> as a neighbor subset, is selected from each training class, then the local geometric center of each class is calculated. S candidate neighbor subsets of the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> are determined with the first smallest distances between the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> and each local geometric center. In the second stage, LWSRC is proposed to approximately represent the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> through a linear weighted sum of all samples of the candidate neighbor subsets. The rationale of the proposed method is as follows: the first stage aims to eliminate the training samples that are far from the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> and assume that these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision, then select the candidate neighbor subsets of the <b>test</b> <b>sample.</b> Thus the classification problem becomes simple with fewer subsets; the second stage pays more attention to those training samples of the candidate neighbor subsets in weighted representing the <b>test</b> <b>sample.</b> This is helpful to accurately represent the <b>test</b> <b>sample.</b> Experimental results on the leaf image database demonstrate that the proposed method not only has a high accuracy and low time cost, but also can be clearly interpreted.
