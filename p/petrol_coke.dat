40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{to measure}} compressive creep in carbon materials has been developed. Using the final experimental set-up five material properties could {{be measured in}} each electrolysis experiment. Creep, sodium expansion, compressive strength and E-modulus were measured for 3 commercial cathode materials at 25 and 980 °C with and without electrolysis. The sodium diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated from the sodium expansion results. Filler materials for cathode blocks, i. e., certain anthracite and <b>petrol</b> <b>coke</b> qualities, were exposed to sodium vapour to examine crack evolution. Creep The three commercial cathode materials were found to deform with time under compression at 25 °C, 980 °C and during electrolysis at 980 °C. Only samples from one block for each quality was studied, so {{care must be taken}} before extending the ranking to all classes of cathode materials. The ranking from low to high creep at 980 °C and during electrolysis was: Semigraphitized Semigraphitic > Anthracitic The diffusion coefficient increased with heat treatment temperature in some laboratory produced materials. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Refractories {{are a key}} {{component}} for cost effective and energetic sustainable processes. For instance, most important for the economic operation of industrial furnaces is the degree of thermal insulation. Refractories with a low bulk density and therefore low thermal conductivity are highly preferable. Thus, depending on the operation temperature thermal characteristics have to be tuned. There {{are a lot of}} possible porosity adjusting methods, e. g. the burnout of sawdust or <b>petrol</b> <b>coke,</b> gas injection approaches, inflation processes or the use of volatile additives and fiber structures. Now, the freeze-foaming as direct foaming technique shall be introduced as an environmentally friendly and cost effective way to refractories. In the present work an aqueous ceramic mullite suspension is f oamed within a few minutes by mere pressure reduction in a freeze drying device. During decreasing pressure the vapour pressure acts as the driving force for foaming. The foam structure is suddenly frozen when the suspension temperature, related to the vacuum pressure, reaches the liquid-solid equilibrium line. The porous structure is then dried thoroughly by sublimating the frozen water. The resulting large-sized foams (length x width x height, 235 x 114 x 70 mm in the green state) exhibit open porosity and dense struts. The open porosity provides an equal thermal distribution and the dense struts improve the mechanical properties. Just 5 - 10 wt. -% organic additives, required for stabile foaming, minimize the effect of crack formation during the sintering step and provide an environmentall y friendly and effective processing route to the final product. The pore morphology is being determined by X-ray computed tomographic images and mercury porosimetry. The measurement of the thermal conductivity has been carried out to evaluate a first benefit of the freeze-foaming process as a promising approach for manufacturing refractories...|$|E
40|$|AbstractArticle {{presents}} the dynamic {{analysis of the}} green anode processing building at Slovalco company {{in the city of}} Žiar nad Hronom. The production process contains anode cauterization, and then this anode is put into the air furnace and consumed during producing the primary aluminium by electrolytic process. Anodes are made of calcined <b>petrol</b> – <b>coke</b> and tar. The processing building is built as the steel frame structure, which contains steel girder platforms. The dynamic analysis contains two base steps, and that is the FEM model of the entire construction and the experimental measuring. The FEM model was created via software Scia Engineer vs. 2015. The FEM model comprises elements with designed dimensions of cross sections due to final design documentation. The platforms were modelled as the girder structures. Computing run was done via modal analysis. There were ten natural frequencies and ten modes of natural vibration as the results, in quite low frequency band. Six experimental measurement series were realized. The principal aim of dynamic response experimental measurements was detecting the vibration intensity of machines and the vibration frequency band of machines. These machines are in closeness to the restroom that is why the dynamic response of them was investigated. The vibration intensity was measured with the aim of checking the vibration effects on humans and on building structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} CGE model, {{calibrated}} to detailed Chinese emissions data, to assess two important questions. What can we reasonably expect Chinese emissions trends {{to look like}} {{over the next three}} decades? Secondly, what would be the appropriate policy interventions to flatten Chinese emissions trajectories and reduce the risk of local, regional, and even global adversity? This research is original in its direct use of the new industrial sector-level emissions and energy using data from China to estimate the energy-specific emission effluent rate and its detailed treatment of policies taking account of the three main determinants of pollution intensity: growth, output composition, and technological change. Our results indicate that, without further effective emission control measures, China’s economic growth {{over the next two decades}} will contribute significantly to SO 2 emission problems, in which the emission firstly increase from the rapid expansion of the transportation service sectors until 2018, then from the heavy industrialization process after 2018. With the potential technical progress, the emission burden will be centralized back to two energy sectors: electricity generation and <b>petrol</b> and <b>coke</b> refining during these two periods. Detailed examination of the structural and technological components of pollution shows that efficient pollution mitigation can be realized by focused abatement activities, cleaner production, and advances in cleaner fuel products and their use technologies.
