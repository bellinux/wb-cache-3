2500|$|Each {{address in}} the city is {{assigned}} a box number, based on the closest street, special building or highway box. The term [...] "box" [...] refers to the Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes,</b> which at one time lined street corners {{and in front of}} certain buildings. Each Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Box</b> was given a specific number by the FDNY's Bureau of Communications. Even if the physical fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> is no longer at a specific address or street corner, the address or street corner is still assigned that fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box's</b> number. Box numbers can be duplicated in different boroughs, which is why they are always identified by borough name or numerical prefix on the computer (66 for Bronx and Manhattan, 77 for Brooklyn, 88 for Staten Island and 99 for Queens). If there is also a street address given to the dispatchers, the responding apparatus will get this information in the firehouse, over the air, and via their mobile data terminals in the rigs, in addition to the Box number. At present there are about 16,000 physical fire <b>alarm</b> street <b>boxes</b> in New York City, with many additional special building boxes and highway boxes, as well as [...] "dummy boxes" [...] used for special response assignments. In addition there are two airport crash boxes, one in the LaGuardia Tower, (Queens Box 37), and one in the JFK Tower, (Queens Box 269), which can only be activated by the personnel in these towers. When either box is sounded it brings an automatic second alarm (2–2) response of equipment, along with various special units.|$|R
50|$|As {{applications}} of electricity broadened, Western Electric not only sold the electric bells and batteries, telegraph keys, fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> and hotel annunciators it originally manufactured, but also many items it purchased from other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The City Council of Chicago {{passed a}} law {{requiring}} that a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> be installed in front of schools and other public assembly venues. The interior fire alarm systems of these buildings must {{be connected to the}} street fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box.</b> Another requirement was that all schools where it was deemed vital would have sprinkler systems installed. However, nine months later, in September 1959, Fire Commissioner Quinn, when interviewed by WNBQ reporter Len O'Connor, admitted that although 400 of the 1040 schools in Chicago at that time had been deemed in critical need of sprinkler systems, only two had actually had sprinklers installed.|$|R
50|$|The Iroquois had no fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> or telephone. The Chicago Fire Department's Engine 13 was {{alerted to}} the fire by a stagehand who had been ordered to run from the burning theater to the nearest firehouse. On {{the way to the}} scene, at {{approximately}} 3:33 pm, a member of Engine 13 activated an <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> to call additional units. Initial efforts focused on the people trapped on the fire escapes. The alley {{to the north of the}} theater, known as Couch Place, was icy, narrow, and full of smoke. Aerial ladders could not be used in the alley and black nets, concealed by the smoke, proved useless.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} once housed {{an auxiliary}} generator system. Although {{the building was}} completed in 1931, it took three more years to complete the hookups to the <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> that were dipersed throughout the city. The system went into service in 1934.|$|R
25|$|The {{entire process}} from initial {{notification}} until a unit is dispatched {{can take up}} to two (2) minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by the caller(s) and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all busy or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> is not answered with 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{nursing home}} was {{equipped}} with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> located on each floor and one fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> located {{at the entrance of}} the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-one days later, James J. Mulcahey {{was elected}} the first paid Chief of Department. Additionally, {{with the new}} paid fire {{department}} in place, the YFD Telegraph Bureau {{was established in the}} Palisade Avenue Firehouse. A large number of fire <b>alarm</b> signal <b>boxes</b> were placed in various locations throughout Yonkers. 38 Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> and 40 miles of telegraph wire made up the system. On September 1, 1896, the first roll call of the Yonkers Fire Department was called. In October 1897, 5 paid firemen were added to the firehouse on Vineyard Avenue (Station 2).|$|R
50|$|By 1935 a {{fire brigade}} and {{ambulances}} {{were available to}} protect the town during emergencies. The Gamewell system of fire alarms was used and consisted of 16 <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> spread throughout the district. Three motor ambulances and a motorised utility van were kept at the fire station, operated by permanent staff.|$|R
2500|$|Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> are {{the second}} most common method of {{contacting}} the fire department. FDNY fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> are located on certain street corners and in certain public buildings such as schools and hospitals, as well as along highways, on bridges, etc. These boxes primarily consist of two types: The first is the mechanical box (also commonly called a pull-box or a telegraph box) in which a spring-wound mechanism alternately opens and closes an electrical circuit, thereby rendering a coded number linked to the specific location of the box. Until the advent of the Starfire [...] "Computer-Assisted Dispatch System" [...] (CADS), dispatchers had to audibly count the taps from mechanical boxes when they were received in the central offices to decipher the number of the box that was pulled. Today, a [...] "Box Alarm Readout System" [...] (BARS) display handles that aspect of the job; The second type is the [...] "Emergency Reporting System" [...] (ERS) box that is equipped with buttons to notify either the FDNY or the NYPD, allowing either department's dispatcher to have direct voice communication with the reporting party. Beginning in the 1970s, ERS boxes started to replace mechanical boxes {{in many areas of the}} city, particularly where the number of false <b>alarms</b> involving mechanical <b>boxes</b> were high. In December 1994, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Fire Commissioner Howard Safir began a concerted effort to remove all of the mechanical and ERS boxes throughout New York City in a cost-cutting move. Facing stiff opposition from members of the city council, community groups, dispatchers and others, the move was blocked by court order as being discriminatory against the disabled (i.e., particularly the speech- and/or hearing-impaired) who – along with the poor – might otherwise have no dependable way to report fires and emergencies if the <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> were eliminated. (In addition, unlike many other cities in the world, it was noted that 117 different languages and dialects are spoken by the residents of and visitors to the city. Since, unlike telephones, a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> requires no verbal contact to indicate its exact location, a person would not have to be able to speak – at all – or to understand English in order to alert the FDNY to a fire or emergency. For this reason, as well, the boxes were recognized as being vital to New Yorkers' safety.) The court order to block the removal of the boxes provided a means for people to report emergencies during the 2003 blackout when other forms of communication were cut off. The fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> independent of outside power, continued to function the entire time.|$|R
5000|$|Manually {{actuated}} devices; {{also known}} as fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> manual pull stations, or simply pull stations, break glass stations, and (in Europe) call points. Devices for manual fire alarm activation are installed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated. They are usually actuated by means of physical interaction, such as pulling a lever or breaking glass.|$|R
50|$|The Great Salem Fire {{started with}} a series of explosions, caused by a mixture of acetone, amalacitate, alcohol, and celluloid. At 1:37 p.m. (EDT) on June 25, 1914, a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>box</b> was used to report a fire in the Korn Leather Factory at 57 Boston Street. A {{memorial}} plaque now exists on the site, now occupied by a Walgreens store.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplicity}} of telegraph <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> and their associated networks {{means that they}} are able to operate under conditions (such as a lengthy or widespread power outage, a natural disaster, or any emergency causing many people to attempt to contact others simultaneously) which may disrupt or disable other communication systems such as landline phones, cellular phones, and emergency services' radio systems.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 Chief Dooley {{requested}} the department build its third fire station at 1022 W. Las Olas Blvd {{at a cost}} just over $21,000. This west side fire station, later renamed as station 8, served the department until 2004, when it was closed and its crews moved to the new station 2. It is being renovated as the Fort Lauderdale Fire Museum. Also in 1926 as part of Chief Dooley’s improvements to the fire department was {{the purchase of the}} department's first ladder truck, a 1926 Seagrave Fire Apparatus ladder truck with chemical equipment, at a cost of $9,500. The final improvement Chief Dooley implemented was the installation of a Gamewell fire alarm system with a central monitoring station, and 40 call boxes to be installed at locations throughout the city. By 1932, the number of fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> had increased to over 60, and was further increased in 1937 to 71 fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> with 15 more added to the growing city in 1941.|$|R

25|$|Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> were installed in the downtown area. These fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|R
50|$|A {{month after}} Clarke's {{election}} to State Senate, Providence's popular mayor Thomas A. Doyle left the Republican Party {{to run as}} an independent. The Republican party drafted Clarke to run against him. Clarke won in a three-way race, but Doyle returned to defeat Clarke the following year, winning by a two-to-one margin.During Clarke's time as mayor, a system of fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> were installed in Providence. The Sockanosset Reservoir was begun, and Dexter Asylum was enlarged. A major hurricane struck the city on September 8, 1869, which caused much damage and flooding in downtown Providence.|$|R
50|$|From their {{organization}} to 1894, {{the two companies}} operated independently although working close together. When Ansonia became a separate Town from Derby in 1889, the two fire departments continued to operate separately. The Borough of Ansonia financed the Eagle Hose, while the West Ansonia Fire District financed the Fountain Hose. Shortly after Ansonia was incorporated as a Town, the current street <b>box</b> fire <b>alarm</b> notification system was installed on the east side. The West Ansonia Fire District purchased a few fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> for their district to be tied into the system.|$|R
50|$|The Tulsa Fire Alarm Building is a {{historic}} Art Deco building at 1010 East Eighth Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was built in 1931 and served as the central reporting station for the Tulsa Fire Department. Fires were reported from <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes</b> spread around town to this building and the firemen in this building would alert the fire station closest to the fire. At {{the time of its}} construction this system was the best available alarm system. The building is just east of the Inner Dispersal Loop in Tulsa's Pearl District.|$|R
5000|$|On July 17, 1980, all Fire <b>Alarm</b> <b>Boxes</b> {{were removed}} from street corners, as the city deemed it too costly to repair the system. On September 15, 1980, Station 2 (quarters of Engine Co. 302 and Engine Co. 305) on Vineyard Avenue was {{permanently}} closed due to structural issues. Because of this, Engine Co. 302 was relocated to Station 9 on Shonnard Place and Engine Co. 305 was relocated to Station 1-Fire Headquarters on New School Street. In December 1980, the title of Chief of Department was replaced with [...] "Fire Commissioner".|$|R
25|$|As the {{manufacturing}} branch expanded, its production ability increased beyond {{the demand for}} phones, and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products. This was a problem because the Bell Telephone Company of Canada's (later renamed to Bell Canada) charter would {{not allow them to}} build other products. So in 1895, the Bell Telephone of Canada was required to spin off its manufacturing arm to build phones for sale to other companies, as well as other devices such as fire <b>alarm</b> <b>boxes,</b> police street call boxes, and fire department call equipment. This company was incorporated as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the Gamewell Company of Newton, Massachusetts {{manufactured}} fire <b>alarm</b> call <b>boxes</b> {{beginning in}} the 1880s. These would telegraph a location code to the central firestation when a lever was pulled in the box.|$|R
