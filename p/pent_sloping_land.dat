40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this study was to}} understand the cognitions of people on policy of reforestation in <b>slope</b> <b>land</b> and afforestation in lowland. The forest functions and policy issues were designed by questionnaire and were surveyed in Taichung city. A total of 399 valid questionnaires were obtained. The sort of importance of forest functions between <b>slope</b> <b>land</b> and lowland were examined by the Friedman method and Hollander-Wolfe test and the results appeared inconsistent between these two areas. The forest functions of 'conservation of soil' and 'conservation of water' showed most important in slope land; whereas, 'carbon sequestration' and 'conservation of water' revealed most important in lowland. However, we also found that most people can not understand the detail items of policy concerning reforestation and afforestation. The important and urgent degrees were measured and compared for reforestation in <b>slope</b> <b>land</b> and afforestation in lowland and showed reforestation in <b>slope</b> <b>land</b> had a high fraction in importance and urgency. Moreover, this study provided three alternatives for selecting as forest planting 20 years later. We found most people supported that 'government continues to reward but to avoid cutting' for <b>slope</b> <b>land</b> (69. 8 %); 'government continues to reward and to allow cutting' for lowland (44. 1 %). 本研究的目的在探討民眾對於山坡地及平地造林政策的認知，以問卷方式設計森林功能和相關政策議題，並於臺中市進行調查，經問卷調查結果共獲得有效問卷 399 份。森林功能在山坡地及平地之重要性排序採用Friedman法及Hollander-Wolfe檢測，所得之結果呈現此兩區位在森林功能的重要性上呈現不一致的現象，民眾認為森林的功能以「國土保安」和「涵養水源」在山坡地最為重要，然而在平地則以「碳吸存」和「涵養水源」最為重要。此外，大部份的民眾對於造林政策之詳細項目並不瞭解。山坡地造林及平地造林之重要性及迫切性經比較之結果顯示民眾認為山坡地造林不論重要性及迫切性均較平地造林為高。對於獎勵年限 20 年屆滿後，本研究提供三種方案供民眾選擇，大部份民眾支持在山坡地造林年滿 20 年後政府繼續獎勵造林，但應限制其在成林後不得伐採（ 69. 8 %）；在平地造林年滿 20 年後政府繼續獎勵造林，但容許伐採後再造林（ 44. 1 %）...|$|R

To restore degraded <b>sloping</b> <b>land,</b> the Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection of DPR of Korea (MoLEP), the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), have been promoting the multi-purpose use of trees to transform landscapes and livelihoods using a participatory approach.

The {{purposes of this}} study were to determine the diversity level of soil macrofauna on different patterns of <b>sloping</b> <b>land</b> agroforestry, in Wonogiri District, Central Java, and to find out the relationship between environmental factors and the level of soil macrofauna diversity. The study was conducted by sampling at three different patterns of agroforestry, namely: pattern of mixed agroforestry (PAC), pattern of teak agroforestry (PAJ), and the pattern of sengon agroforestry (PAS). The field sampling used two methods, namely pit fall traps to obtain above ground macrofauna, and hand sorting methods to obtain underground macrofauna, on <b>land</b> <b>slope</b> of 39 %, 35 %, and 27 %. The data were collected to determine the diversity index of soil macrofauna; and the environmental factors were also measured. The relationship between environmental factors and the diversity index of soil macrofauna was presented in Pearson's correlation analysis. The results showed that the pattern of <b>sloping</b> <b>land</b> agroforestry in Wonogiri District, Central Java had different diversity index of soil macrofauna. The average diversity index of surface macrofauna was the PAC (0. 710), PAS (0661), and PAJ (0. 417).
