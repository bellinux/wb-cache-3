40|$|Abstract. This paper exposes a novel {{formulation}} of <b>prior</b> <b>shape</b> con-straint incorporation for the level set segmentation of objects from cor-rupted images. Applicable to variational frameworks, the proposed scheme consists in weighting the <b>prior</b> <b>shape</b> constraint by {{a function of}} time and space to overcome local minima issues of the energy func-tional. Pose parameters which make the <b>prior</b> <b>shape</b> constraint invariant from global transformations are estimated by the downhill simplex algo-rithm, which is more tractable and robust than the traditional gradient descent. The proposed scheme is simple, easy to implement and can be generalized to any variational approach incorporating a single <b>prior</b> <b>shape.</b> Results illustrated with different kinds of images demonstrate the efficiency of the method. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{design an}} {{effective}} <b>shape</b> <b>prior</b> embedded human silhou-ettes extraction algorithm. Human silhouette extraction is found chal-lenging because of articulated structures, pose variations, and back-ground clutters. Many segmentation algorithms, including the Min-Cut algorithm, meet difficulties in human silhouette extraction. We aim at im-proving {{the performance of}} the Min-Cut algorithm by embedding <b>shape</b> <b>prior</b> knowledge. Unfortunately, seeking <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> automatically is not trivial especially for human silhouettes. In this work, we present a shape sequence matching method that searches for the best path in spatial-temporal domain. The path contains <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> of human sil-houettes that can improve the segmentation. Matching shape sequences in spatial-temporal domain is advantageous over finding <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> by matching <b>shape</b> templates with a single likelihood frame because errors can be avoided by searching for the global optimization in the domain. However, the matching in spatial-temporal domain is computationally intensive, which makes many shape matching methods impractical. We propose a novel shape matching approach that has low computational complexity independent of the number of shape templates. In addition, we investigate on how to make use of <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> in a more adequate way. Embedding <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> into the Min-Cut algorithm based on distances from shape templates is lacking because Euclidean distances cannot rep-resent shape knowledge in a fully appropriate way. We embed distance and orientation information of <b>shape</b> <b>priors</b> simultaneously into the Min-Cut algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and practical. Compared with previous works, our silhouettes extraction system produces better segmentation results. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work proposes {{an image}} {{segmentation}} model based on active contours. For a better handling of regions where anatomical structures are poorly contrasted and/or missing, we propose to incorporate a priori shape {{information in a}} variational formulation. Based on a level set approach, the proposed functional is composed of four terms. The first one makes the level set keep the important signed distance function property, which is necessary to guarantee the good level set evolution. Doing so results in avoiding the classical re-initialization process, contrary to most existing works where a partial differential equation is used instead. The second energy term contains the a priori information about admissible shapes of the target object, the latter being integrated in the level set evolution. An energy that drives rapidly the level set towards objects of interest is defined in the third term. A last term is defined on <b>prior</b> <b>shapes</b> thanks to a complete and modified Mumford-Shah model. The segmentation model is derived by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations associated to the functional minimization.
