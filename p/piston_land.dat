40|$|Carbonaceous {{deposits}} {{have long}} plagued the internal combustion engine, yet a fundamental comprehension of their underlying causes {{remains to be}} developed. In particular, <b>piston</b> <b>land</b> deposits can bring about an array of problems; for example, once a thickness threshold is crossed, the engine's reliability is threatened by an elevated possibility of seizure. As tightening emissions regulations continue to place more stringent constraints on power cylinder design, control of piston deposits, specifically in the top land and top ring groove, is becoming ever more difficult. Tests run on a heavy duty diesel engine revealed the <b>piston</b> <b>land</b> carbon deposit distribution to be circumferentially nonuniform, and a theoretical inquiry was invoked to investigate the cause. Since these deposits are typically lubricant derived, a three-dimensional, unsteady model of the oil film attached to a <b>piston</b> <b>land</b> was formulated. Focus {{was placed on the}} top land, in order to explore the effects of both reciprocating inertia and combustion-driven gas flows on the film's motion and thickness distribution. The numerical simulation created uses results from a realistic CFD simulation of the combustion process as input data. It was found that the gas velocities can have a profound effect.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of lubricating oil in internal combustion engines is a continuous interest for engine developers and {{remains to be}} one of the least understood areas. A better understanding on oil transport is critical to an optimization of engine designs, and advanced analytical tools are essential to the achievement of reduced frictions without compromising oil consumption. Oil transport from piston lands to a liner, hereafter called "bridging", has been observed in engine tests. The additional oil transferred to the liner becomes a potential source of oil consumption through ring-liner interaction. Thus, it is important to develop more quantitative models to better analyze bridging. The objective of this work is to obtain a more in-depth understanding on the oil transport between piston lands and liner and provide quantitative models of the oil transport mechanisms. Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was employed together with analyses of experimental observations. Three categories of bridging were identified: assisted bridging, self-sustained bridging, and reverse bridging. While assisted bridging involves an axial oil flow across an entire <b>piston</b> <b>land,</b> the other two phenomena are localized and become prominent at low engine speeds. The mechanisms of each phenomenon were analyzed in this work. Correlations and theoretical models were developed to associate the risk of bridging with geometrical designs of a piston and operating conditions of an engine. Particularly, the theoretical model of self-sustained bridging contributes to the optimization of geometrical designs of the third land of a piston ring pack. This work constitutes a major step towards a further quantification of oil transport. Some findings and models presented in this work can readily contribute to providing optimal solutions to certain piston regions. Furthermore, the results of this work serve broader purposes in providing boundary conditions to other interactions in a piston ring pack. by Tianshi Fang. Thesis: S.

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the primary interests for the automotive industry in controlling emissions and reducing service cost. Due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of oil transport along the piston, reducing {{oil consumption}} from the ring pack of internal combustion engines has been extremely challenging for engine manufacturers and suppliers. This work addressed the fundamental aspects of oil transport in the piston ring pack through experiments and modeling. A two-dimensional multiple-dye Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) visualization system was successfully implemented in a diesel and a spark-ignition engine. Real time high resolution images of the ring pack oil distribution were acquired and analyzed for the entire range of operating conditions typically encountered by passenger car engines. Based on experimental observations, major oil flow patterns in the piston ring pack were identified and characterized. Physically based models were proposed to describe each individual oil transport process, such as, oil flows on the <b>piston</b> <b>lands</b> in both axial and circumferential directions and oil flows through the ring grooves and gaps. Modeling results showed good agreement with the experimental data. (cont.) Then, using the individual oil transport models, the contributions of the different oil transport mechanisms to oil flow in and between the piston regions and the effects of piston and ring designs were analyzed. Finally, a global oil transport scheme was presented by integrating all major paths and mechanisms of oil transport along the piston. It highlighted that the rate at which oil is lost to the combustion chamber is mostly determined by the competing oil transport processes occurring on the <b>piston</b> <b>lands.</b> While the effect of the inertia force results in a net oil flow toward the top of the piston, the dragging action of the blow-by gases removes oil from the <b>piston</b> <b>lands</b> and recycles it to the crankcase. This work was the first comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of oil transport in the piston ring pack of internal combustion engines. It constitutes a major step in the development of analytical tools for oil consumption reduction. by Benoist Thirouard. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>landing</b> value of <b>piston.</b> Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the pneumatic cylinder piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the <b>landing</b> value of <b>piston</b> due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the pneumatic cylinder through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the pneumatic cylinder piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the piston and rod cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the pneumatic cylinder piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the <b>landing</b> of <b>piston</b> has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the pneumatic cylinder, have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of <b>piston</b> <b>landing</b> was conducted using the pneumatic cylinder with piston and rod diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the pneumatic cylinder axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a landing value. The article shows the calculated data of <b>piston</b> <b>landing,</b> which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the <b>piston</b> <b>landing</b> for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of electro-pneumatic control system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of oil loss past pistons {{was investigated in}} a laboratory test rig in which a piston was both reciprocated and subjected to gas pressures. The investigation brought to light the following facts and {{it is believed that}} this is the first time that they have been demonstrated: (1) Oil control is a two-way and not a one-way problem. The only reason why the rate of oil consumption is reasonably small in most engines is that, although a large amount of oil flows towards the combustion chamber past the rings during part of the engine cycle, nearly all of it returns to the sump during the remainder of the cycle. (2) The various routes permit surprisingly large rates of oil flow in both directions past rings. This applies even with good rings. (3) If oil is added to the combustion chamber, a good ring arrangement will pass it to the sump at a rate up to many thousand times larger than the normal rate of oil consump-tion with the same arrangement. (4) The <b>piston</b> <b>lands,</b> and the top land in particular, play an important role in deciding the rate of oil consumption. If some oil has passed the rings it may be thrown into the com-bustion chamber and be lost; alternatively, an effective top land may retain this oil until by one method or another it is returned to the sump...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To assess piston’s thermal loads, {{the direct}} and {{effective}} method is to calculate piston’s temperature distribution. A key point in calculating the temperature field of a piston is the determination of heat transfer boundary conditions of each side, especially the gas side. The thermal boundaries of a piston consist of the piston top side (combustion side), the crevice surfaces, the <b>piston</b> ring <b>land</b> and skirt outside surface, piston underside and pin hole side. The calculating methods for the heat transfer boundary conditions of engine piston are studied according to the theoretical analysis of heat transfer of engine piston, which can {{be taken as a}} reference for providing precise boundary conditions for the research on piston’s temperature field...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{experiments}} and a simulation study are completed {{to quantify the}} effect of the piston crevice on engine efficiency. The simulation study breaks down the loss mechanisms on brake efficiency at different displacement volumes (300 - 500 cc) and compression ratios (8 - 20). Experiments focus on indicated efficiencies for a narrow range of compression ratios (9. 24 - 12. 57) with different piston crevice volumes. Piston crevice volume is increased in two steps by machining a groove into the <b>piston</b> top <b>land,</b> and is decreased by raising the top ring. Indicated efficiency is measured at various loads (0. 4 - 1. 0 bar MAP), speeds (1500, 2000, 2500 rpm), and coolant temperatures (50 °C and 80 °C). All data points compared in this study are recorded at MBT timing with a relative air-fuel ratio ([gamma]) of 1. For the baseline case (CR = 9. 24, speed = 2000 rpm, coolant = 80 °C), increased crevice volume results in an indicated efficiency degradation of 0. 3 - 0. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3. This absolute decrease corresponds to a 1. 2 - 1. 5 % relative decrease for a 100 % increase in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Decreasing crevice volume leads to a gain in indicated efficiency of 2. 3 - 3. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3, which corresponds to a 6. 9 - 11. 8 % relative increase for a 100 % decrease in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Results of the experimental investigation, when compared across compression ratio, engine speed, and coolant temperature, show that the crevice effect on efficiency is largely independent of these three parameters. Large gains from decreased piston crevice volume prompt renewed discussions on <b>piston</b> top <b>land,</b> top ring, and crown design. by Patrick M. Smith. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the small size cogeneration gas engine (6 cylinders, 122 mm bore, 142 mm stroke) modified for unscavenged prechamber ignition was experimentally investigated. The objective was to evaluate the potential to reduce the exhaust gas emissions, particulary the CO emissions, below the Swiss limits (NOx and CO emissions: 250 and 650 mg/m 3 N, 5 % O 2, respectively), without exhaust gas after treatment, through variations of the prechamber geometrical configuration (size, number, distribution and orientation of the nozzle orifices and prechamber internal volume and shape). The results indicate that trends which increase the penetration of the gas jets and/or promote an early arrival of the flame front at the <b>piston</b> top <b>land</b> crevice entrance (small total nozzle orifice cross sectional area, limited number of nozzle orifices, an orientation of the nozzle orifices towards the squish region, relatively large prechamber internal volume) are benificial to reduce the CO and THC emissions.

The objective was to evaluate the potential to reduce the exhaust gas emissions, particularly the CO emissions, below the Swiss limits (NOx and CO emissions: 250 and 650 mg/m 3 N, 5 % O 2, respectively), without exhaust gas after treatment. The investigation was carried out on a small size gas engine (6 cylinders, 122 mm bore, 142 mm stroke) and required the development of cooled prechambers and the modification of the engine cylinder heads. The approach was essentially experimental, but included a numerical simulation based on the CFD-code KIVA- 3 V in order to assist and guide the experimentation. The numerical simulation {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the differences in flow characteristics at the location of the spark plug electrodes between direct and prechamber ignition. Further, the influence of the prechamber geometrical configuration was investigated through variations of the nozzle orifice diameter, number and orientation, as well as prechamber volume and internal shape. Based on the results of the numerical simulation, the most promising prechamber configuration parameters were selected for experimentation. Then, variations of the selected prechamber configuration parameters, {{as well as of the}} piston geometry, of the turbocharger characteristics and of the engine operating parameters, were carried out in order to determine their influence on the engine performance and emissions. Through the generation of gas jets in the main chamber, the use of a prechamber strongly intensifies and accelerates the combustion process. However, this advantage is conditioned by a significant delay of the spark timing in order to generate substantial gas jets. This results in a large decrease in peak cylinder pressure and in an important reduction of NOx, CO and THC emissions. Minimum emissions are achieved at a spark timing of about 8 °CABTDC. The prechamber geometrical parametric study indicates that trends which increase the penetration of the gas jets and/or promote an early arrival of the flame front at the <b>piston</b> top <b>land</b> crevice entrance are beneficial to reduce the CO and THC emissions. In comparison with the direct ignition, the prechamber ignition yields approximately 40 % and 55 % less CO and THC emissions, respectively. However, this also leads to about 2 %-point lower fuel conversion efficiency. The optimisation of the turbocharger results in a recovery of about 1 %-point in fuel conversion efficiency, but a consequent change in the exhaust manifold gas dynamics causes an increase in THC emissions. At the rated power output (150 kW), the prechamber ignition operation fulfils the Swiss requirements for exhaust gas emissions and still achieves a fuel conversion efficiency higher than 36. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Fretting {{phenomenon}} {{occurs when}} two bodies in contact undergo small repetitive relative motion {{such that the}} localized surface and subsurface material properties are altered leading to damage or failures. Fretting conditions are obtained by controlling externally applied parameters such as load, frequency of displacement, displacement amplitude. Material properties which influence fretting behavior include hardness, ductility, hardening behavior. External parameters like surface roughness, temperature {{also play a role}} in deciding the extent of damage. Based on fretting conditions and specimen geometry, various fretting modes can be classified. Rotational fretting is one such damage mode, observed in industrial applications such as cable ropes under tension used for support in construction industry and variable stator vanes (VSVs) in compressors of turbines. In spite of industrial and engineering relevance, rotational fretting has received little attention. In the present work, rotational fretting of self-mated AISI 4340 material pair was studied, with the objective of characterizing subsurface damage induced by fretting. AISI 4340 (EN 24) is a low alloy martensitic steel with an excellent combination of strength, ductility and toughness. It is widely used in high strength cyclic loading applications like gears, bearings, automobile <b>pistons</b> and aircraft <b>landing</b> gears as well as in low corrosion, high strength offshore applications. It can be readily machined and surface hardened which makes it useful for wear related applications. A novel rotational fretting test set up, capable of operating under various test loads, frequencies, displacement amplitudes and temperatures was used to perform experiments. Specimens were subjected to a combination of normal load and rotational displacement and caused to mutually contact on non-conformal curved surfaces which simulate a bearing or bushing geometry. Fretting results were primarily determined by the frictional torque versus angular displacement plots. The running condition response was linked to the fretting material response regime. Surface and subsurface characterization studies of fretted regions were conducted using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). TEM studies revealed varying levels of fretting induced plastic deformation within the fretted contact zone. Good correlation with available literature relating to formation of dislocation cells and presence of high dislocation density in the fretting damaged regions was established. Although quantifying the dislocation density as a damage indicator is a challenge, it is proposed that a microstructural feature based approach {{has the potential to be}} developed into a useful tool for life assessment and life prediction studies.
