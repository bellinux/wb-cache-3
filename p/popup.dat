During spring training, he was banned from the Indians' training camp after not running out a <b>popup</b> a game earlier. On April 3, 2004, he was traded to the Dodgers for Franklin Gutiérrez and a player to be named later (Andrew Brown); the Akron Beacon Journal later reported that manager Eric Wedge had insisted that Bradley be traded.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (<b>popup</b> stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{phishing}} attempts can {{be easy to}} spot {{because the}} malicious page's URL will usually {{be different from the}} real site link.

25|$|Covert {{redirect}} is {{a subtle}} method to perform phishing attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in <b>popup</b> based on an affected site's domain. It can affect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID based on well-known exploit parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect and XSS vulnerabilities in the third-party application websites.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special <b>popup</b> tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

On June 22, he was told that the injury might require season-ending surgery. [...] On September 6, ESPN reported that Davis was rehabbing his ankle and would not need surgery.|$|E
500|$|The port's visuals {{were well}} received. IGN's Peter Eykemans commended the {{smoother}} textures, especially condensed on a mobile screen, while Destructoid's Jim Sterling noted {{improvements in the}} character and vehicle models. Mark Walton of GameSpot wrote that the game runs well on high-end devices like the Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy S II, but noticed significant frame rate and texture issues on the Xperia Play. Pocket Gamers Mark Brown identified the game's short draw distance leading to sudden <b>popup,</b> although still found that the models and textures [...] "have been given a tune-up" [...] in the port.|$|E
500|$|The port's visuals {{received}} {{a positive response}} from reviewers.

IGN's Blevins similarly criticised the necessity of an advanced system for stable play, but ultimately felt that the port looks [...] "a bit nicer" [...] than the original game. GameSpy's Sal Accardo felt that the port [...] "looks much sharper" [...] than the PlayStation 2 version, though noted some [...] "choppy" [...] animations. Extended Plays Bub mentioned that the advanced settings resulted in slowdown and crashes. Game Informers Matt Helgeson noticed little difference between the visuals of the original and the port.|$|E

500|$|The 1952 World Series {{was against}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, who by then had their stars of the 1950s such as Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Duke Snider, with the team later nicknamed [...] "The Boys of Summer". The teams split the first four games. With his {{pitching}} staff tired, Stengel gave the start to late-season acquisition Ewell Blackwell, who surrendered four runs in five innings, and the Yankees lost the game in 11 innings to the Dodgers behind Carl Erskine's complete game. Needing to win {{two in a row}} at Ebbets Field, Stengel pitched Raschi in Game 6, who won it with a save from Reynolds. With no tomorrow in Game 7, Stengel sent four pitchers to the mound. Mantle hit a home run to break a 2–2 tie, Martin preserved the lead by making a difficult catch off a Robinson <b>popup,</b> and Kuzava again secured the final outs for a Series victory, as the Yankees won 4–2 for their fourth straight World Series victory, matching the record set in 1936–1939, also by the Yankees.|$|E
