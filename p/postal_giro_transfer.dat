50|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>giro</b> or postgiro {{systems have}} a long history in European {{financial}} services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often simply by the local bank opening its own postgiro account.|$|R

The national <b>postal</b> <b>giro</b> system was a cheap and popular payment system across {{a large part of}} the population, and foreign payment card companies were interested in the Danish market.

The Dankort project faced much public and political attention, which produced a parliament act on payment card systems. The Dankort project encompassed development of new hardware and software and a new payment procedure in the Danish retail.

Efimkin gave the team its first top ten in a stage when he finished near the front of the peloton, for ninth, on stage 6, which was won by a breakaway. However, this stage was also costly for the team, as their squad leader Bonnafond was forced to retire from the Giro after crashing and sustaining a gash near his right eye.|$|R

With OBeP, during the online checkout process, the merchant redirects the consumer to their financial institution’s online banking site where they login and authorize charges. After charges are authorized, the financial institution redirects the consumer back to the merchant site. With some services, like Trustly, the merchant can embed an iframe on their site so that the consumer doesn't {{have to leave the}} page to make a payment. All network communications are protected using industry standard encryption. Additionally, communications with the OBeP network take place on a virtual private network, not over the public Internet. OBeP systems protect consumer personal information by not requiring the disclosure of account numbers or other sensitive personal data to online merchants or other third parties.|$|R
40|$|Some payment {{arrangements}} are more efficient in promoting {{economic growth in}} a market-based economy. The payment experience of industrial countries is diverse enough to identify those {{payment arrangements}} that provide the infrastructure for sustained growth {{and the emergence of}} market-based enterprise. Based on the historical experiences of Europe, Japan, and the United States, a number of Country attributes have led to the intensive use of different payment instruments and a different mix of private and public ownership and payment system participation. Such attributes included country size, population density, banking structure, legal framework, safety, and payment instrument pricing. These attributes explain why Japan relies heavily on cash at the point of sale, but uses electronic payments for bill payments and business transactions. They also are the reason Europe relies on credit-transfer giro payments for all types of transactions and United States instead relies on checks. Finally, the fact that consumer payment needs were not met within the banking system led to the establishment of <b>postal</b> <b>giros</b> in Europe, while untimely business payments led to central bank involvement in payment processing in the United States. Unmet user needs, inefficient payment arrangements, differences in payment instrument costs, and improper pricing of payment services will determine the future structure of payment systems in emerging market economies just as they have determined the evolution of payment systems in industrial countries. The authors discuss these issues and apply the lessons learned to payment arrangements in emerging market economies. Although the evolution of payments has taken decades in industrial countries, emerging market economies hope to complete the process in just a few years, and so will benefit by having a better roadmap for transforming their payment systems.

50|$|In most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, {{even for}} third party payments. In these countries, it is {{standard}} practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, {{to facilitate the}} receipt of payments by giro. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using ATMs, which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing {{the name of the}} payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a <b>giro</b> <b>transfer,</b> the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account.

In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance.|$|R

It is an interbank fund transfer system designed to handle a high volume of low-value payment transmitted from the originating bank to another banks (receiving banks). Currently, IBG is adopting batch processing where the electronic fund transfer can either be executed by job scheduler or manual human intervention. Almost everyday, there is delay from originating banks in submitting the IBG files to MEPS. At MEPS, the extension of time will result in non-efficient services and incur loss to the organization. This in-efficiency service, thus impact the MEPS distribution processes to receiving banks as per MEPS‘s Service Level Agreement (SLA). Since the inefficiency caused by the originating bank, the alternative is for MEPS to reduce the processing time by streamlining and automating the processes at MEPS.

50|$|In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques {{have almost}} {{completely}} vanished {{in favour of}} direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank <b>transfers,</b> using so-called <b>giro</b> <b>transfers,</b> have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called acceptgiros (Netherlands) or Überweisungen (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit {{rather than as a}} payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the Eurocheque. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.|$|R
