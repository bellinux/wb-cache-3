40|$|Landsat {{multispectral}} scanner data, Defense Mapping Agency digital terrain data, conventional maps, and ground data were integrated {{to create a}} comprehensive information data base (the Image Based Information System), to monitor the water quality of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Landsat imagery {{was used as the}} <b>planimetric</b> <b>base</b> to which all other data were registered. A georeference image plane, which provided an interface between all data planes for the Lake Tahoe Basin data base, was created from the drainage basin map. The data base was used to extract each drainage basin for separate display. The Defense Mapping Agency-created elevation image was processed with VICAR software to produce a component representing slope magnitude, which was cross-tabulated with the drainage basin georeference table. Future applications of the data base include the development of precipitation modeling, surface runoff models, and classification of drainage basin cover types...|$|E
40|$|The LANDSAT system, {{operated}} {{in the country}} by CNPg/INPE since 1973, systematically acquires, produces, and distributes both multispectral and panchromatic images obtained through remote sensing satellites to thousands of researchers and technicians involved in the natural resources survey. To cooperate in the solution of national problems, CNPq/INPE is developing efforts {{in the area of}} manipulation of those images with the objective of making them useful as <b>planimetric</b> <b>bases</b> for the simple revision of already published maps or for its utilization as basic material in regions not yet reliability mapped. The results obtained from performed tests are presented and the existing limitations are discussed. The new system purchased to handle data from the next series of LANDSAT as well as from MAPSAT and SPOT which will be in operation within the 80 's decade, and are designed not only for natural resources survey but also for the solution of cartographic problems...|$|R
40|$|A medium-resolution Digital Image Model (DIM) of Mars {{is being}} compiled. A DIM is {{a mosaic of}} radiometrically corrected, photometrically {{modelled}} spacecraft images displaying accurate reflectance properties at uniform resolution, and geometrically tied to the best available control. The Mars medium-resolution DIM contains approximately 4700 Viking Orbiter image frames {{that were used to}} compile the recently completed 1 : 2, 000, 000 -scale controlled photomosaic series of Mars. This DIM provides a <b>planimetric</b> control <b>base</b> to which all other Mars maps will be registered. A similar control base of topographic elevations (Digital Terrain Model, or DTM) is also being compiled. These products are scheduled for completion in 1989...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of geodesy and cartography of Mars {{over the past}} century is presented. The modern exploration began with the Mariner 4, 6, and 7 flyby missions, followed by the Mariner 9 and Viking missions that mapped the entire surface of Mars. The primary modern changes to the coordinate system have led to improved measurements of the rotational period, the direction of the spin axis, and {{the size and shape of}} Mars. <b>Planimetric</b> mapping <b>based</b> on Mariner 9 pictures began with a 1 : 25 -M-scale sheet and 30 1 : 5 -M-scale sheets that covered the entire Martian surface. The quality of the Viking Orbiter pictures was greatly improved over Mariner 9 and led to the publication of 140 controlled photomosaic sheets at a scale of 1 : 2 M. Two digital data bases have been compiled for Mars - the digital image model and the digital terrain model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDigital Elevation Model (DEM) {{is one of}} the {{important}} parameters for soil erosion assessment. Notable uncertainties are observed in this study while using three high resolution open source DEMs. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been applied to analysis the assessment of soil erosion uncertainty using open source DEMs (SRTM, ASTER and CARTOSAT) and their increasing grid space (pixel size) from the actual. The study area {{is a part of the}} Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh state, which is located in the central part of India and the area covered 20, 558  km 2. The actual resolution of DEMs is 30  m and their increasing grid spaces are taken as 90, 150, 210, 270 and 330  m for this study. Vertical accuracy of DEMs has been assessed using actual heights of the sample points that have been taken considering <b>planimetric</b> survey <b>based</b> map (toposheet). Elevations of DEMs are converted to the same vertical datum from WGS 84 to MSL (Mean Sea Level), before the accuracy assessment and modelling. Results indicate that the accuracy of the SRTM DEM with the RMSE of 13. 31, 14. 51, and 18. 19  m in 30, 150 and 330  m resolution respectively, is better than the ASTER and the CARTOSAT DEMs. When the grid space of the DEMs increases, the accuracy of the elevation and calculated soil erosion decreases. This study presents a potential uncertainty introduced by open source high resolution DEMs in the accuracy of the soil erosion assessment models. The research provides an analysis of errors in selecting DEMs using the original and increased grid space for soil erosion modelling...|$|R
40|$|This study quantitatively {{assessed}} the periapical bone repair following endodontic surgery, using <b>planimetric</b> evaluation <b>based</b> on two- (conventional and digital intraoral radiographic images - IRs) and three-dimensional (cone beam computed tomography - CBCT) evaluation. Eleven maxillary anterior teeth (of 11 patients) with periapical bone lesions and indication for surgical endodontic treatment were selected. IRs and CBCT images were acquired before the endodontic surgery, and 48 h, 4, and 8 -months after the surgery. In each period of evaluation, the area (mm 2) {{of the bone}} lesion was measured in the images, and the values for the three methods were compared. The area in the CBCT images was measured in the mesio-distal sections comprising the largest diameter of the lesion. Data were submitted to repeated measures 2 -way ANOVA and t-tests with Bonferroni correction. There was {{significant difference between the}} periods of evaluation (p= 0. 002) regarding the assessed periapical bone lesion area. There was no statistically significant difference between the methods of evaluation (p= 0. 023). In the CBCT images the lesion areas were 10 % larger than those observed in the conventional IRs (22. 84 mm 2) and 15 % larger than those observed in the digital IRs (21. 48 mm 2). From the baseline (40. 12 mm 2) to 4 (20. 06 mm 2) and 8 -months (9. 40 mm 2), reductions of 50 and 77 % in the lesion area, respectively, were observed (p< 0. 0001). From 4 to 8 -months, this value was 53 %. Progressive bone repair could be seen from 48 h to 8 -months following endodontic surgery based on two- (conventional and digital IRs) and three-dimensional (CBCT) evaluation. CBCT images provided results similar to those assessed by means of IRs...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} Ibadan, Nigeria was {{conducted}} to analyze how Colonization has altered, or not altered {{the structure of the}} traditional African city form of this Yoruba town. The study encompasses structural city form elements of Ibadan in terms of housing, open space and markets, public facilities, infrastructure, and natural resources. In order to assess the structure of a city, whether it be a western or non-western model, {{there has to be an}} investigation of how the people use and enjoy (recreation and social interchange) the city. These elements are a good identifiers as to the effectiveness of city planning methods, and best qualified through the analysis of urban plans. The study is intended to render a series of conceptual city planning development strategies that could be the foundation for further investigation regarding how this large African city could expand in the future, while retaining some of its traditional integrity. Such a study of traditional African city form conflicting with Colonial forces can have broader applications than in Africa alone, and can be utilized where any indigenous form (regardless of geographic location) is met with an introduced methodology. The information presented in this study does not reflect contemporary conditions in Ibadan due to limited access to data, and should be viewed as an analysis of the <b>planimetric</b> form <b>based</b> on urban design principles. Development concepts are reflective of conditions between 1972 and the early 1980 's and could be reapplied using the same techniques outlined herein to reflect the contemporary state of the city. by Stephan L.
