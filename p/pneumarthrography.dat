40|$|<b>Pneumarthrography</b> {{has been}} used in the {{investigation}} of lesions of the knee joint in more than 200 cases during the past four years. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to discuss the clinical value of this procedure but to record that the introduction of gas into a joint is not, as one might gather from the literature, a process without reaction; there is, in fact, a specific reaction. In searching the literature we have found only casual references to joint reaction after arthrography. Quaintance (1938) reported fifty cases and made no reference to effusion. Cullen and Chance (1943) noted that there was occasionally a slightly turbid effusion after injecting air; and Hauch (1944), after using oxygen, recorded slight effusion but without noting any abnormal appearance of the fluid at operation. Somerville (1943) observed synovial reaction in eight of thirty cases and concluded that the presence of effusion before injecting air was a factor in causing reaction. In a later communication, Somerville (1946) reported effusion after injecting air in about one-quarter of a much larger series of 331 cases but attributed the reactions to the mildly irritant effect of the air and considered that it was harmless; it was noted that there was no change in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate...|$|E
