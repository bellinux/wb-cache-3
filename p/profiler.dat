50|$|<b>Profilers,</b> {{which are}} also {{programs}} themselves, analyze target programs by collecting information on their execution. Based on their data granularity, on how <b>profilers</b> collect information, they are classified into event basedor statistical <b>profilers.</b> Since <b>profilers</b> interrupt program execution to collect information, they have a finite resolutionin the time measurements, which should be taken {{with a grain of}} salt.|$|R

40|$|Developers use <b>profilers</b> to {{identify}} code {{that should be}} op-timized. For each block of code, developers {{would like to know}} “How much will optimizing this code improve perfor-mance? ” This is a question of causality, which traditional <b>profilers</b> cannot answer. Traditional <b>profilers</b> only observe execution. They measure the time spent in each function and the number of times each function was called. For serial pro-grams, these measurements are sufficient to infer causality; however, concurrent and asynchronous programs present a problem. Threads in a parallel program can interfere, and not all code contributes to a program’s execution time. Causal Profiling We introduce Causal Profiling, a novel profiling technique that relies on controlled experimentation rather than passive observation. <b>Profilers</b> that simply observe a program’s exe...|$|R

40|$|Extract: The term ethics, as we use it, {{refers to}} roles or {{standards}} {{that have been}} established to govern the conduct of members of a profession. The {{problem here is that}} only a handful of criminal <b>profilers</b> have begun to professionalize. 1 Most criminal <b>profilers</b> operate outside of a specific or written code of professional ethics. Consequently, one could make an effective argument for the position that many criminal <b>profilers</b> are still allowed the luxury of giving expert opinions without having to worry about being held responsible for them...|$|R
