2500|$|However venues such as theatres {{demand more}} flexibility. To allow for changes for each show, and {{occasionally}} during shows, theatres sometimes install circuits run permanently to sockets around the theatre. Instead of these circuits {{going directly to}} the dimmer they are connected to a patch bay. [...] A patch bay usually sits next to the dimmers enabling the dimmers {{to be connected to}} specific circuits via a <b>patch</b> <b>cable.</b> The patch bay may also enable many circuits to be connected to one dimmer and even series connection for low-voltage lamps. Also in some theatres individual cables are run directly from the light to dimmer. [...] The assigned connections between the circuits (either at the patch bay or in the form of individual cables) and the dimmers is known as the mains or hard patch. [...] Most hard patch situations A control channel on the light board is fixed to a specific dimmer as in a 1-to-1 patch. [...] This is most common in older theatres, and on a tour where dimmers will be brought in by the touring company.|$|E
2500|$|Electric violins have a {{magnetic}} or piezoelectric pickup that converts string vibration to an electric signal. A <b>patch</b> <b>cable</b> or wireless transmitter sends {{the signal to}} an amplifier of a PA system. Electric violins are usually constructed as such, but a pickup {{can be added to}} a conventional acoustic violin. An electric violin with a resonating body that produces listening-level sound independently of the electric elements can be called an electro-acoustic violin. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle. [...] The body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood. These violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or PA system. [...] Some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are hooked up to the violin. The first specially built electric violins date back to 1928 and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. These violins can be plugged into effect units, just like an electric guitar, including distortion, wah-wah pedal and reverb. Since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings. For example, five-stringed electric violins are available from several manufacturers, and a seven string electric violin (with three lower strings encompassing the cello's range) is also available. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion (e.g., Jean-Luc Ponty) and popular music.|$|E

50|$|A {{magnetic}} pickup {{consists of a}} permanent magnet with a core of material such as alnico or ferrite, wrapped with a coil of several thousand turns of fine enameled copper wire. The pickup is most often {{mounted on the body}} of the instrument, but can be attached to the bridge, neck or pickguard, as on many electro-acoustic archtop jazz guitars. Magnetic pickups used with string basses can be attached to the bridge. The permanent magnet creates a magnetic field; the motion of the vibrating steel strings disturbs the field, changing magnetic flux and inducing an electric current through the coil. The pickup is then connected with a <b>patch</b> <b>cable</b> to an amplifier which amplifies the signal to a sufficient magnitude of power to drive a loudspeaker. A pickup can also be connected to recording equipment via a <b>patch</b> <b>cable.</b> There may also be an internal preamplifier device mounted in an acoustic guitar or in an external box. When a preamp is used in this way, it is between the pickup and cable and can significantly reduce the equivalent impedance of the pickup coil.|$|E
50|$|A <b>patch</b> <b>cable</b> is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect one electronic or optical device to another or to building infrastructure for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g. a switch connected to a computer, or a switch connected to a router) are connected with patch cords. Patch cords are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and most are relatively short, no longer than a few meters. In contrast to on-premises wiring, patch cables are more flexible but may also be less durable.|$|E
50|$|For most {{optical fiber}} {{variants}} of Ethernet, fibers {{are used in}} pairs with one fiber for each direction. Obviously, the one transmitter needs {{to be connected to}} the other receiver and vice versa. For this, fiber patch cables with duplex connectors are normally configured as crossover as well as the on-premises wiring. Thus, a simple connection with two patch cables at each end and a section of fixed cable in the middle has got three crossovers in total, resulting in a working connection. <b>Patch</b> <b>cable</b> crossovers can usually be reconfigured very easily by swapping the connectors within a duplex bracket if required.|$|E
50|$|UTP plenum cables {{that run}} above {{ceilings}} and inside walls use a solid copper core for each conductor, which enables the cable {{to hold its}} shape when bent. <b>Patch</b> <b>cables,</b> which connect computers to wall plates, use stranded copper wire because {{they are expected to}} be flexed during their lifetimes.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to shielded or foiled twisted pair (typically F/UTP or S/FTP cable shielding), UTP (unshielded twisted pair) cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP {{is the primary}} wire type for telephone usage and is very common for computer networking, especially as <b>patch</b> <b>cables</b> or temporary network connections due to the high flexibility of the cables.|$|R
50|$|Fixed optical attenuators used {{in fiber}} optic systems may {{use a variety}} of {{principles}} for their functioning.
