5|$|Poultry is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of meat in the world, {{accounting}} for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to pork at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like <b>production</b> <b>units.</b> Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%). There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which {{can be traced back to}} the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Thunderbird 6 commenced on 1 May 1967, {{by which}} time Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons had already entered production. One of the Century 21 <b>production</b> <b>units</b> was transferred from Captain Scarlet to the second Thunderbirds film and shooting was completed in four months alongside that of the new television series. Special effects director Derek Meddings constructed the Skyship One model and supervised the creation of scale replicas of destinations explored in the film, such as the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Egyptian Pyramids and the Grand Canyon. The Swiss Alps shots which frame a scene set inside the fictional Whistle Stop Inn called for the FAB1 model to skate across ice, while scale figures of Alan and Tin-Tin follow the Rolls-Royce on skis. The length of movement required necessitated {{the construction of a}} special effects set that was between 40 and 50feet (12 and 15m) wide (the largest used for the film), filled with salt to simulate the snow-capped Swiss mountains. The film was also shot in parallel with Joe 90, as evidenced by special effects footage of the destruction of the Dover Missile Complex re-appearing in the pilot episode of that series, and a brief appearance of Sam Loover's car during the evacuation of the Complex.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a production-inventory system {{that consists of}} an input-generating installation, a <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> and L intermediate buffers.

We also consider the problem of the optimal preventive maintenance of the <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> if the <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> deteriorates stochastically with usage and the installation is always in operative condition. Under a suitable cost structure and for given contents of the buffers, it is proved that the average-cost optimal policy for the first (second) problem initiates a preventive maintenance of the installation (<b>production</b> <b>unit)</b> if and only if the degree of deterioration of the installation (<b>production</b> <b>unit)</b> exceeds some critical level. Numerical results are presented for both problems...|$|R
