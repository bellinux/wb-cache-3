5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection {{by being in}} close proximity to the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|Once the Imps are working, {{the player}} must then {{set up a}} basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food, are bred), and a Treasury. After {{connecting}} the dungeon to a 'Portal', minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created in the workshop. Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, they can only be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|Mass-produced {{printed circuit}} boards (PCBs) are almost {{exclusively}} manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with SCARA manipulators, which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays, and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> to PCBs with great accuracy.

25|$|Among the Slavic peoples, it is {{customary}} for {{the laity}} to offer small prosphora in commemoration of those {{living and the}} departed whom {{they would like to}} have prayed for during the Liturgy. These often are smaller than the five prosphora used by the priest. They hand these to the priest together with their list of names, and he takes particles out (living {{from the top of the}} loaf, departed from the bottom) and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the diskos. The loaves are returned to the faithful.|$|E
25|$|Marketeers {{primarily}} classify manga {{by the age}} {{and gender}} of the target readership. In particular, books and magazines sold to boys (shōnen) and girls (shōjo) have distinctive cover-art, and most bookstores <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> different shelves. Due to cross-readership, consumer response is not limited by demographics. For example, male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers, and so on. Japan has manga cafés, or manga kissa (kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten). At a manga kissa, people drink coffee, read manga and sometimes stay overnight.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus and Strabo <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> {{the banks}} of the Thermodon, while Diodorus giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya. These Amazons started from Libya passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the Caïcus in Aeolis, near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they {{established}} Mitylene a little way beyond the Caïcus. Aeschylus, at Prometheus Bound, places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis and they later moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon. Homer tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near Lycia.|$|E

25|$|The {{meeting is}} held at 1 p.m. in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives. The sitting vice {{president}} is expected to preside, but in several cases the president pro tempore of the Senate has chaired the proceedings. The vice president and the Speaker of the House sit at the podium, {{with the vice president}} in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.|$|E
500|$|At around noon, {{the news}} of the {{invasion}} was broadcast to the population by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov: [...] "... Without a declaration of war, German forces fell on our country, attacked our frontiers in many places ... The Red Army and the whole nation will wage a victorious Patriotic War for our beloved country, for honour, for liberty ... Our cause is just. The enemy will be beaten. Victory will be ours!" [...] By calling upon the population's devotion to their nation rather than the Party, Molotov struck a patriotic chord that helped a stunned people absorb the shattering news. Within {{the first few days of}} the invasion, the Soviet High Command and Red Army were extensively reorganized so as to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the necessary war footing. Stalin did not address the nation about the German invasion until 3 July, when he also called for a [...] "Patriotic War ... of the entire Soviet people".|$|E
500|$|Taft {{began the}} {{campaign}} on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of those {{who said he was}} not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed [...] "the President's judgment and criticism". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also obey the law. Bryan wanted the railroads to be owned by the government, but Taft preferred that they remain in the private sector, with their maximum rates set by the Interstate Commerce Commission, subject to judicial review. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times, that specific legislation on trusts was needed to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act, and that the constitution should be amended to allow for an income tax, thus overruling decisions of the Supreme Court striking such a tax down. Roosevelt's expansive use of executive power had been controversial; Taft proposed to continue his policies, but <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> more solid legal underpinnings through the passage of legislation.|$|E

500|$|Following Jessie's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Hit the Road" [...] Head of Household competition. Due to the Coup d'État being used, all of the HouseGuests were able to compete. For this competition, HouseGuests faced off {{two at a time}} and were asked {{questions}} about past competitions played this season; the winner of each round would select the next two HouseGuests to face off, with the last HouseGuest remaining being the winner. Michele was the winner. On Day 41, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Chaosserole" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in pairs and had to find matching casseroles and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> a podium labeled with a certain day of the week or luxury prize; if the HouseGuests had put a correct pair on the podium, they would earn food for that day of the week. The HouseGuests earned food for everyday of the week except for Monday. Though the house was split, the HouseGuests were unsure of which side Michele would choose to stay with; she later aligned herself with Jeff, Jordan, and Russell, and stated she hoped to see Chima evicted. Later that day, Michele chose to nominate Chima and Natalie for eviction. Though she had often disregarded the rules for the show, Chima began to break rules more consistently following Jessie's eviction, including covering up cameras, refusing to go to the Diary Room, and not wearing her microphone. Early on Day 42, Chima broke further rules when she refused to wear her microphone and later threw it into the jacuzzi when Kevin brought her microphone to her. Following this, Chima refused to take an exchange microphone from the storage room. Following further refusal to enter the Diary Room, producer Allison Grodner later spoke through the intercom and convinced Chima to come to the Diary Room. Hours later, the remaining HouseGuests learned that Chima had been expelled from the game. On Day 43, the HouseGuests learned that Michele's duty as Head of Household had been fulfilled as Chima was one of Michele's nominations, and that a new Head of Household competition would take place later that day.|$|E

2500|$|Practitioners {{of crystal}} healing purport that certain {{physical}} properties—e.g., shape, color, and markings—determine the ailments that a stone can heal; lists of such links are published in commonly distributed texts. Paradoxically, practitioners also [...] "hold {{the view that}} crystals have no intrinsic qualities but that, instead, their quality changes according to both" [...] participants. After selecting the stones by color or their believed metaphysical qualities, they <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> parts of the body. Color selection and placement of stones are done according to concepts of grounding, chakras, or energy grids.|$|E

[...] One traditional use for firecrackers and small rockets is to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> frames such as small bulls (toritos), small to very large freestanding structures called castles (castillos) and onto large paper mache figures traditionally to represent Judas Iscariot on Holy Saturday.

Within 24 hours the premier announced that all police would wear firearms at all times while on duty to prevent the escape of felons and to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> an equal footing with armed criminals. Previously only police in rural districts had been permitted to carry firearms. Parliament subsequently passed legislation authorising the arming of {{all members of the}} NSW Police Force and all Police have carried firearms ever since.|$|E
