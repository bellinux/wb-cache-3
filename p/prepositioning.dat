There are no aircraft permanently stationed at Værnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Trøndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located {{on the north side of}} the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. Værnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps <b>Prepositioning</b> Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the main runway on the east side.|$|E

In {{this research}} the writer analyze the simple <b>preposition</b> di, pada, ke, and dari and their equivalent in English version. <b>Preposition</b> {{is an interesting}} problem to analyze, {{because there are many}} mistakes when the students translate it into English as target language. Moreover there are many <b>prepositions</b> which can be chosen as the equivalent of one <b>preposition</b> in Indonesia. In this novel contained fifteen short stories, but the researcher only analyzing four short stories deeper. During the research, the researcher used qualitative descriptive method. Based on the findings, there are 45 sentences that containe <b>preposition</b> di, 9 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> pada, 30 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> ke, 20 sentences with the <b>preposition</b> dari. Therefore the number of <b>preposition</b> di, pada, ke, and dari found was 109 sentences. After analyzing the data in fact, a <b>preposition</b> in source language can be translated into many <b>prepositions</b> in target language. The <b>preposition</b> di is translated into many <b>prepositions</b> in the target language such as: under, on, across, near, in at, into, to, behind, by, with, from, inside, and between. The second is translation pada translated into with, at, to, on, and towards.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{impairment}} of <b>prepositions,</b> a somewhat neglected topic in aphasia research. It {{is the first to}} investigate the availability of all types of <b>prepositions</b> (i. e., spatial, temporal, other meaningful, subcategorized, syntactic <b>prepositions,</b> and particles) in a variety of comprehension and production tasks in one anomic aphasic and four Broca’s aphasic patients and healthy speakers. While the availability of spatial, temporal, or subcategorized <b>prepositions</b> has been investigated, other <b>preposition</b> types have never been studied before. The data revealed that <b>prepositions</b> were impaired in the patients, and that the degree of impairment differed for different types of <b>prepositions.</b> Three of the main findings are: first, meaningless <b>prepositions</b> were not the most vulnerable subcategory of <b>prepositions</b> in the patients. In fact, four of the five aphasic patients performed best on (meaningless) syntactic <b>prepositions.</b> Second, patients made few omissions and many substitution errors which were mostly within-category (a <b>preposition</b> was substituted by another <b>preposition).</b> Third, {{there was no difference in}} the performance of Broca’s and anomic aphasic patients. These results differ from those of previous studies (e. g., Bennis et al., 1983; Friederici, 1982). They found that (i) meaningful <b>prepositions</b> remained relatively well preserved in Broca’s aphasia, while meaningless subcategorized and/or syntactic <b>prepositions</b> were very impaired, (ii) that Broca’s aphasic patients tended to omit rather than substitute <b>prepositions,</b> and (iii) that patients of contrasting clinical profiles performed differently. The preservation of syntactic <b>prepositions</b> together with the large number of within-category substitutions (which indicate sensitivity to the grammatical class of <b>prepositions)</b> were interpreted to suggest that the <b>preposition</b> deficit of the patients is not due to syntactic impairments. Rather, a post syntactic deficit in selection of the correct <b>preposition</b> at spell-out – a construct in modern linguistic theory that links syntax with phonology – is put forward. ...|$|R

25|$|The final {{construction}} {{project for the}} yard {{came in the form}} of construction of five 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime <b>Prepositioning</b> ships. These ships could house equipment and supplies to house 4,000 Marines for thirty days, as well as everything they would need for combat. The ships were also designed to not need port facilities, as everything could be offloaded offshore. The ships were built by General Dynamics and initially were operated by General Dynamics' American Overseas Marine under a 25-year charter. The end of the construction of these ships in May 1986 meant that there was no longer any need for the yard, as attempts to secure container ships for United States Lines and survey ships for the Navy fell through. In 1986, the yard closed, with remaining employees either retiring or being laid off. In 1987, General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division ceased operation. The closure of the yard came after an unsuccessful attempt by employees to purchase the yard. On 1 June 1986, Fore River Shipyard closed for good.|$|E

The {{hub of the}} North Vietnamese material distribution was Hanoi with its numerous railheads, bridges, major roads and its seaport. Much of Hanoi however, along with other key port areas such as Haiphong, were off-limits to US air attack {{until late in the}} American war. During the bombing campaign over the north, facilities and installations were widely dispersed and concealed. Some 2,000 imported generators provided essential power, and oil and gas were shuttled ashore on small craft from Soviet ships and stored in thousands of small 55-gallon drums throughout the countryside, alongside roads and in rice paddies. A massive number of civilians were also evacuated to the countryside from the urban areas, along with factories and machine shops. Population was also dispersed with massive movement of civilians out of major cities like Hanoi, into the countryside. <b>Prepositioning</b> was essential to PAVN tactics. Every few miles stockpiles of tools and material were positioned, both on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and on key transportation routes within North Vietnam. Ready-reaction labor units were also held in various areas, deploying for action to repair bomb damage. Action units sometimes helped with supply movement, such as floating 55-gallon drums of fuel down waterways – a crude yet sometimes effective method of moving such material in bulk. Soviet ships also aided dispersal by bringing in fuel and other material already pre-packed in drums, offloaded on to barges for quick distribution, with the ships themselves off-limits to US air attack.|$|E
