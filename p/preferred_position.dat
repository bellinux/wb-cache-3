5|$|Chelsea were {{predicted}} {{to line up}} in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill going into the match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis Sánchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc Fàbregas partnering Matic in midfield. As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football.|$|E
5|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against England {{in the opening}} game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> at the time. Played under the {{captaincy}} of Newport team-mate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.|$|E

5|$|From late 2008, the {{national}} team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled {{to qualify for the}} 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> since childhood.|$|E
5|$|However, in an {{unexpected}} return, Cissé {{was able to}} come on as a 75th-minute substitute in the second leg of Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool's penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005–06 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez deployed Cissé on the right wing on numerous occasions. While his pace made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he {{would be happy to}} continue in this role rather than in his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Cissé also scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool went on to win 3–1 on penalties. He ended the 05/06 season with 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 Mitchell-Innes {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team. The side lacked the batting {{strength}} of the previous years, and {{he was forced to}} move himself from his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> of batting at number three or four, to open the batting during the season. The batting suffered a further blow just prior to the University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to play. Along with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led the batting averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as unremarkable.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in this free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E
25|$|Melvyn Charles (14 May 1935 – 24 September 2016) was a Welsh {{international}} footballer.

25|$|Mattner managed 19 of 23 {{games for}} Adelaide in 2007, though his {{statistics}} were well down on previous years. Despite being a naturally attacking player, Mattner was consistently played in defence, {{rather than on}} a wing which would be his <b>preferred</b> <b>position.</b> This is often offered as an explanation to his drop in form, and subsequent trading away from the Crows.|$|E
25|$|Claude Thesiger Ashton (19 February 1901 – 31 October 1942) was an English amateur footballer and {{first-class}} cricketer. As footballer {{he played}} for Corinthians in several different positions including goalkeeper and centre forward, although his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> was wing-half. He made one appearance for the England national team in 1925 when he was appointed team captain. As a cricketer {{he played for}} Cambridge University and Essex. A pre-war officer of the Auxiliary Air Force, he {{died as a result}} of a mid-air collision in a training accident in the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|In his {{one full}} season for England, Hosen {{established}} {{a record of}} forty-six points from five games. His England debut was made in New Zealand in 1963. He scored {{in all but one}} of his internationals, his highest scoring games being his last two, against Scotland and Wales in 1967. His <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> was full back, but the competition provided by John Willcox and Don Rutherford confined Hosen to ten caps in 1963–67, of which seven were on the wing. He also played twice for the Barbarian F. C..|$|E

25|$|He {{played in}} {{thirteen}} matches of the South Africa tour, including eleven against club and regional teams, before being selected to face South Africa in the Second Test. Magee, who normally {{played on the}} wing, was placed at full back for the match, which the tourists won comfortably. Magee was replaced for the Third Test, but {{was back in the}} squad for the Final Test, played in Cape Town. This time Magee was played in his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> in the three-quarters, but the game ended in defeat for the British team.|$|E
25|$|A hard-working, {{versatile}} and technically gifted player, McManaman was usually deployed as a winger, or occasionally {{as a central}} midfielder; his <b>preferred</b> <b>position,</b> however, {{was that of a}} more offensive and creative attacking midfielder, an uncommon position in the Premier League throughout his career. McManaman was a quick, strong, creative, and energetic player, with good dribbling ability, as well as accurate passing and crossing ability with either foot, which allowed him to create chances and provide assists for teammates as a playmaker. He was often criticised, however, for his inability to score many goals, although he would later improve upon this element of his game during his career.|$|E
25|$|He {{was offered}} a {{professional}} contract with Swansea Town {{at the age of}} seventeen, and he immediately settled into the Second Division side. His debut came at Bramall Lane on 20 December 1952, in {{what turned out to be}} a 7–1 defeat to Sheffield United. However his progress was halted when he twisted his knee on National Service, though this injury came as he was messing around outside the cook house rather than on parade or in the 9th Battalion's march to the Army Cup. He went straight back into the first team upon his recovery, and he was played mostly at centre-half, or in his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> at right-half. He remained in the first eleven under Ron Burgess, who was appointed manager following McCandless' death in July 1955.|$|E

25|$|A talented left-footed attacking midfielder, Hagi's playing {{style was}} {{frequently}} compared with Diego Maradona's throughout his career, {{due to his}} technical ability {{as well as his}} temperamental character and leadership; as a youth, he was mainly inspired by compatriots Anghel Iordănescu and Ion Dumitru. A quick, highly creative, and mobile advanced playmaker, Hagi was also tactically versatile, and capable of playing in several midfield and offensive positions on either wing or through the middle, due to his ability with both feet, despite being naturally left-footed, although he had a preference for using his stronger foot; his <b>preferred</b> <b>position</b> was in a free role as a classic number 10, but he was also used as a second striker on occasion. Hagi was renowned in particular for his first touch and speed on the ball, bursts of acceleration and dribbling skills, which enabled him to get past defenders; he was also highly regarded for his vision and precise passing, although he was capable of both scoring and assisting goals, and was also an accurate finisher and set-piece taker, who had a penchant for scoring goals from powerful, bending long range strikes. In spite of his small stature, Hagi possessed significant upper body strength, which, along with his control, aided him in protecting the ball from opponents, and allowed him to create space for himself or his teammates. Despite his skill and his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest number 10s of his generation, his career was marked by inconsistency at times, and he was also considered to be a controversial player, due to his rebellious and arrogant attitude, as well as his low work-rate and lack of discipline, which led him to have several disagreements with his managers, opponents, and officials.|$|E
