5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|A {{judgment}} for defendant that the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> barred by limitations {{goes to his}} liability in substantive law; and, in whatever form the issue was raised, such a judgment may be interposed as a conclusive bar to another prosecution for the same offense.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1883, <b>prosecutions</b> <b>were</b> [...] "much more common". In {{the years}} 1883 to 1922 there <b>were</b> five <b>prosecutions.</b> There <b>was</b> an {{unsuccessful}} private prosecution in 1971. The next successful <b>prosecution</b> <b>was</b> in 1977.|$|R
50|$|Private <b>prosecutions</b> <b>are</b> rare in Scots law {{and require}} special {{circumstances}} surrounding the crime to be evident.

25|$|Similar to tax havens, diploma mills {{frequently}} employ jurisdiction shopping, {{operating in}} another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> unlikely.

25|$|On August 15, Hasan was {{scheduled}} to enter pleas to the charges brought against him {{before the beginning of}} the court-martial; he {{would not be allowed to}} plead guilty to the premeditated murder charges as the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> pursuing the death penalty in his case. Hasan objected to being shaved against his will, and his attorney's appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Hasan said having a beard was part of his religious belief.|$|E
25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{an option}} for prosecutors, when {{bringing}} conspiracy charges, to decline to indict {{all members of the}} conspiracy (though the existence of all members may be mentioned in an indictment). Such unindicted co-conspirators are commonly found when the identities or whereabouts of members of a conspiracy are unknown, or when the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> concerned only with a particular individual among the conspirators. This is common when the target of the indictment is an elected official or an organized crime leader, and the co-conspirators are persons of little or no public importance. More famously, President Richard Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator by the Watergate special prosecutor, in an event leading up to his eventual resignation.|$|E

25|$|At any {{stage of}} a trial before the Court before {{the return of the}} verdict, the {{prosecution}} may inform the Court that it will not further prosecute the accused upon the charge. All proceedings on the charge against the accused are then stayed, and he or she is discharged. The prosecution may act in this manner for various reasons; for example, if it no longer believes that the accused committed the offence, if it feels that the case against the accused is weak, or if it is of the view that further investigations are required to gather evidence for its case. Unless the judge expressly directs otherwise, such a discharge does not amount to an acquittal. This means that if the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> able to obtain additional evidence to bolster its case, it may bring criminal proceedings against the accused again at a later stage.|$|E
25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

25|$|Counsel for the Public Prosecutor {{opens his}} or her case by stating shortly {{the nature of the}} offence charged and the {{evidence}} by which the accused's guilt is proposed to be proved. The prosecution witnesses are then examined, cross-examined for the defence and, if necessary, re-examined by the prosecution. When the case for the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> concluded, the defence may invite the Court to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no case to answer. The Court must decide whether there is evidence against the accused which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies every element of the charge against him or her. If there is no such evidence, the accused must be acquitted. If the Court finds that a case against the accused has been made out, it must call on the accused to give {{his or her}} defence. It is up to the accused {{to decide whether or not}} to offer a defence. If the accused elects to do so, he or she, or his or her advocate, may open the case for the defence, stating the facts or law on which the accused intends to rely and commenting on the evidence for the prosecution. The accused may then examine his or her witnesses, and after their cross-examination by the prosecution and re-examination by the defence, may sum up his or her case. The prosecution may then call persons as witnesses or recall persons already examined for re-examination for rebuttal purposes, and such rebuttal witnesses may be cross-examined by the defence and re-examined by the prosecution. Whether or not the accused has adduced evidence, the prosecution has the right to reply on the whole case.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trial court}} ruled that Amon's [...] "status as an active protester was {{insufficient}} to establish selective prosecution" [...] and that no illegal discrimination occurs where the government prosecutes individuals for actions they take in failing to comply with tax laws where an effect of the <b>prosecution</b> <b>is</b> [...] "...to dissuade others from engaging {{in that kind of}} tax protest." [...] The Court of Appeals agreed, stating: [...] "Merely showing that the Government elected, under established IRS directives, to prosecute an individual because he was vocal in opposing voluntary compliance with the federal income tax law, without also establishing that others similarly situated were not prosecuted and that the prosecution was based on racial, religious or other impermissible considerations, does not demonstrate an unconstitutionally selective prosecution." ...|$|E
