40|$|Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a non-conventional {{manufacturing}} process of removing materials. The uniqueness of EDM {{process is the}} removal of the unwanted materials without direct contact between the electrode and workpiece. EDM <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> provides <b>power</b> source of EDM system. It supplies voltage and current to produce spark erosion. Power supply and pulse generator are two important parts in EDM <b>power</b> <b>generator.</b> By choosing the proper power supply and pulse generator to the application, a great result for Material Removal Rate (MRR) can be achieved. Efficiency of EDM <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> depends on the configurations of power supply used.

40|$|The {{development}} work during this quarter was focused {{in the assembly}} of the downhole <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> hardware and its electronics module. The quarter was also spent {{in the development of}} the surface system electronics and software to extract the acoustic data transmitted from downhole to the surface from the noise generated by hydrocarbon flow in wells and to amplify very small acoustic signals to increase the distance between the downhole tool and the surface receiver. The tasks accomplished during this report period were: (1) Assembly of the downhole <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> mandrel for generation of electrical power due to flow in the wellbore. (2) Test the piezoelectric wafers to assure that they are performing properly prior to integrating them to the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> mandrel.

(4) Test of the <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> using a water tower and an electric pump to create a water flow loop. (5) Test the power harvesting electronics module. (6) Upgrade the signal condition and amplification from downhole into the surface system. (7) Upgrade the surface processing system capability to process data faster.

5|$|Many {{residential}} PV {{systems are}} connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these grid-connected PV systems, use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.|$|E

National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric <b>power</b> <b>generators.</b> Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
40|$|Electrical Discharge Machining {{process has}} been widely used for {{manufacturing}} micro components due to its contactless process. The <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> design and configuration requirements for producing the desired spark {{have always been a}} challenge to the researchers. The aim of this project is to design and implement the <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> using Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) with 100 W output power for the EDM system. The <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> is designed based on the SMPS push-pull topology. The hardware of the push-pull converter has been successful built its characteristic almost similar to the designed specification. The SMPS <b>power</b> <b>generator</b> for EDM machine is working properly according to the supply current needed by the load. The SMPS is based on the push-pull topology that utilize IGBT transistor. The project describes both simulation and experimental work carried out on the developed circuit.

5|$|A Carbon Trust study {{into the}} {{potential}} of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electric power (0.4% of total UK electric power consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electric power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's electric power needs by 2050.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1997, President Bill Clinton {{declared}} Guam {{a federal}} disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance. One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the Northern Mariana Islands. Ultimately, FEMA received 14,770Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam. In turn, FEMA provided the residents with over $27million in assistance (1997USD, $39million 2015USD). The entire island of Guam was left without power after Paka. Water and sewage systems on Guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon. With {{the usage of}} <b>power</b> <b>generators,</b> most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities {{within a few days}} after the typhoon. The Antonio B.

5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant <b>power</b> <b>generators,</b> each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in {{the north side of}} the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100TWh.|$|E

In October 2011 a Globemaster flew a {{water purification plant}} to Samoa, from where it was transported by Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft to Tuvalu. C-17s also transported supplies to Fiji and Samoa in December 2012 following Cyclone Evan. In January 2013 two Globemasters flew <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> and transformers from Amberley to Hobart following the Tasmanian bushfires. Later that month C-17s were used to transport aviation fuel and other supplies into the Queensland town of Bundaberg after it was affected by heavy flooding. In November 2013 a Globemaster flew a civilian medical team and its equipment from Australia to Cebu in the Philippines {{as part of the}} relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan; an RAAF C-130 subsequently transported the medical team from Cebu to Tacloban in the disaster zone.|$|E

Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which {{more often than not}} were destroyed.

5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based <b>power</b> <b>generators.</b> Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E

25|$|An {{adjacency}} {{system allows}} certain structures {{to benefit from}} being built directly adjacent to others. Energy-consuming structures will use less energy when built adjacent to <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> and <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> will produce more energy when built adjacent to power storage structures. The same applies to their mass-producing equivalents. Likewise, factories will consume less energy and mass when built adjacent to <b>power</b> <b>generators</b> and mass fabricators/extractors, respectively. However, by placing structures in close proximity, they become more vulnerable to collateral damage if an adjacent structure is destroyed. Furthermore, most resource generation structures can cause chain reactions when destroyed (especially Tier III structures, which produce large amounts of resources but often have large detonations that can wipe out a nearby army).|$|E
