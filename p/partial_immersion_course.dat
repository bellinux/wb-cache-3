This paper focuses on the experiences of faculty and the responses of students {{who took part in}} several <b>immersion</b> service-learning <b>courses</b> taught between 2005 and 2007 during the Winter term at Elon University in North Carolina. Four major themes were identified as being significant in these immersion service-learning courses: 1) sharing living space impacts the student-faculty relationship, 2) immersion faculty leaders are placed in multiple roles with multiple opportunities for role modeling, 3) immersion faculty experience their own transformative learning, which often further complicates their roles as leaders, and 4) immersion faculty leaders often experience role conflict in maintaining leadership roles and assessing student work in <b>immersion</b> <b>courses.</b> We conclude that while the role conflicts must be negotiated faculty modeling service behavior may have stronger lessons for students and their future civic engagement than other on-campus service learning <b>courses.</b> <b>Immersion</b> service-learning describes <b>courses</b> where students and faculty participate together in a service project {{for an extended period of}} time, workin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

These requirements can be closely related to specific categories of interaction: orientating, moving and acting. We also found, that existing virtual reality applications often have very little in common when it comes to interaction techniques and does not take into consideration the implications of the display type used.

40|$|Background: In vitro {{staining}} methods {{expose the}} entire specimen to staining solutions. In a real clinical situation, {{this is not}} observed, since one should consider that the bonded surface is not exposed to the oral environment. Theoretically, the clinical condition {{would be the best}} simulated if the specimens were exposed to staining solutions by <b>partial</b> <b>immersion.</b> Aims: To evaluate if different immersion methods and surface treatments influence the color stability of resin-based specimens. Methodology: A stainless steel matrix was used to prepare 30 disc-shaped specimens that were randomly allocated in three groups: Without polishing, polishing with abrasive discs, and surface sealant. Half of the specimens were isolated to maintain only the upper surface exposed to staining (<b>partial</b> <b>immersion)</b> and the other half was totally immersed in coffee solution for 48 h (total immersion). The coordinates ΔE*, ΔL*, Δa*, Δb* were assessed by spectrophotometer. Statistical Analysis: Two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Specimens submitted to <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> showed lower values of ΔE*, ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, in comparison to total immersion (P = 0. 000). Specimens covered by a surface sealant presented lower ΔE* values regardless of the immersion method. Conclusions: Specimens totally immersed in staining solutions could in somehow overestimate the color change, once that in most clinical conditions not all of the restoration surfaces are exposed to the oral environment. Moreover, as the surface sealant application produces color change values that are clinically acceptable, it might be used in esthetic restorations as an adjunct treatment...|$|R
40|$|Immersion as {{a special}} bilingual {{teaching}} method is intended to plunge students into the learning environment by the way of transforming the teaching process into a language environment. Learning the Modern Greek language at the Mariupol State University {{in the process of}} training the Modern Greek-Ukrainian translators based on immersion methods emerges the actual methodological problem which can be solved by revitalizing the method of teaching some special subjects. The method of immersion teaching the Modern Greek language at the Higher Educational Establishment has been highlighted in the paper based on the special course of subjects under the title ?Annotating and Abstracting Texts (Modern Greek language) ? of the optional course for students obtaining the Master?s degree. The special course mentioned above has been worked out on the basis of integrity and immersion. Teaching annotating and abstracting in the Modern Greek language accompanied with the methodology support as well as the syllabus and the reference book of clich?s ensures the appliances named ?Annotating and Abstracting Texts (Modern Greek language) ?. The considered work is provided with practical tasks presented in the form of texts of annotations and abstracts, scientific articles, dedicated to the issues of highlighting the actual issues of philology, linguistics, linguodidactics, comparative pedagogics and translation. As the subject is focused on teaching philologists and translators, immersion has some peculiarities. Firstly, it is multilingual as the teaching material is provided in three languages (Modern Greek, Ukrainian and English). Secondly, it is translation-oriented as immersion is realized not only in one main language (here it is the Modern Greek) but into the processes of Modern Greek ? Ukrainian and English-Ukrainian translation. The method of using the immersive teaching in the special course is realized in the systematic use of the following principles: 1) harmonization of the learning language and the themes and contents of the language material; 2) gradual increasing of the complexity level of the tasks during the teaching process; 3) gradual increasing in number of the teaching materials in the Modern Greek language.

40|$|The era of {{globalization}} has caused English {{to become one}} of the main subjects for education in Indonesia. The teaching of English in the present era has experienced changes from time to time. One of its developments takes the form of the program of bilingual instruction. Such a program is increasingly being promoted by the government in the effort to make the governmental policy concerning the bilingual program a success. Therefore, the researcher has been inspired to contribute suggestions related to the English <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> program actualized in the research concerned here. The development of the bilingual class for language and social science classes has been a follow-up of research conducted by Rahmi D. Andayani et al. on mathematics and physical science classes. In order that bilingual classes in social and linguistic fields could be developed and implemented at junior high schools (locally called sekolah menengah pertama or SMP, for short) in the province of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (or DIY, for short) in particular and in Indonesia in general, research on the <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> program as a model of English language instruction to lead to the idea of the international-level school at SMPs running bilingual classes in DIY has been made. The objective of the research was to (a) design a form of teacher training and carry out training in accordance with field observation, (b) learn of the implementation of the English <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> program in the field and especially its process of instruction, (c) describe the perceptions of students, parents, teachers, and principals of the said schools of the program, and (d) design a model of instruction for the English <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> program. Basically, the immersion class is a class using two languages without ignoring the culture of each language (www. carla. umn. com). The method of the research on the program was qualitatively and quantitatively descriptive. The data were obtained by recording, making interviews, and distributing questionnaires. The data obtained were treated to a SWOT (short for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, after which a model of instruction in the form of the <b>partial</b> <b>immersion</b> program was designed by means of comparisons and conclusions drawn from compiled theories. The model was then tried out and afterwards an evaluation was conducted on it. The results of the research are that (a) the reason for giving the materials from General English, Describing Language Skills, Developing Writing, Developing Reading, Developing Listening, Developing Speaking, Vocabulary, Lesson Plan, and Classroom English for Bilingual Instruction is that teachers of subjects in the fields of the social sciences and languages need training and arms to be used as stepping stones in bilingual instruction, (b) with the holding of the tutorials on making lesson plans, the teachers feel being helped in planning the execution of good instruction in the bilingual class, (c) according to the analysis of data in the tabulation of the perceptions of students, parents, teachers, and principals related to both SMPN 1 Bantul and SMPN 4 Pakem, they feel sufficiently enthusiastic about the running of the bilingual immersion program at school, and (d) the workshop is necessary to give feedback, policy reference for related institutions, and simultaneously dissemination to schools which would later be used as subjects for research on providing a model of good bilingual instruction to be applied at the schools in the effort to lead to the idea of the international-level school.
