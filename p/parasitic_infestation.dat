40|$|Background. Intestinal <b>parasitic</b> <b>infestations</b> pose one of {{the biggest}} health {{problems}} of the contemporary world. Objectives. The aim of this article was to present the prevalence of intestinal parasites among children living in a large urban agglomeration. Material and methods. 1823 children (916 girls and 907 boys), aged 3 – 6, attending 31 different pre-schools in Warsaw, were examined in 2014. Stool specimens were tested in the Department of Epidemiology and Tropical Medicine of the Military Institute of Medicine by light microscopy using three different diagnostic methods (direct smear in Lugol’s solution, decantation with distilled water, Fülleborn’s flotation). The material for testing, fixed in 10 % formalin, was collected three times at 2 – 3 -day intervals. Results. Parasitological examination of the stool specimens showed intestinal <b>parasitic</b> <b>infestations</b> in 47 children (2. 57 % of the study group). Only 7 children were infested with pathogenic parasites (6 cases of giardiasis and 1 enterobiasis) and required antiparasitic treatment. 17 children were infested with potentially pathogenic protozoa (Blasocystis sp.) and 26 with non-pathogenic protozoa (Entamoeba coli, Endolimax nanai), but because of lack of gastrointestinal symptoms (asymptomatic carriage) they did not require a treatment. Conclusions. Performed examination show low infection rates among children from a large urban agglomeration. In the absence of epidemiological surveillance over the prevalence of the majority of intestinal parasitic diseases in Poland, and because some diagnostic centres generate positive test results using valueless methods, the propagation of parasitological diagnostics in light microscopy in direction of prevalence of intestinal <b>parasitic</b> <b>infestations,</b> especially among patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, is strongly recommended...|$|R

50|$|An {{increase}} in eosinophils, i.e., {{the presence of}} more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an eosinophilia, and is typically seen in people with a <b>parasitic</b> <b>infestation</b> of the intestines; autoimmune and collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and Systemic lupus erythematosus; malignant diseases such as eosinophilic leukemia, clonal hypereosinophilia, and Hodgkin's disease; lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia; extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis); Addison's disease and other causes of low corticosteroid production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); reflux esophagitis (in which eosinophils will {{be found in the}} squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and eosinophilic esophagitis; and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma. In 1989, contaminated L-tryptophan supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which was reminiscent of the Toxic Oil Syndrome in Spain in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Overgrowths of {{transparent}} cells prevented {{contamination and}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>infestation.</b> The chamber contents, now segregated, could slowly specialize into a transparent humour, for optimizations such as colour filtering, higher refractive index, blocking of ultraviolet radiation, {{or the ability}} to operate in and out of water. The layer may, in certain classes, be related to the moulting of the organism's shell or skin. An example of this can be observed in Onychophorans where the cuticula of the shell continues to the cornea. The cornea is composed of either one or two cuticular layers depending on how recently the animal has moulted. Along with the lens and two humors, the cornea is responsible for converging light and aiding the focusing of it {{on the back of the}} retina. The cornea protects the eyeball while at the same time accounting for approximately 2/3 of the eye’s total refractive power.|$|E
