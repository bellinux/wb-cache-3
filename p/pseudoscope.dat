5000|$|In 1853 the American {{scientist}} John Leonard Riddell (1807-1865) devised his binocular microscope, {{which contained}} {{the essentials of}} Wheatstone's <b>pseudoscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{instrument}} subsequently {{fell into}} complete neglect {{for nearly two}} centuries. It was revived in 1852 by Charles Wheatstone, who published his ideas in his paper [...] "On Binocular Vision," [...] in the Philosophical Transactions for 1852. Wheatstone's paper stimulated the investigation of binocular vision and many variations of <b>pseudoscopes</b> were created, chief types being the mirror or the prismatic.|$|R
50|$|Switching the two {{pictures}} {{in a standard}} stereoscope changes all the elevated parts into depressions, and vice versa. The <b>pseudoscope</b> also changes convex into concave, and high-relief into low-relief.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pseudoscope</b> is a {{binocular}} optical {{instrument that}} reverses depth perception. It is used to study human stereoscopic perception. Objects viewed through it appear inside out, for example: a box on a floor would appear as a box shaped hole in the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Before the <b>pseudoscope</b> {{itself was}} created intentionally, it existed in {{binocular}} instruments as an imperfection. The first binocular microscope {{was invented by}} the Capuchin monk Cherubin d'Orleans. Because his instrument consisted of two inverting systems, it produced a pseudoscopic impression of depth by accident, although not recognized by microscopists of the time.|$|E

40|$|Bick’s solo {{exhibition}} at Museum Haus Konstruktiv was a summation to date {{of painting and}} drawing exploring his response to the legacies of concrete and constructive art. 17 paintings, a wall painting, an optical installation involving the <b>Pseudoscope,</b> a device developed by constructivist Terry Pope and 41 drawings were placed in 700 sq metres of gallery space in parallel with exhibitions of Marlow Moss and Cerith Wyn Evans. Key to curator Sabine Schaschl’s concept for the three exhibitions was a desire to explore the concrete in relation to gender, identity and the overlooked. Bick had introduced her {{to the work of}} Marlow Moss in 2016 and the exhibition was planed dialogue or conversation, reflecting a central research question for Bick’s work as to what remains viable to contemporary art from the concrete and material legacy of Modernism. A second question revolves around re-exploring the contribution of overlooked and undervalued artists, Moss, obviously, but also in Bick’s sequence of grid works based in a grid from the work of Gillian Wise and his dialogue with Terry Pope over the use of Pope’s optical device to view a three sided revolving painting of Bick’s commissioned specially for the exhibition. Bick collaborated with Zurich based Luvo Architekten to create a bespoke shelving system on which he placed a series of 31 rubber stamp drawings laid out in a Fibonacci Sequence. These reprised ideas of seriality in a modernist avant garde as well as being a hybrid of his own grid sequences with that of Gillian Wise. The title is taken from (and presented in the poster and invitation as) references to concrete poetry, particularly that of Robert Lax (1915 - 2000), who Bick corresponded and published with in the 1990 s and who was in turn publishd by seminal Zurich based small press Pendo Verlag. The idea of ghosts, variations, shifts/nuances and echo’s thus underpinned the thematic of the whole exhibition. This was discussed in detail in the public conversation with Schaschl on 15 March and will form the basis of a large scale publication with Hatje Canz in 2018, including newly commissioned texts on Bick’s work from Dr Jon Wood and Sabine Schaschl...|$|E
