40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{particular}} ‘on the frontline’ account is to allow {{the voice of a}} <b>pit</b> <b>overman,</b> Jack Ditchburn, to tell his own story of being a miner, a trade unionist, and a ‘boss man’ – a man who saw himself as miner first and foremost and as manager second (Beynon et al., 1991). Jack worked as a miner in the Blackhall and Horden pits, part of the Durham coalfields, which were some of the most deeply affected by the 84 - 85 strike. Jack’s narrative adds rich biographical detail to current understandings of the work of a miner, the ’ 84 strike, the characters involved, and the relationships made and broken by it...|$|E

The construction, completed in September 2005, {{is part of an}} effort to restore the V&T's mainline from Virginia City to Carson City for operations. Then Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev), who was instrumental in securing $10 million in federal funding for the project, and Nevada Lieutenant Governor Lorraine Hunt, who secured an additional $1 million in state funding for the project, both spoke at the ceremony. The completion of the first phase of the extension saw the last train of the day venturing beyond Gold Hill and to American Flats, over a massive fill of the <b>Overman</b> <b>Pit,</b> near the Crown Point Ravine. This practice has been abandoned in recent years, though.|$|R
