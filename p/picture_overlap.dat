40|$|What {{is stored}} in {{long-term}} memory from current sensations {{is a question that}} has attracted considerable interest. Over time, several prominent theories have consistently proposed that only attended sensory information leaves a durable memory trace whereas unattended information is not stored beyond the current moment, an assumption that seems to be supported by abundant empirical evidence. Here we show, by using a more sensitive memory test than in previous studies, that this is actually not true. Observers viewed a rapid stream of real-world object <b>pictures</b> <b>overlapped</b> by words (presentation duration per stimulus: 500 ms, interstimulus interval: 200 ms), with the instruction to attend to the words and detect word repetitions, without knowing that their memory would be tested later. In a surprise two-alternative forced-choice recognition test, memory for the unattended object pictures was tested. Memory performance was substantially above chance, even when detailed feature knowledge was necessary for correct recognition, even when tested 24 h later, and even although participants reported {{that they do not have}} any memories. These findings suggests that humans have the ability to store at high speed detailed copies of current visual stimulations in long-term memory independently of current intentions and the current attentional focus...|$|R

40|$|Narcolepsy with {{cataplexy}} is {{a complex}} sleep disorder that affects the modulation of emotions: cataplexy, the key symptom of narcolepsy, is indeed strongly linked with emotions that usually trigger the episodes. Our study aimed to investigate haemodynamic and behavioural responses during emotional stimulation in narco-cataplexy. Twelve adult drug-naive narcoleptic patients (five males; age: 33. 3 ± 9. 4 years) and 12 healthy controls (five males; age: 30. 9 ± 9. 5 years) were exposed to emotional stimuli (pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure and mean cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral arteries were continuously recorded using photoplethysmography and Doppler ultrasound. Ratings of valence and arousal and coping strategies were scored by the Self-Assessment Manikin and by questionnaires, respectively. Narcoleptic patients' haemodynamic responses to <b>pictures</b> <b>overlapped</b> with the data obtained from controls: decrease of heart rate and increase of mean cerebral blood flow velocity regardless of pictures' content, increase of systolic blood pressure during the pleasant condition, and relative reduction of heart rate during pleasant and unpleasant conditions. However, when compared with controls, narcoleptic patients reported lower arousal scores during the pleasant and neutral stimulation, and lower valence scores during the pleasant condition, respectively, and also a lower score at the 'focus on and venting of emotions' dimensions of coping. Our results suggested that adult narcoleptic patients, compared with healthy controls, inhibited their emotion-expressive behaviour to emotional stimulation, {{and that may be}} related to the development of adaptive cognitive strategies to face emotions avoiding cataplexy...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} some basic {{characteristics of the}} relationship between national and international law and politics. The law functions in relation to politics in three basic aspects, namely as a goal, a means, or an obstacle. First, politics can define certain predominantly legal values or institutions as its goal. In this case the political understanding of these values or institutions becomes almost identical to an authentic legal understanding of the same values or institutions. Second, politics can comprehend the law merely as a means for the fulfillment of certain political interests. In this case politics is neutral in its attitude toward the law. Finally, politics can interpret law as an obstacle on the way toward the realization of certain political goals. In this situation either politics prevails over law, or vice versa. In the first case politics effectuates its solutions {{at the expense of the}} rule of law, while in the second case the autonomy of law is preserved through the decisions of the highest courts or by other actions taken by lawyers, intellectuals, associations, organizations, and the public in order to stop illicit acts of political actors. Law and politics create their own particular pictures of reality. Sometimes those <b>pictures</b> <b>overlap,</b> sometimes they differ. Yet, there is something that the law should never include in its sphere; namely, the differentiation of adversaries according to a purely political criterion. This leads to a strict separation between 2 ̆ 2 ours 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 yours 2 ̆ 2, or, in its most radical expression, to a strict separation between friend and enemy. When the latter occurs, politics inevitably prevails over the law, and reduces or damages the autonomy of the rule of law...|$|R

This is not necessarily true as external illumination conditions and/or camera parameters (such as exposure time, aperture size, and white balancing) may vary for different input images.

40|$|Seals {{and humans}} often target the same food resource, leading to competition. This is of {{mounting}} concern with fish stocks in global decline. Grey seals were tracked from southeast Ireland, {{an area of}} mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries, and overlap with fisheries on the Celtic Shelf and Irish Sea was assessed. Overall, there was low overlap between the tagged seals and fisheries. However, when we separate active (e. g. trawls) and passive gear (e. g. nets, lines) fisheries, a different <b>picture</b> emerged. <b>Overlap</b> with active fisheries was no different from that expected under a random distribution, but overlap with passive fisheries was significantly higher. This suggests that grey seals may be targeting the same areas as passive fisheries and/or specifically targeting passive gear. There was variation in foraging areas between individual seals suggesting habitat partitioning to reduce intra-specific competition or potential individual specialisation in foraging behaviour. Our findings support other recent assertions that seal/fisheries interactions in Irish waters are an issue in inshore passive fisheries, most likely at the operational and individual level. This suggests that seal population management measures would be unjustifiable, and mitigation is best focused on minimizing interactions at nets...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cross-modal {{interactions}} {{improve the}} processing of external stimuli, particularly when an isolated sensory modality is impaired. When information from different modalities is integrated, object recognition is facilitated probably {{as a result of}} bottom-up and top-down processes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential effects of cross-modal stimulation in a case of simultanagnosia. Method: We report a detailed analysis of clinical symptoms and an 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study of a patient affected by Balint’s syndrome, a rare and invasive visual–spatial disorder following bilateral parieto-occipital lesions. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of visual and nonvisual cues on performance in tasks involving the recognition of <b>overlapping</b> <b>pictures.</b> Four modalities of sensory cues were used: visual, tactile, olfactory, and auditory. Results: Data from neuropsychological tests showed the presence of ocular apraxia, optic ataxia, and simultanagnosia. The results of the experiment indicate a positive effect of the cues on the recognition of <b>overlapping</b> <b>pictures,</b> not only in the identification of the congruent valid-cued stimulus (target) but also in the identification of the other, noncued stimuli. All the sensory modalities analyzed (except the auditory stimulus) were efficacious in terms of increasing visual recognition. Conclusions: Cross-modal integration improved the patient’s ability to recognize overlapping figures. However, while in the visual unimodal modality both bottom-up (priming, familiarity effect, disengagement of attention) and top-down processes (mental representation and short-term memory, the endogenous orientation of attention) are involved, in the cross-modal integration it is semantic representations that mainly activate visual recognition processes. These results are potentially useful for the design of rehabilitation training for attentional and visual–perceptual deficits...|$|R

40|$|Psychological {{studies have}} found better memory in women than men for {{emotional}} events, but the neural basis for this difference is unknown. We used event-related functional MRI to assess whether sex differences in memory for emotional stimuli is associated with activation of different neural systems in men and women. Brain activation in 12 men and 12 women was recorded while they rated their experience of emotional arousal in response to neutral and emotionally negative pictures. In a recognition memory test 3 weeks after scanning, highly emotional pictures were remembered best, and remembered better by women than by men. Men and women activated different neural circuits to encode stimuli effectively into memory even when the analysis was restricted to pictures rated equally arousing by both groups. Men activated significantly more structures than women in a network that included the right amygdala, whereas women activated significantly fewer structures in a network that included the left amygdala. Women had significantly more brain regions where activation correlated with both ongoing evaluation of emotional experience and with subsequent memory for the most emotionally arousing <b>pictures.</b> Greater <b>overlap</b> in brain regions sensitive to current emotion and contributing to subsequent memory may be a neural mechanism for emotions to enhance memory more powerfully in women than in men...|$|R

Subjects were presented with pictures of items and heard auditory words that either matched or mismatched the <b>pictures.</b> Mismatches <b>overlapped</b> expected words in word-onset (cohort mismatches; see: DOLL, hear: dog), rhyme (CONE – bone), or were unrelated (SHELL – mug). In match trials, the SLI group showed a different pattern of N 100 responses to auditory stimuli compared to the TD group, indicative of early auditory processing differences in SLI. However, the phonological mapping negativity (PMN) response to mismatching items was comparable across groups, suggesting that just like TD children, children with SLI are capable of establishing phonological expectations and detecting violations of these expectations in an online fashion. Perhaps most importantly, we observed a lack of attenuation of the N 400 for rhyming words in the SLI group, which suggests that either these children were not as sensitive to rhyme similarity as their typically developing peers, or did not suppress lexical alternatives to the same extent. These findings help shed light on the underlying deficits responsible for SLI...|$|R

Intraocular inflammation, though, is not common in orbital inflammatory syndrome [4]. It has been hypothesized {{on the basis of}} histopathologic studies that the inflammation in posterior scleritis can contiguously spread to the retinal artery and vein and cause vasculitis with subsequent occlusion [5]. Shukla et al. have described a case of combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion in a case of posterior scleritis [6]. In their case, the anterior segment examination revealed no evidence of anterior scleritis and the systemic work-up was within normal limits. Similar to their case, our case too was treated with intravenous pulse methyl prednisolone followed by tapering doses of oral prednisolone with resolution of the exudative detachment and residual disc pallor with attenuated vasculature. Our case shows that involvement of a particular structure in the eye can sometimes involve an adjacent structure due to contiguous spread of pathology.

We found that when an unattended congruent word preceded a picture target by a lag of 2 items or 4 items, responses to that target picture were speeded compared to when the word was unrelated to the target. This finding suggests that the unattended information is being processed to the level at which it can influence behavior and that this processing lasts for an extended duration after the item is presented...|$|R
