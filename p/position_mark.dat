60|$|There {{were three}} known {{channels}} {{by which the}} Rancocus could be carried quite up to the crater. Mark chose that which {{came in from the}} northward, both because it was the nearest, and because he could lay his course in it, without tacking, for most of the way. Acquainted now with his <b>position,</b> <b>Mark</b> had no difficulty in finding the entrance of this channel. Furnishing the Mermaid with a dozen hands, she was sent to the western roads, to intercept Waally's fleet, should it be coming out with the booty. In about an hour after the Rancocus altered her course, she made the land; and, just as the sun was setting, she got so close in as to be able to anchor in the northern roads, where there was not only a lee, but good holding-ground. Here the ship passed the night, the governor not liking to venture into the narrow passages in the dark.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was passed}} in loading the Neshamony, and in looking after various {{interests}} on the Reef. The hogs had all come in, and were fed. Mark shot one, and had it dressed, putting most of its meat into the pinnace. He also sent Bob out to his old place of resort, near Loam Island, whence he brought back near a hundred hog-fish. These were divided, also, some being given to Dido's mess, and the rest put in the pinnace, after taking out enough for a good supper. About ten at night the Neshamony sailed, Mark carrying her {{out into the open}} water, when he placed Bob at the helm. Bigelow had remained in the ship, to overhaul the lumber, of which there were still large piles both betwixt decks and in the lower hold, as did the whole of the Socrates family, who were yet occupied with the hay harvest and the 'wash.' Before he lay down to catch his nap, Mark took a good look to the southward, in quest of the beacon, but it was not burning, a sign the savages had not appeared {{in the course of the}} day. With this assurance he fell asleep, and slept until informed by Bob that the pinnace was running in beneath the cliffs. Betts called him, because the honest fellow was absolutely at a loss to know where to find the entrance of the cove. So closely did the rocks lap, that this mouth of the harbour was most effectually concealed from all but those who happened to get quite close in with the cliffs, and in a particular <b>position.</b> <b>Mark,</b> himself, had caught a glimpse of this narrow entrance accidentally, on his first voyage, else might he have been obliged to abandon the hope of getting on the heights; for subsequent examination showed that there was but that one spot, on the whole circuit of Vulcan's Peak, where man could ascend to the plain, without having recourse to engineering and the labour of months, if not of years.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} role of frequency information in compound production by independently varying the frequencies {{of the first and}} second constituent as well as the frequency of the compound itself. Pairs of Dutch noun-noun compounds were selected such that there was a maximal contrast for one frequency while matching the other two frequencies. In a position-response association task, participants first learned to associate a compound with a visually marked position on a computer screen. In the test phase, participants had to produce the associated compound in response to the appearance of the <b>position</b> <b>mark,</b> and we measured speech onset latencies. The compound production latencies varied significantly according to factorial contrasts in the frequencies of both constituting morphemes but not according to a factorial contrast in compound frequency, providing further evidence for decompositional models of speech production. In a stepwise regression analysis of the joint data of Experiments 1 - 4, however, compound frequency was a significant nonlinear predictor, with facilitation in the low-frequency range and a trend toward inhibition in the high-frequency range. Furthermore, a combination of structural measures of constituent frequencies and entropies explained significantly more variance than a strict decompositional model, including cumulative root frequency as the only measure of constituent frequency, suggesting a role for paradigmatic relations in the mental lexicon...|$|E

Their lireless efforts made a {{possibly}} dreary holida eason One which more than 250 people willlrllly never forget. For Lois and Liz. December was a special time to gathcr food, gifls and donors to h Ip put a. mile on the faces of those with HIV/AIDS and their fumilie. and friends. The Holiday Gi ft Project has been around since the early days Df OVA and has now evolv d into a wonderful mostly vollinleer­run, ctivity vith limited help from the David's House staff. In 1994, Lois became the first volunteer to head the project, and this year, with tbe sistance and strong leader 'hip of Liz Sofa, they were detenruned La make it the b st holiday yeti There w s a strong donor base by 1996, but in 1994, when Lois began to gather gifts and food, it was through word of mouth, the volunteer new letter at David'. House, her workplace and a wand rful feature article in The Blade that donors were found. In fact, it was Liz's mother, a volunteer in the Residential Program, who told her that donors and more help were needed for the holidays. Liz responded and was given an assignment of a Mom and a five year old boy. She gathered her two children and shopped for their "adopted" famil. Because of confidentiality, Liz initially did not know the family's identity. But through the Community Service Program she began a correspondence with this Mom. She was hoping to help further, but the Mom died suddenly just two months later. From till. point on Liz became more involved with David's Hou e by joining the Special Projects Committee which oversees the holiday program. She has most recently become a Buddy to one of our clients. Lois and Liz made it easy to "adopt" one or more clients during the holiday season. As donors came forward to help our ever increasing client load, our two leaders worked tirelessly to respond to the clients' needs and preferences a expressed to their case managers at David's House. Lois is often stmck by the simplicity and the sincerity of their needs and wishe·. "One woman wanted just a toothbrush. Last year one man asked for Christmas cards and stamps, while another man wished to have his dog groomed. Our biggest requ t from children and adults alike is for socks, clothing, coats and underwear. Many ask for a cure for this disease, and often, a client will draw us pictures. " Our co-chairs find it important to remind their donors that it is not necessary for them to purchase everything on their lists and that they should spend whatever is appropriate for their gift budget. Donors can participate in other ways. if they prefer, including contributions of food to the gift baskets that are distributed to clients and their fami. lies. So mllch has happened in the Community Services Program in the last year. The agency has almost 100 new cuents since this time last year with intakes of women, children and families dramatically increasing. Sadly, nearly 70 of the clients who were helped in last year's project have passed away. However, over 100 individuals, organizations, families, churches and businesses help to provide hundreds of gifts and 180 food baskets to our current clients and their families. Lois expressed that the days of December are special days. She loves seeing the joy on the clients' faces as they recei ve their gifts and baskets. "That's what brings it all together for me. I always needed to do something like this at holiday time. Everything else after this is just anci. llary. This the holiday.

Neither did anyone know that Warren would help to oversee a detailed long­range plan for the agency and eventually become president of the Board of Tmstees of David's House. But. before he joined the board, he left his mark as a volunteer. He brought a lovely mix of humor and compassion to his relationships with the residents, most especially his friend Nancy Drake, who lived at David's House for three years until her death.

A Mother's VISit to the Quilt By Helen lossi To me, "TIle Quilt" had always been the bridal quilt made for the grandmother who died before Twas bam. It was sewn with tiny, meticulous stitichcs, and the names of my grandmother's friend., were written in dIe old fa<;hioned, elegant handwriting of generations past. That quilt is a treasured heirloom, an endming labor of love to be gently passed to each new genemtion. But this new Quilt -it is massive. And it continues to grow in prop 01 t ion to deaths from AIDS and to dle love ex­pressed for those whom we mown. Tmy. meticulous stitcbcs, rerniniscent of my grandmother's quilt., can be seen -yet they may be lying close to n crudely constructed tribute in which the spelling L-;incorrect but the power is oveJwhelming. The correct Litle of this new Quilt is "TIle NAMES Project" TIle nrunes ru-e read aloud in a continuous How as we walk and attempt to absorb what we see. The individual names are stitched, woven. painted or appliqued. Some are bold statements with photos. artifacts, items of personal clothing or medallions. Others dispJay ooly a quiet first nrune. Some are multiple sections fastened together and covered with names of people who shared common interests and friendships. And there ru·e the tender panels memorializing lost infants and children. Pro 1 ounilly stunning is one set of completely blank, unlettered white panels identified only as a memotial to members of a large New York publishing compaJ. 1 y. No names are listed lest they belrJY the confidentiality of families who ru-e afraid to acknowledge tbe loss of their loved ones to AIDS. The stigma is still trong. The message is powerful and compassionate. l 1 len there is the panel where the word "hemophiliac" is printed larger tl 1 an the nan 1 e of the remembered loved one. TIle anger and liustration touch us. I bave stood beside many qui lt panels in small and large clusters in many cities. Jlearned that no one ever stands there alone. There at-e no strangers. One never weeps alone. Whenever tears flow, arms will wrap you. The power of love surrounds you. Members of our fami ly shared the expcJience of the NAMES Project in Washington, D. C. in 1992. We wel-e with our son, Stephen, and we had taken five pili 1 els to add to the more than 20, 000 al the sileo Stephen had designed three. aJ. 1 d T had constructed them. His sister, Mary, had made two more for friends of Stephen and our fam ily. Three generations of our family returned to Wa<;hington in October, 1996, when we added five more panels. Two of them were lor Stephen: one made by MalY, the other by me. cuntinlled 0 11 next page Mother's Visit con fin lied It is 6 : 00 a. In. Mruy, our sons, Paul and David, their father and I make the brisk walk to the mall area between the Washington Monument and the Capitol. The quilt panels have been securely stored ovel 11 ight. Now many hundreds of volunteers are preparing to place the heavy, folded lotus­shaped panels on (he designated grassy spaces. The air is clean and crisp; we approach the open mall and look up at the gleruning white capitol building as the sun rises behind it. The sky is a glorious gift of clear blue dazzled with subtle shades of pink that become more brilliant as day­light appears. It is an awesome and inspiring setting for the event to come. We hesitate in grateful appreciation, then begin to locate our panels as we silently blink away the tears. 1 feel drained and empty, yet gratcful and fulfilled. All is in place. The sun is giv ing wannth now. The perimeter of the maU is filled with the quiet crowd, but the walkways stretching between lhe quilt panels are empty. It is time for lhose lotus blossoms to open. We are together ­Stephen'S parents, siblings and mates, nieces, nephew and closest friends -as a loving rribute to Stephen. Like all of the volunteers, we have come dressed ill white. We will serve as two teams in the unfolding ceremonies this Saturday morning. This was such a vast experience. My personal feeling and the need to relive the times that created the panels we made were compelling. Then I looked beyond myself at that multitude of quilts covering an immense measure of land. And walking there among those quilt panels were thousands of people bound together with a common lhread of uniLy, remembrance and healing. 1 had designed Stephen's panel to show that our family and friends had held, cared for and supported each other in all steps of his life and continued to do so in this new chapter. Many of those persons were with us through­out this weekend of concern and compassion -a continuing tie to one another but, also, to the crowds of caring people who had come to view this memorial and to remember. That evening we walked in the candlelight march. The mass of persons, moving together with candles held high, gave the impression of a river of fl. ame flowing through our nation's capitol to gather, like a great sea of light, at the edges of the refl. ecting pool near the Li ncoln Memorial. Here was an expression of the faith thaI the Quilt would sustain us, and the hope that, through aware­ness and enlightenment, that very Quilt might some day cease to grow. This Quilt, this N AMES Project, has a force of its own. The energy from the unity of many bas become the power of the Quilt. This Quilt has the power of love. ...|$|E
