50|$|Personal {{computer}} <b>parallel</b> port <b>adapters</b> {{are simple}} and inexpensive, {{but they are}} relatively slow because they use the host CPU to change each bit ("bit banging"). They have declined in usefulness because newer computers do not have parallel port hardware. Driver support is also a problem, because the adapter electronics varied so widely.|$|R

50|$|The {{parallel}} port interface was originally {{known as the}} <b>Parallel</b> Printer <b>Adapter</b> on IBM PC-compatible computers. It was primarily designed to operate printers that used IBM's 8-bit extended ASCII character set to print text, but {{could also be used}} to adapt other peripherals. Graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system.|$|R
5000|$|Controller {{functions}} are mapped {{to the computer}} keyboard; an extended keyboard is required to access both left and right Intellivision controllers. With Macintosh, USB game controllers could be used indirectly with a joystick to keyboard mapper utility. For PC, Intellivision Productions promoted the Gravis GamePad Pro game controller (game port version). [...] The MS-DOS emulator, directly accessible on the CD-ROM, also supported original Intellivision controllers through the INTV2PC Hand Controller Interface. INTV2PC is a <b>parallel</b> port <b>adapter</b> that accepts original Intellivision hand controllers. This feature although not promoted is documented in the INTVPC files on the CD-ROM.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} IBM <b>parallel</b> printer <b>adapter</b> for the IBM PC {{was designed}} to support 8-bit data bidirectionally in 1981. This allowed the port {{to be used for}} other purposes, not just output to a printer. This was accomplished by allowing the data lines to be written to by devices on either end of the cable, which required the ports on the host to be bidirectional. This feature saw little use, and was removed in later revisions of the hardware. Years later, in 1987, IBM reintroduced the bidirectional interface with its IBM PS/2 series, where it could be enabled or disabled for compatibility with applications hardwired not to expect a printer port to be bidirectional.|$|R
50|$|The MessagePad 100 {{series of}} devices used Macintosh's {{proprietary}} serial ports - round Mini-DIN 8 connectors. The MessagePad 2000/2100 models (as {{well as the}} eMate 300) have a small, proprietary Newton InterConnect port. However, {{the development of the}} Newton hardware/software platform was canceled by Steve Jobs on February 27, 1998, so the InterConnect port, while itself very advanced, can only be used to connect a serial dongle. A prototype multi-purpose InterConnect device containing serial, audio in, audio out, and other ports was also discovered. In addition, all Newton devices have infrared connectivity, initially only the Sharp ASK protocol, but later also IrDA, though the Sharp ASK protocol was kept in for compatibility reasons. Unlike the Palm Pilot, all Newton devices are equipped with a standard PC Card expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100). This allows native modem and even Ethernet connectivity; Newton users have also written drivers for 802.11b wireless networking cards and ATA-type flash memory cards (including the popular CompactFlash format), as well as for Bluetooth cards. Newton can also dial a phone number through the built-in speaker of the Newton device by simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker and transmitting the appropriate tones. Fax and printing support is also built in at the operating system level, although it requires peripherals such as <b>parallel</b> <b>adapters,</b> PCMCIA cards, or serial modems, the most notable of which is the lightweight Newton Fax Modem released by Apple in 1993. It is powered by 2 AA batteries, and can also be used with a power adapter. It provides data transfer at 2400 bit/s, and can also send and receive fax messages at 9600 and 4800 bit/s respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals {{such as an}} RS-232 to Centronics <b>parallel</b> printer interface <b>adapter.</b> Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, {{which led to the}} Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB.|$|R
5000|$|Discrete {{digital inputs}} and outputs might be {{buffered}} from the microprocessor data bus only by an addressable latch, or might be operated by a specialized input/output IC, such as an Intel 8255 or Motorola 6821 <b>parallel</b> input/output <b>adapter.</b> Later single-chip micrcontrollers have input and output pins available. These input/output circuits usually do not provide enough current to directly operate devices like lamps or motors, so solid-state relays are operated by the microcontroller digital outputs, and inputs are isolated by signal conditioning level-shifting and protection circuits. [...] One or more analog inputs, with an analog multiplexer and common analog to digital converter, are found on some microcontroller boards. Analog outputs may use a digital-to-analog converter or, on some microcontrollers, may be controlled by pulse-width modulation. For discrete inputs, external circuits {{may be required to}} scale inputs, or to provide functions like bridge excitation or cold junction compensation.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the oldest}} {{adapters}} are the C64 user port to RS232 converters. Those were standardized and originally designed to connect printers and other 3rd party hardware, including modems. Later, those adapters have also been adopted for disk drive emulation and even Internet connections. However, the most widespread adapters were probably the different disk drive and printer plug C64 serial bus to <b>Parallel</b> port <b>adapter</b> that evolved for transferring data between disk drives and parallel port supplied computers. Because of hard timing requirements on the C64 side, those are unfortunately not applicable to laptops or multitasking operation systems. There also exist a more limited number of adapters for the C64 tape interface. While the data transfer over the user port is usually limited to 2.4 kbit/s, the C64 expansion port cartridge interface supports transfer rates of one to two magnitudes higher through proprietary protocols. There exist C64 expansion port adapters that support both hard disks, memory cards, USB-disks and Ethernet connections.|$|R
50|$|The IEEE 1284 {{standard}} {{allows for}} faster throughput and bidirectional data flow with a theoretical maximum throughput of 4 megabytes per second; actual throughput is around 2 megabytes/second depending on hardware. In the printer venue, this allows for faster printing and back-channel status and management. Since {{the new standard}} allowed the peripheral to send large amounts of data back to the host, devices that had previously used SCSI interfaces could be produced {{at a much lower}} cost. This included scanners, tape drives, hard disks, computer networks connected directly via <b>parallel</b> interface, network <b>adapters</b> and other devices. No longer was the consumer required to purchase an expensive SCSI card - they could simply use their built-in parallel interface.|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} sequencing, NGS, is revolutionizing {{the world}} of science. Illumina, Inc. ???s NGS chemistry begins with sample preparation which involves fragmenting genomic DNA (gDNA) and attaching oligonucleotide adapters. DNA fragments are then amplified, in a process referred to as cluster generation and sequenced in <b>parallel.</b> The <b>adapters</b> added during the sample preparation process are required for Illumina???s NGS chemistry. Most of the adapters have a unique index sequence (index adapter) incorporated in them, which allows sample tracking and multiplexing. Ilumina, Inc. has a diverse NGS product portfolio that currently uses 220 index adapters from seven different sample preparation product lines. Each manufactured index adapter requires quality control (QC) contamination testing. The purpose of this testing is {{to determine if the}} indexed adapters under evaluation are cross-contaminated with any other indexed adapter. This practice is particularly important because the end-user utilizes the Illumina, Inc. supplied adapter sequences for sample identification and cross-contamination can result in sample tracking errors. It is imperative that contamination testing be conducted on all manufactured adapters; however the majority of the QC testing of these product lines involves labor-intensive sample preparation protocols and instrument time intensive sequencing runs. The project aimed to move the contamination testing of index adapters with library preparation protocols to a shorter PCR-based protocol, introduce a faster cluster generation protocol, and combine multiple QC contamination processes into a single protocol. The single protocol allows all product lines to be tested on a single sequencing run, with data analyzed using a common algorithm. This will result in approximately a 40...|$|R
40|$|Humans can {{perceive}} illusory or subjective contours in {{the absence}} of any real physical boundaries. We used an adaptation protocol to look for orientation-selective neural responses to illusory contours defined by phase-shifted abutting line gratings in the human visual cortex. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to illusory-contour test stimuli after adapting to an illusory-contour adapter stimulus that was oriented parallel or orthogonal to the test stimulus. We found orientation-selective adaptation to illusory contours in early (V 1 and V 2) and higher-tier visual areas (V 3, hV 4, VO 1, V 3 A/B, V 7, LO 1, and LO 2). That is, fMRI responses were smaller for test stimuli <b>parallel</b> to the <b>adapter</b> than for test stimuli orthogonal to the adapter. In two control experiments using spatially jittered and phase-randomized stimuli, we demonstrated that this adaptation was not just in response to differences in the distribution of spectral power in the stimuli. Orientation-selective adaptation to illusory contours increased from early to higher-tier visual areas. Thus, both early and higher-tier visual areas contain neurons selective for the orientation of this type of illusory contour...|$|R
