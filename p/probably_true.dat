5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.|$|E
5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, {{gendarmerie}} commander {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a written message from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted the message to be passed on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was <b>probably</b> <b>true,</b> their request was insincere. The gendarmerie commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E

500|$|As their hunting {{relies heavily}} on vision, mantises are {{primarily}} diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. [...] Mantids in the family Liturgusidae collected at light {{have been shown to}} be predominately males; this is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> for most mantids. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their pheromones. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively.|$|E

500|$|During college Marshall {{joined the}} Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, participated in {{literary}} and debating societies, and founded a Democratic Club. He secured {{a position on}} the staff of the college newspaper, the Geyser, and began writing political columns defending Democratic policies. In 1872 he wrote an unfavorable column about a female lecturer at the school, accusing her of [...] "seeking liberties" [...] with the young boys in their boarding house. She hired lawyer Lew Wallace, the author of , and filed a suit demanding that Marshall pay her $20,000 for libel. Marshall traveled to Indianapolis in search of a defense lawyer and employed future United States President Benjamin Harrison, then a prominent lawyer in the area. Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were <b>probably</b> <b>true.</b> In Marshall's memoir, he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill, his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service, but instead gave him a lecture on ethics.|$|E
500|$|After {{four of the}} barristers had spoken, Mansfield {{announced}} that the court session would resume the next morning rather than continue into the night, which gave Erskine the time he needed to present a full speech rather than a brief comment. In it he accused Sandwich of cowardice and of orchestrating the attack on Baillie, arguing that Baillie was merely doing his duty by attempting to bring {{the problems with the}} hospital into the public eye, and was therefore not acting in bad faith. If the issues with the hospital were not acknowledged, Erskine claimed, the Royal Navy would be [...] "crippled by abuses", with seamen no longer willing to risk their lives for a fleet that would fail to treat them well in their retirement. Erskine was successful in having Baillie found not guilty, and after leaving the court was met with a standing ovation; Emory Speer writes that [...] "It is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> that never did a single speech so completely ensure professional success".|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} to the trial and to Erskine's speech was tremendous; upon leaving the court {{he was given a}} standing ovation by the attorneys present, many of whom offered him briefs on the spot. Joseph Jekyll reported that the court was [...] "in a trance of amazement", and Emory Speer wrote that [...] "It is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> that never did a single speech so completely insure professional success". Erskine claimed to have received 65 briefs immediately after the trial {{as a result of the}} case, which may be an exaggeration, although he undoubtedly did well out of his victory. He became Lord Chancellor in the Ministry of All the Talents and was renowned as an excellent, albeit unorthodox, advocate. Sandwich remained in office until the government fell in 1792; Baillie, on the other hand, was not reinstated at the Hospital despite an insistent effort to regain his former position. The events of the trial were replicated in an episode of Garrow's Law, with William Garrow depicted as representing Baillie (rather than Erskine) and his main antagonist, Arthur Hill, replacing Lord Sandwich.|$|E

500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is <b>probably</b> <b>true</b> that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
