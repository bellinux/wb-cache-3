Up to 300 channels opened simultaneously 300 microseconds after {{the beginning of}} a 1, 000 microM ACh pulse corresponding to a peak current i of almost - 1 nA. Single responses to ACh were averaged and the concentration dependence of i and of the rise time tr from 0. 1 i to 0. 9 i was measured. In adult receptors, i increased proportional to the second to third power of ACh concentration, whereas in embryonic-type receptors it was proportional to the first to the second <b>power.</b> <b>tr</b> increased from approximately 0. 3 ms at 1, 000 microM ACh to a plateau value of approximately 5 ms for adult and of approximately 10 ms for embryoniclike receptors at concentrations less than 10 microM ACh. The concentration dependence of i and tr was simulated using the standard model of ACh binding with different combinations of rate constants and two and three binding sites for ACh. The calculated curves were compared to the measurements and a set of well fitting rate constants was determined for adult and embryoniclike receptors. Three binding sites for ACh were necessary to fit the dose response for i for adult receptors. A method for deriving rate constants in a model of ACh-receptor interaction is described that avoids analysis of open-closed kinetics of single channels, which in rapid systems, as the ones studied here, are at the limit of the frequency response of the current measurement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Green {{wireless}} communications have received considerable attention recently {{in hope of}} finding novel solutions to improve energy efficiency for the ubiquity of wireless applications. In this paper, we argue and show that the timereversal (TR) signal transmission is an ideal paradigm for green {{wireless communications}} because of its inherent nature to fully harvest energy from the surrounding environment by exploiting the multi-path propagation to re-collect all the signal energy that would have otherwise been lost in most existing communication paradigms. A green wireless technology must ensure low energy consumption and low radio pollution to others than the intended user. In this paper, we show through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiment measurements that the TR wireless communications, compared to the conventional direct transmission using a Rake receiver, reveals significant transmission power reduction, achieves high interference alleviation ratio, and exhibits large multi-path diversity gain. As such it is an ideal paradigm {{for the development of}} green wireless systems. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show an order of magnitude improvement in terms of transmit power reduction and interference alleviation. Experimental measurements in a typical indoor environment also demonstrate that the transmit <b>power</b> with <b>TR</b> based transmission can be as low as 20 % of that without TR, and the average radio interference (thus radio pollution) even in a nearby area can be up to 6 dB lower. A strong time correlation is found to be maintained in the multipath channel even when the environment is varying, which indicates high bandwidth efficiency can be achieved in TR radio communications.

40|$|Tandem repeats (TRs) {{represent}} one of {{the most}} prevalent features of genomic sequences. Due to their abundance and functional significance, a plethora of detection tools has been devised over the last two decades. Despite the longstanding interest, TR detection is still not resolved. Our large-scale tests reveal that current detectors produce different, often nonoverlapping inferences, reflecting characteristics of the underlying algorithms rather than the true distribution of TRs in genomic data. Our simulations show that the <b>power</b> of detecting <b>TRs</b> depends on the degree of their divergence, and repeat characteristics such as the length of the minimal repeat unit and their number in tandem. To reconcile the diverse predictions of current algorithms, we propose and evaluate several statistical criteria for measuring the quality of predicted repeat units. In particular, we propose a model-based phylogenetic classifier, entailing a maximum-likelihood estimation of the repeat divergence. Applied in conjunction with {{the state of the art}} detectors, our statistical classification scheme for inferred repeats allows to filter out false-positive predictions. Since different algorithms appear to specialize at predicting TRs with certain properties, we advise applying multiple detectors with subsequent filtering to obtain the most complete set of genuine repeat...|$|R

Next generation land-based, mobile, phased-array radar systems for battlefield applications must meet constraints on volume, weight, power consumption, and data processing capability that are currently not available. The most inefficient component in a phased array radar system is the final power amplifier in each transmit-receive (TR) module. More recent final <b>power</b> amplifiers for <b>TR</b> modules have been configured in the Class AB or push-pull mode with a theoretical efficiency of 78. 5 % and an operational efficiency of only 20 % at x-band (8 - 12. 5 GHz) frequency.
