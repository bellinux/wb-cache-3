5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades.

The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks.

5|$|At the time, he had {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon <b>post</b> <b>for</b> the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, {{in favor of a}} Spanish newcomer.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a <b>post</b> <b>for</b> Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Mangnall was {{the first}} man to bring any major {{silverware}} to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908.

Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old Trafford derby of 7 September 1912. John Bentley took over as club secretary, but was replaced two years later by Jack Robson, who became the club's first full-time manager. He remained in the <b>post</b> <b>for</b> seven years, but resigned in December 1921 after succumbing to a bout of pneumonia.|$|E

Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
