His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and <b>peak</b> <b>output.</b> This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{changes in}} functional independence following {{spinal cord injury}} and to evaluate the association between functional independence and physical capacity. Design: Multi-centre prospective cohort study. Subjects: Patients {{with spinal cord injury}} admitted for initial rehabilitation. Methods: The motor Functional Independence Measure (FIMmotor) was determined at the start of rehabilitation (n = 176), 3 months later (n = 124), at discharge (n = 160) and one year after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (n = 133). One year after discharge, physical and social dimensions of health-related functional status (Sickness Impact Profile 68; SIP 68) were determined. On each occasion, physical capacity was established by measuring arm muscle strength, <b>peak</b> power <b>output</b> and <b>peak</b> oxygen uptake. Results: Multi-level random coefficient analyses revealed that FIMmotor improved during inpatient rehabilitation, but stabilized thereafter. Changes in FIMmotor were associated with <b>peak</b> power <b>output.</b> Multiple regression models showed that FIMmotor and <b>peak</b> power <b>output</b> at discharge were associated with FIMmotor one year after discharge (R(2) = 0. 85), and that <b>peak</b> power <b>output</b> at discharge was associated with the social dimension of the SIP 68 (R(2) = 0. 18) one year after discharge.

500|$|The {{final chapter}} of the third {{generation}} series was the VZ Commodore. Debuting in 2004 with {{a new series of}} V6 engines known as the Alloytec V6, both [...] and [...] versions of the 3.6-litre engine were offered. These were later upgraded to 180 and 195kilowatts (241 and 261hp) respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous Ecotec engines, the Alloytec benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed 5L40E automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed Aisin AY6 manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement. A new 6.0-litre Generation 4 V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of 10 days of heat acclimation with and without pre-cooling on intermittent sprint exercise performance in the heat. Eight males completed three intermittent cycling sprint protocols before and after 10 days of heat acclimation.
