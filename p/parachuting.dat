Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of <b>parachuting</b> herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for <b>parachuting</b> and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E

Benny Morris writes that Israel lost 33 dead and 161 wounded. 27 Israeli tanks were damaged by Jordanian artillery, 4 of which were left behind, two half-tracks, six armored cars and one Dassault Ouragan aircraft, although the pilot succeeded in <b>parachuting</b> to safety. A Mirage had to crash land.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} space {{available}} on the spacecraft for the <b>parachute</b> is so small that the <b>parachute</b> had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the <b>parachute.</b> The <b>parachute</b> team loaded the <b>parachute</b> in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the <b>parachute</b> package several times.

He ejected through the canopy, <b>parachuting</b> to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he could. He would patrol the skies over Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{eventually}} captured by Gorner in the heroin plant, who explains that Bond {{is to be}} used as bait during a drugs delivery across the Afghan desert, and should he survive an expected ambush, is to fly the captured airliner into the Russian heartland. Bond would be identified as British upon its destruction, increasing the evidence against the British Government. Bond survives the predicted Afghan attack and plots an escape attempt, which sees Scarlett get away due to Bond surrendering himself as a diversion. In the morning he is taken aboard the aeroplane. Before the airliner can bomb the Soviets, with the aid of the airliner's pilot and Scarlett (who had been hiding on board), Bond regains control of the aeroplane and crashes it into a mountainside after <b>parachuting</b> to safety.|$|E

5|$|For {{transporting}} paratroops, {{to avoid}} relying solely on American aircraft and pilots, No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force was expanded, becoming No. 38 Group with its Halifax squadrons, now supported by four squadrons of Albemarles and four squadrons of Stirlings. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air, {{the air force}} started experiments on <b>parachuting</b> them into combat, carrying the jeeps and guns in the aircraft's large bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46 Group, was formed, and was equipped solely with Dakotas, instead {{of the mixture of}} aircraft in No. 38 Group. After these changes, the Royal Air Force groups could supply 88 Albermarles, 88 Stirlings, 36 Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes, in addition to aircraft held as reserves.|$|E

Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before trekking westwards, across the Maritime Alps, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to join up with the Allied forces that had just invaded southern France. After 23 days' hiking, he and his companions were recovered by American troops and repatriated.|$|E

The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, <b>parachuting</b> behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E

5|$|As the {{battalion}} {{was to be}} Australia's first airborne unit it required extensive training. Consequently, in addition to basic parachute training at Richmond, {{the battalion}} also trained in jungle warfare at Canungra in Queensland. In September 1943, Major John Overall, formerly of the 2/13th Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, was appointed as commanding officer. Throughout this time training continued in the demolitions, tactics and <b>parachuting,</b> and as no reserve parachutes were used several fatalities occurred. A third rifle company was formed in October 1943 and by January 1944 the battalion was at full strength. Following company and battalion level exercises the battalion was declared ready for operations in May 1944 and moved to Mareeba airstrip in North Queensland. A fourth rifle company was formed in June 1944. In August 1944 the battalion gained its own organic indirect fire support when it was joined by the parachute qualified 1st Mountain Battery, Royal Australian Artillery, equipped with short 25 Pounder guns.|$|E
50|$|A {{ballistic}} <b>parachute,</b> ballistic reserve <b>parachute,</b> or emergency ballistic reserve <b>parachute</b> is a <b>parachute</b> {{ejected from}} the casing by a small explosion, much like that used in an ejection seat. The advantage of the ballistic <b>parachute</b> over a conventional <b>parachute</b> is that it ejects the <b>parachute</b> canopy, causing it to open rapidly, this makes it ideal for attaching to small aircraft, hang gliders and microlights, where an emergency situation may occur {{in close proximity to}} the ground. In such a situation a conventional <b>parachute</b> would not open quickly enough.|$|R

50|$|The Skyhook is United <b>Parachute</b> Technologies {{version of}} a Main-Assisted Reserve Deployment system (MARD), a safety feature on skydiving <b>parachute</b> systems.

5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and <b>parachuting,</b> at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E

5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with <b>parachuting,</b> then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
