5|$|Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest are {{considered}} both founders of Sheffield F.C. and {{creators of the}} code they adhered to. They continued {{to have a strong}} <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club, both being members of the committee. It was Creswick, however, who exerted more influence over the rules in his position of Honorary Secretary and Treasurer.|$|E
5|$|The George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which officially {{opened on}} Homecoming Weekend in November 2011, was named in Parks' honor.

5|$|True {{to their}} {{longtime}} {{identity as a}} stage racing team, all of Astana's 2011 victories came in stage races. They had a much lesser <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grand Tours than they did when Contador rode for them, achieving just one stage win and sixth overall as their best placing, both from the Giro d'Italia. They also took stage wins at seven other races.|$|E
5|$|A flint {{arrowhead}} {{discovered in}} Sale suggests a prehistoric human <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> location, {{but there is}} no further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period. A 4th-century hoard of 46Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After the Roman departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more were raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E

5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, {{more than an hour}} later.|$|E
5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, {{there is no evidence}} that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Finan, bishop of Lindisfarne, Alhfrith of Deira, in {{collusion}} with Wilfred of York, Agilbert of Wessex and others, were determined to persuade Oswiu to rule in favour of the Roman rite of Christianity within the kingdoms over which he had imperium. The case was debated in Oswiu's <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colmán, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colmán, departed elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|They {{are well}} known for their devotion and passionate support for Benfica on all its sports and activities, {{specially}} football and futsal. However, the group is also known by its unconditional defense of Benfica's best interests, being usual to see its members engaging in protests against the club board, staff or players whenever they feel things are not right. Those protests can be silent <b>presences</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> matches or explicit criticism <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club's members meetings.|$|R

5|$|Henry {{personally}} presided at {{the trial}} of John Lambert in November 1538 for denying the real <b>presence.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, he shared in the drafting of a proclamation giving Anabaptists and Sacramentaries ten days {{to get out of}} the country. In 1539 Parliament passed the Six Articles reaffirming Roman Catholic practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy and the importance of confession to a priest and prescribed penalties if anyone denied them. Henry himself observed the Easter Triduum in that year with some display.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, Rupert {{appears to}} have been {{involved}} in a plot to assassinate Oliver Cromwell, an event that would then have been followed by a coup, the landing of a small army in Sussex, and the restoration of Charles II. Charles himself is understood to have rejected the assassination proposal, but three conspirators—who implicated Rupert in the plan—were arrested and confessed in London. Rupert's <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal court continued to be problematic; as in 1643, he was regarded by Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and others as a bellicose figure and an obstacle to peace negotiations; in 1655 Rupert left for Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E

5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> banquet.|$|E

5|$|The Queen was a {{prominent}} figure in Roman society. Her <b>presence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> proxy wedding of Grand Prince Ivan III of Russia and the Byzantine princess Sophia Palaiologina in 1472 was widely noted, as was her pilgrimage to L'Aquila {{on the occasion of}} the translation of Bernardino of Siena's relics to a new church (the construction of which was funded, among others, by King Thomas). That she lived a comfortable life can be deduced from the impression she left on Roman chroniclers, who wrote about the entourage of 40 mounted knights accompanying her on a pilgrimage to St. Peter's Basilica to celebrate the new year 1475.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{church of}} St. Peter's at Exeter became Leofric's cathedral {{and he was}} enthroned as Bishop of Exeter there on St Peter's Day in 1050 with King Edward in attendance.
