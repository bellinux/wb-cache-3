50|$|A {{prominent}} Bolshevik {{leader and}} later USSR Commissar for Enlightenment, Anatoli Lunacharsky, {{was attacked by}} Lenin for attempting to accommodate pseudo-religious sentiments in the world-view of Communism. Lunacharsky had carried ideas similar to Feuerbach’s notion of replacing religion with a new atheistic religion that had {{a place for the}} sentiments, ceremonies and meanings of religion, but which was compatible with science and possessed no supernatural beliefs (see: God-Building). Lunacharsky considered that while religion was false and was used as a tool of exploitation, it still cultivated emotion, moral values and desires among masses of people, which the Bolsheviks should take over and manipulate rather than abolish. These products of religion should have been transformed into humanistic values of a communist morality rather than abolished, when they formed the basis of the <b>psychological</b> and moral <b>integrity</b> of masses of people. By replacing traditional religion with a new atheistic religion wherein humanity was worshiped rather than God, socialism would achieve much better success, according to Lunacharsky. He believed this would have less confrontation and abuse of the culture and historical tradition of European civilization.|$|R

At various points during the story Elliot thinks of himself as wearing a 'mask', and a sympathetic teacher refers to 'the armour' that most people put on each day.

50|$|Many criticisms {{levelled}} {{against the}} focus on human dignity point to inconsistencies in the Supreme Court’s own definition of the term. Iacobucci J has variously characterized the term as referring to “personal autonomy and self-determination”, “physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>integrity</b> and empowerment,” as well as “self-respect and self-worth,” indicating a conflation of different understandings of equality. One scholar notes that this confusion “forms a haphazard amalgamation and intermingling of dignity,” {{and that it is}} a disservice to our understanding of equality by failing to distinguish between human dignity and human interest. Similarly, the Court has at times linked the concept of dignity with the imposition of disadvantage and prejudice while at other times linked it with the redress of discrimination.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Self-compassion {{has been}} {{associated}} with psychological health in young and multigenerational samples. This study investigated whether self-compassion may be associated with subjective well-being (positive affect [PA] and negative affect [NA]) and <b>psychological</b> well-being (ego <b>integrity</b> and meaning in life) in older adults. It also assessed the structure of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003 a) in older adults. Method. A total of 185 adults aged 65 and older (M age = 73. 42) completed several self-report measures, including the SCS. Results. Path analysis revealed that self-compassion was significantly positively associated with PA, ego integrity, and meaning in life, and negatively associated with NA. Factor analyses indicated that the SCS structure identified among undergraduates was not observed in our older sample. Instead, two factors emerged which provided predictive utility. Discussion. These results extend research knowledge, inform strategies to enhance well-being in older adults, and indicate that self-compassion may represent a valuable psychological resource for positive aging.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to give an account of the psychological welfare of employees in the context of self-determination theory. SDT represents an approach to human motivation and personality that uses traditional empirical methods which make clear the importance of development of human innate abilities for personal development, integration and self-regulation. Self-determination theory emphasizes that welfare is an direct function with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. According to the above mentioned theory self actualization (eudemonia) represents the key aspect of psychological welfare. Namely, SDT aims to explain what it means to actualize oneself and how to schive that. The researches within self-determination theory are focused on the factors that allow or prevent <b>psychological</b> grouth, <b>integrity</b> and welfare. SDT is a theory with great prospect and it allows us not only to understand better the psychological processes in many aspects of use (sport, work, parenthood, education, etc.) but also to direct programs and interventions that improve the circumstances in which people live. The theory has recently been applied in health-working psychology and few empirical findings have given support to its fundamental premises. SDT is a consistant theory that can be tested, it is applicable in almost all spheres of life (family, school system, health care, work, relationships among people ect.) and it gives a broad spectrum of possible problems to research. It not only offers different social environments and his welfare, but the theory also offers directives how to improve the conditions in witch people live and work. The organizational context that allows the possibility to choose, make autonomous decisions, clear explanations of certain work assignments, as well as the appreciation of feelings and attitudes of the employees will bring about greater satisfaction of the innate needs for grouth. It is necessary, in our environment, to emphasize the importance of SDT and its capacity, in other words the possibility of practical implementation of above mentioned concepts and theoretical assumptions...|$|R
