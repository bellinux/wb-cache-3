Klein <b>profiles</b> Fogelman is a family-step <b>profiles.</b> Compared with classic <b>profiles,</b> which increase in thickness {{in order to increase}} the lift coefficient, are contributing to the growth <b>profile</b> drag, <b>profile</b> Kleine Fogelman can improve the value as of the lift coefficient as <b>profile</b> drag. This paradox is explained by the specific geometry of the <b>profile</b> of the class. The flow of air, flowing around this partly rigid, partly air <b>profile</b> creates lift. Since {{in the area of the}} vortex flow of air rubs against the air, the drag of the wing with the <b>profile</b> obtained significantly lower resistance of similar wing with a conventional <b>profile.</b> Thus, the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing with the Klein-Fogelman <b>profile</b> s lower.
