40|$|Sera {{from eight}} {{different}} non-human primate species, in total 216 samples, were analysed {{for the presence}} of TT virus (TTV) sequences. A very high incidence of TTV infection was found in sera from both common <b>chimpanzees</b> and <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees,</b> 48 – 8 % and 66 – 7 %, respectively. Sequence analysis of PCR fragments from two <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> and seven common chimpanzees resulted in a total of 14 different TTV sequences. Phylogenetic analysis, including human TTV of all known genotypes, revealed that: (i) TTV from <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> are closely related to viruses from human genotypes 2 and 3; (ii) TTV sequences obtained from common chimpanzees cluster together with human TTV genotypes 5 and 6, the latter only at the protein level; (iii) TTV from the common chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes verus and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii cluster together, suggesting an ancient host–pathogen relationship before subspeciation 1 – 6 million years ago; and (iv) TTV of common and <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> may have been acquired by these animals in different zoonotic events not longer than 2 – 5 million years ago...|$|R

40|$|An unusual {{serological}} profile against human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type I and II (HTLV-I and -II) proteins {{was reported}} in several human Pygmy tribes in Zaire and Cameroon with serum antibodies reactive with gp 21 and p 24. Here we describe a similar pattern of serum antibodies in a colony of captive <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> and the isolation of a novel retrovirus, simian T-cell lymphotropic virus from Pan paniscus (STLVpan-p), from the {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of several seropositive animals. Cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three seropositive <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> with human cord blood mononuclear cells led to the expression of an HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-related virus initially demonstrated by electron microscopy. Furthermore, several of these cocultures became immortalized T-cell lines expressing the CD 4 + CD 8 + DR+ phenotype of mature activated T cells. Southern blotting and DNA sequencing of a PCR fragment of viral DNA from these cell cultures demonstrated a distant evolutionary relationship of these viruses to HTLV-I and -II and distinct from the known STLV isolates. We designated this virus STLVpan-p. A genealogical analysis of the captive <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> colony, originated from wild-caught animals, revealed a prevalence of seropositive offspring from infected mothers, as also observed with HTLVs. The presence in this old African Great Ape species of a virus which is genetically quite distinct from HTLV-I and -II could provide new insights in the phylogenesis of STLVs and HTLVs and be instrumental in the discovery of related human viruses...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{deals with}} the <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee's</b> {{interactions}} involving mutual contacts of the ano-genital regions between two individuals, referred to as genito-genital (GG) contacts. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> have unique forms of GG contacts: ventro-ventral copulation.

25|$|Other HPV types, such as HPV-13, vary {{relatively}} little in different human populations. In fact, {{the sequence of}} HPV-13 closely resembles a papillomavirus of bonobos (also known as <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees).</b> It {{is not clear whether}} this similarity is due to recent transmission between species or because HPV-13 has simply changed very little in the six or so million years since humans and bonobos diverged.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzees</b> (bonobos) {{share many}} {{physical}} characteristics with humans. A prime example are their neotenous skulls. The shape of their skull {{does not change}} into adulthood; it only increases in size. This is due to sexual dimorphism and an evolutionary change in timing of development. Juveniles became sexually mature before their bodies had fully developed into adulthood, and due to some selective advantage the neotenic structure of the skull remained in later generations.|$|R

5000|$|From the {{perspective}} of evolutionary psychology the experiences and behaviors associated with love can be investigated {{in terms of how}} they have been shaped by human evolution. For example, {{it has been suggested that}} human language has been selected during evolution as a type of [...] "mating signal" [...] that allows potential mates to judge reproductive fitness. Miller described evolutionary psychology as a starting place for further research: [...] "Cognitive neuroscience could try to localize courtship adaptations in the brain. Most importantly, we need much better observations concerning real-life human courtship, including the measurable aspects of courtship that influence mate choice, the reproductive (or at least sexual) consequences of individual variation in those aspects, and the social-cognitive and emotional mechanisms of falling in love." [...] Since Darwin's time there have been similar speculations about the evolution of human interest in music also as a potential signaling system for attracting and judging the fitness of potential mates. It has been suggested that the human capacity to experience love has been evolved as a signal to potential mates that the partner will be a good parent and be likely to help pass genes to future generations. Biologist Jeremy Griffith defines love as 'unconditional selflessness', suggesting utterly cooperative instincts developed in modern humans' ancestor, Australopithecus. Studies of bonobos (a great ape previously referred to as a <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee)</b> are frequently cited in support of a cooperative past in humans.|$|E

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} type 13 (HPV- 13) {{is associated}} with oral focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH) in humans. A recent epidemic of a FEH-like disease in a <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee</b> (Pan paniscus) colony allowed us to clone a novel papillomavirus genome. To assess the homology between HPV- 13 and the <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee</b> papillomavirus type 1 (PCPV- 1), the complete nucleotide sequences of both FEH-related viruses were determined. In both viruses, all eight major open reading frames were located on one strand and the genomic organization {{was similar to that}} of other mucosal papillomaviruses. The genomes of PCPV- 1 and HPV- 13 showed extensive overall sequence homology (85 %). They could be classified, using phylogenetic analysis, together with HPV types 6, 11, 43, and 44 in a group associated with benign orogenital lesions.

40|$|The {{high rate}} of {{evolution}} of mitochondrial DNA makes this molecule suitable for genealogical research on such closely related species as humans and apes. Because previous approaches failed to establish the branching order of the lineages leading to humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees, we compared human mitochondrial DNA to mitochondrial DNA from five species of ape (common chimpanzee, <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee,</b> gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon). About 50 restriction endonuclease cleavage sites were mapped in each mitochondrial DNA, and the six maps were aligned with respect to 11 invariant positions. Differences among the maps were evident at 121 positions. Both conserved and variable sites are widely dispersed in the mitochondrial genome. Besides site differences, ascribed to point mutations, there is evidence for one rearrangement: the gorilla map is shorter than the other owing to the deletion of 95 base pairs near the origin of replication. The parsimony method of deriving all six maps from a common ancestor produced a genealogical tree in which the common and <b>pygmy</b> <b>chimpanzee</b> maps are the most closely related pair; the closest relative of this pair is the gorilla map; most closely related to this trio is the human map. This tree is only slightly more parsimonious than some alternative trees.
