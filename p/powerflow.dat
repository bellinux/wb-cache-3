40|$|An {{increasing}} number of inverter based power generators have been connected to the distribution network in recent years. This phenomenon, coupled with the adoption of open energy markets has significantly complicated the <b>powerflows</b> on the power network, requiring advanced and intelligent parameter knowledge to optimize the efficiency, quality and reliability of the system.

Coupled with the adoption of open energy markets, this event has significantly complicated the <b>powerflows</b> on the {{distribution grid}}, urging network operators to invest in advanced control and monitoring tools in order to optimize the efficiency and reliability of the system. In this context, a method to estimate the connection status of distributed generators and the system topology is proposed in this paper, the goal being to obtain up to date information on the power system network’s configuration. This will enable grid operators to have visibility on the status of the distribution grid and react proactively to problematic situations that might arise. The proposed topology estimation method relies on injected pilot signals through generators feeding in power. Pilot voltage stimulations are injected from distributed generators and the induced currents effects are measured at several nodes in the system. The measured data is evaluated through correlation, and a weighed least-square algorithm, applied to the network’s dynamic model, estimates those unknown parameters and provides an accurate snapshot of the power network topology.

40|$|Lock-in {{thermography}} (LIT) is an {{imaging method}} that depicts radiated heat andits diffusion in manifold samples. LIT offers versatile {{possibilities for the}} characterizationof solar cells and modules since the radiated heat {{is proportional to the}} dissipationof electrical power. Up to now, the quantitative correlation of detected heat and dissipatedelectrical power has been known for silicon solar cells only. For many other typesof solar cells and modules – especially thin film solar cells – LIT has been used as aqualitative measurement tool for depicting the location of defects, for example. Thus,the potential of LIT in terms of the calculation of power generation and dissipation inthin film solar cells has not been exploited. This visualization and calculation of <b>powerflows</b> leads {{to a better understanding of}} the influences of defects on the efficiency ofsolar modules. Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of potential improvements, whichresults in solar modules with higher efficiencies, produced to lower costs. In order to interpret LIT signals accurately, the lock-in algorithm and particularlyits limits have to be understood. The present thesis shows the evaluation of the lockinalgorithm and its algebraic complex result with simulations. It is found that the weakpoints of the lock-in algorithm lie in the sampling of the acquired heat signal. Samplingmoments that are not uniformly distributed in a lock-in period produce unreliable results. A low sampling at high measurement frequencies shows significant deviationsdistorting the LIT result. The findings allow for the development of user-friendly LITsystems that automatically avoid sampling errors and produce reliable LIT results. The comprehension of LIT measurements of thin film solar cells needs a theoreticalthermal model for the solar cells that can be used to solve the differential heatdiffusion equation. The solution describes the surface temperature distribution that isacquired in LIT measurements. By the evaluation of the frequency response of a pointheat source in a thin film solar cell, a simple thermal model representing a solid body isfound to adequately reproduce LIT measurements. LIT investigations in the scale of the thermal diffusion length are hampered bythe diffusion of heat that leads to a blurring of heat sources. With the description of thethermal model and a Fourier transform technique, it is possible to successfully deconvolutethe heat generating sources from the heat diffusion, meaning the removal of thethermal blurring. This leads to the unimpeded visualization of the dissipated power ofsmall heat sources such as shunts or the series interconnection of cells in a thin filmsolar module [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{mechanisms}} governing the sub-wavelength spatial localization {{of light in}} surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes by investigating both local and global features in optical <b>powerflow</b> at SPP frequencies. Close inspection of the instantaneous Poynting vector reveals formation of optical vortices – localized areas of cyclic <b>powerflow</b> – at the metal-dielectric interface. As a result, optical energy circulates through a subwavelength-thick ‘conveyor belt’ between the metal and dielectric where it creates a high density of optical states (DOS), tight optical energy localization, and low group velocity associated with SPP waves. The formation of bonding and anti-bonding SPP modes in metal-dielectric-metal waveguides can also be conveniently {{explained in terms of}} different spatial arrangements of localized <b>powerflow</b> vortices between two metal interfaces. Finally, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of global topological transitions in metamaterials composed of multiple metal and dielectric films, i. e., transitions of their iso-frequency surfaces from ellipsoids to hyperboloids, which are not accompanied by the breaking of lattice symmetry. Our analysis reveals that such global topological transitions are governed by the dynamic local re-arrangement of local topological features of the optical interference field, such as vortices and saddle points, which reconfigures global optical <b>powerflow</b> within the metamaterial. These new insights into plasmonic light localization and DOS manipulation not only help to explain the well-known properties of SPP waves but also provide useful guidelines for the design of plasmonic components and materials for a variety of practical applications.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} a hydrodynamics-inspired {{approach to}} trap and manipulate light in plasmonic nanostructures, {{which is based}} on steering optical <b>powerflow</b> around nano-obstacles. New insights into plasmonic nanofocusing mechanisms are obtained by invoking an analogy of the ‘photon fluid’ (PF).

In particular, trapped light can be molded into optical vortices–tornado-like areas of circular motion of power flux–connected into transmission-like sequences. In the electromagnetic theory terms, this approach is based on radiationless electromagnetic interference of evanescent fields rather than on interference of propagating waves radiated by the dipoles induced in nanoparticles.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{automotive}} industry Lattice-Boltzmann type flow solvers like <b>PowerFlow</b> from Exa Corporation are becoming increasingly important. In contrast to the traditional finite volume approach <b>PowerFlow</b> utilizes a hierachical cartesian grid for flow simulation. In this case study we show how {{to take advantage of}} these hierarchical grids in order to extend an existing Lattice-Boltzmann CFD environment with an automotive soiling simulation system. To achieve this, we chose to constantly generate a huge number of massive particles in user manipulable particle emitters. The process of tracing these particles step by step thus creates evolving particle streams, which can be displayed interactively by our visualization system. Each particle is created with stochastically varying diameter, specific mass and initial velocity, whereas already existing particles may decay because of aging, when leaving the simulation domain or when colliding with the vehicle’s surface. On the one hand the display of these animated particles is a very natural and intuitive way to explore a CFD data set. On the other hand animated massive particles can be easily utilized for driving an automotive soiling simulation just by coloring the particles ’ hit points on the vehicle’s surface. ...|$|E

40|$|The European Union’s {{energy and}} climate policy {{objectives}} for 2030 targets to achieve at least 27 % of the generated electricity from renewables. Such large-scale integration of renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid, will have drastic {{effects on the}} electricity grid structure, system operations and {{the functioning of the}} electricity market itself. In order to tackle the intermittency challenges posed by RES, smarter operating processes are essential. This requires accurate simulation tools and an efficient exchange of information between the energy players in Europe (TSOs, DSOs and other private generators). The Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) was developed to support data exchanges between these energy players. The CGMES based Common Information Model (CGMES-CIM) files contain all the information about the grid under study including the <b>powerflow</b> values. The current version of CGMES-CIM supports full interoperability with respect to steady state simulations but is quite challenging to use for dynamic simulations. Open-Instance Power System Library (OpenIPSL), which is a Modelica based power system library, seems {{to be one of the}} possible solutions that can overcome the interoperability issue with respect to dynamic simulations. This thesis focuses on extending the OpenIPSL with PowerFactory based models and provides a proof of concept to automatically initialize the Modelica grid model using CGMES-CIM. OpenModelica, an open-source Modelica simulation environment is used in this project to carry out dynamic studies on a modified Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) grid model. In order to perform dynamic studies, the Modelica grid model first needs to be populated with <b>powerflow</b> values. OpenModelica does not include <b>powerflow</b> option and therefore, <b>powerflow</b> solution needs to be obtained from another simulation tool and the values need to be subsequently loaded into OpenModelica to perform dynamic simulations; this process is called Initialization. Thus, to overcome the challenges with initialization of Modelica models, this thesis presents a proof of concept that directly utilizes the CGMES-CIM files for initialization of Modelica based grid models. The interfacing process between CIM and Modelica based grid model is done using Python. To test the concept, Modelica based dynamic simulations were carried out and compared with reference results (signal records obtained through time domain simulations) from PowerFactory. For this purpose, several PowerFactory based Modelica models were developed and validated, extending the OpenIPSL. These models were subsequently used to create and validate a modified BPA grid model, which serves as a test case. This thesis also proposes a method to directly convert CGMES-CIM files to Modelica files. This conversion helps achieve complete automation of dynamic simulations in a Modelica environment. Therefore, this thesis contributes to the OpenIPSL by developing PowerFactory based models and, also proposes a new CGMES-CIM to Modelica converter. Electrical Sustainable Energ...|$|E
