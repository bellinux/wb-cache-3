In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic <b>printing</b> <b>timer</b> which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E

When the Seiko Group was selected to be the official time keeper for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a <b>printing</b> <b>timer</b> was required to time events, and Shinshu Seiki started developing an electronic printer.|$|E

30|$|Conjugated {{conductive}} polymers {{have seen}} prosperous applications, e.g., <b>printed</b> sensors or <b>timers,</b> electronic newspaper, wearable electronics, and displays. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a derivative of polythiophene, firstly developed by Bayer AG research laboratories, shows excellent transparency in the visible region, good electrical conductivity, and environmental stability [1]. However, PEDOT prepared by using oxidative chemical or electrochemical polymerization methods {{is found to}} be insoluble and therefore difficult to process in thin-film form or other shapes [2]. Water soluble PEDOT:PSS was achieved by using a water-soluble poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS) as the charge-balancing dopant during polymerization [3], which is a system with good film-forming properties, high visible light transmittance and excellent environmental stability. It has been successfully used in anti-static coating and organic optoelectronic deices etc. [4 â€“ 7]. PEDOT:PSS electrodes are good candidates to replace brittle indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes for the fully flexible electronic devices, except their lower conductivity [8, 9], as the high Joule heat generated by the current flowing through the organic electrodes impairs the performance as well as the lifetime of the devices. Grain-like structure was reported on spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films, in which the PEDOT core was surrounded by a thin layer of PSS shell with a non-homogenous distribution of the PEDOT and PSS species in a single grain [10]. This core-shell structure is likely to limit the conductivity, as commercially available products have a conductivity of 1 S/cm (Baytron P, Bayer Corporation), which limits its application in optoelectronic devices.|$|R
