5|$|The University of Central Florida has {{a unique}} campus layout {{that has become a}} model for other universities, {{reminiscent}} of the plans by Walt Disney for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT. The campus was designed to be a pedestrian oriented campus, with a series of concentric circles. The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd, which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus. Inside of Gemini, there is Apollo Circle, Mercury Circle, and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle. Pegasus Circle contains the student union, which is the center of the campus, with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it. All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini, with the circle divided up into <b>pie-shaped</b> sections for each college. As there are very few roads inside of Gemini, many buildings' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night. The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design, the other being the University of California, Irvine. Newsweek has ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country. Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus. Outside of Gemini, the campus is divided up into different themed sections. The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities, the north side contains Knights Plaza, an uptown style athletic village, the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida, and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities.|$|E

2500|$|Experts from Rhode Island College {{were brought}} in for the Plaintiff's side to judge the {{effectiveness}} of the school board's new plan. [...] From April to November 1969, McMillan repeatedly ordered the board to revise the plan. The Board eventually submitted a plan rezoning neighborhoods into <b>pie-shaped</b> wedges, where blacks living in the center of Charlotte would be divided up and distributed to outlying, formerly white high schools. The school board's plan required busing and would achieve a black population of 2-36% in all ten of the high schools. Due to the greater number of elementary schools, elaborate gerrymandering was required and would achieve greater integration, but would leave more than half of black elementary students at majority-black schools.|$|E

Doughboy is a non-humanoid bioform who normally assumes an enormous <b>pie-shaped</b> form {{with a face}} consisting of eyes, a mouth, and sometimes a nose, long rubbery arms with only two fingers each, and stalk-like legs with two toes each. His body resembles dough both in appearance and in consistency.|$|E
50|$|The Lemp Brewery {{consists}} of 27 buildings on a 13.7 acre <b>pie-shaped</b> site bounded by Cherokee Street on the north, Lemp Avenue on the west, and South Broadway on the southeast.

When it was constructed by the Lemp Family, the Lemp Mansion, included an underground tunnel through the natural cave system leading to the Lemp Brewery. The Lemp Family would use this tunnel to go to work.|$|E
5000|$|Connected {{to the two}} {{principal}} centers (Madalena {{on the west coast}} and Lajes on the south coast) by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway, the parish is wedged between the parishes of São Caetano and Candelária.

50|$|The Service Module was an {{unpressurized}} cylindrical structure, measuring 24 ft {{long and}} 12 ft in diameter.The interior {{was a simple}} structure consisting of a central tunnel section 44 in in diameter, surrounded by six <b>pie-shaped</b> sectors. The sectors were topped by a forward bulkhead and fairing, separated by six radial beams, covered on the outside by four honeycomb panels, and supported by an aft bulkhead and engine heat shield. The sectors were not all equal 60° angles, but varied according to required size.|$|E
50|$|Linked by the Regional E.R.1-1ª roadway to {{the parish}}es of Criação Velha (to the north) and São Caetano (to the southeast), the parish is {{primarily}} a coastal agricultural community. From the coast, for about 2 km, the parish comprises cultivatable lands and settlements, which starts sloping into higher altitudes, reaching its extreme at Ponta do Pico; the parish is basically a <b>pie-shaped</b> wedge, with 8.6 km at its extreme, along the coast. Settled areas are divided equally between hedge-row-divided parcels and forested patches of land, with scrub and natural vegetation occupying higher altitudes.|$|E
50|$|The {{repair work}} on the SRBs had {{involved}} workers making a <b>pie-shaped</b> cut in the propellant block to remove the defective area. However, most of CSD's qualified personnel had left the program by this point and so the repair crew in question {{did not know the}} proper procedure. After replacement, they neglected to seal the area where the cut in the propellant block had been made. The result was a near-repeat of 34D-9; a gap was left between the propellant and SRB casing so that another burn-through occurred during launch.|$|E

Among the songs were [...] "Charleston Rag", [...] "Daddy", [...] "My Handyman Ain't Handy No More", [...] "Gee, I Wish I Had Someone to Rock Me in the Cradle of Love", and [...] "There's a Million Little Cupids in the Sky" [...] (from the Blake-Sissle show [...] "The Chocolate Dandies).|$|E
50|$|The parish is {{bounded by}} the parishes of Bandeiras {{to the north}} and west and Criação Velha to the south: a <b>pie-shaped</b> wedge that extends from the coast to the summit of Pico. The main {{regional}} E.R.1-2ª roadway travels along the coast into Madalena, from Baixio Grande in the northeast (at Bandeiras) to Sertão and Canada João Paulinho in the southwest (at the border with Criação Velha). Meanwhile, near the main medical centre, the E.R.3-2ª bisects the parish and continues to the centre of the island: the former Estrada Longitudanal. Finally, from the main square (Largo Cardeal Costa Nunes) a variant of the E.R.1-2ª continues to Bandeiras.|$|E

50|$|The ride {{begins with}} a hissing sound of air, and the metal {{platform}} separates into eight <b>pie-shaped</b> wedges as it retracts away from the gondola. Into the first swing, the gondola immediately begins rotating slowly as each consecutive swing intensifies. The rotation allows riders' experience to change throughout the entire ride, and at each swing's peak, a brief floating sensation can be felt. Within thirty seconds, the pendulum reaches its maximum arc of 240 degrees. As the ride cycle nears the end, the pendulum slows to a stop nearly {{as fast as it}} accelerated in the beginning. Within a few swings, the gondola moves into a controlled stop as the loading platform lifts back into place.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{is located}} along the northwestern {{coast of the}} {{municipality}} and connected to the regional road that encircles the island. The area is relatively hilly along the coast, and gradually slopes towards the interior, where it reaches its peak (literally) in the stratovolcano of Pico. Its borders conform to an irregular <b>pie-shaped</b> wedge between the parishes of Madalena and Santa Luzia (in the municipality of São Roque do Pico); its widest portion is approximately 1.5 kilometres and about 5 kilometres long from the coast to Ponta do Pico. Most cultivatable lands {{are close to the}} roadways, and the community is predominantly rural. Forests dominate the mid-elevations, while scrub, mosses and smaller tree species are exist along the slopes of the mountain.|$|E
50|$|The planetarium has a 102-person seating {{capacity}} (98 regular chairs, 4 wheelchair positions). Each seat {{is equipped with}} an interactive control panel on its armrest that allows the audience to vote during programs. The Barlow has panorama slide projectors and an all-sky system (an all-sky image {{is a series of}} six <b>pie-shaped</b> images that are aligned to make a picture fill the dome). Video images can be projected onto the dome from DVD, laser disk, computer, or SVHS tapes. The planetarium is powered by a Digistar II star projector. In 2004 the Barlow acquired a laser projection system that uses a three-color argon laser to draw images set to music on the dome. The planetarium also has a 10,000-watt sound system.|$|E
50|$|The first camera {{installed}} on the SPT contained a 960-element bolometer array of superconducting transition edge sensors (TES), which made {{it one of the}} largest TES bolometer arrays ever built. The focal plane for this camera (referred to as the SPT-SZ camera because it was designed to conduct a survey of galaxy clusters through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect signature) was split into six <b>pie-shaped</b> wedges, each with 160 detectors. These wedges observed at three different frequencies: 95 GHz, 150 GHz, and 220 GHz. The modularity of the focal plane allowed it to be broken into many different frequency configurations. For the majority {{of the life of the}} camera, the SPT-SZ focal plane had one wedge at 95 GHz, four at 150 GHz, and one at 220 GHz.|$|E
50|$|When the {{two ships}} collided, Saudi Riyadhs bow struck the {{starboard}} side of Arthur W. Radford, about 30 ft behind its bow. Saudi Riyadh sustained a four-foot-high, 30 ft-long gash along the port and starboard sides of its bow, {{with most of the}} damage to its port side. Arthur W. Radford, more heavily damaged, sustained a deep gash on its starboard side, penetrating nearly 25 ft into the main deck, ripping a <b>pie-shaped</b> gash and penetrating into the centerline of Arthur W. Radford. A hole ran from the deck to the waterline. The collision toppled its 5-inch 54-caliber gun and damaged Tomahawk cruise missile tubes. One sailor aboard suffered a broken arm, and 12 more had various injuries. The ship entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard Drydock #3 25 February 1999.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{is located}} in the western coast of the municipality, {{sandwiched}} between the parishes of Madalena and Candelária; a <b>pie-shaped</b> wedge that extends just to the base of Ponte do Pico to an area of about 2.75 kilometers at its maximum width. Unlike the other parishes with the municipality of Madalena, Criação Velha's borders does not extend to the top of Pico (its limit stops about 2 kilometers from the summit of the stratovolcano). The area is relatively hilly, sloping gradually from forested parcels into an area of semi-cultivatable land and then scrub pasture-lands. Most practical farming occurs around the central parish, since the forested lands are dense and impractical. The area is recognized for a series of grottos, with about 5 kilometers of extensions, carved from the dykes and subterranean lava fields along the island's history.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 and 2013, SO - IL was {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} inaugural presence for the Frieze fair in New York City. Working with a prefabricated rental tent structure forced them to be inventive with a limited vocabulary. <b>Pie-shaped</b> tent section wedges bend the otherwise straight tent into a meandering, supple, shape. The winding form animates it on the unusual waterfront site, as well as establishing the temporary structure as an icon along the water. In Spring 2013, SO - IL won a competition to design the new Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at the University of California, Davis. Plans for the museum include a 50,000 square foot permeable roof or [...] "Grand Canopy" [...] that blurs building edges, and creates a sensory landscape {{of a variety of}} activities and scales. The building is expected to be completed in 2016 and achieve LEED Platinum.|$|E
50|$|Two sets of old {{shingles}} were peeled {{from the}} roof. Chain saws hacked the roof into numerous <b>pie-shaped</b> pieces. The haymow {{and the outside}} walls were dismantled {{and moved to the}} new site. The barn was gone, only the silo remained standing, a solitary testament to history. The Association contracted a crane to pick up the entire silo and lay it down on a flat bed truck trailer. Then a heavy duty farm tractor came in to pull the silo down the hill. As the tractor started up the hill the silo looked as if it were going to collapse inwardly so the tractor was stopped and the silo chained off to a tree overnight until the Amish carpenters could reinforce the silo's bracing. The next day the silo was slowly pulled over gravel country roads, the State of Illinois would not permit the silo to travel over concrete State Highways, to its new site.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of {{the jail}} was {{simultaneous}} {{with that of}} the county’s new courthouse, which was finished in 1888. [...] It was designed by William H. Brown and Benjamin F. Haugh of Indianapolis, Indiana. [...] It was built at a cost of $30,000. The building was one of 18 such jails that were built in the United States and the only one that was three stories tall. [...] The front part of the jail had offices for the jailer, kitchen, trustee cells and quarters for women. The rest of the building is made up of <b>pie-shaped</b> cells that revolved inside of a cage. The building was designed for maximum security with minimal contact between the prisoners and the jailers. [...] The building was used as a jail until 1969. [...] In 1971 the Council Bluffs Park Board acquired the building and in 1977 the county historical society took ownership of the building and maintains it as a museum.|$|E

It had no discernible features, being merely a <b>pie-shaped</b> mass of sleek red fur a little darker than Castor's own hair. [...] "They're affectionate little things {{and many of the}} sand rats keep them for pets - a man has to have someone to talk to when he's out prospecting and a flat cat is better than a wife because it can't talk back. It just purrs and snuggles up to you." [...] The boys take the flat cat onto the family space ship, where it soon has eight [...] "kittens", each of which soon gives birth again, until the ship is overwhelmed with flat cats. The family solves the problem by rounding up the flat cats and putting them into the storage hold at low temperature, where they hibernate. They are later revived and sold to miners in the asteroid belt.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{principle}} {{was to use}} a small air tank to capture, compress and controllably release air power and convert it into mechanical motion. Each Space Pet shipped with a [...] "Tomy air pump" [...] {{that was used to}} recharge the air tank. The air pump resembled a bicycle pump, although smaller. The flagship model was the [...] "High Hopping Hoomdorm", which was something of a mechanical grasshopper that would hop furiously (and somewhat erratically) across the room. Other models included the [...] "Stretch Legged Stoomdorm" [...] which propelled itself in an accordion-like fashion, the [...] "Fleet Footed Floomdorm" [...] which sort of shuffled along on <b>pie-shaped</b> feet and the [...] "Lurch Along Loomdorm" [...] which raises up by means of scissor action, then fell forward and retracted its feet. There were four models in total. The entire Space Pets line was closely related to TOMY Air Powered Vehicle line. Variations of Space Pets were sold under other names outside of the USA. For example, the [...] "High Hopping Hoomdorm" [...] was packaged and sold as the [...] "Sky Hopper" [...] in the United Kingdom. Likewise, [...] "Lunar Legs" [...] was an alias for the [...] "Stretch Legged Stoomdorm".|$|E
50|$|The Solinst {{continuous}} multichannel tubing (CMT) {{system is}} a system that uses custom-extruded flexible 1.7-inch OD multichannel MDPE tubing to monitor as many as seven discrete zones within a single borehole in either unconsolidated sedimentary or in bedrock. Prior to insertion, ports are created that allow groundwater to enter each of the six outer <b>pie-shaped</b> channels (nominal diameter=0.5 in) at different depths with a central hexagonal center channel (nominal diameter=0.4 in) at the bottom. The multichannel tubing can be extruded in lengths up to 300 feet and is generally shipped as 200 foot lengths in 4-ft-diameter coils. The desired length of tubing, equal to the total depth of the multilevel well plus stickup, is cut from the coil, and the well is built at the jobsite based on the hydrogeologic data obtained from the exploratory boring or other methods. The tubing is stiff enough to be easily handled, yet light and flexible enough to allow site workers to insert the multilevel well hand-over-hand into the borehole. To date, CMT installations have been almost entirely backfilled installations where the sand packs and bentonite seals are poured or tremied from the ground surface. Einarson and Cherry (2002) provide additional information on the CMT system. More information is also provided by Solinst.|$|E
