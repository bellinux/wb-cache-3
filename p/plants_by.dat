5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E

5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on <b>plants.</b> <b>By</b> reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid {{progress}} {{in establishing a}} modern monophyletic classification of the flowering <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the Liliaceae family, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves of the <b>Plants,</b> <b>by</b> the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin.

5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the Mojave Desert. It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} grow in {{riparian}} zones along the park's washes. Willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants, joined by rushes and sedges. Here the invasive Eurasian tamarisk, {{also known as}} saltcedar, threatens native <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> crowding, using most of the available water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.|$|E
5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> 2015 to reduce its cost base.|$|E

5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of <b>plants,</b> <b>by</b> means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus {{described}} <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> their uses, and attempted a biological classification {{based on how}} plants reproduced, a first {{in the history of}} botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book.|$|E

Olympus was fined 700 million yen ($7 million USD). In April 2014, six banks filed a civil suit against Olympus over the fraud, seeking an additional 28 billion yen in damages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
