25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low <b>pressure</b> <b>variation</b> with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

30|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution is}} {{obtained for the}} problem of a pressure field, caused by harmonic oscillations of {{a segment of the}} ocean bottom within the frequency band of “forced oscillations.” On the basis of this solution, the amplitude of <b>pressure</b> <b>variations</b> is shown to undergo a rapid exponential drop with an increase in the distance from the source. Therefore, in the case of observatories installed on a nearly horizontal bottom a contribution to the <b>pressure</b> <b>variations</b> can only be given by submarine slopes the distance from which does not exceed 1 – 2 ocean depths. A cross-spectral analysis of <b>pressure</b> <b>variations</b> and of three-component accelerograms have confirmed the hypothesis concerning the contribution of horizontal movements of nearby submarine slopes to <b>pressure</b> <b>variations.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bell {{operations}} and lockouts {{may also be}} done at between 0.4 and 0.6 bar oxygen partial pressure, but often use a higher partial pressure of oxygen, between 0.6 and 0.9 bar, which lessens the effect of <b>pressure</b> <b>variation</b> due to excursions away from holding pressure, thereby reducing the amount and probability of bubble formation due to these pressure changes. In emergencies a partial pressure of 0.6 bar of oxygen can be tolerated for over 24 hours, but this is avoided where possible. Carbon dioxide can also be tolerated at higher levels for limited periods. US Navy limit is 0.02 bar for up to 4 hours. Nitrogen partial pressure starts at 0.79 bar, but tends to decrease over time as the system loses gas to lock operation, and is topped up with helium.|$|E

In the work, we put an accent on the relationship between ocean bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>variations</b> and accelerations in movements of the ocean bottom, following from on-site observed data, and, also, on the physical interpretation and development of a mathematical model of this phenomenon. Special attention is devoted to a discussion of the contribution of horizontal components of the acceleration of the ocean bottom movement to <b>pressure</b> <b>variations</b> at the ocean bottom.|$|R

His observations for temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>variation,</b> hygrometry, and psychrometry of the Orotavan climate, which he chose for health, are valuable. He starts with a theory of the three conditions of salubrity--heat-and-cold, humidity, and atmospheric change.
