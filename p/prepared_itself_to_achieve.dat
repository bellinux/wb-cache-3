Stress is a regular psychological response to any external pressure. In situations when we face stress, our body responds by <b>preparing</b> <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> cope up with the challenges. This is mostly done by the release of chemicals such as adrenaline, neurotransmitters, and stress hormones. The release of chemicals works in our favor as a source of energy, in turn affecting all our organs.

Two main theories as {{of the origin of}} the name exist.
