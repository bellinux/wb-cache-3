40|$|To convert {{lignocellulose}} into transportation {{fuels and}} chemical products, pretreatment of the biomass, {{leading to the}} separation of the main components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), is a crucial and still challenging first step. Within this study, the screw press pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and its effect on the subsequent chemical pretreatment steps were evaluated. Macroscopic disruption and defibration of reed <b>straw</b> after screw <b>press</b> pretreatment were confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy and dye adsorption studies, showing an enhancement of the accessible surface area. Alkaline and dilute acid hydrolysis was tested to study the release of phenols or sugars from screw-press-treated and non-treated straw materials. To showcase a realistic subsequent chemical pretreatment step, kinetics of enzymatic hydrolysis after a biogenic and biphasic fractionation (OrganoCat) process was tested to evaluate the release of glucose from cut and <b>pressed</b> reed <b>straw.</b> Pretreatment by a screw press enhanced alkaline hydrolysis. A kinetic study showed that screw press pretreatment can reduce processing time and the amount of alkaline chemicals needed. A 75 % and a 116 % increase in the release of reducing sugars from screw-press-treated wheat and reed straw was detected, respectively. Whereas the OrganoCat fractionation of the screw-press-pretreated reed straw showed no significant improvement, a synergetic effect could be observed in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose pulp after combination of both pretreatments in comparison to applying only the cutting mill before chemical fractionation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} making straw briquettes. The aim {{is to examine the}} possibility of making straw briquettes directly on the field from lines arising after the passing of the combine harvester, which would save the operation of harvesting and storing straw and thus transport intensity. The basis of this work is finding straw production in the Czech Republic and its possible potential to produce briquettes. The Czech Republic is able to use for energy purposes, an average of 1. 6 million t / y of straw cereals and 900 000 t / y of rape straw. Low specific density cut straw complicated transport to incinerators or to stationary lines to produce other forms of fuel. <b>Pressing</b> the <b>straw</b> bales specific density improves, but costs associated with transport are still relatively high. Because of low specific density, straw often stored in open stacks. Not all the straw, which is not used directly in agriculture, is used for combustion. There are also other industrial uses for straw, as Ecopanels (construction), paper, various ornaments and tools (for example: baskets). Most important for the production of briquettes is the moisture content of input material, which may not exceed 15 %. The basis for obtaining briquettes directly in the field is appropriate combination of forage harvester and briquetting press, for example self-propelled briquetting press Biotruck 2000 is constructed from the Claas Jaguar. Forage harvester transports straw to the briquetting press, during transport is straw dried because of the heat from powerful engine. To briquetting is used several types of presses that are described in this thesis. The best quality briquettes are formed on the principle of screw press. The last two parts of the thesis are dealing with proposal the technological line for production of briquettes from straw directly on the field. There are described here used machines, their cost, performance and energy efficiency in those parts of the thesis. In the proposed procedure is a dry indoor storage of briquettes...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of corn silage with {{varying levels of}} ammonia gassed wheat straw on performance, digestibility, fermentation parameters, chewing activities, blood metabolites and profitability of Holstein heifers have been evaluated. Fifteen Holstein heifer with 9 - 10 months of age were assigned in a completely randomized design with 3 treatment as 1) 36 % corn silage, 2) 18 % corn silage and 18 % wheat straw and 3) 36 % treated wheat straw and 5 replicates for 2 months. <b>Straw</b> <b>presses</b> treated with 4 % ammonia gas for 30 days. The {{results showed that the}} difference in dry matter intake and average daily weight gain and wither sheight among treatments is not significant. Digestibility of DM, CP, ADF and NDF in treatment 1 was significantly higher than other treatments. Ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen in treatment 3 as were significantly higher than other treatments. Eating time, rumination time and total chewing time in treatment 3 was significantly higher than the other two treatments. Blood urea nitrogen in treatment 3 than the other two treatments and blood albumin in treatment 2 were significantly higher than the other two treatments. Glucose, cholesterol, TG and AST and ALT had no significant difference among treatments. In general, for every kilogram of weight gain, in treatment 3 and treatment 2 as compared to treatment 1, 3860 and 3935 Rials were saved respectively The results showed that the treated straw with 4 % ammonia gas can be completely replaced corn silage in the diet of Holstein heifers without negative impact on their performance...|$|R
40|$|Pigs {{are often}} housed in barren {{intensive}} housing systems {{but according to}} council directive 2008 / 120 /EC, they must have access to enrichment materials. In order to be successful, enrichment should be destructible, edible, nutritional and dung-free. Straw {{seems to be an}} interesting enrichment material but is not a practical option for fully-slatted systems. Producers must therefore provide straw applications to reduce straw waste through the slatted floor. Both the type of straw used and the design of the application might influence the interest for and the effectiveness of the materials. It is therefore designated to verify differences in ways to present enrichment materials, in order to detect applications which are less interesting for pigs. To this end, four straw applications were tested simultaneously (1 enrichment application per pen) during 4 cohorts, presenting them each time during two weeks to 6 pigs (total n = 96) in pens with slatted floors. The four applications tested were a straw rack (long-stemmed straw), a straw feeder (long-stemmed straw), a MIK Toy (in rolls <b>pressed</b> chopped <b>straw)</b> and the Ikadan Straw Dispenser with chopped straw. All pigs had ad libitum access to straw from one of the applications. Behaviour was recorded using video cameras. Data were analysed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 separately using the logistic mixed model. The daily used straw quantity per pen was registered during the entire test period. The quantity of straw use was the highest in presence of the straw rack (P < 0. 0001), with an average straw use of approximately 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. Straw use did not differ between week 1 and week 2 for any of the applications, but manipulative behaviour towards the application decreased for all applications during week 2 compared to week 1. This suggests a decrease in the required time to intake straw from the applications. In presence of the straw feeder, most of the time only one pig was occupied with the application, while in presence of the straw rack, the MIK Toy and the Funbar, more pigs interacted simultaneously with the device (P < 0. 0001). Pigs spent more consecutive scans interacting with the straw rack and the straw feeder (P = 0. 0003), which could be explained by the use of long straw with these applications. The results show that the duration of interactions with the applications might depend on the type of straw that is used. This study was funded by the Federal Public Service of Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment (Contract RT 12 / 02 SUCANNIB). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} four straw applications on pigs housed on slatted floors were investigated to determine differences in behavior, straw use and growth. Both {{the type of}} straw used and {{the design of the}} application might influence the attractiveness and effectiveness of the applications. To this end, four straw applications were tested simultaneously (1 application per pen), presenting them during two weeks to six pigs. This experimental set-up was repeated three times. The four applications tested were a straw dispenser (Funbar) with fully chopped straw, a MIK Toy (in rolls <b>pressed</b> chopped <b>straw),</b> a rack (long-stemmed straw) and a straw feeder (long-stemmed straw). All pigs (total n = 96) had ad libitum access to straw from one of the applications. Behavior was recorded using video cameras and analyzed per individual pig for week 1 and week 2 of each experimental set-up separately using the logistic mixed model. The rack and straw feeder were explored and manipulated the most (P = 0. 02). In addition, the duration of sustained contact with the application was longer in presence of these applications (P = 0. 0009). This result might be related to the use of long straw. The straw use in presence of the rack was very high, with an average straw use of 2 kg per pen (6 pigs) per week. For all applications, direct contact with the application decreased during the second week compared to the first week. However, this decrease was the smallest in pens with the MIK Toy. Synchronized use of the applications was seen to a small extent, as in most cases not more than two pigs showed application interaction simultaneously. The presence of the Funbar (straw dispenser) was associated with a higher frequency of belly-nosing (P = 0. 03), nosing other body-parts of pen mates (P = 0. 06) and manipulating pen fittings (P = 0. 0002). It has been shown that the use of chopped straw might be related to a higher frequency of manipulating pen-mates, {{but it is not clear}} whether the type of straw explains this result. Growth and the presence of skin lesions did not differ between the applications. It can be concluded that the straw rack and feeder attract 35 pigs to a larger extent. In addition, these applications are associated with longer durations of sustained contact. Straw use however is very high in presence of the rack. The Funbar straw dispenser is the least preferred application regarding behavioral effects. It seemed that this application did not offer growing pigs the same distraction as the other applications. status: publishe...|$|R
