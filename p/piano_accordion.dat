25|$|Traditional {{styles of}} music have survived most {{in remote areas}} such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalistic regions of the Basques and the Bretons.

These groupes folkloriques tend to focus on very early 20th-century melodies {{and the use of the}} <b>piano</b> <b>accordion.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{instruments}} that are called accordion. The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the <b>piano</b> <b>accordion,</b> which is used for many musical genres.

50|$|DBAs {{have two}} main {{advantages}} {{when compared with}} chromatic <b>accordions</b> such as <b>piano</b> <b>accordions</b> and chromatic button accordions: 1) smaller size and lighter weight, 2) and the rhythmic effects inherent in the single ("push-pull") action.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{standing}} only [...] tall in heels, {{she often}} caught {{the gaze of}} men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to [...] "look beautiful when she woke up". [...] A nephew later said that she could [...] "make a joke out of nothing", and could have [...] "walked out of a burning house with a smile and a joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. [...] She played the ukulele, the <b>piano</b> <b>accordion,</b> and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.|$|E
500|$|She took John back to {{her house}} and {{enrolled}} him in a local school, but after few weeks she handed him back to Mimi. Various reasons have been suggested for her decision, such as Dykins' unwillingness to raise the young boy, Julia's inability {{to cope with the}} responsibility, or a punishment forced on her by Mimi and her father for [...] "living in sin". Lennon blamed himself, saying later, [...] "My mother... couldn't cope with me." [...] He then lived continuously at 'Mendips', in the smallest bedroom above the front door, with Mimi determined to give him a [...] "proper upbringing". Julia later bought Lennon his first guitar for £5/10- (five pounds, ten shillings) after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks, but insisted it had to be delivered to her house, not her sister's. As Lennon had difficulty learning chords, she taught him banjo and ukulele chords, which were simpler, and later taught Lennon how to play the <b>piano</b> <b>accordion.</b> Julia's banjo was the first instrument that John learned to play 'sitting there with endless patience until I managed to work out all the chords.' After Julia's untimely death the instrument was never seen again and its whereabouts remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the accompaniment}} {{for the big}} top summer shows came from Peter Ostroushko, a local {{mandolin}} player. Ostroushko, known {{for his work on}} the radio show A Prairie Home Companion, became involved in the youth circus after his daughter saw a show and decided to join. In 2005, the Butlers discovered Ostroushko's affinity for the mandolin and fiddle, and asked if he would play a Celtic song at the premiere of their upcoming summer big top show, Dyrnwych. He happily agreed, having expressed a lifelong dream of joining a circus, and played the track, [...] "See It There/Con Cassidy's", not only at Dyrnwych opening but also at each of its subsequent 18 performances. The following year, he composed original music for the 2006 Juventas show, Pazzanni, and expanded his band to five members, including himself on mandolin, fiddle, and mandocello, Marc Anderson on percussion, Dan Chouinard on <b>piano,</b> <b>accordion,</b> and keyboard, Dirk Freymuth on electric and acoustic guitars, and Joel Sayles on electric and acoustic bass guitars. Ostroushko again provided a score for Atlanticus and RavensManor, continued in 2010 with Sawdust, then Grimm, and finally Showdown. Tracks from the first four shows for which he played, from Dyrnwych to RavensManor, are anthologized on the album Peter Joins the Circus, published by Borderland Productions in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>piano</b> <b>accordion</b> is the {{official}} city instrument of San Francisco, California. [...] Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments. [...] The oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika, from the Greek harmonikos, meaning harmonic, musical. Today, native versions of the name accordion are more common. These names refer {{to the type of}} accordion patented by Cyrill Demian, which concerned [...] "automatically coupled chords on the bass side".|$|E
50|$|The B/C/C system (also {{known as}} the British Chromatic System) used in Scotland {{provides}} a notable example {{of the use of}} a double-action bass side with a single-action melody side: these instruments frequently feature a full Stradella bass system as used on <b>piano</b> <b>accordions</b> and chromatic button accordions.|$|R

2500|$|Most recently, Scottish piping has {{included}} a renaissance for cauldwind pipes such as smallpipes and border pipes, which use cold, dry air {{as opposed to}} the moist air of mouth-blown pipes. Other [...] pipers such as Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison began to explore new musical genres on many kinds of pipes. [...] The accordion also gained in popularity during the 1970s due to the renown of Phil Cunningham, whose distinctive <b>piano</b> <b>accordion</b> style {{was an integral part of}} the band Silly Wizard. Numerous musicians continued to follow more traditional styles including Alex Beaton.|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City at age 25 on October 26, 1893, and being inspected at Ellis Island, Astaire's father, {{hoping to find}} work in his brewing trade, moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and landed {{a job with the}} Storz Brewing Company. Astaire's mother dreamed of escaping Omaha by virtue of her children's talents, after Astaire's sister, Adele Astaire, early on revealed herself to be an instinctive dancer and singer. She planned a [...] "brother and sister act," [...] which was common in vaudeville at the time. Although Astaire refused dance lessons at first, he easily mimicked his older sister's steps and took up <b>piano,</b> <b>accordion,</b> and clarinet.|$|E
