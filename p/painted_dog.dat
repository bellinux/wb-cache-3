6000|$|... 212. On {{the other}} hand, {{one of the}} four {{pictures}} I chose for permanent teaching in Fors was one of a child and a dog. The child is doing nothing; neither is the dog. But the dog is absolutely and beyond comparison the best <b>painted</b> <b>dog</b> in the world--ancient or modern--on this side of it, or at the Antipodes, (so far as I've seen the contents of said world). And the child is painted so that child cannot be better done. That is a picture for a museum.|$|E
60|$|While he was pondering on {{this the}} {{situation}} was rendered still more difficult by Sammy, who, {{taking advantage of the}} door being open, escaped and rushed into the road, thus publishing his condition to all and sundry. You can hush up a <b>painted</b> <b>dog</b> while it confines itself to your own premises, but once it has mixed with the great public this becomes out of the question. Sammy's state advanced from a private trouble into a row. Mr. Downing's next move was in the same direction that Sammy had taken, only, instead of running about the road, he went straight to the headmaster.|$|E

5000|$|On October 25, 2009, Vega, {{one of the}} zoo's African <b>painted</b> <b>dogs</b> {{gave birth}} to a litter of nine live puppies, and one dead puppy. Vega died the next day, leaving her puppies orphaned. To help nurse and raise the dogs, the zoo found a domesticated dog, Honey, from a local shelter who had {{recently}} given birth and was still lactating. Honey immediately took to the puppies and fed them. At the same time, the zoo's vet staff hand-fed the puppies a liquid diet fortified with enzymes. Although, four of the remaining puppies died - the typical mortality rate for African <b>painted</b> <b>dogs</b> is 50 percent - the remaining five were healthy and doing well after a month. [...] The <b>painted</b> <b>dogs</b> were involved in the death of a young boy in November 2012, during which one dog was shot, and the exhibit was closed.
