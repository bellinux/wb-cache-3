In contrast, hydrolysis of testosterone undecanoate into testosterone is rapid and appears to be complete. The difference in conversion efficiency with DMAU relative to testosterone undecanoate is attributed to steric hindrance in DMAU caused by its additional C7α and C11β methyl groups. Although the hydrolysis of DMAU into dimethandrolone was very limited, it was still sufficient to produce dose-dependent biological effects at the dosages assessed, including reversible suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. A subsequent <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>study</b> found that the conversion of DMAU into dimethandrolone was improved when the drug was delivered orally in castor oil/benzyl benzoate or a self-emulsifying drug delivery system contained in capsules as opposed to powder in capsules.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{pharmacotherapy}} {{during pregnancy}} is common and increasing. Physiologic changes during pregnancy may significantly alter overall systemic drug exposure, necessitating dose changes. A search of PubMed for <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> showed 494 publications during pregnancy out of 35, 921 total <b>pharmacokinetic</b> published <b>studies</b> (1. 29 %), {{from the late}} 1960 s through August 31, 2013. Closer examination of <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> in pregnant women published since 2008 (81 studies) revealed that {{about a third of}} the trials were for treatment of acute labor and delivery issues, a third included studies of infectious disease treatment during pregnancy, and the remaining third were for varied antepartum indications. Approximately two-thirds of these recent studies were primarily funded by government agencies worldwide, one quarter were supported by private non-profit foundations or combinations of government and private funding, and slightly less than 10 % were supported by pharmaceutical industry. As highlighted in this review, vast gaps exist in pharmacology information and evidence for appropriate dosing of medications in pregnant women. This lack of knowledge and understanding of drug disposition throughout pregnancy place both the mother and the fetus at risk for avoidable therapeutic misadventures – suboptimal efficacy or excess toxicity – with medication use in pregnancy.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the study design and discuss strategies used to recruit and retain African-American smokers in a <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>study.</b> Methods The parent study was designed to evaluate the differences in the steady-state concentrations of bupropion and its three principal metabolites between African-American menthol and non-menthol cigarette smokers. Study participation consisted of four visits at a General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) over six weeks. After meeting telephone eligibility requirements, phone-eligible participants underwent additional screening during the first two GCRC visits. The last two visits (<b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>study</b> phase) required repeated blood draws using an intravenous catheter over the course of 12 hours. Results Five hundred and fifteen African-American smokers completed telephone screening; 187 were phone-eligible and 92 were scheduled for the first GCRC visit. Of the 81 who attended the first visit, 48 individuals were enrolled in the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>study,</b> and a total of 40 individuals completed the study (83 % retention rate). Conclusions Although recruitment of African-American smokers into a non-treatment, <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>study</b> poses challenges, retention is feasible.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction: Clinical <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> of {{antibiotics}} can establish evidence-based dosing regimens that improve {{the likelihood of}} eradicating the pathogen {{at the site of}} infection, reduce the potential for selection of resistant pathogens, and minimize harm to the patient. Innovations in small volume sampling (< 50 μL) or ‘microsampling’ may result in less-invasive sample collection, self-sampling and dried storage. Microsampling may open up opportunities in patient groups where sampling is challenging. Areas Covered: The challenges for implementation of microsampling to assure suitability of the results, include: acceptable study design, regulatory agency acceptance, and meeting bioanalytical validation requirements. This manuscript covers various microsampling methods, including dried blood/plasma spots, volumetric absorptive microsampling, capillary microsampling, plasma preparation technologies and solid-phase microextraction. Expert Opinion: The available analytical technology is being underutilized {{due to a lack of}} bridging studies and validated bioanalytical methods. These deficiencies represent major impediments to the application of microsampling to antibiotic <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>studies.</b> A conceptual framework for the assessment of the suitability of microsampling in clinical <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> {{of antibiotics}} is provided.
