500|$|Simon Eden of Cross Rhythms {{gave the}} album ten {{out of ten}} squares, saying [...] "With 'Lifesong' being officially [...] second release, the <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> {{to see if they}} can deliver. The simple answer is quite {{probably}} yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of serving up milk and cookies". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three out of five stars, opining [...] "Overall, Lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [...] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but Lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting [...] " [...] comes from the school of U2-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the [...] "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" [...] to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams's {{career began}} to hit its peak after the Nashville {{establishment}} gradually—and somewhat reluctantly—accepted his new sound. His popularity {{had risen to}} levels where {{he could no longer}} be overlooked for major industry awards. He was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. Family Tradition, Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound, Habits Old and New, Rowdy, The <b>Pressure</b> <b>Is</b> <b>On,</b> High Notes, Strong Stuff, Man of Steel, Major Moves, Five-O, Montana Cafe, and many others resulted in a long string of hits. [...] Between 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums, 18 studio & 3 compilation, that were all, at least, certified gold by the RIAA. Between 1979 and 1990, Williams enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.1 singles, during his career. In 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987 and 1988, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the Academy of Country Music. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was Born to Boogie. During the 1980s, Williams became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams's songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as [...] "Family Tradition", [...] "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound", [...] "Old Habits", [...] "Ain't Misbehavin, [...] "Born to Boogie", and [...] "My Name Is Bocephus". The 1987 hit single Wild Streak was cowritten by Houston native Terri Sharp, for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records.|$|E
