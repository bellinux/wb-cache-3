Indeed, the idea that the functional properties of the ion channels are well defined and reasonably homogeneous is necessary for biophysicists to analyze the kinetics from population measurements.

40|$|Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) {{signaling}} pathway is a critical step for neuronal death occurring in several neurological conditions. JNKs can be activated via receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, G-protein coupled receptors and ligand-gated ion channels, including the NMDA glutamate receptors. While JNK has been generally associated with postsynaptic NMDA receptors, its presynaptic role remains largely unexplored. Here, by means of biochemical, morphological and functional approaches, we demonstrate that JNK and its scaffold protein JIP 1 are also expressed at the presynaptic level and that the NMDA-evoked glutamate release is controlled by presynaptic JNK-JIP 1 interaction. Moreover, using knockout mice for single JNK isoforms, we proved that JNK 2 is the essential isoform in mediating this <b>presynaptic</b> <b>event.</b> Overall the present findings unveil a novel JNK 2 localization and function, {{which is likely to}} play a role in different physiological and pathological conditions...|$|E

The synaptic facilitation and the frequence of miniature postsynaptic potential were unaffected by the toxins, indicating that <b>presynaptic</b> <b>events</b> were not modified. Picrotoxin, a selective antagonist of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (A) receptor, did not modify toxin effects.

Recently, a role for alpha-synuclein in reward and addiction, especially in alcoholism, has been reported. Since PD and alcohol dependence present a strong comorbidity with anxiety disorders, a role for alpha-synuclein in anxiety has been proposed. The aim of the present investigation was to study the involvement of alpha-synuclein in anxiety by testing alpha-synuclein knock out and wild type mice in three different emotionality tests: the open field, the elevated plus maze and the light¿dark box.

In both contracting preparations and non-contracting preparations pre-treated with glycerol, 100 or more nerve impulses resulted in a maximal fall in mean {{amplitude of}} about 20 % with recovery apparent over the next 10 - 20 min. In an altered ionic environment with a lowered Ca and raised Mg concentration, 450 nerve impulses did not produce a decrease in mean amplitude but a similar reduction was seen following {{a larger number of}} impulses. The reduction in amplitude was estimated to follow the release of the order of 5000 - 10000 quanta at end-plates in a normal ionic environment and on average 17000 quanta {{in the presence of a}} lowered Ca and raised Mg concentration. Changes in the mean size of the spontaneous quantal response is considered to be a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>event</b> and to reflect the loss and slow recovery of larger packets of transmitter from a vesicular store that is readily released by nerve impulses...|$|E
40|$|Spike-timing-dependent {{plasticity}} (STDP) {{is described}} by long-term potentiation (LTP), when a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>event</b> precedes a postsynaptic event, and by long-term depression (LTD), when the temporal order is reversed. In this article, we present a biophysical model of STDP based on a differential Hebbian learning rule (ISO learning). This rule correlates presynaptically the NMDA channel conductance with the derivative of the membrane potential at the synapse as the postsynaptic signal. The model is able to reproduce the generic STDP weight change characteristic. We �nd that (1) The actual shape of the weight change curve strongly depends on the NMDA channel characteristics and on {{the shape of the}} membrane potential at the synapse. (2) The typical antisymmetrical STDP curve (LTD and LTP) can become similar to a standard Hebbian characteristic (LTP only) without having to change the learning rule. This occurs if the membrane depolarization has a shallow onset and is long lasting. (3) It is known that the membrane potential varies along the dendrite {{as a result of the}} active or passive backpropagation of somatic spikes or because of local dendritic processes. As a consequence, our model predicts that learning properties will be different at different locations on the dendritic tree. In conclusion, such site-speci�c synaptic plasticity would provide a neuron with powerful learning capabilities. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{probability}} density function (PDF) approach to neural network modeling, a common simplifying {{assumption is that}} the arrival times of elementary postsynaptic events are governed by a Poisson process. This assumption ignores temporal correlations in the input that sometimes have important physiological consequences.

We focus on the integrate-and-fire neuron with instantaneous synaptic kinetics and a random elementary excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), A. Between <b>presynaptic</b> <b>events,</b> the membrane voltage, v, decays exponentially toward rest, while s, the time since the last synaptic input event, evolves with unit velocity. When a synaptic event arrives, v jumps by A, and s is reset to zero. If v crosses the threshold voltage, an action potential occurs, and v is reset to vreset. The probability per unit time of a synaptic event at time t, given the elapsed time s since the last event, h(s, t), depends on specifics of the renewal process...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{behavioral}} sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex after tail stimuli in Aplysia {{leads to}} an enhancement of the connections between sensory and motor neurons of this reflex. Both behavioral sensitization and enhancement {{of the connection between}} sensory and motor neurons are importantly mediated by serotonin. Serotonin activates two types of receptors in the sensory neurons, one of which is coupled to the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and the other to the inositol triphosphate/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Here we describe a genetic approach to assessing the isolated contribution of the PKA pathway to short-term facilitation. We have cloned from Aplysia an octopamine receptor gene, Ap oa 1, that couples selectively to the cAMP/PKA pathway. We have ectopically expressed this receptor in Aplysia sensory neurons of the pleural ganglia, where it is not normally expressed. Activation of this receptor by octopamine stimulates all four <b>presynaptic</b> <b>events</b> involved in short-term synaptic facilitation that are normally produced by serotonin: (i) membrane depolarization; (ii) increased membrane excitability; (iii) increased spike duration; and (iv) presynaptic facilitation. These results indicate that the cAMP/PKA pathway alone is sufficient to produce all the features of presynaptic facilitation...|$|R

40|$|We used Magnesium Green AM {{to measure}} Ca 2 + {{transients}} in Schaffer collateral presynaptic terminals simultaneously with postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSPs) {{to investigate the}} mechanism of neurosteroid enhancement of short-term synaptic facilitation. Measurement of [Ca 2 +]i, isolated to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>events,</b> using the fluorescence ratio (ΔF/F 0) demonstrated that at a constant stimulus intensity there was {{no change in the}} excitability of presynaptic fibres between paired stimuli or between ACSF and 1 μm pregnenolone sulphate (PREGS). Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was correlated with residual Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]res), and there was an additional increase in the ∫ΔF/F 0 for the [Ca 2 +]res-subtracted response to the second of paired stimuli, resulting primarily from a slowing of the decay time constant. In addition to the role of presynaptic [Ca 2 +]res in PPF, we observed a decrease in EC 50 and a greater maximum for Hill function fits to fEPSP versus ΔF/F 0 during the second of paired responses. The enhancement of fEPSP PPF by PREGS did not result from an increase of ΔF/F 0. The data presented here support a PREGS-induced increase in presynaptic glutamate release from the second, but not the first, of a pair of stimuli for a given presynaptic [Ca 2 +] because: (a) there is actually a decrease in the ∫ΔF/F 0 of the [Ca 2 +]res-subtracted second response over that seen in ACSF; (b) PREGS causes no change in presynaptic Ca 2 + buffering; and (c) there is a decrease in EC 50 and an increase of ymax in the Hill function fits to ΔF/F 0 versus fEPSP data.

40|$|Originally {{ascribed}} passive {{roles in}} the CNS, astrocytes are now known to have {{an active role in}} the regulation of synaptic transmission. Neuronal activity can evoke Ca 2 + transients in astrocytes, and Ca 2 + transients in astrocytes can evoke changes in neuronal activity. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has been shown to mediate such bidirectional communication between astrocytes and neurons. We demonstrate here that ATP, a primary mediator of intercellular Ca 2 + signaling among astrocytes, also mediates intercellular signaling between astrocytes and neurons in hippocampal cultures. Mechanical stimulation of astrocytes evoked Ca 2 + waves mediated by the release of ATP and the activation of P 2 receptors. Mechanically evoked Ca 2 + waves led to decreased excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in an ATP-dependent manner. Exogenous application of ATP does not affect postsynaptic glutamatergic responses but decreased <b>presynaptic</b> exocytotic <b>events.</b> Finally, we show that astrocytes exhibit spontaneous Ca 2 + waves mediated by extracellular ATP and that inhibition of these Ca 2 + responses enhanced excitatory glutamatergic transmission.

Using the Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory circuit as an in vivo model, we show that SAM- 10, an ortholog of mammalian single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSDP), functions cell-autonomously in the nucleus to regulate synaptic differentiation, as well as positioning of, a single neurite branch. PLM mechanosensory neurons in sam- 10 mutants exhibit abnormal placement of the neurite branch point, and defective synaptogenesis, characterized by an overextended synaptic varicosity, underdeveloped synaptic morphology and disrupted colocalization of active zone and synaptic vesicles. SAM- 10 functions coordinately with Lim domain-binding protein 1 (LDB- 1), demonstrated by our observations that: (1) mutations in either gene show similar defects in PLM neurons; and (2) LDB- 1 is required for SAM- 10 nuclear localization. SAM- 10 regulates PLM synaptic differentiation by suppressing transcription of prk- 2, which encodes an ortholog of the mammalian Pim kinase family. PRK- 2 -mediated activities of SAM- 10 are specifically involved in PLM synaptic differentiation, but not other sam- 10 phenotypes such as neurite branching. Thus, these data reveal a novel transcriptional signaling pathway that regulates neuronal specification of neurite branching and presynaptic differentiation...|$|R

However, why two different firing modes exist is largely unknown. In this study, we report that in layer V pyramidal cells of the rat somatosensory cortex, in vitro associations of EPSPs with spike bursts delayed by � 10 msec led to long-term synaptic depression (LTD), whereas pairings with individual action potentials at the same delay induced long-term potentiation. EPSPs were evoked extracellularly in layer II–III and recorded intracellularly in layer V neurons with the whole-cell or nystatin-based perforated patch-clamp technique. Bursts were evoked with brief somatic current injections, resulting in three to four action potentials with interspike frequencies of � 200 Hz, characteristic of intrinsic burst firing.

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system (CNS) fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) of the AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor families (Collingridge and Lester 1989; Mayer and Westbrook 1987; Watkins et al. 1990). The AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas the slow component is contributed by NMDA receptors (e. g., Stern et al. 1992). The latter {{can be viewed as}} coincidence detectors of pre- and postsynaptic activity, since the gating of the integral ion channel requires two closely simultaneous <b>events,</b> <b>presynaptic</b> release of glutamate and depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Depolarization is induced primarily by the activation of synaptically colocalized AMPA receptors. Coincidence detection by the NMDA receptor rests on its voltage-dependent channel block by extracellular Mg 2 +. NMDA receptors are designed for high Ca 2 + permeability, and Ca 2 + influx through the NMDA receptor channel is thought to be essential for activity-dependent synaptic modulation (reviewed in Bliss and Collingridge 1993). Furthermore, excessively high Ca 2 + influx through NMDA receptors has pathophysiological consequences, including epileptiform activities and neurodegeneration (Choi 1988). By contrast, Mg 2 +.

40|$|Retrograde {{synaptic}} signalling is {{a mechanism}} through which a retrograde messenger is produced and released from postsynaptic neurons, commutes to the presynaptic terminal where it engages its cognate receptor(s) to modulate {{the probability of}} neurotransmitter release. Retrograde signalling is recognized as a fundamental form of feedback regulation at many cortical synapses with {{a broad array of}} diffusible messenger molecules implicated in initiating the cascade of <b>presynaptic</b> molecular <b>events.</b> An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the molecules acting as retrograde messengers in adult brain all have discrete functions during brain development, and, most notably, there is an overarching continuum of regulatory functions these messengers execute from early <b>events</b> of <b>presynaptic</b> neurotransmitter to the maintenance of synaptic pasticity in adulthood. Here, developmental roles of signal molecules (and, in a broader context, the underlying signalling cassettes) that otherwise act as retrograde messengers at mature synapses have been studied with emphasis on how the synapse specificity of retrograde signalling is achieved and translated into specific molecular pathways subserving synaptic information processing. Thematically, this thesis first summarizes current concepts on the organization of synapsespecific retrograde signalling networks operated by endocannabinoids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glutamate as retrograde messengers in the primate and rodent telencephalon emphasizing how cholinergic projection neurons in basal forebrain territories modulate the plasticity of their afferents. We demonstrate a high degree of evolutionary conservation in neuronal diversity and neurochemical specificity in basal forebrain nuclei between rodents and prosimian primates. We find that the areal expansion and cytoarchitectonic differentiation of neocortical subfields in primates is associated with differential cortical patterning of CB 1 cannabinoid receptor-containing subcortical and intracortical afferents and these connectivity patterns are maintained during senescence. Next we asked whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons have a preferred means to tune the activity of afferent synapses or instead they possess a capacity to recruit molecularly distinct signalling networks at non-overlapping subsynaptic dendrite domains receiving functionally segregated synaptic inputs. Our studies revealed a striking dichotomy of CB 1 cannabinoid receptor or vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT 3) -containing afferents – defining components of endocannabinoid and glutamate-mdiated retrograde signalling, respectively – in the rodent basal forebrain. In contrast, we find that CB 1 cannabinoid receptors and VGLUT 3 co-exist at nerve terminals of cholecystokinin-containing interneurons impinging layer 2 / 3 pyramidal cells synapses in the cerebral cortex. Based on the above anatomical indices we hypothesized that (i) different forms of retrograde synaptic communication may co-exist in non-overlapping, functionally discrete domains along the elaborate dendritic arbor of a neuron and (ii) the molecular identity of a presynaptic neuron drives the developmental assembly of retrograde signalling mechanisms operated at its synapses. We uncovered that synapses of parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking (FS) basket cells in layer 2 / 3 of the neocortex undergo endocannabinoid independent retrograde modifications in response to high-frequency burst firing of postsynaptic pyramidal cells in the absence of presynaptic CB 1 cannabinoid receptors. We identified VGLUT 3 -dependent glutamate release from subsynaptic pyramidal cell dendrites as a substitute negative feedback loop. Interneurons of the cerebral cortex are neurochemically and functionally heterogeneous. This limits our ability to study the development of synaptic communication en masse at select subsets of inhibitory terminals. We have challenged this status quo by introducing a novel technology, target specific isolation (TSI), to enrich neurochemically-defined cortical and hippocampal interneuron progenies for large scale, high-throughput developmental, cell biology, and gene expression profiling studies. We have successfully utilized TSI to characterize the temporal dynamics of FS cell synaptogenesis in vitro, and to describe that calpain, a Ca 2 +-dependent protease, cleaves synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP- 25) in vivo and reduces SNAP- 25 levels during GABAergic interneuron development. We have also explored whether endocannabinoids drive particular aspects of interneuron development and found that these bioactive eicosanoids act as short-range diffusible chemoacttractants to facilitate radial (interlaminar) interneuron migration. Our studies also demonstrate that endocannabinoids are negative regulators of interneuron morphogenesis. Finally, we have uncovered that a branch of neurodevelopmental endocannabinoid actions is mediated by a novel interplay between endocannabinoid and BDNF-mediated signalling networks because endocannabinoids can increase TrkB receptor phosphorylation through a signalling mechanism involving src kinase activation in the absence of BDNF. Overall, a coherent set of experimental evidence is collated in this thesis in support of the concept that molecules acting as retrograde messengers in adult brain play fundamental roles during neurodevelopment...|$|R
40|$|This review gives a very {{personal}} view {{of some of the}} work that has led up to the present state of knowledge about synapses and ion channels. It would take a whole book to do justice to this topic, and we can only apologise in advance for failing to mention by name {{most of the people who}} have played an important part. Many of the new ideas that are proclaimed daily are actually quite old, and it is perhaps appropriate to remind the present generation of neuroscientists of how current views have evolved. A surprising number of them can be found in the prescient work of Bernard Katz and his colleagues at University College London, to whom this article is a tribute. Katz made fundamental contributions to both presynaptic (transmitter release) and postsynaptic (ion channel) aspects of synaptic transmission. We shall concentrate on the latter, and Erwin Neher will discuss <b>presynaptic</b> <b>events</b> in the next review. We may, I think, without too much rashness, assume that there is some substance or substances in the nerve endings or [salivary] gland cells with which both atropine and pilocarpine are capable of forming compounds. On this assumption, then, the atropine or pilocarpine compounds are formed according to some law of which their relative mass and chemical affinity for the substance are factors. The first estimate of the time course of transmitter action was derived from measurements of the rise and decay time course of the extracellularly recorded endplate potential and from double pulse experiments (Eccles et al. 1941). It was correctly inferred that the permeability change following a nerve impulse lasted only a few milliseconds. Almost half a century passed after Hills astonishing paper was published before the next critical development took place. This development was the recognition that the binding of an agonist to a receptor, and the subsequent activation of the receptor, had to be treated as two separate steps if any sense were to be made of the experimental results (Stephenson 1956; Castillo and Katz 1957). Although this sounds like a small extension of what had already been done, it took a long time to come, and it proved extraordinarily fruitful (as discussed below). Indeed, the lessons of this development are still not universally appreciated. In the early 1970 s, the advent of noise analysis (Katz and Miledi 1970; Katz and Miledi 1971; Katz and Miledi 1972) allowed the first (indirect) inferences about the properties of single ion channels. In the 1970 paper, Katz and Miledi showed fluctuations of the response to acetylcholine that were so obvious that one wondered why nobody had noticed them before. Katz and Miledi suggested, correctly, that the fluctuations were caused by the random opening and shutting of individual ion channels, and used the amplitude of the fluctuations to estimate that the elementary depolarisation elicited by ACh was about 0. 3 &# 956;V in amplitude. For the first time, there was a firm estimate of the number of channels opened by a single quantum of ACh. Katz and Miledi 1971; Katz and Miledi 1972 went on to exploit the temporal characteristics of the noise to estimate the duration of elementary events, as well as their amplitude. By plotting the distribution of frequencies in the fluctuations as a power spectrum, they were able to conclude, for example, that the channel that appeared after denervation had a longer mean open time than the adult channel, and that carbachol produced briefer openings than ACh. They were also able to estimate the single channel conductance as being of the order of 100 pS, within a factor of 3 of the value subsequently found by single channel channel measurements. This was far bigger than some previous biochemical estimates had suggested, and it finally settled the long-running discussion about whether the receptor was a pore or a carrier. The development of noise analysis had made it natural to think in terms of single ion channels, which had been observed in artificial bilayers, but in the early 1970 s nobody had seen one in a biological membrane. There was quite a large range of estimates for the size of the current that a single channel might pass and no knowledge of the shape of the elementary current event. It was these problems that guided the quest to measure single channel currents directly. These questions were frequently discussed in Katzs Department at University College London, and they seemed to me (B. S.) to be central questions in synaptic physiology. Although estimates of channel conductance from noise analysis turned out to be reasonably accurate, there were many other estimates (e. g., from biochemical measurements) that were wildly inaccurate. When they met again in Göttingen, Erwin Neher (who was recording single channels from doped bilayers) and B. S. decided to attempt measurements of elementary synaptic currents with patch pipettes. Earlier work with noise analysis had suggested that the elementary events in chronically denervated muscle fibres were somewhat smaller and had a severalfold longer duration than those in the subsynaptic membrane (Katz and Miledi 1971; Neher and Sakmann 1976 a). It was therefore decided that this was a suitable preparation for an attempt to see single channels. Restriction of the measurement to a small patch of membrane 1  2 &# 956;m in diameter, with a seal resistance of about 100 M&# 937;, was sufficient to reduce the background noise to less than 1 pA at the necessary bandwidth. One of our very first attempts in Göttingen in spring 1975 showed square pulse-like events in patch pipette recordings from denervated frog muscle and assured us that we were on the right path. The results were published in the following year (Neher and Sakmann 1976 b). The next few years were spent in controlling possible artefacts, developing new and more convenient preparations, and increasing the seal resistance to several G&# 937;, making patches mechanically stable. These improvements allowed measurements at a higher time resolution, and in conditions where it was possible to control both voltage and the ion concentrations on both faces of the membrane (Hamill et al. 1981). The significance of this work on ion channels extended far beyond the description of the acetylcholine receptor; it also impinged on a much older pharmacological problem. Stephenson 1956 had pointed out the very important fact that the action of an agonist could not be described by an affinity constant alone. In addition, some measure of the ability of the agonist to activate the receptor (i. e., in our case, to open the channel) was essential too (he termed the latter the efficacy of the agonist). This postulate was, very rightly, enormously influential (though widely misunderstood, as may be seen by the inaccurate accounts that are found in most textbooks to this day). Stephenson had formulated his theory in a black box manner, but unfortunately it turned out subsequently that the box was too black, and it was not possible to measure the postulated quantities without knowing something about mechanism (Colquhoun 1987). This stood in strong contrast to Schilds method for estimating the equilibrium constant for an antagonist, which is remarkably independent of the contents of the black box. Just after Stephensons paper, del Castillo and Katz 1957, quite independently, addressed essentially the same problem. They, however, took the opposite approach, and discussed the problem in terms of a simple but specific mechanism, an agonist-binding step followed by a conformation change step. Their motive was very similar to Stephensons, which was to explain the action of partial agonists. In their mechanism, the equilibrium constant for the second step provided a physical embodiment of Stephensons efficacy. The analysis of single channels had allowed efficacy to be defined in a concrete way, and to be measured. Although the ideas of Stephenson and Katz are now quite old, they have assumed a new importance in the age of molecular biology. It is now commonplace for mutations to be made in a receptor protein with the aim of locating the position of the agonist binding site. But these old ideas make it obvious that the interpretation of such experiments may be far from obvious. Clearly the EC 50 for the agonist (often, but unhelpfully, referred to as apparent affinity) is affected by both steps in the reaction, the initial binding step and the conformation change step. Even now it is not uncommon to read that the properties of the binding site can be inferred by doing a ligand-binding experiment, whereas a glance at the simple model of del Castillo and Katz 1957 shows that this is obviously not true (for any ligand that causes a conformation change) : the affinity for agonist as measured in a radioligand-binding experiment also depends on both steps in the mechanism. There is, of course, no reason to think that the mutated amino acid is in the binding site unless it is the first (binding) step that is affected rather than the second, and it is not at all easy to obtain evidence that this is the case. This problem, often referred to in the ion channel context as the bindinggating problem, has been widely ignored, and it will be very interesting to see, when full structures become available, just how many mutation experiments have led to incorrect conclusions as a result. It will be equally interesting to see how much sense can be made of the relationship between protein structure and mechanism when the analysis is done properly. A more sophisticated version of the analysis used by Colquhoun and Sakmann has been used by Sine and Auerbach to interpret mutations of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that cause myasthenic syndromes (e. g.,Sine et al. 1995). Their analysis provides a good illustration of the fact that the importance of considering mechanism extends far beyond an esoteric interest in kineticsindeed, it is critically important for the sort|$|R
