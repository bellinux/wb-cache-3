Open signals L1OC and L2OC use time-division multiplexing to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase {{to the open}} signals; this places <b>peak</b> <b>signal</b> strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) signal {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong <b>peak</b> <b>signal</b> at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} previously, {{to alleviate}} the peak regeneration phenomenon, the CAF scheme should set up a clipping threshold that {{is lower than the}} target PAPR level. Thus, the CAF scheme generates excessive degradation of the EVM performance. However, the CAF scheme eliminates <b>peak</b> <b>signals</b> with a fixed signal loss regardless of whether successive <b>peak</b> <b>signals</b> occur. In addition, the PW scheme eliminates <b>peak</b> <b>signals</b> smoothly by multiplying them by a specific window function. However, when the consecutive <b>peak</b> <b>signals</b> occur within half of the window length in the PW scheme, the window function can overlap. This leads to unintended distortions of the original signals and generates unintended distortion signals, even if the signal is under the clipping threshold. However, the PW scheme is usually preferred to the PAPR reduction scheme because it results in reduced performance degradation compared to the CAF scheme. In summary, using the same clipping threshold as the PW scheme, the CAF scheme cannot eliminate high-PAPR signals entirely because of the peak regeneration phenomenon. Furthermore, the PW scheme can deteriorate signal distortion in the case of successive <b>peak</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
