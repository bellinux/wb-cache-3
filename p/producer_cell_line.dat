40|$|Adenovirus (Ad) vectors, in {{particular}} {{those of the}} serotype 5, are highly attractive {{for a wide range}} of gene therapy, vaccine and virotherapy applications (as discussed in further detail in this issue). Wild type Ad 5 virus can replicate in numerous tissue types but to use Ad vectors for therapeutic purposes the viral genome requires modification. In particular, if the viral genome is modified in such a way that the viral life cycle is interfered with, a specific <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> is required to provide trans-complementation to overcome the modification and allow viral production. This can occur in two ways; use of a <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> that contains specific adenoviral sequences incorporated into the cell genome to trans-complement, or use of a <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> that naturally complements for the modified Ad vector genome. This review concentrates on producer cell lines that complement non-replicating adenoviral vectors, starting with the historical HEK 293 cell line developed in 1977 for first generation Ad vectors. In addition the problem of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) contamination in viral preparations from HEK 293 cells is addressed leading to the development of alternate cell lines. Furthermore novel cell lines for more complex Ad vectors and alternate serotype Ad vectors are discussed...|$|E

An insulator element {{has been added to}} the long terminal repeats of the integrated vector to limit proto-oncogene activation. The vector provides high-level, stable expression of WAS protein in transduced murine and human hematopoietic cells. We have also developed a monoclonal antibody specific for intracellular WAS protein. This antibody has been used to monitor expression in blood and bone marrow cells after transfer into lineage negative bone marrow cells from WAS mice and in a WAS negative human B-cell line. Persistent expression of the transgene has been observed in transduced murine cells 12 â 20 weeks following transplantation.

Research into KSHV miRNA function {{has suffered from}} a lack of genetic systems to study viral miRNA mutations {{in the context of the}} viral genome. We used the Escherichia coli Red recombination system together with a new bacmid background, BAC 16, to create mutants for all known KSHV miRNAs. The specific miRNA deletions or mutations and the integrity of the bacmids have been strictly quality controlled using PCR, restriction digestion, and sequencing. In addition, stable viral <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> based on iSLK cells have been created for wildtype KSHV, for 12 individual miRNA knock-out mutants (ΔmiR-K 12 - 1 through - 12), and for mutants deleted for 10 of 12 (ΔmiR-cluster) or all 12 miRNAs (ΔmiR-all). NGS, in combination with SureSelect technology, was employed to sequence the entire latent genome within all <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> qPCR assays were used to verify the expression of the remaining viral miRNAs in a subset of mutants. Induction of the lytic cycle leads to efficient production of progeny viruses that have been used to infect endothelial cells.

40|$|The {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) vector system {{is based on}} nonpathogenic and helper-virus-dependent parvoviruses. The vector system offers safe, efficient, and {{long-term}} in vivo gene transfer in numerous tissues. Clinical trials using AAV vectors have demonstrated vector safety as well as efficiency. The increasing interest {{in the use of}} AAV for clinical studies demands large quantities of vectors and hence a need for improvement in vector production. The commonly used transient-transfection method, although versatile and free of adenovirus (Ad), is not cost-effective for large-scale production. While the wild-type-Ad-dependent AAV <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> seem to be cost-effective, this method faces the problem of wild-type Ad contamination. To overcome these shortcomings, we have explored the feasibility of creating inducible AAV packaging <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> that require neither transfection nor helper virus infection. As a first step toward that goal, we have created a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> containing highly inducible Ad E 1 A and E 1 B genes, which are essential for AAV production. Subsequently, the AAV Rep and Cap genes and an AAV vector containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene were stably introduced into the E 1 A-E 1 B <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> generating inducible AAV-GFP packaging <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Upon induction of E 1 A and E 1 B genes and infection with replication-defective Ad with E 1 A, E 1 B, and E 3 deleted, the packaging cells yielded high-titer AAV-GFP vectors. Finally, the E 2, E 4, and VA genes of Ad, under the control of their endogenous promoters, were also introduced into these <b>cells.</b> A few <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were obtained, which could produce AAV-GFP vectors upon simple drug induction. Although future improvement is necessary to increase the stability and vector yield of the cells, our study has nonetheless demonstrated the feasibility of generating helper-virus-free inducible AAV <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

Reproducibly high numbers of transduced cells can be obtained {{with a wide range of}} virus titers, thus relaxing the requirement of set (high) titers within a transduction protocol.

40|$|Retroviral gene {{transfer}} {{is widely used}} in experimental and human gene therapy applications. We have devised a novel method of generating high-titer retroviral producer cell lines based on the P 1 bacteriophage recombinase system Cre-loxP. Incorporation of loxP sites flanking a Neo(r) -SVTK cassette in the proviral DNA allows excision of these selectable markers through expression of Cre recombinase after production of a high-titer <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> The resultant producer line contains a single loxP site flanked by the viral long terminal repeats. Retransfection of this line with the Cre expression vector and a plasmid containing a gene of interest flanked by loxP sites allows insertional recombination of the gene into the favorable preexisting site in the genome and the generation of a new line with a titer equivalent {{to that of the}} parental <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> The efficiency of the process is sufficient to allow the generation of multiple new producer lines without the addition of antibiotic resistance genes. We have successfully generated retroviral vectors carrying different genes by using this approach and discuss the potential applications of this method in gene therapy...|$|E

This review presents {{the state of the art}} of the production of these vectors with particular emphasis on their large-scale production for clinical purposes. In contrast to oncoretroviral vectors, which are produced using stable <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> clinical-grade LV are in most of the cases produced by transient transfection of 293 or 293 T cells grown in cell factories.

40|$|Although vectors {{based on}} adeno-associated virus (AAV) offer several unique advantages, their usage has been {{hampered}} by the difficulties encountered in vector production. In this report, we describe a new AAV packaging system based on inducible amplification of integrated helper and vector constructs containing the simian virus 40 (SV 40) replication origin. The packaging and <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> developed express SV 40 T antigen {{under the control of}} the reverse tetracycline transactivator system, which allows inducible amplification of chromosomal loci linked to the SV 40 origin. Culturing these cells in the presence of doxycycline followed by adenovirus infection resulted in helper and vector gene amplification as well as higher vector titers. Clonal <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> generated vector titers that were 10 times higher than those obtained by standard methods, with approximately 104 vector particles produced per cell. These stocks were free of detectable replication-competent virus. The lack of a transfection step combined with the reproducibility of stable producer lines makes this packaging method ideally suited for the large-scale production of vector stocks for human gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) vector in large animal studies and {{clinical}} trials often requires high-titer and high-potency vectors. A number of currently used vector production methods, based on either transient transfection or helper virus infection of cell lines, have their advantages and limitations. We previously developed a 293 -cell–based <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> method for high-titer and high-potency AAV 2 vectors. Similar to several other methods, however, it requires multiple cloning steps for the vector and packaging plasmids and a two-step transfection and selection for stable cell lines. Here we report a simplified method with several key improvements and advantages: (1) a one-step cloning of AAV vector cassette into the serotype-specific packaging plasmid; (2) a single plasmid transfection and selection for stable AAV vector producer cell lines; (3) high vector yields of different serotypes, e. g., AAV 2, 8, and 9, upon infection with an E 1 A/E 1 B-deleted helper adenovirus; (4) efficient packaging of both single-stranded and double-stranded (self-complementary) AAV vectors; and (5) efficient packaging of large AAV cassettes {{such as a}} mini-dystrophin vector (5. 0 [*]kb). All cell lines were stable with growth rates identical to the parental 293 cells. The vector yields were consistent among serotypes, with 5 [*]×[*] 1013 to 8 [*]×[*] 1013 vector genome particles per Nunc cell factory (equivalent to 40 15 -cm plates). The vectors showed high potency for in vitro and in vivo transduction. In conclusion, the simple and versatile AAV <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> method can be useful for large scale AAV vector production in preclinical and clinical studies...|$|E

40|$|Lentiviral vectors (LV) {{represent}} a key tool for gene and cell therapy applications. The production of these vectors in sufficient quantities for clinical applications remains a hurdle, prompting the field towards developing suspension {{processes that are}} conducive to large scale production. We describe here a LV production strategy using a stable inducible <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> The HEK 293 cell line employed grows in suspension, thus offering direct scalability, and produces a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) -expressing lentiviral vector in the 10 6 Transduction Units (TU) /ml range without optimization. The stable <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> called clone 92, was derived by stable transfection from a packaging cell line with a plasmid encoding the transgene GFP. The packaging cell line expresses all the other necessary components to produce LV upon induction with cumate and doxycycline. First, we demonstrate that LV production using clone 92 is scalable from 20 mL shake flasks to 3 L bioreactors. Next, we developed two strategies for high yield LV production in perfusion mode using acoustic cell filter technology in 1 to 3 L bioreactors. The first approach uses a basal commercial medium and perfusion mode both pre- and post-induction for increasing cell density and LV recovery. The second approach makes use of a fortified medium formulation to achieve target cell density for induction in batch mode, followed by perfusion mode after induction. Using these perfusion-based strategies, the titer was improved to 3. 2 x 10 7 TU/ml. As a result, cumulative functional LV titers were increased by up to 15 -fold compared to batch mode, reaching a cumulative total yield of 8 x 10 10 TU/L of bioreactor culture. This approach is easily amenable to large-scale production and commercial manufacturing. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a clonal haemopoietic {{stem cell}} (HSC) {{disorder}} characterised {{by the presence}} of a disease-specific gene, BCR-ABL, which leads to the production of a bcr-abl mRNA transcript. CML is an ideal candidate for gene therapy using ribozymes (Rz), catalytic RNA molecules that cleave and inactivate target RNA in a sequence specific manner. Limited data is available on the activity of ribozymes in human CML cells. In this study, hammerhead ribozyme sequences directed against the b 3 a 2 bcr-abl mRNA sequence (Rz 6 -Rz 10) were cloned into several retroviral vectors. Initial experiments using MSCVHSA based retroviral constructs failed to express the sequences in cell lines. Rz cDNA fragments were then cloned into an LNL 6 based retroviral vector (LGL 1) encoding a GFP reporter gene and stable LGLRz constructs produced. Using cell sorting, high-titre PA 317 <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> clones were isolated. Transcriptional silencing of the LGLRz 6 <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> occurred with prolonged culture, with partial reversal on treatment with the demethylating agent 5 ' azacytidine. To assess the activity of these constructs in human cells, CD 34 + HSC were isolated from newly diagnosed b 3 a 2 Ph+ CML patients. Cells were transduced with either control LGL vector or the LGLRz 6 construct. Transduced human cells were sorted based on GFP expression and placed into long-term HSC culture (LTC-IC assays). Using a common cDNA, RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of both the transgene and bcr-abl in individual colonies derived from the LTCIC assay at various time points, allowing assessment of the effect of transgene expression on bcr-abl expression. LGLRz transgene expression was detectable for up to 6 weeks in culture. Colony RT-PCR results from 3 patients showed that expression of the LGLRz 6 construct was associated with decreased bcr-abl expression. It also appeared that the reduced bcr-abl expression decreased the proliferation of Ph+ cells leading to their loss from culture. In summary, these results appear to show an effect of a retroviral vector containing a bcr-abl Rz sequence on human CML HSC. Targeting of bcr-abl remains a valid therapeutic goal in the Imatinib era, particularly if problems related to effective ribozyme delivery and targeting can be overcome...|$|E

Most of the polypeptides synthesised in vitro by translation of HTLVMT- 2 virion RNAs possess the same sizes as the proteins formerly designated as ATLA (ATL-associated antigen) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunologically precipitated with sera of ATL patients. Therefore, the antigens termed ATLA, found by the serological study of ATL, are HTLVMT- 2 encoded polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProduction of E 1 -deleted {{adenovirus}} (rAd) vectors requires complementation by E 1 A and E 1 B functions {{provided by}} the production cell line. The two cell lines most commonly used for production of rAd vectors, 293 and Per. C 6, were derived from human primary cells and contain contiguous E 1 A and E 1 B sequences from the Ad genome. As an alternative system, we tested complementation of rAd vectors using sequential transfection of individual E 1 A and E 1 B expression cassettes into A 549 human lung tumor cells, which support highly efficient replication of wild type adenovirus. We found that E 1 A function could be complemented in A 549 cells by the mutant E 1 Adl 01 / 07, and that E 1 B function could be provided in such cells using only the 55 K E 1 B gene. Production yields in the resulting <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> designated SL 0003, {{were similar to those}} obtained from 293 cells without generation of detectable recombinant replication competent adenovirus...|$|E

BPECs were immortalized with hTERT between passages 4 to 7, and transformed between passages 7 to 12. HMECs were transduced with hTERT pre-MO and transformed post-MO between passages 6 to 12. Methylation-specific PCR, RT-PCR and Southern blots The genomic DNA was isolated by using columns (Qiagen). Bisulfite modification of DNA {{was carried out by}} using CpGenome ™ Fast DNA Modification Kit (Chemicon). The CpG WIZ® p 16 Amplification Kit (Chemicon) was used for determining the methylation status of the p 16 promoter by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) (Herman et. al., 1996). In this assay, DNA-specific primers produce PCR products of different sizes following a complete chemical modification reaction; U primers amplify only unmethylated DNA (154 bp), M primers amplif...|$|E
40|$|Human T leukemia <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> spontaneously release {{into their}} medium a {{suppressor}} lymphokine, T leukemia-derived suppressor lymphokine (TLSL), able to inhibit proliferation, DNA synthesis, and colony formation {{in a variety}} of malignant hemopoietic <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as in normal myelomonocytic progenitor cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood. Titration curves indicated that the inhibitory activity in the crude supernatant preparations ranged from 10 (- 3) - 10 (- 9) : the supernatants from CCRF/CEM, HUT- 78, and MOLT- 4 <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were the most active, those from HPB-ALL, JM, and CCRF/HSB 2 displayed an intermediate activity, and the Jurkat supernatant was the least active. Target <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> of B <b>cell</b> origin (Burkitt lymphomas) were more sensitive than granulocytic, monocytic, erythroid, and T <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Partial purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography demonstrated that TLSL is a protein with an Mr of 88, 000, as determined by gel filtration. A high Mr form (greater than 300, 000) was produced in serum-free medium by one of the most active <b>producer</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> (CCRF/CEM), and appeared to be an aggregate of the 88, 000 Mr form. Neither the partially purified fractions obtained nor the crude supernatant preparations displayed antiviral activity or contained interleukin 2. Unlike lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor, TLSL is cytostatic: maximal inhibition of proliferation was observed 4 - 5 d after addition of crude supernatant to the target cells, and was not accompanied by a significant loss in cell viability. The antiproliferative capacity of TLSL was manifested both in suspension and methylcellulose cultures. Treated target cells accumulated either in the G 1 or in the S phase of the cell cycle. The effect of TLSL on the target cells is irreversible: even brief (1 h) incubation of sensitive cells with TLSL resulted in inhibition of proliferation measured 5 d later. Although TLSL is produced by leukemic T <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> this lymphokine inhibits proliferation of normal peripheral blood T cells in response to mitogens or alloantigens: T lymphocyte activation was inhibited by all of the T cell supernatants tested. In contrast, when T <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were used as targets, no inhibition of proliferation was detected with two exceptions: the low <b>producer</b> Jurkat <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was sensitive to all the T cell-derived supernatants, and the intermediate <b>producer</b> CCRF/HSB 2 <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was sensitive only to the three most active supernatants, CCRF/CEM, MOLT- 4, and HUT- 78. The possible significance of TLSL and its relationship with other suppressor lymphokines previously described in other systems is discussed...|$|R

The panel included 11 <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> of H- 2 Kb haplotype derived from fibrosarcomas, carcinomas and melanoma, and from transformed fibroblasts.
