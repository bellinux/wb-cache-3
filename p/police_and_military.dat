5|$|For months, {{workers in}} Łódź {{had been in}} a state of unrest, with several major strikes having taken place, which were {{forcibly}} suppressed by the Russian <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military.</b> The insurrection began spontaneously, without backing from any organized group. Polish revolutionary groups were taken by surprise and did not {{play a major role in}} the subsequent events. Around 21–22 June, following clashes with the authorities in the previous days, angry workers began building barricades and assaulting <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> patrols. Additional troops were called by the authorities, who also declared martial law. On 23 June, no businesses operated in the city, as the <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> stormed dozens of workers' barricades. Eventually, by 25 June, the uprising was crushed, with estimates of several hundred dead and wounded. The uprising was reported in the international press and widely discussed by socialist and communist activists worldwide. Unrest in Łódź would continue for many months, although without protests on such a large-scale as before.|$|E

5|$|Tensions mounted further, and in {{the evening}} of 21 or 22 June (sources vary), angry workers began {{building}} barricades and assaulting <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> patrols, killing {{those who did not}} surrender.

5|$|During {{the martial}} law era, Manila became a hot-bed of {{resistance}} activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly {{clashed with the}} <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> which were subservient to the Marcos regime. After decades of resistance, the non-violent People Power Revolution (predecessor to the peaceful-revolutions that toppled the iron-curtain in Europe), ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power.|$|E
5|$|Human rights organisations accuse <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> {{forces of}} mistreating and even torturing {{criminal}} suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers {{in the north}} are charged with holding political opponents {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E

He preserved various elements of the old colonial order in his administration, particularly on issues of law and order.

White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Hitler {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union. The expanding war and the need to control occupied territories provided the conditions for Himmler to further consolidate the <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> organs of the SS. Rapid acquisition of vast territories in the East placed considerable strain on the SS police organizations as they struggled to adjust to the changing security challenges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military.</b> Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Giolitti {{acknowledged}} {{the need to}} stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E

5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Ranariddh {{was elected}} as FUNCINPEC's {{president}} in February 1992. Subsequently, in August 1992, FUNCINPEC formally registered {{itself as a}} political party under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) administration, and started opening party offices across Cambodia the following month. However, party offices and officials faced harassment and attacks from State of Cambodia (SOC) secret <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> intelligence officials. Between November 1992 and January 1993, 18 FUNCINPEC officials were killed and another 22 officials wounded, prompting Ranariddh to call on UNTAC to intervene and end the violence. UNTAC responded by setting up a special prosecutor's office to investigate cases of political violence, but faced resistance from the SOC police in arresting and prosecuting offenders. Most of the violent attacks occurred in the Kampong Cham and Battambang provinces, whereby the governor in the latter province, Ung Sami {{was found to have}} been directly involved in the attacks. When UNTAC allowed election campaigns to start in April 1993, FUNCINPEC held few election rallies due to intimidations from SOC police. They campaigned through low-key methods, such as using pick-up trucks to travel around the country and broadcast political messages as well as sending party workers to visit villages in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E
