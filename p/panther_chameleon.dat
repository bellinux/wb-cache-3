50|$|Male <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> {{can grow}} up to 20 in in length, with a typical length of around 17 in. Females are smaller, at about half the size. In a form of sexual dimorphism, males are more vibrantly colored than the females. Coloration varies with location, and the {{different}} color patterns of <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} 'locales', which are named after the geographical location in which they are found. <b>Panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> from the areas of Nosy Be, Ankify, and Ambanja are typically a vibrant blue, while those from Ambilobe, Antsiranana, and Sambava are red, green or orange. The areas of Maroantsetra and Tamatave yield primarily red specimens. Numerous other color phases, and patterns occur between and within regions. Females generally remain tan and brown with hints of pink, peach, or bright orange, no matter where they are found, but there are slight differences in patterns and colors among the different color phases.|$|R
50|$|For a {{long time}} {{it was thought that}} {{chameleons}} change color by dispersion of pigment-containing organelles within their skin. However, research conducted in 2014 on <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> has shown that pigment movement only represents part of the story.|$|R

50|$|A {{study found}} other {{cockroaches}} (Turkestan ("red runner") cockroaches, Madagascar hissing cockroaches,) provided a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, {{more so than}} mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> (Furcifer pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R
50|$|The oviparous species {{lay eggs}} {{three to six}} weeks after copulation. The female will dig a hole — from 10 - 30 cm, deep {{depending}} on the species — and deposit her eggs. Clutch sizes vary greatly with species. Small Brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs, while large veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) {{have been known to}} lay clutches of 20-200 (veiled <b>chameleons)</b> and 10-40 (<b>panther</b> <b>chameleons)</b> eggs. Clutch sizes can also vary greatly among the same species. Eggs generally hatch after four to 12 months, again depending on species. The eggs of Parson's chameleon (Calumma parsonii), a species which is rare in captivity, are believed to take more than 24 months to hatch.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{study of}} commercially ordered specimens, small second instar nymphs (...) {{consisted}} of 21% dry matter, made of 76% crude protein and 14% crude fat, while medium third instar nymphs (1.3-1.9 cm) consisted of 28% dry matter, made of 53% crude protein and 27% crude fat. Mineral content is well represented except for a low calcium:phosphorus ratio typical in cockroaches, and calcium supplementation may be advisable. Vitamin A and E content was relatively low, and is generally significantly higher in free-ranging cockroaches. Insectivores which fed on unsupplemented invertebrates {{have been found to}} suffer from vitamin A deficiencies, and {{a study of}} <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> (Furcifer pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R

Nosy Be is also home to a specific color of <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon</b> (Furcifer pardalis).|$|E
50|$|Like {{most species}} of chameleons, the <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon</b> is very territorial. It spends the {{majority}} of its life in isolation, apart from mating sessions. When two males come into contact, they will change color and inflate their bodies, attempting to assert their dominance. Often these battles end at this stage, with the loser retreating, turning drab and dark colors. Occasionally, the displays result in physical combat if neither contender backs down.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>chameleons,</b> and <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> in particular, {{have the}} {{remarkable}} ability to exhibit complex and rapid colour changes during social interactions such as male contests or courtship. It is generally interpreted that {{these changes are}} due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores. Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores. In addition, we show that a deeper population of iridophores with larger crystals reflects a substantial proportion of sunlight especially in the near-infrared range. The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> {{have very}} long tongues (sometimes longer {{than their own}} body length) which {{they are capable of}} rapidly {{extending}} out of the mouth. The tongue extends at around 26 body lengths per second. The tongue hits the prey in about 0.0030 sec. The tongue of the chameleon is a complex arrangement of bone, muscle and sinew. At the base of the tongue, a bone is shot forward, giving the tongue the initial momentum it needs to reach the prey quickly. At the tip of this elastic tongue, a muscular, club-like structure covered in thick mucus forms a suction cup. [...] Once the tip sticks to a prey item, it is drawn quickly back into the mouth, where the panther chameleon's strong jaws crush it and it is consumed.|$|R
40|$|Blood {{samples of}} 86 captive <b>panther</b> <b>chameleons</b> (Furcifer pardalis) were {{collected}} in January and August from the ventral coccygeal vein {{in order to establish}} reference intervals of clinical healthy individuals under similar husbandry conditions for plasma biochemistry and hematology for this species. Significant differences were found in phosphorus, glucose, total protein, albumin and white blood cell count between males and females in both seasons. Calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase varied in only one season between genders. Significant differences between summer and winter values were present in both genders for uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total protein, creatine kinase and albumin. Additionally, females showed seasonal variations for alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, whereas packed cell volume varied in males. Gravid females had significantly higher body-weights and increased values for uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, alanine aminotransferase, total protein and albumin. Cytomorphologic characteristics of blood cells in stained blood films were evaluated to serve as additional parameters for hematology...|$|R

5000|$|Panther {{chameleons}} are zygodactylous: on each foot, {{the five}} toes are fused {{into a group}} of two {{and a group of}} three, giving the foot a tongs-like appearance. These specialized feet allow the <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon</b> a tight grip on narrow branches. Each toe is equipped with a sharp claw to gain traction on surfaces such as bark when climbing. The claws make it easy to see how many toes are fused into each part of the foot [...] - [...] two toes on the outside of each front foot and three on the inside.|$|E
50|$|Réunion {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of birds such as the white-tailed tropicbird (paille en queue). Its largest land animal is the <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon,</b> Furcifer pardalis. Much of the West coast is ringed by coral reef which harbours, among other animals, sea urchins, conger eels and parrot fish. Sea turtles and {{dolphins}} also inhabit the coastal waters. Humpback whales migrate north to the island from the Antarctic waters annually during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June-September) to breed and feed, and can be routinely observed from the shores of Réunion during this season. At least 19 species formerly endemic to Réunion have become extinct following human colonisation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829. [...] Its generic name (Furcifer) {{is derived from}} the Latin root furci meaning [...] "forked" [...] and refers to the shape of the animal's feet. [...] The specific name pardalis refers to the animals' markings, as it is Latin for [...] "leopard" [...] or [...] "spotted like a panther". [...] The English word chameleon (also chamaeleon) derives from Latin chamaeleō, a borrowing of the Ancient Greek χαμαιλέων (khamailéōn), a compound of χαμαί (khamaí) [...] "on the ground" [...] and λέων (léōn) [...] "lion". The Greek word is a calque translating the Akkadian nēš qaqqari, [...] "ground lion". [...] This lends to the common English name of [...] "panther chameleon".|$|E
50|$|When kept as pets, {{they require}} a large {{enclosure}} and are fed crickets primarily but also wax worms, meal worms, and roaches - chameleons {{should have a}} varied diet. It {{should be noted that}} panther chameleons require fresh flowing air, so the use of an open air screen cage is necessary. A glass aquarium should not be used as it restricts airflow and can cause respiratory infections in the animal. Enclosure size is very important, a 2'×2'×4' mesh cage is perfect for a single adult although females could be kept in a 1.5'×1.5'×3' enclosure. A proper day and night light schedule is required along with a UVB bulb being present in the cage. The reptile requires UVB to replicate sunlight, and help its body process. A 5.0 UVB bulb should be on for 12 hours a day as well as a heat bulb to replicate the suns heat. Humidity is very important with chameleons, 50-60% humidity should be perfect for a <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon,</b> although it will not be fatal if this is not consistent. Panther Chameleons do however require the constant availability of water. When studying a <b>Panther</b> <b>Chameleon</b> you will notice that they do not drink from a dish as might be considered. A misting bottle should be used three times daily to properly hydrate the chameleon, this will also help maintain humidity, a water dripping system could be used so that water droplets form on the interior of the cage setup. The chameleon will sponge the water droplets from the surfaces of the cage using their tongue. It is very important that chameleons are not housed together as adults; there should be only one chameleon per cage. These rules could be slightly bent during breeding season by slowly introducing an opposite sex chameleon for short periods of time. Females should have many places available to lay eggs at all times, because they will lay eggs even if they have not been fertilized.|$|E

40|$|The morphometry, age structure, and {{abundance}} of the <b>panther</b> <b>chameleon</b> Furcifer pardalis (Cuvier 1829) were studied at Nosy Be (NW Madagascar). Males were larger and heavier than Females (SVL, 138. 38 +/- 35. 94 vs 91. 92 +/- 18. 48 mm; mass, 61. 06 +/- 39. 86 vs 22. 62 +/- 13. 17 g).

Compared to other species of Malagasy chameleons, F pardalis is infrequent in pristine and close forests, while, like other Furcifer species, it. is more closely associated with riverine habitats. The higher concentration Of individuals in forest-like bands along roads is explained {{by the presence of}} a suitable vegetation band along roads and the similarity of this habitat to the riverine and ecotonal forests preferred by chameleons of the genus Furcifer.
