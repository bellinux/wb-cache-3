40|$|Due to {{its highly}} {{suppressed}} cross section (fermionic) dark matter {{interacting with the}} Standard Model via pseudoscalar mediators {{is expected to be}} essentially unobservable in direct detection experiments. We consider both a simplified model and a more realistic model based on an extended two Higgs doublet model and compute the leading one-loop contribution to the effective dark matter- nucleon interaction. This higher order correction dominates the scattering rate completely and can naturally, i. e. for couplings of order one, lead to a direct detection cross section {{in the vicinity of the}} neutrino floor. Taking the observed relic density and constraints from low-energy observables into account we analyze the direct detection <b>prospects</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail</b> and find regions of parameter space that are within reach of upcoming direct detection experiments such as XENONnT, LZ, and DARWIN.

40|$|Philippine GDP growth surged toits {{highest level}} in 31 years, re-cording 7. 3 percent in 2007 (Table 1). The much {{anticipated}} break-through was achieved as economic growth crossed the 7 percent threshold. Election spending, government infra-structure projects, and personal con-sumption expenditure—underpinned by remittances from overseas Filipinos— were the primary sources of economic ac-tivity. However, {{it remains to be}} seen whether this performance can be sustained in 2008, not to mention the medium term. Several factors will lead to a likely economic downturn in 2008. One, the global economy will be buffeted by a drop in output growth of industrialized countries, the highlight of which is the pending US recession. Persistent high fuel prices, the fallout from the US subprime crisis, and jittery finan-cial markets are the major contributors to the current global economic slow-down. Two, the stimulus from the 2007 elections and government infra-structure program will decline. And three, the low investment rate during the past decade will take its toll on production capacity. The format of this year’s Outlook will be slightly different. Instead of dis-cussing economic performance and <b>prospects</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail,</b> some key economic issues will be highlighted. The potential impact of these issues on the 2008 forecast will be referred to when relevant. What's in store for the Philippine economy in 2008...|$|R

40|$|This book {{describes}} the fascinating recent advances made concerning the chaos, stability and instability of semiconductor lasers, and discusses their applications and future <b>prospects</b> <b>in</b> <b>detail.</b> It emphasizes the dynamics in semiconductor lasers by optical and electronic feedback, optical injection, and injection current modulation. Applications of semiconductor laser chaos, control and noise, and semiconductor lasers are also demonstrated. Semiconductor lasers with new structures, such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and broad-area semiconductor lasers, are intriguing and promising devices. Current topics include fast physical number generation using chaotic semiconductor lasers for secure communication, development of chaos, quantum-dot semiconductor lasers and quantum-cascade semiconductor lasers, and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. This fourth edition has been significantly expanded {{to reflect the}} latest developments. The fundamental theory of laser chaos and the chaotic dynamics in semiconductor lasers are discussed, but also for example the method of self-mixing interferometry in quantum-cascade lasers, which is indispensable in practical applications. Further, this edition covers chaos synchronization between two lasers and the application to secure optical communications. Another new topic is the consistency and synchronization property of many coupled semiconductor lasers {{in connection with the}} analogy of the dynamics between synaptic neurons and chaotic semiconductor lasers, which are compatible nonlinear dynamic elements. In particular, zero-lag synchronization between distant neurons plays a crucial role for information processing in the brain. Lastly, the book presents an application of the consistency and synchronization property in chaotic semiconductor lasers, namely a type of neuro-inspired information processing referred to as reservoir computing...|$|R

40|$|Cosmic-ray protons with {{energies}} above 10 ^ 16 eV passing {{near the}} Sun may interact with photons emitted by the Sun and be excited to a Δ^+ resonance. When the Δ^+ decays, it produces pions which further decay to muons and photons {{which may be}} detected with terrestrial detectors. A flux of muons, photon pairs (from π^ 0 decay), or individual high-energy photons coming from near the Sun would be a rather striking signature, and the flux of these particles is a fairly direct measure of the flux of cosmic-ray nucleons, independent of the cosmic-ray composition. In a solid angle within 15 ^∘ around the Sun the flux of photon pairs is about 1. 3 e- 3 particles/(km^ 2 ·yr), while the flux of muons is about 0. 33 e- 3 particles/(km^ 2 ·yr). This is {{beyond the reach of}} current detectors like the Telescope Array, Auger, KASCADE-Grande or IceCube. However, the muon flux might be detectable by next-generation air shower arrays or neutrino detectors such as ARIANNA or ARA. We discuss the experimental <b>prospects</b> <b>in</b> some <b>detail.</b> Other cosmic-ray interactions occuring close to the Sun are also briefly discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
