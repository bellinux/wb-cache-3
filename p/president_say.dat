You're also talking about the government picking up {{a big part of the}} catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper two percent.

60|$|These {{people are}} thought to know most about fairyland and its inhabitants. But, in the Yellow Fairy Book, and the rest, are many tales by persons who are neither savages nor rustics, such as Madame D'Aulnoy and Herr Hans Christian Andersen. The Folk Lore Society, or its <b>president,</b> <b>say</b> that THEIR tales are not so true as the rest, {{and should not be}} {{published}} with the rest. But WE say that all the stories which are pleasant to read are quite true enough for us; so here they are, with pictures by Mr. Ford, and we do not think that either the pictures or the stories are likely to mislead children.|$|E
6000|$|The Editor {{thinks that}} {{children}} will readily {{forgive him for}} publishing another Fairy Book. We have had the Blue, the Red, the Green, {{and here is the}} Yellow. If children are pleased, and they are so kind as to say that they are pleased, the Editor does not care very much for what other people may say. Now, there is one gentleman who seems to think that it is not quite right to print so many fairy tales, with pictures, and to publish them in red and blue covers. He is named Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, and he is president of a learned body called the Folk Lore Society. Once a year he makes his address to his subjects, of whom the Editor is one, and Mr. Joseph Jacobs (who has published many delightful fairy tales with pretty pictures)(1) is another. Fancy, then, the dismay of Mr. Jacobs, and of the Editor, when they heard their <b>president</b> <b>say</b> that he did not think it very nice in them to publish fairy books, above all, red, green, and blue fairy books! They said that they did not see any harm in it, and they were ready to 'put themselves on their country,' and be tried by a jury of children. And, indeed, they still see no harm in what they have done; nay, like Father William in the poem, they are ready 'to do it again and again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{better part}} of one's life {{consists}} of his friendships; and, of them, mine with Mr. Edwards {{was one of the}} most cherished. I have not been false to it. At a word I could have had the office any time before the department was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the <b>President</b> <b>say</b> as much. That word I forbore to speak, partly for other reasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he might gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort for him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost consciousness of rectitude. I first determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and myself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks, for my benefit. Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the question I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I supposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him. Two or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me Mr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out. His own letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed him of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave assurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform and strong friendship for him entitled me to. Among other things it says, [...] "Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall never be excepted to by me." [...] I also had had a letter from Washington, saying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had declined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I had not then breathed of his letter to any living creature. In saying I had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said substantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to the State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but I aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to keep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself. Mr. Edwards' first suspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend, in behalf of Don Morrison. I knew this was a mistake; and the result has proved it. I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war with Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way. I believe no such thing. With Baker and some strong man from the Military tract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the Wabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed. I believed this in March, and I know it now. The only thing which gave either any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment with themselves.|$|E

50|$|Chea Sim {{left the}} {{position}} of acting Head of State on October 14, 2004, when Norodom Sihamoni became king. He was absent from the 63rd anniversary celebrations of the CPP in June 2014, following years in which age and illness from high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic ailments forced him {{to back away from}} his roles and receive medical care in Vietnam. The Phnom Penh Post reported that Hun Sen was publicly referred to as “acting CPP president” {{for the first time at}} the anniversary event. In the months leading to his death, Chea Sim's signature continued to appear on documents passed by the Senate, of which he was President, but which was in practice presided over by his Deputy <b>President,</b> <b>Say</b> Chhum. He died on 8 June 2015. His Majesty Norodom Sihamoni, King of Cambodia, signed a royal decree to establish a commission to organize the funeral of Chea Sim. The commission was chaired by Heng Samrin, President of the National Assembly along with three vice chairmen, including Prime Minister Hun Sen; Say Chhum, Acting President of Senate; Kong Sam Ol, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Royal Palace. Cambodia scheduled a formal mourning ceremony for Chea Sim for June 19, 2015.|$|E
