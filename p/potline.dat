40|$|Smelter grade {{aluminium}} {{can be used}} as {{an electrical}} conductor application if the level of transition metal impurities is controlled precisely. Bauxite and petroleum coke are the main sources of such impurities in aluminium. Most of the impurities have significant effect on aluminium properties. Efforts have been done to supply relatively pure coke to aluminium smelters but still a list of impurities is found in the <b>potline</b> metal. The effect of transition metal impurities on electrical conductivity could be minimised if they are out of solution from aluminium and present in some solid phase. Industrially, boron treatment has been employed to combine transition metals into their borides. However, solution thermodynamic and reaction mechanism of borides formation are not well understood and further investigations are required. In this article a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been carried out to investigate the formation of borides. It is shown that diborides (MB 2) are the most thermodynamically stable boride compounds of these impurities in the given working conditions. It is also shown that diborides of Zr, Ti, and V are the most thermodynamically stable phases at 650 - 900 degrees Celsius as compared with Cr and Al diborides. Thermodynamic stability of different phases is also affected by the presence of other diborides phases...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of Kyoto {{protocol}} for reducing green house gases and the identification of perfluorocarbons (PFC&# 146;s) emitted during anode effect (AE) in the aluminium electrolysis process as a major source and increasing in global aluminium production capacities, efforts to prevent and control AE have become very important. Much fundamental information on the initiating cause of AE, and the electrochemistry {{have been published in}} the last six decades. Modern control systems at most smelters should apply this knowledge and prevent AE, but in reality don&# 146;t perform as well as expected. While the electrolysis is continuous, manual interventions are still needed, and not all the relevant process parameters are capable of being sensed and controlled directly. Due to this, the process gets disturbed and with subjective decisions, the root cause of each AE gets obscured. No study has been published analysing these causes. They can be due to actions taken by man, performance of equipment and materials as well deviation from control parameters. This study focussed on these previously ignored aspects in order to determine their importance, develop early identification and remedies. Scientific methodology was employed in a smelter with a range of cell technologies and work practices involving extensive data analysis and follow up trials to address root causes, implementing remedies to prevent recurrence. Variables significantly affecting AE frequency were current density, energy balance, algorithms for controls, feeder and breaker design, as well as operational practices. A new logic was introduced to predict AE&# 146;s early reducing AE frequency by 30 - 70 %. AE duration was reduced from 45 to 25 seconds in a <b>potline</b> through refinements in control system. At the start of this investigation the average PFC emission at the smelter was 0. 24 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al and the end a figure of 0. 12 t CO 2 equivalent / t Al. At the time of its conclusion, the improvements were consolidated in a test section achieving an extremely low PFC emission of <= 0. 04 t CO 2 equivalent/t Al as compared to the 2010 voluntary target of 0. 88 t CO 2 equivalent/t Al set by the International Aluminium Association...|$|E

5000|$|Primary {{aluminium}} smelting {{is the process}} of extracting aluminium metal from aluminium oxide (also known as alumina). The process takes place in electrolytic cells that are known as pots. The pots are made up of steel shells with two linings, an outer insulating or refractory lining and an inner carbon lining that acts as the cathode of the electrolytic cell. During the operation of the cell, substances, including aluminium and fluorides, are absorbed into the cell lining. After some years of operation, the pot lining fails and is removed.

40|$|In this project, {{a concept}} {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of aluminum production cells by introducing <b>potlining</b> additives was examined and tested.

40|$|Abstract. Spent <b>potlining</b> (SPL) from Hall-Heroult {{cells is}} a kind of toxic solid waste with {{recyclable}} carbon and electrolyte. The recycle of SPL by floatation, which can meet environment requirements and bring economic profits, is focused on presently because of its great potential to be industrialized and spread. However, it is difficult to get a good floatation index in floatation of SPL with carbon content lower than 50 %. Therefore, the dressing of SPL with 36. 1 % of carbon has been investigated in the paper with the interesting potential {{to improve the quality of}} floatation products by optimizing floatation conditions, such as grinding size, pulp density and agitation speed of floatation machine. And the comparative experiment has been performed.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} preheating of continuously fed, fragmented {{ferrous scrap}} charges by furnace offgases and utilizing substitutes for imported fluorspar to condition electric steelmaking slags. Three types of continuous scrap charging procedures were investigated to determine electrical energy consumption in a I-st (short ton) electric arc furnace. Cold and preheated scrap charges were continuously fed at rates averaging 37. 5 and 43. 7 lb/min, respectively. The feed rate varied appreciably from test to test owing to hangup of the scrap in the charge bin. Approximately 7 pct less electrical energy was consumed in melting scrap preheated to 8400 to 1, 1100 F by furnace off-gases than in melting cold scrap.

40|$|An {{aluminum}} factory {{has experienced}} several load shedding as result of faults in 500 kV overhead {{lines of the}} electric grid, external to the plant. The load shedding from {{two of the four}} <b>potlines</b> of aluminum production, are consequence of the actuation of the protection system against voltages sags installed on the thyristors rectifiers, which under certain conditions considered dangerous, causes the trip of the rectifiers to avoid possible damage to the thyristors due to commutation failure, shedding in this way 360 MW of the total load of the aluminum factory. In order to assess the sensitivity of the protection system to voltage sags caused by faults in the external network, a comprehensive study of the system was performed through digital simulations of failures in several overhead lines, considering different types of faults, locations, scenarios, etc. The parameters and topology of the network are available in detail in the PSS/E program power flow files, but since it is necessary to determine the waveform of the voltage at the plant bus bars, the studies must be performed with a program able to calculate electromagnetic transients such as the ATP.

5000|$|Production {{of primary}} {{aluminium}} metal with the Hall-Héroult process involves the electrolytic reduction of alumina in cells or pots. The electrolyte {{is made up}} of molten cryolite and other additives. The electrolyte is contained in a carbon and refractory lining in a steel potshell. The pots typically have a life of 2 to 6 years. Eventually the cell fails and the <b>potlining</b> (SPL) is removed and replaced. The SPL generated is listed by various environmental bodies as hazardous waste. [...] Due to the concentrations of ﬂuorides and cyanides in spent potliner, and the tendency to leach in contact with water, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) listed the materials on 13 September 1988 (53 Fed. Reg. 35412) as a hazardous waste (K088) under 40 C.F.R., Part 261, Subpart D. International shipment of SPL is subject to the protocols of the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. As the environmental regulation agencies in an increasing number of countries define SPL as a hazardous material, the disposal costs can easily run to more than $1000 per tonne SPL.World production of primary aluminium is in the order of 40 million tonnes. The world’s smelters also produce about one million tonnes of toxic SPL waste. Past industry practice has been to landfill this waste. This must change if the aluminium industry wants to claim a reasonable degree of sustainability and environmentally tolerable emissions. Landfill of unreacted SPL is considered a practice of the past.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{conduct a}} field study to obtain {{information}} on the urinary concentrations of aluminium (Al) and fluoride (F-) depending on the different compounds exposed to in the aluminum industry. METHODS [...] 16 workers from one plant that produced aluminium fluoride (AlF 3), and from two plants that produced aluminium electrolytically by two different processes {{participated in the study}} for one working week. Pollutants were monitored by eight hour personal sampling every day, and urine samples were collected during the week. Al and F- were analysed in both atmospheric and urine samples by atomic absorption spectrometry and an ion selective electrode. RESULTS [...] The principal results show different characteristics of kinetic curves of Al and F- excretion in workers with different exposures. Some characteristics of excretory peaks were linked to specific exposures [...] for instance, after exposure to AlF 3 there was one delayed Al peak associated with one delayed F- peak about eight hours {{after the end of the}} daily shift, and after mixed exposure to HF and AlF 3, two F- peaks were noted, one fast peak at the end of the shift and another delayed peak at 10 hours synchronised with an Al peak. In one of the electrolysis plants, the exposure to Al and F- compounds led to the simultaneous excretion of Al and F- peaks, either as a single peak or two individual ones depending on the type of technology used on site (open or enclosed <b>potlines).</b> The average estimated half life of Al was 7. 5 hours, and of F- about nine hours. Quantitative relations between excretion and exposure showed an association between the F- atmospheric limit value of 2. 5 mg/m 3 with a urinary F- concentration of 6. 4 mg/g creatinine at the end of the shift, a peak of 7. 4 mg/g creatinine, and 7. 4 mg excreted a day. For Al, the exposure to 1. 36 mg/m 3 during the shift corresponded to a urinary concentration at the end of the shift of 200 microgram/g creatinine. Daily excretion of 200 micrograms corresponded to an exposure to 0. 28 mg/m 3. CONCLUSION [...] Particular differences in the behaviour of Al and F- in urine depended upon the original molecular form in the pollutant. These results reinforce the principle that, in biological monitoring, the sampling strategy and the choice of limit value should be dependent on kinetic data that take the exposure compound of the element in question into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence of cyanide in the industrial aluminium electrolytic cell. Therefore, it was an aim of this investigation to identify the favoured regions of cyanide formation in <b>potlining,</b> and conduct parallel laboratory studies to determine some of the chemical factors likely to influence cyanide formation. The study was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved autopsies of cells of various ages, design and construction in detail. This was followed by extensive sampling of sections of the trenched sidewalls and cathode combined with chemical analyses of the specimens, to enable mapping of the cyanide distribution profiles. Examination of these profiles revealed that major amounts of cyanide were generally concentrated in the carbon sidewall region near the collector bars and to a lesser extent in the cathode near the mid-section of the pot. In particular, carbon that was heavily impregnated with metallic sodium and easily accessible to air ingress, was found to contain high concentrations of cyanide. Thus, from the cyanide profiles it: was evident that air ingress through the collector bar seals of the cathode, and sodium penetration of the carbon governed the favoured region for cyanide formation during normal pot operation. In the second stage, an examination of the kinetics of sodium cyanide formation in carbon-mix was performed in the laboratory. Metallic sodium was reacted with carbon and gaseous nitrogen over a range of temperatures. Rate plots derived from a combination of thermogravimetric and integral analysis techniques indicated that there was increasing reactivity with increase in sodium content during the initial stages of reaction. Furthermore, rate data obtained appeared to fit a second-order reaction relative to reactant sodium after the initial burst of reaction. Further laboratory investigations were conducted to establish the temperatures required for cyanide formation, and determine the susceptibility of different forms of carbon to cyanide generation. The carbon types ranged from plant derived carbon-mix through commercial preformed cathode material to high purity graphite. Whilst cyanide formation was found to readily occur in the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C in all the carbons tested, the less ordered carbon-mix was significantly more vulnerable. However, highly graphitised carbon was the least susceptible to cyanide formation within its structure. Moreover, the reaction was accelerated by the presence of small amounts of iron impurity. Laboratory tests also indicated that the predominant cyanide-containing species formed in potlinings was most likely uncomplexed sodium cyanide. The overall results obtained from laboratory studies were consistent with plant measurements and observations derived from the complex industrial situation. Conclusions drawn from this work may have implications in terms of future cell design, and the ultimate impact of spent potlinings on the surrounding environment...|$|R
