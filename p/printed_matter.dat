5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the stamping privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E

The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of Artemisia absinthium as a flavouring agent remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe. Unlike Switzerland and France, there are no further restrictions.|$|E

The illustration of <b>printed</b> <b>matters</b> could be considerably standardised due to the lithography technique invented by Alois Senefelder. Finally, another invention was photography, whose establishment {{at the end of the}} 19th century led to the first halftoning and reproduction procedures.

25|$|The generations who led {{and fought}} the American Civil War were born into an {{independent}} United States {{and they would}} determine whether it could continue as a united republic. Steam power on land and sea had begun to shrink {{the world and the}} telegraph moved information at the speed of electricity. In 1851, Congress reduced rates for typical uses such as <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> to one cent, and three-cent letter postage versus five or ten-cent rates. Postal distances for each rate were extended as much as ten times, for example, from three hundred to 3,000 miles. Their world was filled with mechanized innovations that included the first U.S. postage stamps produced from machine perforation to replace the cutting tasks which had been done manually. These were accompanied by innovations in paper types and printing techniques.|$|E

25|$|The rise of {{printing}} was {{greatly influenced by}} Mahayana Buddhism. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea {{of printing}} and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example {{of this type of}} <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> is a fragment of a dhāraṇī (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in Xi'an. It is called the Great spell of unsullied pure light (Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650-670. A similar piece, the Saddharma pundarika sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699. This coincides with the reign of Wu Zetian, under which the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.|$|E

500|$|Muslims have {{traditionally}} expressed love and veneration for Muhammad. Stories of Muhammad's life, his intercession {{and of his}} miracles (particularly [...] "Splitting of the moon") have permeated popular Muslim thought and poetry. Among Arabic odes to Muhammad, Qasidat al-Burda ("Poem of the Mantle") by the Egyptian Sufi al-Busiri (1211–1294) is particularly well known, and widely held to possess a healing, spiritual power. The Quran refers to Muhammad as [...] "a mercy (rahmat) to the worlds" [...] (Quran [...] ). The association of rain with mercy in Oriental countries has led to imagining Muhammad as a rain cloud dispensing blessings and stretching over lands, reviving the dead hearts, just as rain revives the seemingly dead earth (see, for example, the Sindhi poem of Shah ʿAbd al-Latif). Muhammad's birthday is celebrated as a major feast throughout the Islamic world, excluding Wahhabi-dominated Saudi Arabia where these public celebrations are discouraged. When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with Peace be upon him (Arabic: ṣallā llahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam). In casual writing, this is sometimes abbreviated as PBUH or SAW; in <b>printed</b> <b>matter,</b> a small calligraphic rendition is commonly used (ﷺ).|$|E

500|$|Gill Sans remains popular, {{although}} a trend {{away from it}} towards grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces took place around the 1950s and 1960s {{under the influence of}} continental and American design. Typefaces that became popular around this time included original early [...] "grotesque" [...] sans-serifs, as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers. Mosley has commented that in 1960 [...] "orders unexpectedly revived" [...] for the old Monotype Grotesque design: [...] " [...] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties." [...] He added in 2007 [...] "its rather clumsy design seems to {{have been one of the}} chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the... prettiness of Gill Sans". As an example of this trend, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert's corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage, and abandoned the classical, all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated. Kinneir and Calvert's road signage redesign used a similar approach. Linotype and its designer Hermann Zapf, who had begun development on a planned Gill Sans competitor in 1955, first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these fonts before abandoning the design project (now named [...] "Magnus") around 1962-3.|$|E
