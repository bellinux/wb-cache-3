50|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} can typically shift ratios {{faster than}} a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch <b>pedal</b> to the <b>floor</b> and move the gearstick from one position to another.

On February 24, 2010, Toyota responded that it [...] "has rigorously tested its solutions" [...] and are [...] "confident" [...] with the recall repairs, but that it would continue to monitor other possible contributing factors for unintended acceleration, including mechanical, electronics, and driver error.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{hand dryer}} was patented in 1921 by R.B. Hibbard, D. J. Watrous and J.G. Bassett for the Airdry Corporation of Groton New York.

50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the key-operated combination ignition-starter switch, {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a <b>pedal</b> in the <b>floor</b> that manually engaged the starter drive pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|R
2500|$|Unicycle cranks vary {{in length}} to {{accommodate}} different unicycle wheel sizes, and different unicycling disciplines. As almost all unicycles are ungeared, crank length {{is a major}} factor in determining how much force is transmitted to the wheel. Larger wheel diameters (26" [...] to 36") require longer cranks , as do disciplines such as Mountain Unicycling, Trials, Street, and Flatland. These unicycles and disciplines commonly use cranks lengths greater than 125mm. For indoor unicycling such as freestyle or hockey, shorter cranks give a smoother pedaling motion and enable tighter turns without the <b>pedal</b> hitting the <b>floor.</b> Crank lengths of 100mm are common, although some riders use cranks as short as 79mm.|$|R

40|$|Organizations {{establish}} their own profiles at social media sites to publish pertinent {{information to customers}} and other stakeholders. During a long and severe crisis, multiple issues may emerge in media interaction. Positive responses and prompt interaction from the official account of e. g. a car manufacturer creates clarity and reduces anxiety among stakeholders. This research targets the Volkswagen 2015 emission scandal that became public on Sept. 18, 2015. We report its main phases over time based on public web information. To better understand the online interaction and reactions of the company, we scrutinized what information was published on VW’s official web sites, Facebook, and Twitter profiles and how {{the image of the}} company developed over time among various stakeholders. To investigate this, Twitter and Facebook data sets were collected, cleaned, and analysed. We also compared this crisis in several respects with the Toyota recall crisis in 2010 - 2011 that was caused by sticking accelerator <b>pedals</b> and <b>floor</b> mats, as well as the GM crisis in 2014 that was caused by faulty ignition switches. Further we compare our findings with the Malaysian airline crisis that was caused by the disappeared flight MH 370 and downed MH 14...|$|R
40|$|Friction braking is {{necessarily}} related to high thermal loads which may cause {{problems such as}} hot spotting and the associated hot judder phenomenon. The driver may experience brake judder as vibrations in the frequency range below 100 Hz in the steering wheel, brake <b>pedal</b> and <b>floor.</b> It is state-of-the-art to investigate the thermal and thermoelastic behaviour of brakes in elaborate finite element studies, which provide high resolution results but require a high computational effort. As a consequence, thermal and thermoelastic issues could not be considered so far in brake models intended {{to be used for}} a system-dynamical analysis of the complete vehicle that may necessary to set up control strategies such as electronic stability programs. With this backgrouns, the article introduces a new method to model brake discs and to account for their thermal amd thermoelastic behaviour while braking in a very efficient way. Effects such as the temperature dependency on friction and the change of contact conditions between the disc and the pad caused by thermal and mechanical influences may be considered with much less computational effort and an acceptable accuracy when compared with the finite element method...|$|R

5000|$|The product allowed {{musician}}s to record musical phrases {{at the touch}} of a button which were then played back, looping indefinitely. The musician would typically use the looping audio as a backing track providing a virtual backing band.

By pressing a button on the <b>floor</b> <b>pedal,</b> the device begins recording a rhythm (8 seconds of memory comes standard, but an upgraded 32-second memory chip is a common upgrade). When the musician is finished playing the part to be looped, simply press the tap button on the floor again and the machine does two things immediately: replays the part from the beginning looping it indefinitely while sending a MIDI clock signal to a drum machine which kicks in right on time and is synchronized to the rhythm part.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to confirm that female drivers sit closer to the steering wheel than do male drivers and to investigate whether this expected difference in sitting position is attributable to differences in the physical dimensions of men and women. Driver body dimensions and multiple measures of sitting distance from the steering wheel were collected from a sample of 150 men and 150 women. The results confirmed that on average, women sit closer to the steering wheel than men do and that this difference is accounted for by variations in body dimensions, especially height. This result suggests that driver height may provide a good surrogate for sitting distance from the steering wheel when investigating the role of driver position in real-world crash outcomes. The potential applications of this research include change to vehicle design that allows independent adjustment of the relative distance among the driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat, the steering wheel, and the <b>floor</b> <b>pedals...</b>|$|R

500|$|Although many {{reviews of}} St. Anger were positive, some reviewers {{had a strong}} distaste for the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork {{strongly}} disliked the album and criticized Ulrich and Hammett, saying that Ulrich was [...] "playing a drum set consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell. The kit's high-end clamor ignored {{the basic principles of}} drumming: timekeeping," [...] he added, [...] "Hetfield and Hammett's guitars underwent more processing than cat food. When they both speedstrummed through 'St. Anger', and most other movements, [...] seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise. Also the duration of most songs made it boring to hear them." [...] Playlouder reviewer William Luff cited the album's 75-minute length and sound ("a monolithic slab of noise") as reasoning that St. Anger was [...] "just too dense and daunting to be truly enjoyable." [...] PopMatters reporter Michael Christopher said [...] "St. Anger dispenses with the recent spate of radio friendly pleasantries in favor of <b>pedal</b> to the <b>floor</b> thrash, staggered and extended song structures, quick changes and a muddled production that tries to harken back to the Kill 'Em All days.
