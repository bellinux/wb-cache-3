40|$|An exact spectral-dynamic {{stiffness}} method (S-DSM) {{for free}} vibration analysis of composite <b>plates</b> and <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{has been proposed}} in Part I of this two-part paper. The main purpose of this Part II paper is twofold: (i) To validate and demonstrate {{the superiority of the}} proposed S-DSM and (ii) To establish exact benchmark solutions for free vibration of composite plate-like structures. The S-DSM is applied to a number of problems covering orthotropic composite <b>plates</b> and <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies.</b> It is demonstrated that the S-DSM gives exact solutions with high computational efficiency within low as well as high frequency ranges. The applications are completely general and the new development can handle complex plate shapes with any boundary conditions...|$|R
50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R

The NRCSD deployer doors are located on the forward end, the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is located on the}} aft end, and access panels are provided on the top. The inside walls of the NRCSD are a smooth bore design to minimize and/or preclude hang-up or jamming of CubeSat appendages during deployment, should these become released prematurely.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented for the buckling analysis of prismatic skew <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> subject to invariant in-plane stresses. Based {{on the exact}} solution of the plate differential equations, the method of Lagrangian multipliers is used to enforce the transverse skew boundaries by {{a sufficient number of}} point constraints. Analysis assumes that the plate is infinitely long and that supports repeat at bay length intervals, typifying the continuity found in aircraft wing construction. Following a brief derivation of the formulation adopted, results are presented and comparisons are made with other analyses for an unstiffened isotropic skew plate, subject to pure compression loading with both simply supported and clamped boundary conditions. Results for four benchmark stiffened panels, i. e. <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies,</b> incorporating composite material and combined loading are also given for a range of skew angles...|$|R
50|$|Steel plate {{construction}} is roughly twice {{the speed of}} other reinforced concrete construction, because it avoids tying rebar and constructing forms on-site. The parallel <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> can be constructed quickly in specialized off-site fabrication facilities.

5000|$|At {{the front}} of the barrel, the [...] plastic leaves the screw and travels through a screen pack to remove any {{contaminants}} in the melt. The screens are reinforced by a breaker plate (a thick metal puck with many holes drilled through it) since the pressure at this point can exceed 5,000 psi (34 MPa). The screen pack/breaker <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> also serves to create back pressure in the barrel. Back pressure is required for uniform melting and proper mixing of the polymer, and how much pressure is generated can be [...] "tweaked" [...] by varying screen pack composition (the number of screens, their wire weave size, and other parameters).

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, over-torque protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has an ORU <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> with two cone members and a post member which mate to the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two plates. Two deflecting plates are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} deflecting plates, the force is distributed preventing the ORU and base plates from deflecting. This accounts for precision in the placement of the article. The novelty is believed to reside in using deflecting plates in conjunction with kinematic mounts to provide distributed forces to the two members...|$|E
40|$|A Helmholtz {{resonator}} with a uniform, flexible {{end plate}} is studied in this work. This work {{shows that the}} flexible plate modifies the frequency response characteristics of the resonator, providing multiple distinct resonant frequencies instead of a single resonant frequency. Therefore, acoustical transmission loss will increase {{at each of the}} multiple resonant frequencies of the resonator and <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> versus at a single frequency for the unmodified Helmholtz resonator. By using receptance coupling as the modeling approach, the receptance of the Helmholtz resonator and flexible <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is predicted by coupling receptance models of an unmodified Helmholtz resonator and a clamped plate. Finally, the predicted receptance of the Helmholtz resonator and flexible <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is compared against experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of T 4 D tail plates occurring during {{in vitro complementation}} reactions {{was found to be}} stimulated by pteroyl hexaglutamate. Neither the pteroyl pentaglutamate nor the pteroyl heptaglutamate substituted for the hexaglutamate. A small stimulation of the rate and amount of T 4 D tail <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> was observed in untreated extracts. A greater stimulation occurred when activated charcoal-treated bacterial extracts were used. Charcoal treatment inhibited complementation only when no preformed tail plates were present in the extracts, and the inhibition was reversed by the addition of 9 × 10 − 6 m chemically synthesized pteroyl hexaglutamate. The stimulation is apparently due to a requirement for the pteroyl hexaglutamate for tail <b>plate</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{robotic system}} {{includes}} a tendon-driven end effector, a linear actuator, a flexible tendon, and a <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> The linear actuator assembly has a servo motor and a drive mechanism, {{the latter of}} which translates linearly {{with respect to a}} drive axis of the servo motor in response to output torque from the servo motor.

A looped end of the flexible tendon is received within the tendon guide channels...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{theory and}} the {{associated}} computer program VICONOPT deal with infinitely wide <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> given that boundary conditions {{on all sides of}} each panel form a rectangle. They also deal with cases when the four supports form a parallelogram so that the plate is a skew plate. This is true provided the panel is of finite width. i. e. isolated from any adjacent panels, which is the case commonly modeled in practice. It does not represent what happens in the real structure however, where normally there is continuity with the adjacent panel. The present paper shows how the {{theory and the}} computer program VICONOPT, can be modified such that skewed <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> that are infinitely wide and repeat at transverse intervals can now be modeled exactly. The paper also shows that the theory can be used, if a small measure of approximation is accepted, to model this situation by analysing only one of the identical stiffeners with associated panel skin in the common situations where the panel has equally spaced, identical, longitudinal stiffeners between each adjacent pair of longitudinal lines of support. Illustrative results are given...|$|R
25|$|Parallel plate {{separators}} {{are similar}} to API separators but they include tilted parallel <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> (also known as parallel packs). The parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation. The result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator {{to achieve the same}} degree of separation.|$|R

40|$|The dual-plate {{composite}} {{shear wall}} concept {{was introduced to}} reduce the construction time of tall buildings. A dual-plate composite shear wall is a concrete-filled steel <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> The steel <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is composed of two steel plates connected with steel rods spaced uniformly in orthogonal directions. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop details to be used in dual-plate composite shear walls and to investigate the behavior and adequacy of those details. ^ A 3 / 8 -scale dual-plate composite shear wall was constructed and tested as part of the experimental evaluation conducted during this research effort. First, foundation details and the connection between the specimen and foundation were designed and investigated. Next, details of the shear wall were selected using available standard design provisions. The behavior of dual-plate composite shear walls was investigated through four distinct experimental tests to study the following features: (a) stability of plate assemblies for resisting vertical construction loads, (b) strain compatibility between steel plates and concrete - to determine whether the steel plates and concrete act together for the selected details used in the <b>plate</b> <b>assembly,</b> (c) shear strength of horizontal splice connections between adjacent plate assemblies, and (d) behavior of dual-plate composite shear walls under cyclic load - to determine whether composite shear walls have sufficient strength and ductility to resist earthquake and wind loads. ^ From the experimental and analytical investigation of the stability behavior of a 3 / 8 -scale two-story dual-plate assembly, it was determined that the <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> was able to resist a maximum load of 18 times the maximum expected construction load. Behavior of the composite shear wall under cyclic lateral loading was investigated using a 3 / 8 -scale 5 - 1 / 2 story 30 -ft tall T-shaped shear wall specimen. It was determined from the test that if buckling of the plate could be prevented, then the design approach used for the test specimen can be used to design the structural components for dual-plate composite shear walls to resist cyclic lateral loads up to at least 2 % drift. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a {{new family}} of fibre {{laminated}} <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The assemblies covered are prismatic and consist {{of a series of}} thin, flat, rectangular plates that have a series of equally spaced voids, which run for the full length of the central layer of the plates and have constant rectangular cross-section. Optimization of an important sub-group of such <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies,</b> namely blade-stiffened panels, is studied parametrically with the objective of minimizing their mass subject to buckling constraint under pure longitudinal compression. Ply thicknesses, fibre orientation and height of the blade stiffeners are the design variables used when optimizing and the variables changed during the parametric study are the number of stiffeners, a nondimensional load parameter and the aspect ratio of the panels. The parametric study shows graphically the effects on the panel mass of the number of voids in the portion between stiffeners, the thickness of individual voids, the number of stiffeners and the effects of prescribing the values of the stiffener height or thickness. It is observed that a substantial, e. g. 16 - 20 %, mass saving can be achieved by using voids in the way advocated. These percentages are very close to those obtained by using the same voids for an individual plate that is identical to the skin between blades and is simply supported...|$|R
