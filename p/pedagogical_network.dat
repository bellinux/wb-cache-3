For these three models the link-space matrix can be solved analytically. We apply the formalism to a simple one-parameter growing network model whose numerical solution exemplifies the effect of degree-degree correlations for the resulting degree distribution. We also employ the formalism to derive the degree distributions of two very simple network decay models, more specifically, that of random link deletion and random node deletion. The formalism allows detailed analysis of the correlations within networks and we also employ it to derive the form of a perfectly nonassortative network for arbitrary degree distribution...|$|E

Malaysian smart schools aim to help their country to foster the workforce of 21 st century by utilizing and enabling the leading-edge technologies into schools. And the smart schools not only focus on stimulating thinking, creativity, and caring for the students, but also considering the individual differences and learning styles among their learners. The smart education in Singapore also emphasizes the role of technology. Their goal is to foster engaging learning experience to meet the diverse needs of learners, through the innovative use of information and communications technology (Education and Learning Sub-Committee, 2007). In order to realize this, Singapore created an enriching and personalized learner-centric environment, and additionally created a nation-wide education and learning architecture for educational institutions and life-long learning. Korea carried out the smart education project to provide the customized and adaptive learning for students to foster self-directed learning ability and have fun to use various resources and technology. Individualized instruction and creativity-centered education is considered as the main keyword of smart education. Australia aims to build a smart, multi-disciplinary student-centric education system using the following strategies: adaptive learning programs and learning portfolios for students, collaborative technologies and digital learning resources for teachers and students, computerized administration, monitoring and reporting, and online learning resources. New York proposed the keys for achieving Smart School as following: embracing and expanding online learning, utilizing transformative technologies, connecting every school using high-speed network, extending connectivity between {{inside and outside of}} the classroom, providing high-quality, continuous professional development, and focusing on foster 21 st century skills (New York Smart Schools Commission Report 2014). Finnish smart education aims at using user-driven and motivational learning solutions to promote 21 st century learning (Kankaanranta and Mäkelä 2014). They proposed a <b>pedagogical</b> <b>network</b> of educational institutions called “value network” that is the central of program. It has five categories as following: to understand user experience and usability, to receive expert feedback, to indicate learning outcomes, effects and quality of learning, to develop skills and expertise (Mäkelä et al. 2014). United Arab Emirates (UAE) aims to advance their education system to student-centric through the application of world-class teaching science and latest technology. They encourage learner to develop creativity, analytic thinking and innovation. Their approach encompasses learning {{both inside and outside the}} classroom. The students can control and active participant into their own learning process in interactive, engaging and enabling learning environments.|$|E

40|$|Teaching {{informatics}} {{takes place}} in schools for about 30 years. More and more developed countries discuss the basic necessity of compulsory courses in informatics at secondary level (at the age of 10 years) as precondition in working successful with informatics systems at all. A historical analysis is presented due to find out successful elements {{in teaching and learning}} informatics at school over time. The main focus from developing informatics and didactics of informatics are shown in combination to find out the chronological order of main ideas in both fields. Studies are presented, which show some results on special curricular elements to reflect the goals in constructing teaching processes in a meaningful and effective way. Embedding elements of collaborative learning in teaching as well as learning processes produced surprising effects. One result of our studies takes us to state that the historical perspective of informatics is one key how young students learn to understand actual and upcoming developments which affects the future character of everyday life. It is shown, how to integrate this in planning and realising concrete teaching processes. Especially the skill of problem solving has a key function as it enables students to learn, how to get involved with finding solutions in the field of informatics. This makes it possible to study principal upper bounds in elements of theoretical evidence. Our group worked out modern concepts to enable students to participate successful in informatics and in other subjects in school, where basic knowledge in informatics is needed more and more. Integrated school centred <b>pedagogical</b> <b>networks</b> with sophisticated network management based on the necessities of the mentioned ideas is the technical background for enabling pupils learning to build mental models in informatics.

40|$|Summary. Innovative storage {{technology}} and the rising popularity of the Inter-net have generated an ever-growing amount of data. In this vast amount of data much valuable knowledge is available, yet it is hidden. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art classification technique that generally provides accurate models, as {{it is able to}} capture non-linearities in the data. However, this strength is also its main weakness, as the generated non-linear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. By extracting rules that mimic the black box as closely as possible, we can provide some insight into the logics of the SVM model. This explanation capability is of crucial importance in any domain where the model needs to be validated before being implemented, such as in credit scoring (loan default prediction) and medical diagnosis. If the SVM is regarded as the cur-rent state-of-the-art, SVM rule extraction can be the state-of-the-art of the (near) future. This chapter provides an overview of recently proposed SVM rule extraction techniques, complemented with the <b>pedagogical</b> Artificial Neural <b>Network</b> (ANN) rule extraction techniques which are also suitable for SVMs. Issues related to thi...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the creation of}} the Historical and <b>Pedagogical</b> Museums <b>network</b> in the State of São Paulo between 1956 and 1973, mainly taking into consideration the concept for creation, the program, {{and the role of the}} museum in society. This work covers a period until the end of the 1990 's, when the curators of the museums, which belonged to the State until that time, was transferred to the municipalities by means ofa "municipalization"process coordinated by the Department of Museums and Archives of the State Department of Cultural Affairs (DEMA-SEC). It also shows that the implementation of this museums network - among other initiatives in the fields of education and of culture - addressed earlier needs of asserting an identity, emphasizing through projects of this type the hegemonic character of the State. This allowed to align the initiative of creating the museums with others actions carried out by the State before, and also enabled that this topic was take out from its long isolation from the study of State history. It also considers the web of relationships existing among the various sectors with which museums were connected, such as education, culture, and the São Paulo Historical and Geographical Institute, the Government, and Society. The implementation of Historical and Pedagogical Museums by means of State action, through its Departments of Education (from 1956 to 1968) and Cultural Affairs (from 1968 to 1998) was one of the ways through which the Government orientated its activities during those years in the fields of history, education and culture. The central thesis is that the implementation of these museums has fully addressed the aspirations of society at the time, while, at the same time, underscoring the logic behind the ideation that has oriented the characteristic mode of operation of museums during the years in which their curatorship was exercised by the Government, and proposes to consider them as a paradigm for "historical museums of the State of São Paulo"...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-introduce the E-quality in Networked Learning Manifesto that was {{presented}} at the Networked Learning 2002 conference by the E-Quality Network and to reflect on its current applicability and meaning for networked learning. The paper will focus specifically on two of the five themes of the Manifesto; the working definition of networked (e) -learning and the need for a networked (e) - learning policy. In the paper we argue that the time is right to simply use the term networked learning and drop the ‘e’ in networked e-learning. This is because we think it is more important to foreground connectivity as a specific and important <b>pedagogical</b> feature of <b>networked</b> learning. We claim that an updated definition of networked learning should not only refer to being a pedagogy based on connectivity and the co-production of knowledge but also one that aspires to support e-quality of opportunity and include reference to the importance of relational dialogue and critical reflexivity in all of this. Following on from the definition of networked learning we reaffirm the point made in the original Manifesto that policy for networked learning should be based on explicit educational values and research. And further, that it should be reiterated by reference to research findings. We identify a number of policy areas that have been identified as important to consider at both the Government and Institutional level. We then argue for policy, when introducing Networked Learning into the curriculum and institutional educational practice, to be informed by the educational values and theory underpinning networked learning and not to be developed in isolation to these. The paper concludes by asking people to respond and draw on their research to comment on and hopefully develop the E-Quality Networked Learning manifesto and draw out issues for networked learning for the coming years...|$|R

As {{part of the}} {{proceedings}} three BA Popular Music students from the University delivered papers, presenting them {{with the opportunity to}} engage with a wider research community. The success of the panel prompted Yoshe Watson, one of the students involved, to put forward the idea of an undergraduate PMS conference open to students from across the UK and beyond. This conference, U:Pop (www. u-pop. org), will be held in Northampton on the 30 th May 2015, launching a broader international undergraduate research network that will connect students, academics and industry professionals. This paper will reflect both upon the U:Pop conference after the event and the opportunities and challenges of formulating the proposed research network to follow it. Whilst undergraduate research networks currently operate in other disciplines, particularly in the US, there are few platforms for undergraduate students working in PMS to develop independent research and scholarship outside of their immediate curriculum. Focusing on the recommendations of Healy and Jenkins’ (2009) HEA report into developing undergraduate research and inquiry, this paper will plot out the possible ways by which students can develop their scholarship, and engage with PMS research communities beyond their own institutions. Through opportunities to present and publish research, to engage with scholars in the field of PMS, to develop methodological and <b>pedagogical</b> skills and <b>network</b> both with academic and industrial partners, the research network will seek to meet a number of objectives relevant to the current academic research climate. It will create academic and industrial opportunities for students, foster the self-perception of undergraduates as active researchers who are a new generation of PMS scholars, and it will act as a pathway towards postgraduate study. The network will also foster cross-institutional collaboration, develop undergraduate research skills both within and without curricula, and, in light of the recent REF assessment, promote academic research that has real social impact. Finally the paper will ask how the PMS research community can facilitate such a network and foster sophisticated scholarship amongst undergraduate cohorts...|$|R
