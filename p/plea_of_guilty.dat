They wrote that [...] "it is absurd" [...] to charge the reparation articles of the treaty with any [...] "political meaning" [...] and the legal interpretation [...] "is the only one that can stand". They concluded that German opposition [...] "is based upon a text which has no legal validity whatsoever, and which Germany never signed at all." [...] Sidney Fay was the [...] "most outspoken and influential critic" [...] of the article. In 1928, he concluded that all of Europe shared the blame for the war and that Germany had no intention of launching a general European war in 1914.|$|E
