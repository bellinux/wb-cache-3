5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a <b>paper</b> <b>board</b> box.|$|E
25|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} were developed as flat sandwich sheets used for bulkheads and decking. These were long established with wood and <b>paper</b> <b>board</b> construction, but required a more robust material for aerospace use. This was achieved {{towards the end}} of the war, with all-aluminium honeycomb sandwiches.|$|E
25|$|The insole is the {{interior}} {{bottom of a}} shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during {{the closing of the}} shoe during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic <b>paper</b> <b>board</b> or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is the {{comparison}} between the experimental and FEM results of loaded corrugated <b>paper</b> <b>boards.</b> The corrugated <b>paper</b> <b>boards</b> have an orthotropic material behaviour, {{which means that the}} boards, depending on the direction of the corrugation, have different modules of elasticity.

60|$|After sewing the book, {{she would}} {{cut out a}} piece of morocco paper, or blue paper, or gilt paper, and {{sometimes}} a piece of morocco itself, just the size of the book when open, for the cover. Then, after spreading out a large newspaper upon the table, so as to keep the table clean, she would lay down the cover with the handsome side down, and then spread the paste over the other side, very carefully, with a brush which she made from the end of a quill. Then she would put the back edge of the book down upon this cover, and lay it over, first on one side, and then on the other, and pat it down well with a towel; and that would make the cover stick to the outside leaves of the book, and cover up and hide the great stitches in the back, by which the leaves had been sewed together. Then she would take the book before her, and begin at the beginning. First, she would lay down the cover and put upon it a piece of tin, made to fill papers with, to keep it down smooth. Then she would lay the next leaf down upon the tin. The leaf was to have the title-page upon it, and so there were to be no pictures pasted to it. She would, therefore, lay this down upon the tin, and then, with one of her large paint brushes, dipped in the water, she would wet it all over, patting it afterwards with a towel, to take up all the superfluous water. Then she would take up the tin, and put the title-leaf down upon the cover, and put the tin over it to keep it down smooth. The next leaf would be for pictures, and, after pasting pictures upon it, on both sides, she would lay it down upon the tin, and with her brush she would wet all those parts which had not been pasted. Then patting it with a dry towel, or soft cloth, to dry it as much as possible, she would put it under the tin. In this way she would go on regularly, through the book, pasting pictures upon all the pages, and wetting with her brush all those parts of the paper which had not been wet by the paste, and putting the tin over the leaves as fast as she finished them, to keep them all smooth. Then, when she had got through, she would put the whole away between two boards, to dry; the weight of the <b>paper</b> <b>board</b> being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth. The next morning when she came to look at her book, she generally found it nearly dry; and then she would put some heavy weight upon the upper board, to press it harder. When it was perfectly dry, she took out the book, and pared off the edges, all around, with a sharp knife and a rule. Then she would get her paint-box, and colour all the pictures beautifully, and make borders about them, in bright colours, and print a handsome title-page with her pen, and write the name of the boy in it whom she meant to give it to.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{migration}} investigations with different spiked and non-spiked <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> packaging {{materials in contact}} with foodstuffs and food simulants in the temperature range between - 18 °C and 40 °C were carried out. The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} migration behaviour of target substances in <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> fibres. Components and contaminants of <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> with different molecular weight and chemical structure were selected as target migrants. From the kinetic migration studies diffusion and partition coefficients were derived by using a software for modelling migration in multilayer materials. On the basis of these results {{for the first time a}} model for the migration from <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> into foods and simulants was developed by adapting the validated diffusion model for plastics. In contrast to the migration in plastic materials, where the migrants are solved and homogenously distributed in the polymer matrix, mass transfer in <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> is a more complex phenomenon, because the migrants can be adsorbed on the cellulose surface with different strength. The most important finding of the study was that for a correct modelling of the experimental results in many cases <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> must be regarded as a 2 -layer system: the main mass of <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> (B 1) defines the core layer with high diffusion rates and a thin second layer (B 2) represents the surface region of the <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> with decreased diffusion rates due to the slow desorption...|$|R
