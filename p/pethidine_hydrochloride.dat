40|$|Thirty-five human {{volunteers and}} eight Rhesus monkeys were studied with {{standard}} gastrooesophageal manometric techniqes and their reflux status was evaluated witha pH probe {{placed in the}} lower oesophagus. morphine sulphate, <b>pethidine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> or idazepam was given intravenously until drowsiness was induced. The manometric and pH studies were repeated. All three drugs decreased the lower oesophageal high pressure zone and increased the probability of relux in both monkeys and man. Thes findings are relevant {{in the preparation of}} patients for surgery since gastrooesophageal reflux and pulmonary aspiration may be a problen in the pre-and postoperative phases...|$|E
40|$|A simple, precise, {{rapid and}} {{low-cost}} potentiometric method for pethidine determination in pharmaceuticals and urine is proposed. A chemically modified carbon paste electrode (CMCPE) for <b>pethidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (PDCl) based on pethidine-phosphotungstate (PD-PT) as ion-pair complex was prepared and fully character-ized {{in terms of}} composition, usable pH range, response time and temperature. The pethidine electrode showed Nernstain responses in the concentration range 2. 1 × 10 – 6 - 1. 0 × 10 – 2 M with a detection limit of 7. 3 × 10 - 7 and usable within the pH range 3. 5 - 6. 6. This sensor exhibited a fast response time (about 5 - 8 s), good stability. The value (dE/dt) of the electrode {{was found to be}} 0. 00071 V/?C, which indicates fairly high ther-mal stability. Selectivity coefficients determined by matched potential method (MPM) and separate solution method (SSM) showed high selectivity for PDCl with respect to a large number of inorganic cations, organic cations, sugars and some common drug excipients. The sensor could be used successfully in the estimation of PDCl in ampoules and in spiked urine samples...|$|E
40|$|Migraine {{can be a}} {{disabling}} {{condition for}} the sufferer. For {{the small number of}} patients for whom home therapy fails and who seek treatment in an emergency department, several therapeutic options are available. I review the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the following therapies: the phenothiazines, lignocaine (lidocaine), ketorolac, the ergot alkaloids, metoclopramide hydrochloride, the “triptans,” haloperidol, <b>pethidine</b> (meperidine <b>hydrochloride),</b> and magnesium sulfate. Based on available evidence, the most effective agents seem to be prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and sumatriptan, each of which has achieved greater than 70 % efficacy in several studies...|$|R

40|$|Fifty-eight {{patients}} with mild to moderately severe acute pancreatitis were randomly allocated to treatment {{with or without}} nasogastric suction (27 and 31 patients respectively). Intravenous fluids and <b>pethidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were also given. The two groups were comparable clinically {{at the start of}} the study. There were no differences between the two groups in the mean duration of the following features: abdominal pain or tenderness; absence of bowel movements; raised serum amylase concentration; time to resumption of oral feeding; and days in hospital. Prolonged hyperamylasaemia (serum amylase greater than 0. 33 mU/l) occurred in one patient in the suction group and in three patients in the non-suction group. A mild recurrence of abdominal pain after resumption of oral feeding occurred in three patients in the suction group and in two patients in the non-suction group. Two patients in the suction group developed overt consumption coagulopathy and two others pulmonary complications. No patient in the non-suction group had complications. The findings suggest that most {{patients with}} mild to moderately severe acute pancreatitis do not benefit from nasogastric suction. The procedure should be elective rather than mandatory in treating this condition...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that rat/mouse hemokinin- 1 (r/m HK- 1), a mammalian tachykinin, produced dose- and time-related antinociceptive effects at the supraspinal level via activating NK 1 receptors. Moreover, r/m HK- 1 remarkably enhanced both the antinociceptive extent {{and duration of}} morphine administered at the peripheral and supraspinal level through a convergence of pharmacological effects of opioid-responsive neurons. <b>Pethidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is an important narcotic analgesic, which acts as an opiate agonist and has pharmacological effects similar to morphine. To improve {{our knowledge of the}} pharmacology of pethidine, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between the nociception of r/m HK and pethidine by comparing it with that of r/m HK- 1 and morphine. Our data showed that r/m HK- 1 remarkably enhanced the antinociceptive extent of pethidine administered at the peripheral level, but not at the supraspinal level. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by prior treatment with the classical opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic effect is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. Differences in the antinociceptive activity of pethidine and morphine in combination with r/m HK- 1, arise because there are differences in the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of pethidine and morphine, particularly their lipophilicity. Our results may pave the way for a new strategy for the control of pain and may provide a clinical strategy to enable selection of either opioid as a priority.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present the}} {{diagnostic}} approach of bone lesions with percutaneous trephine biopsy under Computed Tomography(CT) guidance. To describe the procedure, {{to determine the}} specificity, the accuracy and its possible complications. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a 27 -month period 296 percutaneous skeletal biopsies were performed under CT-guidance in 287 patients (176 men and 111 women, age range 11 - 86 years, 171 outpatients and 116 inpatients). The biopsies were performed under local anesthesia. Forty five to 60 min before the procedure all patients received an analgesic treatment consisting of 3 mgr bromazepam per os and 0, 05 gr <b>pethidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> IM. In all biopsies 1 - 3 specimens were obtained with the trephine biopsy - 228 - set (14 gauge/ 12 cm & 19, 5 cm). In 260 biopsies 1 - 4 specimens were obtained with the automated biopsy needle (16 gauge or 18 gauge/ 15 cm). In 99 of them material for cytological evaluation was received with CIBA 20 gauge & 22 gauge/ 15 cm needle. Finally, in 114 biopsies material for microbiologic evaluations and cultures was received and in 11 material for haematological examination. RESULTS: Only the 272 patients who had a 6 month follow-up participated in the study. The 15 patients with no monitoring were excluded. The results and the statistic analysis were related with 280 biopsies. The total results from the overall analysis of the biopsy material were of great specificity in 71. 4 %. Only in 1. 8 % there was no diagnosis. The highest per cent of great specificity results came from the histological tests (61. 4 %), the cytological results were of great specificity in 9. 8 %, the cultures’ results in 41. 5 % and the haematological results in 45. 5 %. The accuracy was 98. 9 % for the histological evaluation, 91. 4 % for the cytological evaluation and 94. 8 % for cultures. The high percentage of specificity (p< 0, 001) and accuracy (p= 1. 00) in histological results depended exclusively {{on the number of}} the received specimens. The anatomic location of the lesion and its structure were of no statistic significance. Three minor complications were noticed, consisting of local hematoma (1 %). CONCLUSION: The percutaneous bone biopsy under CT-guidance is a safe procedure with great specificity and accuracy, depending on the number of specimens received. ...|$|E
