5000|$|In {{the right}} image, the top gauge is a thread gauge that is screwed into the part to be tested, the [...] "GO" [...] end should fully enter the part; the [...] "NOT GO" [...] end should not. The lower {{image is a}} <b>plain</b> <b>plug</b> gauge used to check {{the size of a}} hole; the green end is the go, and the red end is the no-go. The {{tolerance}} of the part that this gauge checks is 0.30 mm, where the lower size of the hole is 12.60 mm and the upper size is 12.90 mm, every size outside this range is out of tolerance. This may be initially expressed on the parts drawing in a number of styles; three possibilities may be ...|$|E
5000|$|Johnson strung his guitars {{with pure}} nickel strings, (instead of just nickel-plated, and {{probably}} used GHS brand strings, which he now endorses) {{and played with}} small thick picks, preferably his also now endorsed Dunlop Jazz III nylon picks. Johnson used a 100w Marshall tube amplifier with EL34 power tubes (he liked the German brand Siemens made by RFT), with a 4x12 cabinet wired in vintage style series-parallel 8-ohm total load (vs 16-ohm total load stock). Four x 8-ohm speakers instead of four x 16-ohm speakers like original wired cabs. Very late 1970s or early 1980s G1280 80-watt speakers at the time, similar to modern-day [...] "Lead 80" [...] speakers although a bit different. Speaker wires soldered to the speaker terminals, not the connector type plugs. He also prefers unplated <b>plain</b> brass <b>plugs</b> on his guitar cables preferably the Bill Lawrence, or second choice unplated plain Brass George L's in his lead tone signal. He prefers their warmer tone vs. nickel, chrome or gold-plated, although he likes the brighter nickel-plated plugs in his clean rhythm signal chain. His vintage Strats are also mildly modded to have the tone control wired to the bridge instead of the middle Pickup and usually leaves the back plastic plate off the back. This helps with changing the strings faster, is able to bang on the springs and create feed back, and [...] "sounds better that way" [...] probably because of less damping from the plastic, for a more open tone. He also doesn't like to run the G and B strings through the string tree, so wraps them in a carefully locking way around the tuners, and wraps {{them all the way}} down on those strings to correct the angle. It gives better tuning for less friction, and different tonality. Early 1950s to early and mid-1960s Strats were wired with a [...] "phonebook" [...] style [...]1uf (micro-farad) capacitor instead of the more common and modern [...]022uf, and [...]047uf. The older [...]1uf can roll off more highs, and is slightly warmer than a modern Strat wired with modern components.|$|R
