Planet gears are held symmetrically about the sun gear by a <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> and are in mesh with both the sun gear and a ring gear. Two unidirectional clutches restrict rotation of the first <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> <b>carrier</b> and ring gear to one direction.

40|$|Comparing with {{fixed shaft}} gearbox, {{vibration}} properties {{of planetary gearbox}} are much more complicated. In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources as several pairs of sun-planet gears and several pairs of ring-planet gears mesh simultaneously. In addition, the signal transmission path changes due to {{the rotation of the}} carrier. To facilitate fault detection of a planetary gearbox and avoid catastrophic consequences caused by gear failures, it is essential to understand the vibration properties of a planetary gearbox. This paper aims to simulate vibration signals and investigate vibration properties of a planetary gear set when there is a cracked tooth in a <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> Displacement signals of the sun <b>gear</b> and the <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> and resultant acceleration signals of the whole planetary gear set will be simulated and investigated.

40|$|Planetary gears suffer {{easily from}} the effects of various errors in {{comparison}} with an ordinary gear train because each gear in the planetary gears meshes with multiple gears. Then an unbalanced force in the planetary gears, due to the influence of various errors in each gear, leads to an increase in vibration and noise and a decline in efficiency. In previous studies, it was possible to clarify experimentally that the effects of the amplitude and direction of runout errors of <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> and dividing error in the circumferential direction of the holes for <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> shaft on <b>carrier</b> caused unbalanced force on the solar type planetary gears.

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque {{is applied to the}} input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> to orbit around the sun <b>gear.</b> The <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> orbit around the sun <b>gear,</b> the <b>carrier</b> and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.|$|R
40|$|Conventional accelerometers {{installed}} on housing often give out less accurate diagnostic results for planetary gearbox because the mesh excitation of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> change with <b>carrier</b> movement. Recent significant advancements in low-power and low-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technologies {{make it possible}} and easier to mount MEMS accelerometers directly on the rotating shaft, enabling more accurate dynamic characteristics of the rotating machine to be acquired and used for condition monitoring. In this paper, two tiny MEMS accelerometers are installed diametrically opposite {{each other on the}} lowspeed input shaft of a planetary gearbox to measure the acceleration signals. The acceleration signals sensed by each MEMS will contain both the tangential acceleration and gravitational acceleration, but the latter can be removed by summing the acceleration signals from both sensors in order to characterise the rotor dynamics precisely. The experimental results show that the tangential acceleration measured on the low-speed input shaft of a planetary gearbox can clearly indicate faults, thus providing a reliable and lowcost method for planetary gearbox condition monitoring...|$|R

30|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox typically consists of some key components: a sun <b>gear,</b> <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> ring <b>gear,</b> <b>carrier,</b> and bearing, and faults may occur in these components owing to fatigue or tough working conditions. According to a condition-monitoring report on wind turbines, a gearbox failure {{is the leading}} contributor to all wind turbine failures [3]. A vibration-based method was proven {{to be one of}} the most popular techniques in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, and it has been determined that certain changes to the vibration signals can be seen when a fault occurs, e.g., crack or spalling [4 – 6]. The commonly used vibration signal processing methods can be divided into three categories: time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time–frequency domain methods. Time domain methods refer to the analysis of a signal with respect to time, and are relatively easy and direct compared to both frequency and time–frequency domain methods. Statistical indicators, the time synchronous averaging (TSA) method, and an autoregressive (AR) model are typically used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery [4, 7 – 9]. Frequency domain methods refer to an analysis of the signals with respect to the frequency, and a periodic signal in the time domain can be converted into a frequency component through a Fourier transformation. In this way, researchers can identify the difference between the spectrum of a normal vibration signal and a fault vibration signal with commonly used methods that include a spectrum-based analysis, resonance demodulation technique, and cepstrum analysis [10 – 12]. In contrast, time–frequency domain methods are used to study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, allowing both the constituent frequency components and their time variation features to be revealed and analyzed. Researchers have developed various time–frequency domain methods including a short-time Fourier transformation, Wigner–Ville distribution, continuous wavelet transform, and Hilbert-Huang transformation [13 – 16]. Although vibration-based methods have been successfully used in the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of rotating machinery, the appearance of faults in the analysis results has to be identified artificially, e.g., the identification of a fault characteristic frequency in the spectrum, the determination of a filter sub-band in a demodulation analysis, or the determination of a wavelet type, all of which require considerable of experience and expertise [17 – 19]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some intelligent techniques that can automatically determine the health conditions of a {{planetary gearbox}}.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} modal {{properties of}} double-helical planetary gear (DHPG) system with three-dimensional motion are investigated {{with a combined}} use of numerical and analytical approach in this paper. The lumped-parameter model of the DHPG consider-ing stiffness coupled between the left gear and the right gear is developed. Load-sharing with journal bearings is accepted in this planetary gear system, so that four stiffness coef-ficients {{can be applied to}} describe the dynamic behavior between the <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> and the <b>carrier.</b> The model has three planar degrees of freedom for the carrier and an added axial degree of freedom for all gears, considering the effect of axial dynamic forces. The vibration equations are obtained according to Lagrange equation. A modal type distribu-tion map is plotted initially to simplify modal classification. With the application of this modal type distribution map, all vibration modes are categorized distinctly into three essentially different types of modes including planet mode (PM), rotational-axial mode (RAM), and planer-translational mode (PTM). Unique characteristics of these vibration modes, such as, eigenvalue number, multiplicity of natural frequencies and deflection relations, are deduced and proved analytically. For each type of vibration modes, the reduced-order eigenvalue problems are derived. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028788...|$|R

40|$|Although {{planetary}} gears {{used in an}} industrial region have load equalizing mechanisms in order to equalize distributed loads on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> each other, those mechanisms may be uneffective dynamically in some cases. In this report, the face bearing patterns, the load distributions on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> and the dynamic loads on a sun gear in some types of {{planetary gears}} have been measured by strain gages {{in order to obtain}} an easy method of improving the dynamic characteristics of planetary gears.
