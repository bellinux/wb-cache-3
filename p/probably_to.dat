5|$|On 29 April 1950, Charles {{dissolved}} parliament pending fresh elections. His {{intention was}} <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> prevent {{the formation of}} a PSC–CVP government under Van Zeeland, a staunch Leopoldist, which would lead to the return of the King without further discussion. The following election produced an absolute PSC–CVP majority in both Chamber and Senate, and a new single-party government under Jean Duvieusart was formed.|$|E
5|$|Rossini wrote a brief {{instrumental}} passage, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> {{establish the}} key of C major and the mood for the following Sanctus. The Ritornello and the Sanctus which follows are in effect in the same key of C major (both in 6/8).|$|E

Commissioned in September 1963, Terry Nation had {{intended}} {{for his second}} seven-part serial to be set during the British Raj in India (<b>probably</b> <b>to</b> have been the eighth serial), but the story was ultimately abandoned as the Daleks became a success, and demand for further science fiction adventures grew.|$|E

In particular, the increase of the nasopharyngeal space was <b>probably</b> related <b>to</b> growth, and the increase of the oro- and laryngopharyngeal dimensions was <b>probably</b> related <b>to</b> the forward shift of the mandible.|$|R
5|$|As the Muslim {{forces were}} {{geographically}} divided, Heraclius sought to exploit this situation {{and planned to}} attack. He {{did not wish to}} engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> tie down Yazid's forces which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige {{expanded}} and embellished York Minster and other churches in his archdiocese, {{and built the}} tower at Beverley, as well as giving books and other items to the church there. He consecrated Herewald as Bishop of Llandaff at a council held at London in 1056, although this information is only attested in the Book of Llandaff, a sometimes unreliable source. In 1059 he, along with Earl Tostig and Æthelwine Bishop of Durham, escorted King Malcolm III of Scotland to King Edward's court at Gloucester when Malcolm came south, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> thank Edward for his help in restoring Malcolm to the Scottish throne, and perhaps to acknowledge the English king as Malcolm's lord.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{reformed}} {{the provincial}} administration, establishing a three-tiered provincial hierarchy, {{in place of}} the previous single-tier structure. The original 42 provinces of the Principate were almost tripled in number to c. 120. These were grouped into 12 divisions called dioceses, each under a vicarius, in turn grouped into 4 praetorian prefectures, to correspond to the areas of command assigned to the four Tetrarchs, who were each assisted by a chief-of-staff called a praefectus praetorio (not be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian Guard, who held the same title). The aim of this fragmentation of provincial administration was <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> reduce the possibility of military rebellion by governors (by reducing the forces they each controlled).|$|E

5|$|During the 17th century, {{the ground}} floor of the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was dug up, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> reuse for surfacing roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and this part of the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the mall}} {{underwent}} some cosmetic renovation and was renamed from simply The Mall to University Mall, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> diversify {{it from the}} new McCain Mall Simon was planning for North Little Rock. The mall's reopening was held in March of that year. News accounts say that special {{emphasis was placed on}} a security program. University Mall drew thousands of shoppers yearly and was known for its holiday displays and programs. It also became a favorite place for many walkers, including retirees and heart patients from St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center, located just across University Avenue.|$|E
5|$|It passed {{onto his}} younger brother, George, who entertained Queen Anne and Prince Henry there in 1603, and onto George's grandson, Henry, who hosted James I three times between 1612 and 1617, and Charles I in 1634. The gardens were redeveloped, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> provide a {{suitable}} venue for these royal visits. By now, however, {{several generations of}} excessive expenditure meant that the family estates had been much diminished, and the family was having trouble maintaining their lavish lifestyle and former prominence in the region.|$|E

5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Quamby {{house was}} built for Sir Richard Dry in 1838, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. It was built mostly by convict labour, using locally made clay bricks, in an American Colonial style, a single storey with a stone-flagged long veranda. The {{original}} estate was broken up {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Quamby was opened for tourism, by Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett on 4 October 2009. It is operated as the Quamby Golf and Country Club, and has a par 38 9-hole golf course that dates from the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{rebuilt the}} walls and the gatehouses at Launceston, {{building}} a high tower to increase the height of the keep, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> allow guests to enjoy the view of his deer park. The bailey was cleared of its older buildings and a new great hall was constructed in the south-west corner. The castle's inhabitants ate well, enjoying a wide range of food including prime cuts of venison brought into the castle, probably mostly from the larger deer parks belonging to the earldom across the region.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{family of}} de Vaux {{originated}} in Rouen, northern France, {{and settled in}} England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux brothers, or cousins, were {{among a number of}} Anglo-Norman knights invited to Scotland, and granted land, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, at that time part of Scotland, while John de Vaux was granted the barony of Dirleton. John built a castle at Eldbotle, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> the north-west of modern Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, although neither survives.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{strategy}} for 480 BC was <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force. The cities in any territory {{that the army}} passed through {{would be forced to}} submit or risk destruction; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced. Conversely, the Allied strategy was <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible. Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less. The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly. After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis. The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat. At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant. Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>probably</b> {{closely related}} <b>to</b> {{and looks like}} a small version of the orange-breasted falcon. These two, in turn, are <b>probably</b> closest <b>to</b> the aplomado falcon and {{constitute}} a rather old American lineage of Falco species.|$|R
5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> a {{combination}} of various organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, phenolic compounds and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps. Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study. Porcini were thought to have anti-cancer properties according to Hungarian research conducted in the 1950s, but later investigations in the United States did not support this.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat posed by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was <b>probably</b> <b>to</b> act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
