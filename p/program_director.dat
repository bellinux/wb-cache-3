40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that the Internet {{could be used to}} disseminate and evaluate a curriculum in ambulatory care, and that internal medicine residency <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> would value features made possible by online dissemination. An Internet-based ambulatory care curriculum was developed and marketed to internal medicine residency <b>program</b> <b>directors.</b> Utilization and knowledge outcomes were tracked by the website; opinions of <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> were measured by paper surveys. Twenty-four programs enrolled with the online curriculum. The curriculum was rated favorably by all programs, test scores on curricular content improved significantly, and <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> rated highly features made possible by an Internet-based curriculum...|$|R
50|$|As {{the medium}} of {{television}} grew up, <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> at local U.S. television stations felt {{a need for a}} program specific forum to discuss and resolve the challenges faced {{as a result of the}} Prime Time Access Rule, which gave responsibility for programming between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. to local stations and <b>program</b> <b>directors.</b> Encouraged by syndicated programming salesmen, 64 <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> (NATPE’s charter members) named Stan Cohen of WDSU New Orleans temporary president and set about organizing a meeting.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and assess the stressors and coping mechanisms related to job performance as perceived by directors of adult literacy education programs in Texas. This research also attempted to determine whether there were relationships between: specific demographic variables and job related stressors; and those same demographic variables and coping mechanisms of adult literacy education program administrators in Texas. A survey instrument was sent to all adult literacy education <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> in Texas in June, 2002. Demographic information, as well as information regarding types of stressors, and coping strategies used by those <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> was collected and analyzed. Major findings for the study indicated: 1. A majority of adult literacy education <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> in Texas experienced a significant level of occupational stress and a high overall general stress level. 2. The top stressors identified by the <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> were: Data Collection/Analysis, Statewide Accountability System, Development/ Maintenance of School Budget, Funding Related Issues, Student Achievement, Technology Related Issues, Administration of Programs for Special Students, Selection of Faculty and Staff, Dealing with Unsatisfactory Performance by Professional Staff, Dismissal of a Teacher or Staff Member. 3. The major stress-coping mechanisms employed by the <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> were Planning ahead for stressful events and Communication with significant others or peers. 4. <b>Program</b> <b>directors</b> with greater adult education experience have a lower level of occupational stress compared to less experienced <b>program</b> <b>directors.</b> Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations are made: 1. To address the sources of stress related to data collection, statewide accountability, and program budgets, training should be made available for administrators to improve their understanding and competencies to handle these demands. 2. Implementation of a system or network in which <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> could share problems, insights, and help one another address problems similar to what they may encounter in their jobs would strengthen the whole adult literacy education system in Texas. 3. Communication and leadership in long range planning is necessary from the state office to assist <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> in planning ahead for stressful events...|$|R

5|$|Based on his {{industry}} {{experience on}} Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers {{could be found}} among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program, as OMSF program controller. Phillips' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along {{with a staff of}} officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo <b>Program</b> <b>Director.</b> Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd never make it in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the <b>program</b> <b>director</b> at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
40|$|Objective. Our {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} radiology fellowship directors' and recent fellows' experiences and perceptions {{with regard to the}} fellowship application and selection process and to compare these experiences and perceptions. Materials and Methods. Institutional review board approval was obtained. We conducted an online survey of the memberships of three radiology subspecialty societies between October 2009 and December 2009 to learn about radiologists' views regarding various aspects of radiology fellowships. Results. In the process of selecting fellows, <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> and recent fellows consider performance during the radiology residency and the quality or prestige of the residency program as the most important objective factors, and the personal interview, letters of recommendation, and personality as the most important subjective factors. 25 % of the <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> were in the match, and 41 % of the recent fellows were in the match. Most (48 %) of <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> favored a match, but most (56 %) of the recent fellows disfavored participating in a match. Both <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> and recent fellows expressed satisfaction with the fellowship application and selection process. Conclusion. There was no majority support for a fellowship match among <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> and recent fellows and less support among recent fellows. Recent fellows appear more satisfied with the current selection and application process than <b>program</b> <b>directors...</b>|$|R
