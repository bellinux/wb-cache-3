40|$|The {{transfer}} {{efficiency of}} small droplets in spray painting {{is influenced by}} local turbulence characteristics, which can be passively controlled by using nozzles of Indeterminate Origin (IO). To achieve {{better understanding of the}} physics underlying the IO <b>nozzle</b> <b>jet,</b> an experimental investigation in a large-scale water jet was performed using Planner Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques. ^ Flow visualizations show that IO nozzles introduce streamwise vortex pairs into the jet shear layer. 2 ̆ 2 Incursion 2 ̆ 2 streamwise vortex pairs are generated at the 10 nozzle valley locations as each braid region is shed from the nozzle, i. e. they are formed periodically during the K-H shedding processes. They reorganize to form 2 ̆ 2 excursion 2 ̆ 2 streamwise-vortex pairs at the peak locations. Streamwise vortices greatly influence the evolution of the IO <b>nozzle</b> <b>jet.</b> Interaction between streamwise and spanwise vortices promotes earlier turbulence transition. ^ Due to 2 ̆ 2 excursion 2 ̆ 2 streamwise vortex pairs, IO <b>nozzle</b> <b>jets</b> have higher spreading rates in the peak plane at near-nozzle region, but the differences vanish when the jets propagate downstream. Streamwise vortices introduce radial shear flow into the jet, which facilitates extra turbulence production and enhances mixing between the jet and ambient fluids. These vortices also dissipate TKE in the near-nozzle region, so that the turbulence intensity and Reynolds stresses are lower compared to the conventional round <b>nozzle</b> <b>jet</b> downstream of x/D 3 ̆e 7. ^ Although IO nozzles greatly influence the jet at the near-nozzle region, the influence fades as the jet propagates downstream.

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and electrodiffusion techniques were used to investigate the characteristics of three impinging jets. Two cruciform jets, one issuing from a plane orifice nozzle (CO/P) and the second from a hemispherical orifice nozzle (CO/H), were compared to a reference round jet issuing from a convergent nozzle. The distance between the jet exit and the target wall is equal to 2 nozzle equivalent diameters (De). The Reynolds number based on De and on the exit bulk-velocity was equal to 5290 in each flow.
