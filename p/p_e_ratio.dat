40|$|We {{measure a}} country’s growth {{opportunities}} by investigating how its industry mix is priced in global capital markets, using price earnings ratios of global industry portfolios. First, {{we find that}} these exogenous growth opportunities strongly predict future changes in real GDP and investment in a large panel of countries. This relation is strongest in countries that have liberalized their capital accounts, equity markets, and banking systems. Second, we re-examine the link between financial development, investor protection, capital allocation, and growth. We find that financial development and investor protection measures are much less important in aligning growth opportunities with growth than is capital market openness. Third, we formulate new tests of market integration and segmentation. Under integration, {{the difference between a}} country’s local <b>P</b> <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> and its global counterpart should not predict relative growth, but the difference between its exogenous global <b>P</b> <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> and the world market <b>P</b> <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> should predict relative growth...|$|E
40|$|A late Holocene record, {{based on}} diatom and stable carbon {{isotopes}} from Lake Tizong, northern Cameroon, provides {{a history of}} environmental changes over the last 4100 years. Several coarser sediment layers among which the two younger ones are of pyroclastic origin interrupt the fine clayey sediment of the core. The detailed chronology of the core supported by 24 radiocarbon C- 14 dates and proxies data results revealed an erosive phase registered in the sedimentary column from 2200 to 1500 cal BP. The diatom ecological groups suggest that between 4100 and 2800 cal yrs BP, the lake level was much higher than after corresponding to a relatively greater precipitation minus evaporation (<b>P</b> <b>E)</b> <b>ratio,</b> as well as increased runoff in the lake catchment. These conditions were favourable {{to the development of}} C 3 plants in the lake catchment as indicated by lower delta C- 13 values and higher C/N ratios than after. This hydrological phase is also characterized by eutrophic, turbid and probably circum-neutral to alkaline waters. After this episode, higher delta C- 13 values between 2800 and 2500 cal BP suggest increased water use efficiency of terrestrial plants and/or potentially more C 4 plant debris input into the lake: an indication of savannas patches developing, due probably to changes in the rainfall distribution. Marked lake-level declines are recorded at 2500, 2200 - 2100, and at 1400 - 1000 cal yrs BP. These low-stands are characterized by higher inputs of windblown diatoms (up to 4. 2 %) than before, which confirms that the NE trade-winds were strengthening. This corresponds primarily to a reduction in the <b>P</b> <b>E</b> <b>ratio,</b> but probably also to greater inter-annual or seasonal variability when drier periods or seasons became more prolonged and intense than previously. Consequently, savannas were maintained as suggested by relatively higher than before delta C- 13 values, as well as independently supported by regional pollen data. After 1000 cal BP, the lake-level rose towards sub-modern conditions, with a deep neutral and eutrophic water column. Carbon stable isotopes suggest a reduction of organic matter input, while savannas were maintained despite the return to more humid conditions. The trends of climatic changes observed in the Lake Tizong reveal the variability in timing, magnitude and regional extent of known climatic events...|$|E

This {{was the first}} experiment {{in the world to}} measure a polarization transfer in the e &ar;,e ′ p &ar; reaction on a complex nucleus (A > 2), as well as the first experiment with polarized beam at JLab. For a free proton target the ratio of polarization transfer quantities P ′ L /P ′ T provides a means of measuring the ratio G p M /G p E of the proton's form factors that is insensitive to many systematic errors common to other experiments. This sensitivity to the G p M /G <b>p</b> <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> is also retained for nuclear targets. Measurements were made using a waterfall target at Q 2 = 0. 8 (GeV/c) 2 in quasi-perpendicular kinematics with four settings for the outgoing proton's recoil momentum.

40|$|Headcount {{measures}} of poverty {{are by far}} the most common tools for evaluating poverty and gauging progress in global development goals. The headcount ratio, or the prevalence of poverty, and the headcount, or the number of the poor, both convey tangible information about poverty. But both ignore the depth of poverty, so they arguably present distorted views of the spatial distribution of poverty as well as the extent of progress against poverty over time. Additionally, headcount measures can provide incentives for policymakers and NGOs to focus their efforts on the least poor, an observation well understood among policymakers themselves. While other poverty measures mitigate these problems by capturing the intensity as well as the prevalence of poverty, they are often not central to policy discourse because they are perceived to be too "unintuitive" to have traction. There is a need for poverty measures that go beyond traditional headcount measures, but retain their direct interpretation. This paper presents person equivalent (<b>p.</b> <b>e.)</b> headcount measures, which do just that. Our approach draws on the logic of full 2 ̆ 010 time equivalent jobs, adult equivalent incomes, and other constructs in economics. An initial period is used to calibrate the average depth of poverty among the poor, which then becomes the "person equivalent" underlying the <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> headcount and the <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> headcount <b>ratio.</b> We illustrate our methods using 1. 25 a day poverty data from 78 countries as provided by the World Bank, and show how the new measures map out different pictures of poverty and progress than traditional headcount measures. Overall, the picture is one of a more rapid decline in global poverty, but with significant redistributions of its burden across regions and countries. For example, <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> headcounts are much higher than traditional headcounts in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub Saharan Africa; in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific the reverse is true. In Kenya the traditional headcount rose by 8 million and the <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> headcount rose by 11 million; in South Africa the <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> headcount fell by more than the traditional headcount. We discuss properties of the new measures, outline some generalizations and conclude with recommendations for using this approach in development goals to track progress and direct policy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{partitioning}} of a micelle-forming octyl phenol ethoxylate surfactant (Triton X- 100) between {{water and}} sunflower oil was investigated and quantified as partition coefficient <b>P,</b> i. <b>e.</b> the <b>ratio</b> of total surfactant concentrations (molecules dissolved and in micelles) {{in oil and}} water. Values of P were determined over 5 decades of the concentration in the aqueous phase. Below the critical micelle concentration (cmc), P = 2. 0 {{was found to be}} independent of concentra-tion over a range of more than two decades. When adding surfactant to an oil-water two-phase system at or beyond the cmc, all extra surfactant accumulates in the water phase, and the value of P reduces accordingly. Arguments are given why emulsification leads to an O/W emulsion while Bancroft’s rule as based on the molecular preference of the surfactant for oil (P = 2. 0), would suggest the opposite. Bancroft’s rule should be taken in its original form, taken into account all oil in both phases...|$|R

40|$|Background: The 12 -lead surface {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is {{a useful}} tool to predict both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias via P-wave and QT measurements and its derivatives. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with cardiovascular events. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess ECG findings of patients with PV. Method and materials: Sixty patients with PV (34 male, mean age 58 &# 177; 11 years) and 60 age and gender-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled into the study. From the 12 -lead surface ECG, P-wave and both conventional QT measurements and transmyocardial repolarization parameters (T peak -T end interval (T <b>p</b> -T <b>e)</b> and derivatives) were evaluated digitally by two experienced cardiologists. In addition, a novel parameter, Pi was calculated digitally as the standard deviation of the P-wave duration across the 12 ECG leads. Results: QT duration and corrected QT interval were significantly longer in the PV group compared to healthy controls (p&# 60; 0. 01 and p&# 60; 0. 01, respectively). The T <b>p</b> -T <b>e</b> was longer and the T <b>p</b> -T <b>e</b> /QT <b>ratio</b> was significantly higher in the PV group compared to the controls. P-wave analyses showed that all P-wave parameters including Pmax, Pmin, P dispersion, and Pi were significantly prolonged in PV patients compared to the controls. The increase of both T <b>p</b> -T <b>e</b> and <b>P</b> max in the PV group was independent of age, BMI, diabetes and hypertension, gender, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, hematocrit, left atrial dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and early deceleration time in a univariate analysis of co-variance model (F= 11. 097, p= 0. 001 and F= 31. 537, p= 0. 0001, respectively). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that PV may be associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities of both atrium and ventricle. </p...|$|R

Self Determination Theory {{was used as}} a guiding theory and Template Analysis was used to analyse the data. Setting: A secondary school in the North East of England. Participants: 14 pupils (aged 13 and 14, boys and girls) with a range of self-perceived competencies regarding <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> and 4 <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> teachers of the pupils (3 male, 1 female). Primary and secondary outcomes: (1) Attitudes and perceptions of <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> pupils regarding their {{experiences of}} compulsory school <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> lessons. (2) <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> teachers experiences of teaching <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> Results: Key results from pupils and teachers suggest pupils enjoy participation in <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> when they feel competent, in control and supported by others. Feeling competent depended on i) the activity within <b>P.</b> <b>E.</b> and ii) the pupils perceived physical capabilities/aptitude. Feeling in control related to i) having a choice of activities, ii) being able to set exertion levels and iii) control over clothes worn whilst taking part. Relationships within pupil groups and between pupils and teachers were perceived as important. Teachers could positively influence their pupils’ enjoyment by understanding and supporting their personal goals, as opposed to dictating and controlling what they did and for how long, and by promoting a non-threatening atmosphere between pupils.

Under these conditions, {{the first signs}} of cytopathic effect (c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.)</b> appeared at about 30 h post-infection and cell lysis occurred after 40 h. Before the onset of cytopathic changes, the virus induced inhibition of host cell protein, DNA and RNA (primarily rRNA) synthesis. These were designated c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) virus stocks. The effect of virus on host cell macromolecular synthesis and development of c. <b>p.</b> <b>e,</b> were not related to the virus isolate, but to the conditions under which the virus was produced. Thus, from a single virus clone, working stocks were derived which could or could not induce inhibition of host cell functions and c. <b>p.</b> <b>e,</b> development. The virus stocks that did not induce inhibition are defined as c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-). Analysis of [3 H]leucine-labelled proteins from Vero cells infected with either the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) or the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-) virus stocks revealed synthesis of two virusspecific polypeptides migrating with mobilities corresponding to mol. wt. 68000 and 79000.

In cells infected with the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) virus stock, the virusspecific polypeptides were synthesized at times when there was a drastic inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The yield of infectious progeny during the first 24 h of infection is similar in Vero cells infected with either the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) or the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-) virus stocks. The proportion of defective interfering particles was much higher in the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (-) than in the c. <b>p.</b> <b>e.</b> (+) virus stocks.

40|$|Background: It is well {{documented}} that pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) improves oxygenation and ventilation compared to volume-controlled ventilation and reduces peak airway pressure in gynecological laparoscopy. PCV with moderately inversed inspiratory-expiratory (I: <b>E)</b> <b>ratio</b> can successfully recruit collapsed alveoli and has been proved to be beneficial in intensive care. We tested the hypothesis that altering the I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> to 1. 5 : 1 in PCV improves ventilation during gynecological laparoscopy using laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Objective: To study pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (PCIRV) with I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> 1. 5 : 1 as against PCV with I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 : 2 in gynecological laparoscopy with LMA using noninvasive parameters. Materials and Methods: Intraoperative hemodynamics and side-stream spirometry recordings were noted in 20 consecutive patients undergoing major gynecological laparoscopy with LMA. Flexible LMA or LMA supreme were used depending on normal body mass index (BMI) or high BMI, respectively. Results: Reversing the I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> to 1. 5 : 1 increased the tidal volume, mean airway pressures, and dynamic lung compliance significantly, all indicating better oxygenation at comparable peak airway pressures as against PCV with I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 : 2. There was {{no change in the}} end-tidal carbon dioxide. There was no auto-positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or change in the hemodynamics. Conclusion: Reversal of I: <b>E</b> <b>ratio</b> with PCV can be beneficially used with LMA in laparoscopy...|$|R

40|$|The protein {{composition}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) in serum was analyzed for 63 viremic {{patients with chronic}} HBV and found to consist of polypeptides with molecular masses of 16, 18, and 20 kDa (<b>P</b> 16 <b>e,</b> <b>P</b> 18 <b>e,</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e,</b> respectively). Several experiments demonstrated their viral nature and HBeAg specificity and that <b>P</b> 16 <b>e</b> occurs either in free soluble form or as aggregates or immunocomplexes, while <b>P</b> 18 <b>e</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e</b> occur essentially as immunocomplexes. Of 63 patients, 45 (71 %) had <b>P</b> 16 <b>e,</b> <b>P</b> 18 <b>e,</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e,</b> and the remaining 18 (29 %) had only <b>P</b> 16 <b>e.</b> During {{the natural history of}} the disease, spontaneous clearance of HBV DNA and HBeAg took place only in six of nine (67 %) patients with the three HBe polypeptides but in none of the five patients having <b>P</b> 16 <b>e</b> alone (<b>P</b> less than 0. 05). Similarly, 22 of 23 (96 %) patients responding to interferon therapy had <b>P</b> 16 <b>e,</b> <b>P</b> 18 <b>e,</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e,</b> but these polypeptides occurred in only 14 of 26 (54 %) nonresponder patients (P less than 0. 001). Following the loss of HBV DNA and HBeAg, before the development of anti-HBe, the only HBe species detected were <b>P</b> 18 <b>e</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e,</b> but these became no longer detectable after complete normalization of liver function tests. Therefore, persistence of <b>P</b> 16 <b>e</b> represents a failure to recover from HBV, and the appearance of HBe polypeptides <b>P</b> 18 <b>e</b> and <b>P</b> 20 <b>e</b> is associated with virus clearance and a favorable outcome of the disease...|$|R

Esses táxons se distribuem desde o extremo leste Colombiano, passando pela Venezuela, Guianas e até o nordeste brasileiro, e são caracterizados pelo dorso de plumagem esverdeada, ventre esbranquiçado ou amarelado, e barrado ou maculado de negro; os machos apresentam a fronte vermelha e/ou alaranjada. O presente trabalho tem como objetivo revisar a taxonomia desse complexo através da análise de caracteres de plumagem e morfométricos. Foram estudados 495 espécimes, depositados nas principais coleções ornitológicas. Foram determinados 18 caracteres de plumagem, 12 dos quais mostraram-se informativos, além de caracteres morfométricos. O estudo dos caracteres relacionados à plumagem aponta para a existência de cinco táxons. Picumnus exilis (Lichtenstein, 1823), que ocorre próximo ao litoral da Bahia e de Sergipe. Picumnus pernambucensis Zimmer, 1947 ocorre ao norte do rio São Francisco (AL, PE e PB). Picumnus buffonii Lafresnaye, 1845 ocorre no escudo guianense, ao leste do rio Branco e também ao sul do rio Amazonas, a leste do rio Tocantins (PA e MA). Picumnus undulatus Hargitt, 1889 é encontrado entre os rios Branco, Negro e Orinoco, enquanto Picumnus obsoletus Allen, 1892, ocorre em baixas altitudes desde o delta do Orinoco até o extremo nordeste venezuelano (Delta Amacuro, Monagas e Sucre). As subespécies <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> alegriae Hellmayr, 1929, <b>e</b> <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> clarus Zimmer & Phelps, 1946, foram sinonimizados, respectivamente, à <b>P.</b> buffonii <b>e</b> <b>P.</b> undulatus. Tanto <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> salvini Hargitt, 1893, como P. nigropunctatus Zimmer & Phelps, 1950, foram considerados sinônimos juniores de Picumnus obsoletus Allen, 1892. Similaridades entre as espécies aqui determinadas e outros Picumnus apontam para um parafiletismo do complexo P. exilis da maneira como tratado pela literatura. Em adição, os resultados demonstram a necessidade de uma revisão taxonômica e filogenética que englobe todo o gênero Picumnus. The Picumnus exilis {{complex is}} composed by six subspecies: <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> exilis, <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> pernambucensis, <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> alegriae, <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> buffonii, <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> undulates and <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> clarus; or seven if one considers <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> salvini {{as a senior}} synonym of P. nigropunctatus. These taxa are found from easternmost Colombia and through Venezuela and Guianas, and north towards northeastern Brazil. They are characterized by a greenish back, whitish or yellowish belly (barred or tainted with black); males exhibit red and/or orange forehead. This work aims to review the taxonomy of this complex {{on the basis of}} morphometric and plumage characters analyses. I analyzed 495 specimens housed in the main ornithological collections. A total of 18 plumage characters were found, 12 of them proved to be informative. The results suggested the existence of five taxa. Picumnus exilis (Lichtenstein, 1823), which occurs near the coasts of Bahia and Sergipe. Picumnus pernambucensis Zimmer, 1947, found north of the São Francisco River (Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraiba). Picumnus buffonii Lafresnay, 1845 occurs in the Guyana Shield, East of the Branco River and South of the Amazonas River to the East of the Tocantins River (Pará and Maranhão). Picumnus undulates Hargitt, 1889 is found between the Branco, Negro and Orinoco Rivers. The fifth taxon is Picumnus obsoletus Allen, 1892, which occurs at low altitutes and ranges from the Orinoco Delta north to far northeast Venezuela (Delta Amacuro, Monagas and Sucre). The subspecies <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> alegriae Hellmayr, 1929, and <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> clarus Zimmer & Phelps, 1946 have been synonymized with P. buffonii and P. undulates, respectively. Furthermore, both <b>P.</b> <b>e.</b> salvini Hargitt, 1893, and P. nigropunctatus Zimmer & Phelps, 1950, proved to be junior synonyms of Picumnus obsoletus Allen, 1892. Similarities between these species and other Picumnus point out to a paraphyletic P. exilis complex.
