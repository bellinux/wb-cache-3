Almost all small and majority of medium farms apply harvesting by use of <b>picker-husker.</b> First after natural drying and threshing of grains, maize cobs are residual biomass available for energy use. Modern farmers need more comfort and advanced heating facilities, e. g. boilers with automatic feeding. The objective was to develop processor for maize cobs crushing. The cobs should be so sized to enable feeding by use of charging screw, commonly used for wood chips. This will enable, after adjustment of combustion technique, use of serial produced boilers and feeding equipment. The following prerequisites have been set up: the processor has to be low-cost type, and produced granulation should fulfil demands similar to these defined for wood chips used as a fuel. Using previous experience with similar material the prototype based on cylinder with spirally positioned knives, stationary comb type knife counter and under-sieve has been selected and designed. The effects of stationary knifes, RPM of cylinder, different under-sieve openings and distance of sieves to rotated knife trajectory has been tested, and crushed maize cobs analyzed. The results showed that this processor can be successfully used for crushing of maize cobs for it use as fuel in boilers with crew conveyor, commonly used for wood chips. The fuel flow, due to lower density of crushed maize cobs, should have about 1. 5 times bigger volume. The capacity of processor overcomes need of one user. It can supply enough fuel for four to five consumers...|$|E
40|$|Seed corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops due to its high economical value. For this reason harvesting operation should be done precisely. Losses in harvesting seed corn are inevitable but can be decreased to the acceptable level. There are several machinery factors such as cylinder and travel speed which can affect total harvesting losses in two stage harvesting method (with <b>picker-husker</b> and sheller). For this purpose this study evaluated the amount of losses in different speed levels (3, 4 and 5 km h- 1) and cylinder speed (400, 500 and 600 rpm) and investigated the relationship between the specified factors (independent variables) and machinery losses (dependent variable). All types of machinery losses were measured and summed as total losses from a representative seed corn field. In order to find the relationship between the variables several models (linear, 2 FI, quadratic and cubic) were tested. All analyses were done by applying the response surface methodology based on two variables, three levels and central composite design (CCD). Based on the results of this study, the relationship between cylinder and travel speed was analyzed and the corresponding model was designed. The results recommended that the 2 FI model as the highest order model with significant term can describe the harvesting losses in relationship between cylinder and travel speed. The coefficient of determination (R 2), the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated as 0. 90, 0. 89 and 3. 69 %, respectively and the response surface results showed that an increase of travel and cylinder speed would lead to an increase of harvesting losses. It was denoted that the travel speed have more impact on harvesting losses in comparison with cylinder speed. The optimization study showed the least harvesting losses of 209. 88 kg ha- 1 in cylinder and travel speed of 600 rpm and 3 km h- 1, respectively. It was concluded that the increase of travel and cylinder speed resulted in the increase of harvesting losses where the highest losses score was occurred in 5 km h- 1 and 600 rpm, respectively...|$|E
