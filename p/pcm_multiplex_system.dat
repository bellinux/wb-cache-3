40|$|A {{process and}} a system for {{encoding}} and decoding an analog VF signal in PCM format, in particular for the transmission of voice information in a one-way or intercom loudspeaker system. The VF signal is converted into a digital signal by A/D conversion, where each sampling value corresponds to an 8 -bit data word. Each data word is transmitted over the <b>PCM</b> <b>multiplex</b> line in a time-slot of a PCM frame. On receipt, the data words are decoded into an analog signal by D/A conversion. To transmit voice signals having a bandwidth between 7 and 8 kHz, the sampling rate of the A/D-D/A converters is {{twice as fast as}} the PCM synchronization frequency and during transmission, every second data word is buffered after coding until the next data word is available and the consecutive data words are applied to the <b>PCM</b> <b>multiplex</b> line {{in such a way that}} they occupy two adjacent time-slots.

We model the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>system</b> as the fluid queueing system with the regulated input fluid traffic. Each traffic generated by an ON-OFF source (original traffic) is regulated by the leaky bucket and aggregated output traffic (regulated traffic) flows into the buffer of the multiplexer. Using the CDE approximat,ion method, which consists of the loss probability for the bufferless system and that for the system with the large buffer, we explicitly derive the approximated probability of the buffer overflow for the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>system.</b> Our result includes the two important parameters of the leaky bucket; the size of a token pool and the token generation rate.

40|$|SUMMARY MIMO spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>systems</b> are {{attracting}} {{a lot of}} attention because of their high spectral effiencies. Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) is known to be the optimal signal detection method for MIMO spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of bit error rate (BER). However, the main drawback of MLD is its high complexity. In this paper, to reduce the computational complexity of MLD and to attain good BER in MIMO spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>systems,</b> we propose the minimum mean square error (MMSE) -MLD that combines MMSE detection and MLD according to the estimated SINR from each transmit antenna. We also propose the ordered successive MMSE detection (OSD) -MLD that combines OSD and MLD according to the estimated SINR from the transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed MMSE-MLD and OSD-MLD can attain almost identical BER to that of MLD but with less complexity. key words: MIMO, MLD, SINR 1...|$|R

In this scheme, a portion of OFDM subcarriers (up to 50 %) is transmitted with its phase conjugates, which is used at the receiver to estimate the nonlinear distortions in the respective subcarriers and other subcarriers, which are not accompanied by PCPs. Simulation and experimental results show that by varying the PCP overhead, a performance improvement up to 4 dB can be achieved. In addition, the proposed technique can be effectively applied in both single polarization and polarization-division <b>multiplexed</b> <b>systems,</b> in both single channel and wavelength-division <b>multiplexing</b> <b>systems,</b> thus, offering highest flexibility in implementations...|$|R
