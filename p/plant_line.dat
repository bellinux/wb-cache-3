40|$|Background and aims: Festuca rubra {{plants are}} asymptomatically {{infected}} by the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae and high infection {{rates have been}} found in natural grasslands. Our objective was to determine the effect of endophyte infection on the competitive ability of Festuca rubra in binary mixtures against other grassland species. Methods: In two glasshouse experiments, endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) plants of two half-sib lines (PEN, RAB) of Festuca rubra were grown in monocultures and in binary mixtures against five grassland species: Trifolium repens, Trifolium pratense, Trifolium subterraneum, Lotus corniculatus and Plantago lanceolata. Results: Biomass production of F. rubra was affected by endophyte infection and <b>plant</b> <b>line</b> but not by competition with T. pratense. In the PEN line E+ plants produced less root biomass than E-; and in the RAB line E+ plants produced less shoot biomass than E-. In spite of these differences shoot and root biomass production of Trifolium pratense were more inhibited when growing with endophyte–infected plants of Festuca rubra than with E- plants, regardless of the <b>plant</b> <b>line.</b> In both F. rubra lines, the endophyte increased the phosphorus concentration in shoots. Regardless of F. rubra <b>plant</b> <b>line,</b> root biomass of the five target species was more inhibited when growing with endophyte-infected than with endophyte-free plants. Conclusions: Irrespective of F. rubra line, endophyte-infected plants had a better competitive ability than non-infected plants, as indicated by the lower relative yield of companion plants when growing in mixture with E+ plants. We suggest an allelopathic effect of E+ red fescue on other grassland species. This work was funded by project AGL 2008 - 01159 AGR from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of subsoiling on the physical and hydric properties of a Typical Hapludult and fruit yield in a 14 -year-old citrus orchard located in Piracicaba, SP. The treatments consisted of: no-subsoiling (with no tilling of the soil after the orchard was planted); subsoiling on one side of the <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> (SUB. 1); and subsoiling on both sides of the <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> (SUB. 2).

40|$|Most Gram-negative plant {{pathogenic}} bacteria translocate effector proteins (T 3 Es) {{directly into}} plant cells via a conserved type III secretion system, which {{is essential for}} pathogenicity in susceptible plants. In resistant plants, recognition of some T 3 Es is mediated by corresponding resistance (R) genes or R proteins and induces effector triggered immunity (ETI) that often results in programmed cell death reactions. The identification of R genes and understanding their evolution/distribution bears great potential for the generation of resistant crop plants. We focus on T 3 Es from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), the causal agent of bacterial spot disease on pepper and tomato plants. Here, 86 Solanaceae lines mainly of the genus Nicotiana were screened for phenotypical reactions after Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression of 21 different Xcv effectors to (i) identify new <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> for T 3 E characterization, (ii) analyze conservation/evolution of putative R genes and (iii) identify promising <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> as repertoire for R-gene isolation. The effectors provoked different reactions on closely related <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> indicative of a high variability and evolution rate of potential R genes. In some cases, putative R genes were conserved within a plant species but not within superordinate phylogenetical units. Interestingly, the effector XopQ was recognized by several Nicotiana spp. lines, and Xcv infection assays revealed that XopQ is a host range determinant in many Nicotiana species. Non-host resistance against Xcv and XopQ recognition in N. benthamiana required EDS 1, strongly suggesting {{the presence of a}} TIR domain-containing XopQ-specific R protein in these <b>plant</b> <b>lines.</b> XopQ is a conserved effector among most xanthomonads, pointing out the XopQ-recognizing RxopQ as candidate for targeted crop improvement...|$|R

40|$|Recessive {{resistances}} {{to plant}} viruses in the Potyvirus genus {{have been found}} to be based on mutations in the plant eukaryotic translation initiation factors, eIF 4 E and eIF 4 G or their isoforms. Here we report that natural, monogenic recessive resistance to the potyvirus Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) has been found in a number of mustard (Brassica juncea) accessions. Bulked segregant analysis and sequencing of resistant and susceptible plant lines indicated the resistance is controlled by a single recessive gene, recessive TuMV resistance 03 (retr 03), an allele of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 B-beta (eIF 2 Bβ). Silencing of eIF 2 Bβ in a TuMV-susceptible mustard <b>plant</b> <b>line</b> and expression of eIF 2 Bβ from a TuMV-susceptible line in a TuMV-resistant mustard <b>plant</b> <b>line</b> confirmed the new resistance mechanism. A functional copy of a specific allele of eIF 2 Bβ is required for efficient TuMV infection. eIF 2 Bβ represents a new class of virus resistance gene conferring resistance to any pathogen. eIF 2 B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for its GTP-binding protein partner eIF 2 via interaction with eIF 2 ·GTP at an early step in translation initiation. Further genotyping indicated that a single non-synonymous substitution (A 120 G) in the N-terminal region of eIF 2 Bβ was responsible for the TuMV resistance. A reproducible marker has been developed, facilitating marker-assisted selection for TuMV resistance in B. juncea. Our findings provide a new target for seeking natural resistance to potyviruses and new opportunities for the control of potyviruses using genome editing techniques targeted on eIF 2 Bβ. ...|$|E

We investigated if the Epichloë-endophyte affects the growth and nutrient content of F. rubra plants subjected to drought. Endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) plants of two half-sib lines (PEN and RAB) were subjected to three water availability treatments. Shoot and root biomass, nutrient content, proline, phenolic compounds and fungal alkaloids were measured after the treatments. The effect of the endophyte on shoot and root biomass and dead leaves depended on the <b>plant</b> <b>line.</b> In the PEN line, E+ plants had a greater S:R ratio than E-, but the opposite occurred in RAB. In both plant lines and all water treatments, endophyte-infected plants had greater concentrations of N, P and Zn in shoots and Ca, Mg and Zn in roots than E- plants. On average, E+ plants contained in their shoots more P (62 %), Zn (58 %) and N (19 %) than E- plants. While the proline in shoots increased in response to water stress, the endophyte did not affect this response. A multivariate analysis showed that endophyte status and <b>plant</b> <b>line</b> impose stronger differences {{in the performance of}} the plants than the water stress treatments. Furthermore, differences between PEN and RAB lines seemed to be greater in E- than in E+ plants, suggesting that E+ plants of both lines are more similar than those of their non-infected version. This is probably due to the endophyte producing a similar effect in both plant lines, such as the increase in N, P and Zn in shoots. The remarkable effect of the endophyte in the nutrient balance of the plants could help to explain the high prevalence of infected plants in natural grasslands...|$|E
