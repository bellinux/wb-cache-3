5000|$|The word {{chelator}} {{is derived}} from Greek chēlē, meaning [...] "claw". Chelators remove, through a complex formation, metals from looser chemical compounds in the organism, such as iron and lead. The most commonly used metal chelators in clinical toxicology include meso-2,3-dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA, succimer), sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS, unithiol) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Diagnostically, a <b>provocation</b> <b>test</b> involves taking a urine test {{before and after the}} application of a chelating agent. The <b>provocation</b> <b>test</b> with DMPS has according to Geir Bjørklund been found to provide a reliable estimate of body burden mercury, safer than dimercaprol and more potent than DMSA. A <b>provocation</b> <b>test</b> with calcium EDTA can be used when the blood lead levels have returned to normal by the time a diagnosis of lead poisoning is attempted. In such situations, this <b>provocation</b> <b>test</b> can increase the urinary excretion of the stored lead.|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous {{coronary}} artery spasm is an important cause of morbidity both in patients with {{coronary artery}} disease and in those with variant angina. A number of pharmacological agents have been identified which can provoke {{coronary artery spasm}} in susceptible patients. The role of <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> in the clinical diagnosis of coronary spasm is controversial. This is reflected by variations in the clinical use of <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> between specialist cardiac centres. <b>Provocation</b> <b>testing</b> {{appears to be a}} sensitive method of identifying patients with variant angina and active disease but such patients can often be diagnosed clinically. The specificity is less clear. There is little evidence that altering patient therapy {{on the basis of a}} positive test modifies prognosis.

40|$|Occupational asthma due to {{platinum}} salts is {{a frequent}} disease in platinum refineries. The diagnosis is based upon a history of work related symptoms and a positive skin prick test with platinum salts. Bronchial <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> have not been performed in epidemiological studies because the skin test {{is believed to be}} highly specific and sensitive. As no reliable data about this issue currently exist, this study assesses the use of skin prick and bronchial <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> with methacholine and platinum salt in platinum refinery workers. Twenty seven of 35 workers, who were referred to our clinic with work related symptoms and nine control subjects with bronchial hyperreactivity underwent a skin prick <b>test</b> and bronchial <b>provocation</b> with methacholine and platinum salt. For skin prick and bronchial <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> with platinum salt a 10 (- 2) - 10 (- 8) mol/l hexachloroplatinic acid solution, in 10 -fold dilutions was used. Four of the 27 subjects and all controls showed neither a bronchial reaction nor a skin reaction. Twenty three subjects were considered allergic to platinum salt; 22 of these showed a fall of 50 % or more in specific airway conductance after inhalation of the platinum salt solution. Four workers experienced a positive bronchial reaction despite a negative skin prick test. No correlation of responsiveness to methacholine with responsiveness to platinum salt was found, but the skin prick test correlated with the bronchial reaction to platinum salt (rs = 0. 50, p less than 0. 023, n = 22). One dual reaction was seen in bronchial <b>provocation</b> <b>tests.</b> Side effects of both skin <b>tests</b> and bronchial <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> with platinum salt were rare and were not encountered in workers without a skin reaction to platinum salt.

Aims: To describe our use of oral <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> to provide a list of safe drugs to patients. Methods: We studied the records of 100 patients who underwent oral <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> in our department between 2003 and 2009. All patients were admitted to hospital and drugs were administered under supervision, one drug per day. A dermatologist evaluated all symptoms and signs that developed following drug intake. Results: Sixty nine women and 31 men underwent <b>provocation</b> <b>testing.</b> There were 96 reactions in 61 patients, of which 44 reactions in 34 patients were judged to be true reactions. All reactions could be controlled, with treatment or spontaneously. A list of safe drugs was provided to the patient along with written instructions to avoid any drug(s) that had produced a reaction.

Materials and Methods: 153 TMD pain subjects and 84 healthy controls {{were enrolled in the}} study. Inclusion criterion for the TMD subjects was a RDC/TMD pain diagnosis (group I and III) and ETTH or CTTH diagnosed according to IHS criteria. Assessment variables were mandibular range of motion, masticatory muscle and TMJ tenderness, referred pain, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> of the jaw. Results: PPT differed significantly between controls and TMD (ETTH and CTTH) patients at trigeminal and non-trigeminal sites (p < 0. 001). Number of painful muscle sites increased significantly with headache frequency (p < 0. 001). CTTH patients had significantly more sites with referred pain in the temples than ETTH patients (p < 0. 03). Overall, 31 % of ETTH and 57 % of CTTH patients reported familiar headache in {{one or more of the}} <b>provocation</b> <b>tests.</b> Conclusion: TMD patients with ETTH and CTTH had increased sensitivity at trigeminal and non-trigeminal sites and more muscle tenderness compared with controls, which suggests involvement of peripheral and central sensitization.

40|$|ABSTRACT Hypersensitivity to {{formalin}} used to sterilise {{artificial kidney}} machines was shown by inhalation <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> {{to be responsible}} for attacks of wheezing accompanied by productive cough in two members of the nursing staff of a haemodialysis unit. Three further members of the staff of 28 who were continually exposed to this substance occupationally had developed similar recurrent but less frequent episodes since joining the unit. Two underwent inhalation <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> with formalin which did not reproduce these symptoms. Single episodes of these symptoms had been noted by three additional staff members so that altogether eight (29 %) had experienced attacks described as bronchitic since becoming exposed to formalin. We suggest that, while exposure to formalin {{did not seem to be}} directly responsible in all cases, it might have increased susceptibility to other provoking agents or induced a hyper-reactive responsiveness of the airways. The responses observed in the two nurses after inhalation <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> with formalin were predominantly of airways obstruction. Wheezing began between two and three hours after exposure, and peakex-piratory flow rates fell maximally by approximately 50 o%. Reactions persisted for 10 hours to 10 days depending on the exposure dose. A productive cough was a prominent feature.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} address the issues of safety, {{feasibility}} and clinical impact of noninvasive diagnosis of coronary vasospasm (CVS). BACKGROUNDThe safety of ergonovine provocation for CVS performed outside the catheterization laboratory has been questioned. METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis {{of the results of}} bedside ergonovine <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> by monitoring left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) using two-dimensional echocardiography (Erg Echo). RESULTSAfter confirming that there was no significant epicardial coronary stenosis, Erg Echo was performed on 1, 372 patients from July 1991 to December 1997. Ergonovine echocardiography was terminated prematurely in 13 patients (0. 9 %) because of limitations caused by side effects unrelated to myocardial ischemia. Among 1, 359 completed tests, 31 % (n = 421) showed positive results, with development of RWMAs in 412 tests (98 %) or ST displacement in electrocardiograms of nine tests (2 %). Arrhythmias developed in 1. 9 % (26 / 1, 372), including transient ventricular tachycardia (n = 2) and atrioventricular block (n = 4), which were promptly reversed with nitroglycerin. There was no mortality or development of myocardial infarction. Based on the angiographic criteria of 218 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of Erg Echo for the diagnosis of CVS were 93 % and 91 %, respectively. Since 1994, Erg Echo has become a more popular diagnostic method than invasive spasm <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> in the catheterization laboratory and has comprised more than 95 % of all spasm <b>provocation</b> <b>tests</b> during the last three years. In the outpatient clinic, 453 patients underwent Erg Echo safely. CONCLUSIONSAlthough this is a retrospective study in a single center, we believe that Erg Echo is highly feasible, accurate and safe for the diagnosis of CVS and can replace invasive angiographic spasm <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> in the catheterization laboratory...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of type I allergy, an IgE-antibody-mediated hypersensitivity disease affecting more than 25 % of the population, {{is based on}} the measurement of allergen-specific serum IgE levels and <b>provocation</b> <b>testing.</b> Whether the determination of allergen-specific serum IgE levels can replace in vivo <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> for allergy diagnosis is a controversial issue. We used purified recombinant timothy grass and birch pollen allergens to compare by skin prick and nasal <b>provocation</b> <b>testing</b> as well as by serology in vivo sensitivity with antibody-binding capacity in 24 pollen allergic patients and eight control individuals. Results from biologic tests were correlated {{with each other and with}} allergen-specific IgE and IgG 1 - 4 levels. IgE-reactive allergens induced immediate skin and nasal reactions, but the intensity of the allergic tissue reactions was not correlated with either the levels of allergen-specific IgE or the levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies. Less frequently detected allergens with low IgE-binding capacity were able to induce strong allergic reactions comparable to those caused by major allergens with high IgE-binding capacity. In contrast, skin <b>test</b> and nasal <b>provocation</b> results were significantly correlated (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 01). Our study thus demonstrates on a molecular level that skin testing provides a better reflection of immediate type respiratory sensitivity than serologic measurements.
