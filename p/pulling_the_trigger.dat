5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, {{electro-mechanical}} arcade {{games were}} gradually replaced by electronic video games, following {{the release of}} Pong in 1972, with 1978's Space Invaders dealing a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of mechanical games. Light guns used in electronic video games work in the opposite manner to their mechanical counterparts: the sensor is in the gun and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> allows it to receive light from the on-screen targets. Computer light pens had been used for practical purposes at MIT in the early 1960s, and the Magnavox Odyssey had a light gun accessory, {{in the production of}} which Nintendo was involved.|$|E

25|$|Semi-automatic {{refers to}} a firearm which uses the force of recoil or gas to eject the empty case and load a fresh {{cartridge}} into the firing chamber for the next shot and which allows repeat shots solely through the action of <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> A double-action revolver also requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired but is not considered semi-automatic since the manual action of <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is what advances the cylinder, not {{the energy of the}} preceding shot.|$|E
25|$|Colt Government Mk. IV Series 80 (1983–present): Introduced an {{internal}} firing pin safety {{and a new}} half-cock notch on the sear; <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> on these models while at half-cock will cause the hammer to drop. Models after 1988 returned to the solid barrel bushing due to concerns about breakages.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{television}} stations throughout Pennsylvania broadcast taped footage of Dwyer's suicide to a midday audience.

50|$|The AccuTrigger is a {{functionally}} two-stage <b>trigger</b> {{developed by}} <b>the</b> Savage Arms Company in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>trigger</b> {{was designed for}} ease of use and the ability for end users to adjust the weight of <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> on <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Trigger-pull refers {{to the amount of}} force necessary to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|R

25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer was down, <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> would cock the hammer. If the trigger was pulled with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that {{to fire the}} {{revolver}} from a hammer down state, the trigger must be pulled twice.|$|E
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} mandated a grip {{safety and}} a manual safety. A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located {{on the left}} rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety. Language cautioning against <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> with the second finger {{was included in the}} initial M1911 manual, and later manuals up to the 1940s.|$|E

25|$|An open-bolt {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with {{a high rate of}} fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively little at the moment the trigger is pulled.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, Marissa and Bianca {{received}} {{a text message}} that they believed was from Scott who invited them to {{a party at the}} Chandler mansion to celebrate the resurrection of Stuart Chandler who had been presumed dead for two years until he was revealed to be alive as a part of Project Orpheus. They attended the party and enjoyed celebrating life in Pine Valley when JR, in a drunken rage, shot into the crowd. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that Marissa died and that {{she was the one who}} JR shot. Marissa's father, David, tried to stop JR from <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> but the gun misfired. David then threw JR to the floor and shot him and as a result, JR lapsed into a five-year-long coma. David was arrested and jailed for the incident but later returned to Pine Valley after being paroled. Bianca is seen visiting Marissa's grave and updating Marissa on her son AJ and Miranda, whom they had planned to raise together. Bianca tells Marissa that they were supposed to be together and that she will never stop missing her. After JR awakens from his coma, Bianca becomes upset when she sees him, going into a fit of grief and attacking him for killing Marissa. Bianca leaves Pine Valley telling everyone she is going away for work, but she is shown visiting her sister Kendall, who appears to be ill.|$|E
500|$|... "Light gun shooters", [...] "light gun games" [...] or [...] "gun games" [...] are {{games in}} which the protagonist shoots at targets, whether antagonists or objects, and which utilize a gun-shaped {{controller}} (termed a [...] "light gun") with which the player aims. While light gun games may feature a first-person perspective, they are distinct from first person shooters, which utilize more conventional input devices. Light gun games which feature [...] "on-rails" [...] movement are sometimes termed [...] "rail shooters", though this term is also applied to other types of shooters featuring similar movement. The light gun itself is so termed because it functions {{through the use of}} a light sensor: <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> allows it to detect light from the on-screen targets.|$|E

500|$|The Persona 3 The Movie {{project was}} first {{revealed}} during a thirty second post-credits teaser trailer {{at the end}} of the limited theatrical release of the Persona 4 The Animation: The Factor of Hope feature film during its screening in Japan on June 9, 2012. The teaser noted that the project had been green lit for production. Featured in the teaser was the Persona 3 Protagonist holding an [...] "Evoker" [...] (a unique game mechanic of summoning a [...] "Persona") to his head and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> all showcased in Japanese-style 2D animation. This left some speculation amongst the media as to whether the project would be an anime film or otherwise since at the time this was left to ambiguity. Following later confirmation of the project's animated theatrical nature, a slightly altered fifteen-second version of the teaser was streamed online.|$|E
500|$|The {{poor design}} of the breech allowed the Type 94 Nambu to be fired unintentionally. The sear bar on the Type 94 Nambu {{converts}} the forward pull of the trigger into a lateral movement that frees the hammer. Because the sear bar is {{on the outside of}} the pistol, it could be jarred loose during engagement if the pistol was cocked and handled carelessly. The forward end of the [...] sear bar would need to be depressed approximately [...] 2mm to cause the weapon to fire. The ability to fire the Type 94 without <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> gave rise to war stories of Japanese soldiers surrendering, only to fire the pistol, earning the pistol monikers such as the [...] "suicide special" [...] and the [...] "surrender pistol". These stories are widely discredited because of the difficulty to fire the weapon by squeezing the sear bar. If the safety is engaged on the Type 94 it is impossible for the weapon to discharge unintentionally.|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{rejected}} arguments that such video games {{are protected by}} freedom of expression, saying, [...] "Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They’re not even speech. They’re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it," [...] as well as simply calling video games [...] "mental masturbation". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, {{saying that it was}} looking [...] "for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> from the awful reality that a life may end". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller [...] "gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E
