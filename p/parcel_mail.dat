50|$|From {{the late}} 1940s, mail planes became {{increasingly}} rare, as the increasing size of aircraft and economics dictated {{a move towards}} bulk carriage of mail onboard airline flights, and this remains the primary method today. <b>Parcel</b> <b>mail,</b> overnight mail and priority mail, however, are still carried aboard what may be considered the spiritual successors of classic, pre-war mail planes; small, general aviation aircraft that have been adapted to the role, with the Cessna 208 and Piper PA-31 Navajo being among the most popular. Cargo airline operators, such as UPS and FedEx, also carry mail along with bulk cargo, aboard converted airliners.|$|E
50|$|The pond was a {{place for}} public relaxation, but had become a hazard by the late 19th century, a <b>parcel</b> <b>mail</b> coach having notably come to grief in it in 1891. To commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897, a large {{fountain}} {{was placed in the}} middle of the pond and railings were erected around it. In 1953 the pond was drained and is now a major roundabout on the London to Brighton route (the A23 road). In 1975, due to sporadic incidents of vandalism, the decision was made to fill in the pool as well. In January 2003, a new water feature (funded by Croydon Council's Smarter Croydon initiative) was put in place, although this was soon removed. Thornton Heath Pond remains a name principally for traffic bulletins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mail</b> and <b>parcel</b> are two {{important}} things that involved students and staff in Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). As <b>mail</b> and <b>parcel</b> received by students and staff every day,it is a challenge for Pusat Mel to handle the process of receiving and distributing it for a big number of recipients. Current method and process of recipients to take the parcel is {{they need to go}} to their respective hostel office and check either their parcel has arrived or not. If the parcel has arrived,they need to provide their matric card as proof that he/she is the correct recipient. The problem with current process is, student need to check by their self either their parcel has arrived or not. That would require a lot of their energy and time to check the parcel every day. Another problem arises when there is case of missing parcel while in the hand of hostel office. A proper management system is needed to solve those problems. The objectives of this system are:(1) To develop mailing system to assist the KK 3 officer and students in the <b>parcel</b> or <b>mail</b> process,(2) To notify the students about their receiving <b>parcel</b> or <b>mail</b> through the email or SMS. By the use of this system, hostel office that manages <b>parcel</b> and <b>mail</b> distribution can handle both of it with effective and efficient. Students also no need to check their <b>parcel</b> and <b>mail</b> frequently as this system comes with email and SMS notification that will ease them to know either their parcel has arrived or not. The system has been developed and it shows both of the objectives can be achieved according to user testing that has been conducted before. Hence,this system should undergo future enhancement so that all hostel office in UMP can use this system for the ease of their management and students as well...|$|R

25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, letter carrier routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering <b>parcels,</b> <b>mail,</b> clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, work stress, and injuries to employees who are facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|R
