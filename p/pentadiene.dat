40|$|Abstract: The {{principles}} of linear free energy relationships {{were applied to}} the 13 C substituent chemical shifts (SCS) of the carbon atoms in the unsaturated chain of 3 -methylene- 4 -substituted- 1, 4 -pentadienes. Correlations of the SCS with the substituent parameters of Swain and Lupton provide a mutually consistent picture of the electronic effects in these compounds. The pattern of the electronic effects can be fully rationalized by a model based on the direct transmission of substituent effects through-space (direct through-space field effects), and via conjugative interactions (resonance effects), or by substituent-induced polarization of the �-system in the unsaturated chain (�-polarization effect).

Testing of mechanical mixtures, consisting of each one of the magnesium vanadates and antimony oxide, indicated that the latter had a positive effect especially on the selectivity to dehydrogenation with the Mg 3 V 2 O 8 containing samples. The main products of the reaction were pentenes, <b>pentadienes</b> and carbon oxides.

The catalytic behavior of mixtures consisting of magnesium vanadate and antimony oxide, 50 - 50 % wt, was also investigated. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the vanadates have shown that they were of high purity, while XPS measurements revealed a slight surface enrichment in magnesium. At 350 - 500 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, similar total n-pentane conversions were achieved with the two magnesium vanadate phases; the main products were linear unsaturated C- 5 hydrocarbons, i. e. pentenes and <b>pentadienes,</b> and carbon oxides. Magnesium orthovanadate was more selective than the pyrovanadate towards the pure dehydrogenation reaction in comparison with the combustion one, and its selectivity was in general increased by the addition of Sb 2 O 4 The latter had little effect on the behavior of the pyrovanadate phase. Decreasing the oxygen to alkane ratio in the feed led to a decrease in total conversion and an increase in selectivity, while the C- 5 hydrocarbon product distributions were not influenced appreciably. The extent of the homogeneous reaction between pentane and oxygen was negligible for oxygen to alkane ratios in the feed equal to 0. 5 and 1. 0, but increased dramatically when the ratio was raised to 2. 0...|$|R

The plume was sampled at its origin for deriving emission factors and followed ~ 13. 6 km downwind for observing chemical changes during the first hour of atmospheric aging. The P- 3 B payload included a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS), which measured non-methane organic gases (NMOGs) at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution (10 m/ 0. 1 s). Quantitative emission data are reported for CO 2, CO, NO, NO 2, HONO, NH 3 and 16 NMOGs (formaldehyde, methanol, acetonitrile, propene, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone plus its isomer propanal, acetic acid plus its isomer glycolaldehyde, furan, isoprene plus isomeric <b>pentadienes</b> and cyclopentene, methyl vinyl ketone plus its isomers crotonaldehyde and methacrolein, methylglyoxal, hydroxy acetone plus its isomers methyl acetate and propionic acid, benzene, 2, 3 -butandione and 2 -furfural) with molar emission ratios relative to CO larger than 1 ppbV ppmV − 1. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 2 -furfural and methanol dominated NMOG emissions. No NMOGs with more than 10 carbon atoms were observed at mixing ratios larger than 50 ppbV ppmV − 1 CO emitted. Downwind plume chemistry was investigated using the observations and a 0 -D photochemical box model simulation. The model was run on a near-explicit chemical mechanism (MCM v 3. 3) and initialized with measured emission data. Ozone formation during the first hour of atmospheric aging was well captured by the model, with carbonyls (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 2, 3 -butanedione, methylglyoxal, 2 -furfural) in addition to CO and CH 4 being the main drivers of peroxy radical chemistry. The model also accurately reproduced the sequestration of NO x into PAN and the OH-initiated degradation of furan and 2 -furfural at an average OH concentration of 7. 45 ± 1. 07 × 10 6 cm − 3 in the plume.

Historical Development of Stable Metallacyclobutenes Fred Tebbe and {{co-workers}} synthesized the first stable metallacyclobutene complexes {{in the late}} 1970 ’s by treatment of an intermediate titanium methylene species – later popularized as the “Tebbe reagent” – with acetylenes. Robert Grubbs at Caltech further studied this system, using it to detail a degenerate metathesis reaction and to isolate a metallacyclobutane complex – which was implicated in the emerging field of alkene metathesis. Further development of stable metallacyclobutene complexes is explored chronologically, {{particularly with regard to}} systems developed by Thorn, Bianchini, Hughes, O’Connor, Casey, Wojcicki, and Chen.

The reaction is thought to occur through a vinylcarbene intermediate such as 15 - 17, and a model complex of an oxametallabenzene containing an internal vinylcarbene moiety is calculated (18). Complex 13 -exo reacts with trimethylphosphine to decomplex the ester carbonyl, generating a PMe₃ complex, 20 -exo. Oxidative demetallation of complexes 9 -ZZ and 9 -ZE is effected with iodine to generate organic <b>pentadienes</b> 21 - 22. Iron vinylcarbene complex (CO) ₃Fe(η³-C(OMe) C(CO₂Me) =CH(CO₂Me) (25 a) is synthesized, and its reactivity with maleic anhydride and maleimide is found to generate dinuclear iron complex 30, and new organic species 31 and 32.

Furthermore, the volatiles of the isolate Nodulisporium sp. were selectively active against a number of plant pathogens including Daldina sp. and Hypoxylon spp. teleomorphs (seems to produce its own unique set of VOCs) (Hassan et al. 2013). Wu et al. (2016) characterized 26 terpene synthases (TPSs) derived from four endophytic (Xylariaceous) fungi known to produce mycodiesel hydrocarbons. Shaw et al. (2015) suggested the evolutionary relationship of fungal terpene synthases to those in plants and bacteria. Authors identified 1, 8 -cineole, a commercially important monoterpenes from endophytic Hypoxylon sp.|$|E
40|$|Lipoxygenases are non-heme, non-sulfur iron {{containing}} {{enzymes that}} catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsatured fatty acids containing {{one or more}} <b>pentadiene</b> systems to the corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives. Structural studies in solution of the mammalian and plant enzyme revealed that the latter has a more stable and compact conformation 1. As yet, metal atom extraction, reconstitution and substitution with vicariate metals have not been successfully applied to soybean lipoxygenase- 1, because of the highly buried position of the iron atom within the active site. Tryptic digestion of lipoxygenase- 1 and the subsequent isolation of the 60 kDa C-terminal region allowed to generate a “mini-lipoxygenase- 1 (miniLOX) ” that retains the catalytically active iron, but in a more accessible position 2. In this study, we investigated by near-UV-circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies the structural and functional effects of iron removal, reconstitution and vicariation in miniLOX. Moreover, we report the kinetic analysis and the membrane binding ability of the apo- and metal-substituted forms of miniLOX, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and monolamellar vesicles. Taken together, these data demonstrate an unprecedented structural role of iron, which is involved {{not only in the}} catalytic activity but also in the membrane binding ability of lipoxygenase- 1. 1.

40|$|The active {{compound}} curcumin is {{isolated from}} the spice turmeric. Curcumin, curcuminoids and their synthetic analogs {{have been shown to}} inhibit the progression of cancer in animal models. In colon and skin carcinogenesis the genetic changes engross different genes, but curcumin is effective in preventing carcinogenesis in both organs. A needful elucidation for this result is that analogues of curcumin can inhibit angiogenesis. The synthetic analog of Curcumin, 1, 5 bis (3, 5 dimethoxy phenyl) 1, 4 <b>pentadiene</b> – 3 one (BDMP) was tested for its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of primary endothelial cells in the presence and absence of the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and its ability to inhibit proliferation of an immortalized endothelial cell line. BDMP and other analogs of curcumin such as bis (3, 4 dimethoxyphenyl) 1, 3 propanedione (BDMPP), bis (2, 4 dimethoxyphenyl) 1, 3 propanedione (DMPP), and bis (3, 3 dinitrophenyl) 2 - bromo 1, 3 propanedione (BDNP) were subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit bFGF-induced corneal neovascularization in the mouse cornea. Ultimately, BDMP was evaluated for its ability to inhibit phorbol esterstimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA production. BDMP effectively inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner. BDMP, BDMPP, DMPP and BDNP have shown significant inhibition of bFGF mediated corneal neovascularization in the mouse. BDMP had no effect on phorbol ester stimulated VEGF production. Results of these investigations show that BDMP has direct antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Carcinogenesis inhibiting activity of the BDMP in skin and colon may be mediated in part through angiogenesis inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [55]- 59) Lipoxygenase is a ubiquitous {{enzyme that}} can oxidize {{free fatty acids}} containing a cis, cis - 1, 4 - <b>pentadiene</b> structure. This action forms fatty acid hydroperoxides which are precursors to compounds of medicinal importance. Plant tissues contain high levels of lipoxygenase activity which has been implicated {{in the production of}} many volatile compounds. These compounds can be involved with plant-insect interaction as well as production of off-flavors by plants. Since the 18 kDa 5 -lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) of mammals {{has been shown to be}} a key step in controlling lipoxygenase activity, our aim was to establish whether plants had a similar control mechanism. We have employed a human FLAP gene as a heterologous probe to screen a Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA library. Three independent cross hybridizing phage plaques were isolated. All three clones shared similar restriction fragments suggesting that they were either overlapping clones or that these sequences are part of a small gene family. We have subcloned one of these genomic clones. Partial sequencing of this putative fragment reveals very little homology to human FLAP. However, high homology domains have been identified between the Arabidopsis thaliana putative genomic DNA and guinea pig lipoprotein lipase DNA. Northern analysis using the total RNA from the entire plant and the putative genomic fragment shows hybridization with a 2. 4 kb RNA transcript. These results suggest that although an exact analog plant analog of the human FLAP may not exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, a protein with domains performing related functions to human FLAP may be present.
