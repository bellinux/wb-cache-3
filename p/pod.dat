5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume <b>pod</b> borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include <b>pod</b> sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus <b>pod</b> and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the <b>pod</b> herself. She rationalises that the <b>pod</b> is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the <b>pod,</b> and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the <b>pod</b> needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the <b>pod</b> towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E

The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a <b>pod</b> of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale <b>pod,</b> will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the <b>pod</b> alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the <b>Pod</b> itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the <b>Pod</b> was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the <b>Pod</b> itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both Deal and Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded <b>Pod</b> at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and focused more on getting good sounds from the musical equipment than on trying to improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between <b>Pod</b> and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spread of}} spores through air from {{infected}} <b>pods</b> was observed and some assumption regarding this mechanism of dispersion {{has been made}} in previous studies, however it is remained uncertain due to unconvincing results from an experiment that collected some spores in the air using the volumetric spore trap, where a small amount of spores were found in the trap. Conversely, the dispersal of inoculum via rain is considered an effective mechanism in spreading the inoculum. It was assumed that under close canopy, less water will reach the sporulating <b>pods</b> to spread the inoculum, however, rain drops from leaves and branches could also splash the inoculum to the surroundings. Infected <b>pods</b> laying on the ground or litter could also spread the inoculum, yet greater infection was observed on <b>pods</b> located under infected <b>pods</b> hanging on the tree compared to <b>pods</b> at the same level of infected <b>pods.</b> It was reported that splash of wind-blown droplets from the infected <b>pods</b> are also able to infect <b>pods</b> on different trees nearby ...|$|R
