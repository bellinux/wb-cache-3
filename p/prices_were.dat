30|$|The {{export prices}} of five major rice markets {{are used in}} this study which were taken from the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s Global Information Early Warning System (GIEWS) database. The <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> {{measured}} in a common currency, namely monthly FOB export prices in nominal US dollars. The Thai and Vietnamese <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> the five per cent broken rice prices, the American <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the two to four per cent broken price, the Argentinean <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the ten per cent broken price, and the Pakistani <b>price</b> <b>is</b> the twenty five per cent broken <b>price.</b> The <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> therefore seen as representing the higher quality indica grades of rice apart from the Pakistani price. While the higher quality Pakistani <b>price</b> <b>was</b> not available, it is assumed that the higher quality Pakistan price closely follows price movements in the lower quality Pakistani <b>price</b> since this <b>is</b> the case for Thai and Vietnamese rice export prices. The Uruguayan export <b>price</b> <b>is</b> probably a more important rice price for South American markets than the Argentinean <b>price,</b> however, data <b>was</b> only available from 2006 which would have severely cut the available number of observations included in the study therefore the study assumes that Argentinean <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> related to Uruguayan <b>price</b> movements and <b>are</b> therefore suitable for the analysis. Indian export <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> also available; however, due to the Indian government’s policy of temporal rice export bans there are many breaks in the price series therefore Indian <b>prices</b> cannot <b>be</b> included in the study.|$|R

5|$|Newman's {{determination}} {{to make the}} promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available {{in all parts of}} the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. <b>Prices</b> <b>were</b> about one fifth of those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.|$|E
5|$|Prices for pelts {{have varied}} {{considerably}} {{over the past}} 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when average <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> about $100 US. In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450–750 per pelt. Prices declined through the 1960s but picked up again in the late 1970s. In 1979, the Hudson's Bay Company paid $410 for one female pelt. In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for $449,307 (CAN) at an average price of $27.|$|E
5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> low {{and passenger}} numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly {{the result of}} competition between the UERL's lines {{and those of the}} other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E

5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{expected}} audience {{of up to}} 13million, ITV raised the prices of their 30-second advertising slots during the final from between £100,000 and £150,000 {{to as much as}} £250,000. It was estimated that ITV would stand to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved. Among the confirmed advertisers on ITV were Ford, Cadbury, Nike, Heineken, Audi and BlackBerry. Sky's advertising <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> not reported, but among their scheduled advertisers were Audi, Ford, Nike, Samsung and Pepsi.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets.

5|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in 1924, with the line opening in 1940. It allowed the {{district}} of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo via the Bergen Line. Electric traction was taken into use in 1944; at first El 9 locomotives were used, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train connected with a ferry service from Flåm to Gudvangen. In 1992, freight services were terminated, and due to low ticket prices and high operating costs, the line was nearly closed. In 1998, Flåm Utvikling took over marketing and ticket sale for the line, <b>prices</b> <b>were</b> heavily increased and El 17 locomotives were introduced. The trains remain operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), while the line itself is {{owned and operated by}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection.

During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity.
