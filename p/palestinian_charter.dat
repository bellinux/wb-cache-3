50|$|I {{thank you}} for your {{rejection}} - fully, finally and forever - of the passages in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Charter</b> calling for the destruction of Israel. For they were the ideological underpinnings of a struggle renounced at Oslo. By revoking them once and for all, you have sent, I say again, a powerful message not to the government, but to the people of Israel. You will touch people on the street there. You will reach their hearts there.|$|E

40|$|The Palestinian Authority (hereinafter the PA) 1 is a {{good example}} of the contradictions {{inherent}} in the role of a constitution and its place in a particular (non-state, pre-state or quasistate) legal system. At present, there is a Basic Law (hereinafter the BL) which is enforced in the territory under PA control, and a Draft Palestinian Constitution (hereinafter the DPC) is also circulating. 2 At the same time, the 1968 <b>Palestinian</b> National <b>Charter</b> (hereinafter the Charter) remains, formally, in force, although considered by many as 'old fashioned' since it renounced the armed resistance as a means to national liberation (Nofal 1997, 87). Furthermore, the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereinafter the PLO) unilaterally proclaimed the establishment of a new independent state called the ‘State of Palestine’ in 1988 but this did not lead directly to the realization of statehood. Therefore it remains an aspiration and future objective as the Israeli occupation persists and the ‘State of Palestine’ has still to be established.

In the month following, it was quickly recognised by many states, including Egypt and Jordan. In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the [...] "Palestinian territory", without explicitly specifying further.

This sparked three days of rioting by Palestinians, resulting in both Israelis and Palestinians being killed. In January 1997 Netanyahu signed the Hebron Protocol with the Palestinian Authority which resulted in the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the Palestinian Authority.|$|R
