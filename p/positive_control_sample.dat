40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{observed}} anticipation (earlier age at onset [AAO] in successive generations) in familial schizophrenia. However, whether true anticipation or ascertainment bias {{is the principal}} originating mechanism remains unclear. In 1944 L. S. Penrose collected AAO data on a large, representative sample of familial mental illness, using a broad ascertainment strategy. These data allowed examination of anticipation and ascertainment biases in five two-generation samples of affected relative pairs. The median intergenerational difference (MID) in AAO {{was used to assess}} anticipation. Results showed significant anticipation in parent-offspring pairs with schizophrenia (n = 137 pairs; MID 15 years; P =. 0001) and in a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> with Huntington disease (n = 11; P =. 01). Broadening the diagnosis of the schizophrenia sample suggested anticipation of severity of illness. However, other analyses provided evidence for ascertainment bias, especially in later-AAO parents, in parent-offspring pairs. Aunt/uncle-niece/nephew schizophrenia pairs showed anticipation (n = 111; P =. 0001), but the MID was 8 years and aunts/uncles had earlier median AAO than parents. Anticipation effects were greatest in pairs with late-AAO parents but remained significant in a subgroup of schizophrenia pairs with early parental AAO (n = 31; P =. 03). A small control sample of other diseases had MID of 5 years but no significant anticipation (n = 9; P =. 38). These results suggest that, although ascertainment-bias effects were observed in parent-offspring pairs, true anticipation appears to be inherent in the transmission of familial schizophrenia. The findings support investigations of unstable mutations and other mechanisms that may contribute to true anticipation in schizophrenia...|$|E

Rapid detection of Influenza viruses enables antiviral use and can bring financial savings. It is also {{essential for the}} global surveillance of prevalent Influenza strains. RT-PCR is considered the most specific and sensitive method for detection of Influenza, but Influenza mutates at a high rate and it is therefore crucial that RT-PCR methods are updated regularly. In 2014, Cepheid released their Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay, which can detect Influenza A and B and RSV by multiplex RT-PCR in approximately one hour. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate this assay at Laboratoriemedicin Västernorrland by using the laboratory’s previous PCR assay for detection of Influenza viruses as reference method. Real-time RT-PCR was used to compare Xpert Flu/RSV XC to the reference method.

Soil samples were collected from different regions (compost, 50 year old garden, river bed, clove, wheat farms and domestic yards) of Isfahan in two different seasons. One gram of each sample was serially diluted and cultivated in a primary isolation medium. Morphological shapes of colonies and vegetative hyphae were initially used to separate the grown bacteria of the samples. Various biochemical tests based on Bergey`s manual of systemic bacteriology were performed to separate the Streptomyces from other related Genera. In order to further separate Streptomyces grisesus, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of aphE and strA genes in isolated colonies. Biochemical and morphological results, showed the presence of several species of Streptomyces in the collected samples.

40|$|Introduction: Microorganisms may {{be present}} in the form of spores, in honey. One of these {{dangerous}} organisms is the bacterium Clostridium botulinium spores which are capable induced botulism particularly in infants. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of Cl. botulinum spores in honey produced in different regions of Iran. Method: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2013. A total of 130 honey samples were collected and analyzed for Cl. botulinium spore. Samples were chosen randomly from the apiary of Iran.   The samples were examined according to Iranian standard. In laboratory, honey samples were investigated using thermal shock and they located in cooked meat medium and incubated for 10 days at 35 °C. The bacterium spores of Clostridium perfringens (PTCC: 1766) was used as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b> Results: The Results showed that Cl. botulinum spore was not detected in any of examined samples. Thirty four samples (26. 67 %) had mold and yeast contamination higher than the Iranian standard limit. Samples from Kurdestan province had high contamination (66. 6 %) and it was higher than other regions.   Honey samples from Mazanderan province had the lowest prevalence of mold and yeast with ranged from 30 to 55 CFU/g. Conclusion: Overall, the contamination of honey with Cl.   botulinum spores in examined samples was zero and so they are safe, but some samples had mold and yeasts contamination that honey samples collected from west and north regions had the high and low contamination, respectively.

40|$|In {{response}} to a request of DG SANCO to provide National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) {{as soon as possible}} with a method to test soft white wheat consignments for the presence of unauthorised GM glyphosate-resistant wheat harbouring the event MON 71800, the European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) developed, in collaboration with the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL), a testing strategy intended to be immediately implementable by EU NRLs. The testing strategy is based on a combination of three validated screening methods that allow excluding (detectable) presence of Monsanto’s GM glyphosate-resistant wheat (MON 71800) in wheat grain or food/feed products and confirming its presence whenever other GMOs can be excluded. The present report describes the results of the tests carried out by the EU-RL GMFF to verify the testing strategy proposed; the tests were conducted using the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> represented by a crude DNA lysate of MON 71800 provided by Monsanto and genomic DNA samples of genetically modified organisms harbouring the CTP 2 -CP 4 epsps element for which a validated event-specific method is available. The sensitivity of the three methods was assessed by verifying the relative limit of detection (LODrel) on MON 71800 wheat DNA. The LODrel is approximately 0. 03 % for the P- 35 S and for T-nos methods and 0. 06 % for the CTP 2 -CP 4 epsps method in 300 nanograms of wheat genomic DNA. Further experimental evidence confirmed that the three methods react against genomic DNA extracted from GM events containing the CTP 2 -CP 4 epsps element for which a validated event-specific method is available. The experimental verification hereby reported confirmed the validity of the EU-RL GMFF guidance on testing for GM glyphosate-resistant wheat (MON 71800) in wheat grain or in food/feed products containing wheat flour originating or consigned from the US, provided that DNA of acceptable quality can be obtained.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in biotechnology {{have led to}} {{an explosion in the}} amount of biological data available to researchers. Since the introduction of high-throughput technologies, a massive number of genetic markers can now be investigated for large numbers of study participants. This has led to the discovery of thousands of genetic markers that are associated with various human traits and diseases. Technological advances have made it possible to investigate not only diseases that are caused by alteration of a single gene, but also to explore the whole genome simultaneously. Most diseases are not only caused by a single genetic mutation, but by many genetic variants contributing to the disease risk, either on their own or in interaction with other variants or other environmental factors. In complex diseases, both genetic variants and environmental factors contribute to disease susceptibility, and identifying the underlying genetic risk variants for these diseases has been a major challenge in genomics. Statistics is a tool for data analysis that has {{played an important role in}} the breakthroughs in genetic studies. Statistics have shaped experimental design by addressing issues such as false <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> <b>sample</b> sizes requirements, and population heterogeneity. It has also played a prominent role in the development of quality-control protocols and different normalizations methods. New types of genetic data require development of both new methodologies as well as adaptations of existing methods, and this has led to the integration of statistical methodology into almost all aspects of genetic analyses. The title of this thesis, DNA Methylation and Exome Chip Analysis in Complex Disease, is a broad title encompassing many aspects of both genetic and epigenetic epidemiology. Common themes in this thesis are methods for the identification of genetic biomarkers in complex diseases and the aggregation of genetic information across several genetic sites. Two papers involve DNA methylation data and one paper assesses the constraints in genetic studies involving low-frequency and rare variants using the Exome Chip. The structure of the thesis is as follows. An introduction and background to the study of genetics and epigenetics of complex diseases is presented in Chapter II.

40|$|Avian {{paramyxoviruses}} (APMVs) cause {{a significant}} economic {{impact on the}} poultry industry worldwide. There are nine different serotypes of APMVs, which can infect {{a wide range of}} avian species. Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV- 1) with a ICPI above 0, 7. Clinical signs seen in birds infected with APMV- 1 vary depending on the pathogenicity of the isolate. As signs of disease caused by APMV- 1 in different hosts vary significantly, the diagnosis of ND cannot be made based on clinical signs alone. So far no ND outbreak has occurred in New Zealand and all New Zealand isolates of APMV- 1 to date have been apathogenic, so New Zealand is regarded free of the virulent form of NDV. However, seroconversion to APMV- 1 is occasionally recognized in commercial poultry flocks during the lay period, and APMV- 1 have been isolated from wild waterfowl in New Zealand. A limited number of studies have been undertaken to characterize such NZ isolates of APMV- 1. For this reason this research had a look at which APMV- 1 isolates are circulating in New Zealand. To do so paired cloacal and tracheal swabs were taken from sero-negative layer birds that were introduced into a commercial poultry flock with known exposure to APMV- 1. In total 100 birds were sampled: 50 on the first sampling (2 weeks after introduction to the farm), then 25 on the second sampling (a week later) and 25 on the third sampling (another 2 weeks later). In total 22 blood samples were collected for serology at the second and third time point. From the cloacal and tracheal samples RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy columns and the 45 samples taken at the last time point were tested in a real time RT-PCR using a M-gene assay and a L-TET assay. Also 162 samples from chickens and other domestic birds kept on small backyard farms that were at high risk of getting a APMV- 1 infection from wild waterfowl, were tested by this real time RT-PCRs. All samples that were tested with the M-gene assay were negative, only the positive controls were positive. The L-probe tested all the samples negative and there was no <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> for this test so no conclusions can be drawn from these results. Since there were no positive samples {{it was not possible to}} characterize any isolates. From the results of this research it can be concluded that APMV- 1 is not common in New Zealand. More research to characterize the APMV- 1 isolates that are circulating in New Zealand should be done, to assure that all circulating APMVs continue to belong to lentogenic and apathogenic types...|$|E
40|$|Two {{concerns}} {{were raised by}} the Government Accountability Office following the 2001 building contaminations via letters containing Bacillus anthracis (BA). These included the: 1) lack of validated sampling methods, and 2) need to use statistical sampling to quantify the confidence of no contamination when all samples have negative results. Critical to addressing these concerns is quantifying the false negative rate (FNR). The FNR may depend on the 1) method of contaminant deposition, 2) surface concentration of the contaminant, 3) surface material being sampled, 4) sample collection method, 5) sample storage/transportation conditions, 6) sample processing method, and 7) sample analytical method. A {{review of the literature}} found 17 laboratory studies that focused on swab, wipe, or vacuum samples collected from a variety of surface materials contaminated by BA or a surrogate, and used culture methods to determine the surface contaminant concentration. These studies quantified performance of the sampling and analysis methods in terms of recovery efficiency (RE) and not FNR (which left a major gap in available information). Quantifying the FNR under a variety of conditions is a key aspect of validating sample and analysis methods, and also for calculating the confidence in characterization or clearance decisions based on a statistical sampling plan. A laboratory study was planned to partially fill the gap in FNR results. This report documents the experimental design developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) for a sponge-wipe method. The testing was performed by SNL and is now completed. The study investigated the effects on key response variables from six surface materials contaminated with eight surface concentrations of a BA surrogate (Bacillus atrophaeus). The key response variables include measures of the contamination on test coupons of surface materials tested, contamination recovered from coupons by sponge-wipe samples, RE, and FNR. The experimental design involves 16 test runs, performed in two blocks of eight runs. Three surface materials (stainless steel, vinyl tile, and ceramic tile) were tested in the first block, while three other surface materials (plastic, painted wood paneling, and faux leather) were tested in the second block. The eight surface concentrations of the surrogate were randomly assigned to test runs within each block. Some of the concentrations were very low and presented challenges for deposition, sampling, and analysis. However, such tests are needed to investigate RE and FNR over the full range of concentrations of interest. In each run, there were 10 test coupons of each of the three surface materials. A <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> was generated {{at the same time as}} each test sample. The positive control results will be used to 1) calculate RE values for the wipe sampling and analysis method, and 2) fit RE- and FNR-concentration equations, for each of the six surface materials. Data analyses will support 1) estimating the FNR for each combination of contaminant concentration and surface material, 2) estimating the surface concentrations and their uncertainties of the contaminant for each combination of concentration and surface material, 3) estimating RE (%) and their uncertainties for each combination of contaminant concentration and surface material, 4) fitting FNR-concentration and RE-concentration equations for each of the six surface materials, 5) assessing goodness-of-fit of the equations, and 6) quantifying the uncertainty in FNR and RE predictions made with the fitted equations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} in situ {{the application}} of 4 % titanium tetrafluoride (TiF 4) solution and 2 % sodium fluoride (NaF) gel on artificial white-spot lesions in human enamel. A crossover, double-blind study using in situ caries models was carried out. Eleven volunteers used an intraoral appliance containing five demineralized human enamel blocks. The blocks (n= 170) were randomly divided according to treatment into the following groups: TiF 4 (n= 55), NaF (n= 55), <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> (n= 55). A negative control group was composed of demineralized specimens (n= 5). The microhardness test was performed using a Knoop penetrator. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was {{used to analyze the}} concentration of titanium, calcium, phosphate and oxygen. The enamel microhardness at different depths for TiF 4, NaF and <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> was not statistically different (p> 0. 05). The samples from these three groups had statistically higher microhardness values than the negative <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> (p< 0. 05). EDS analysis did not provide conclusive results about the penetration of titanium in the TiF 4 samples. While in some fragments it had substantial penetration, in other fragments it only had superficial penetration. It was possible to conclude that, under in situ conditions, 4 % TiF 4 solution and 2 % NaF gel were able to remineralize artificial white-spot lesions in human enamel. However, the magnitude of the remineralization did not differ between groups...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{interest}} in investigating diamond as a material for use in biomedical implants. Diamond can be rendered electrically conducting by doping with boron or nitrogen. This has led to inclusion of boron doped and nitrogen included diamond elements as electrodes and/or feedthroughs for medical implants. As these conductive device elements are not encapsulated, {{there is a need}} to establish their clinical safety for use in implants. This article compares the biocompatibility of electrically conducting boron doped diamond (BDD) and nitrogen included diamond films and electrically insulating poly crystalline diamond films against a silicone negative control and a BDD sample treated with stannous octoate as a <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Samples</b> were surgically implanted into the back muscle of a guinea pig for a period of 4 - 15 weeks, excised and the implant site sectioned and submitted for histological analysis. All forms of diamond exhibited a similar or lower thickness of fibrotic tissue encapsulating compared to the silicone negative <b>control</b> <b>samples.</b> All forms of diamond exhibited similar or lower levels of acute, chronic inflammatory, and foreign body responses compared to the silicone negative control indicating that the materials are well tolerated in vivo.

5000|$|An {{example that}} is often used in {{teaching}} laboratories is a controlled protein assay. Students might be given a fluid sample containing an unknown (to the student) amount of protein. It is their job to correctly perform a controlled experiment in which they determine the concentration of protein in the fluid sample (usually called the [...] "unknown sample"). The teaching lab would be equipped with a protein standard solution with a known protein concentration. Students could make several <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> containing various dilutions of the protein standard. Negative <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> would contain all of the reagents for the protein assay but no protein. In this example, all samples are performed in duplicate. The assay is a colorimetric assay in which a spectrophotometer can measure the amount of protein in samples by detecting a colored complex formed by the interaction of protein molecules and molecules of an added dye. In the illustration, {{the results for the}} diluted test samples can be compared to the results of the standard curve (the blue line in the illustration) to estimate the amount of protein in the unknown sample.|$|R
40|$|The MGIT 960 a high capacity, automated, {{non-invasive}} liquid culture {{system was}} proposed {{as an alternative}} to the BACTEC 460, a semi-automated, radiometric liquid culture system, for the growth of mycobacteria from bovine lymph node (LN) tissues. A limit of detection study for Mycobacterium bovis, spiked into negative LN tissue, showed that both liquid culture systems supported growth down to a concentration of 2. 5 x 102 cfu/ml. A total of 867 routine LN tissues mainly from bovines but including some badger, deer and sheep tissues, were cultured on both liquid culture systems and on solid culture systems (Stonebrinks and LJP). For MTBC (Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) isolates 92 %, 93. 2 % and 73. 9 % grew on BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and solid culture systems respectively. MGIT 960 detected growth of MTBC isolates slightly faster than the BACTEC 460 system (14. 6 days compared to 15. 2 days respectively). For Rhodococcus equi isolates 42 %, 96. 6 % and 42 % grew on BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and solid culture systems respectively. For atypical mycobacteria isolates 89. 5 %, 43. 4 % and 10. 5 % grew on BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and solid culture systems respectively. For Mycobacterium avium isolates 33. 3 %, 100 % and 33. 3 % grew on BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and Solid culture systems respectively. Contamination rate was 3. 1 %, 8. 2 % and 10. 9 % for BACTEC 460, MGIT 960 and solid culture systems respectively. For growth of MTBC, M. avium and R. equi isolates MGIT 960 system gave a similar or better detection rate compared to BACTEC 460 but gave a poorer isolation rate for the growth of atypical mycobacteria. Even with the higher contamination rate the MGIT 960 system was a suitable alternative to the BACTEC 460 system. A decontamination study, comparing 5 % oxalic acid and 0. 75 % CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride), was carried out to determine if CPC could be used with the MGIT 960 system. CPC is not a suitable decontamination chemical for use with MGIT 960 system since only 47. 4 % of MTBC isolates were identified with CPC compared to 100 % with oxalic acid decontamination. A study to compare five extraction methods to detect mycobacterial DNA directly from decontaminated LN tissue to determine which if any could be used, with culture, for rapid diagnosis of high priority samples such as singleton reactors and samples with potential human involvement. This study showed that heat lysis and the Roche High Pure Template Preparation kit were not specific or sensitive enough for this purpose. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) gave a limit of detection result for M. bovis of 2. 3 x 102 cfu/ml when spiked into PBS but this increased to 2. 3 x 103 cfu/ml when spiked into negative LN tissue. IMS is not sensitive enough for the detection of mycobacterial DNA directly from decontaminated LN tissue. GenoType Mycobacteria Direct kit, with the addition of an overnight Proteinase K digestion, correctly identified 63. 3 % of the decontaminated LN tissues with 16. 7 % false negatives, the remainder of the samples failed. A persistent problem with the test was the failure of the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>sample,</b> supplied with the kit, to be correctly identified. Sequence Capture PCR, a known method for the detection of mycobacterial DNA in LN tissue, correctly identified 73. 3 % of the samples and the remaining 26. 7 % samples gave false negative results. Both the GenoType Mycobacteria Direct kit and Sequence Capture PCR could be suitable for the direct detection of mycobacterial DNA from decontaminated LN tissues with further work required to reduce the number sample failures and improve the sensitivity of both tests...|$|E
40|$|Background: All {{infectious}} disease oriented clinical diagnostic assays {{in use today}} focus on detecting {{the presence of a}} single, well defined target agent or a set of agents. In recent years, microarray-based diagnostics have been developed that greatly facilitate the highly parallel detection of multiple microbes that may be present in a given clinical specimen. While several algorithms have been described for interpretation of diagnostic microarrays, none of the existing approaches is capable of incorporating training data generated from <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> to improve performance. Results: To specifically address this issue we have developed a novel interpretive algorithm, VIPR (Viral Identification using a PRobabilistic algorithm), which uses Bayesian inference to capitalize on empirical training data to optimize detection sensitivity. To illustrate this approach, we have focused on the detection of viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) using a custom HF-virus microarray. VIPR was used to analyze 110 empirical microarray hybridizations generated from 33 distinct virus species. An accuracy of 94 % was achieved as measured by leave-one-out cross validation.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{preparation}} of novel magnetic field-responsive tissue substitutes based on biocompatible multi-domain magnetic particles dispersed in a fibrin???agarose biopolymer scaffold. We characterized our biomaterials with several experimental techniques. First we analyzed their microstructure {{and found that it}} was strongly affected by the presence of magnetic particles, especially when a magnetic field was applied at the start of polymer gelation. In these samples we observed parallel stripes consisting of closely packed fibers, separated by more isotropic net-like spaces. We then studied the viability of oral mucosa fibroblasts in the magnetic scaffolds and found no significant differences compared to <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples.</b> Finally, we analyzed the magnetic and mechanical properties of the tissue substitutes. Differences in microstructural patterns of the tissue substitutes correlated with their macroscopic mechanical properties. We also found that the mechanical properties of our magnetic tissue substitutes could be reversibly tuned by noncontact magnetic forces. This unique advantage with respect to other biomaterials could be used to match the mechanical properties of the tissue substitutes to those of potential target tissues in tissue engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|Potato is {{a staple}} food crop that widely grown around the world. Virus {{infection}} is main factor that affects great {{loss of the}} potato production. Potato virus X(PVX), potato virus Y(PVY),and potato leaf roll virus(PLRV) are top three viruses that result in decreased yield of potato in Indonesia. Therefore, the rapid methods of DAS-ELISA was studied to test tuber samples of five potato varieties, Granola, Atlantik, Raja, Super John, Kalosi, and Masalle. Two simple, rapid, sensitive, reliable detection techniques of three virus are reported in the paper: they are DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR. Detection of all three viruses on <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> could be carried out with ELISA technique without purification of RNA virus. Neither PLRV nor PVX were detected on five potato varieties test samples, but PVY was detected only in Kalosi test sample.
