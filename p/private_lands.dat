5|$|Springbok {{occur in}} several {{protected}} areas across their range: Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park (Botswana); Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park between Botswana and South Africa; Etosha National Park and Namib-Naukluft Park (Namibia); Mokala and Karoo National Parks {{and a number}} of provincial reserves in South Africa. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the springbok population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it might be an underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East's estimate. Springbok are under active management in several <b>private</b> <b>lands.</b> Small populations have been introduced into <b>private</b> <b>lands</b> and provincial areas of KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E

5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some <b>private</b> <b>lands</b> and some roads in the area. The <b>private</b> <b>lands</b> are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and <b>private</b> <b>lands.</b> Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Kettle Creek has {{an area of}} 244 square miles. It {{is located}} in Clinton, Potter, Cameron, and Tioga Counties. Forested land makes up 93.5 percent of the lower Kettle Creek watershed, 2.7 percent is abandoned coal mines and quarries, 2.4 percent is grassland, and 1.4 percent is developed land. This part of the watershed is not densely populated. The {{upper reaches of the}} watershed are also mostly forested, with some riparian meadows and camps. Public lands such as state forest or state park lands occupy 92 percent of the watershed. Most of the private land is located near floodplains. A total of 0.3 percent of the watershed, or 456 acres, (including 15 percent of the private land) is agricultural land. Much of the private and agricultural land is either in the northern reaches of the watershed, near Germania, or in or near the lower Kettle Creek valley. Wetlands make up under 1 percent of the watershed's area; 37 percent of them are on <b>private</b> <b>lands.</b> A total of 47 percent, or 382 acres, of the watershed's wetlands are riverine wetlands. palustrine wetlands cover 299 acres, or 37 percent of the total wetlands, and 133 acres (16 percent) are lacustrine wetlands. Most of the watershed's lacustrine wetlands are located in Kettle Creek's floodplain. Palustrine wetlands are found on the Kettle Creek Lake.|$|E

40|$|With {{parks and}} {{protected}} areas insufficient to sustain global biodiversity, {{the role of}} <b>private</b> <b>land</b> in biodiversity conservation is becoming increasingly significant. This paper reviews global voluntary and involuntary strategies for <b>private</b> <b>land</b> conservation. Involuntary strategies can achieve effective conservation outcomes, but often lack social acceptability. In contrast, voluntary strategies enjoy greater social acceptance but may not achieve sufficient uptake to have meaningful conservation objectives. Based on the review, we propose a classification system for <b>private</b> <b>land</b> conservation as a complement to the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2 ̆ 7 s (IUCN 2 ̆ 7 s) classification of global protected areas. The classification system provides a framework for identifying and describing conservation strategies on <b>private</b> <b>land</b> on the dimension of tenure and security. It also identifies opportunities and vulnerabilities in achieving conservation on <b>private</b> <b>land</b> while emphasising the need for systematic data collection similar to IUCN 2 ̆ 7 s efforts for protected areas...|$|R

25|$|The new National Park Service agency used {{predator}} control {{agents from}} the bureau to trap wolves, coyotes, and mountain lions within park boundaries. The agency's first director, Stephen Mather saw his primary {{responsibility to the}} new national-park idea as one of building a constituency to support the parks, and feared that if predator populations were not controlled inside park boundaries, they would wander to adjoining <b>private</b> <b>lands</b> to kill livestock. Mather did not want angry ranchers complaining to their congressional representatives that the national parks were bad for the ranching business.|$|E

25|$|The greatly {{expanded}} participation {{of government in}} land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster.

Most of the upper and lower Hayfork Creek reaches also are in the Shasta-Trinity forest, while a large amount of private land surrounds its middle reach. Throughout nearly the entire watershed, there are sporadic patches of <b>private</b> <b>lands</b> and Bureau of Land Management-owned lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{origins of}} the Flushing Line emerged on February 25, 1885, {{with the construction of}} the East River Tunnel Railroad in the Steinway Tunnel and an objective to connect the Long Island Rail Road with the New York Central Railroad. Although the East River Tunnel Railroad's builders considered the plan, no action was taken, and the railroad was redesignated as the New York and Long Island Railroad Company in 1887. To run from West 42nd Street and Tenth Avenue to Van Alst Avenue after crossing under the East River, the builders planned {{for the remainder of the}} line to be constructed on <b>private</b> <b>lands,</b> and numerous alterations were made to the proposal. In 1890, William Steinway advised the company to utilize electricity to power the tunnels, believing that the construction of the tunnel would increase the value of his properties in the vicinity.|$|E
