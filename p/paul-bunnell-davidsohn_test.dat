40|$|A novel immunochromatographic assay, the CARDS O. S. MONO test (Pacific Biotech, San Diego, Calif.), and a latex {{agglutination}} test, the Infectious Mononucleosis Kit (Unipath Ltd., Hampshire, United Kingdom) {{were compared}} with the <b>Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn</b> <b>test.</b> Of the 957 serum specimens studied, 78 were positive and 879 were negative by the <b>Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn</b> <b>test.</b> After discrepancies were resolved by determining Epstein-Barr virus serology, the sensitivities of the CARDS O. S. MONO test and the Infectious Mononucleosis Kit were 91. 0 and 96. 2 %, respectively, and both tests had a specificity and a positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value and overall agreement of greater than 99 %. The results show that both tests can accurately detect infectious mononucleosis-associated heterophile antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} included 91 {{patients in}} who an acute or previous EBV infection {{was established by}} ELISA test. All patients were also subjected to the <b>Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn</b> <b>test,</b> while 20 patients were tested by the rapid screening test Clearview IM. The diagnosis of acute infective mononucleosis was in 61 patients (67 %) confirmed by the Elisa test, and in 12 patients (19. 67 %) by the <b>Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn</b> <b>test,</b> while the rapid screening test Clearview IM demonstrated too low a detection of heterophile antibodies. The rapid screening test was not reliable. In 25 % cases, the test was invalid, at early infection stages the rapid test failed to diagnose any case of the EBV virus infection. Paull-Bunell-Davidsohn was often negative, especially with young children. Therefore, priority {{should be given to}} virology tests based on the detection of specific antibodies to EBV antigen...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{microbiological}} {{departments in}} Norway {{have participated in}} a multicenter evaluation of the following commercial tests for detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -specific and heterophile antibodies: CAPTIA Select viral capsid antigen (VCA) -M/G/EBNA (Centocor Inc.), Enzygnost anti-EBV/immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG (Dade Behring), Vironostika EBV VCA IgM/IgG/EBNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Organon Teknika), SEROFLUOR immunofluorescence assay and EBV Combi-Test (Institute Virion Ltd.), anti-EBV recombinant IgM- and IgG-early antigen/EBNA IgG ELISA (Biotest Diagnostics), EBV IgM/IgG/EBNA ELISA (Gull Laboratories), <b>Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn</b> <b>test</b> (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur), Monosticon Dri-Dot (Organon Teknika), Avitex-IM (Omega Diagnostics Ltd.), Alexon Serascan infectious mononucleosis test (Alexon Biomedical Inc.), Clearview IM (Unipath Ltd.), and Cards±OS Mono (Pacific Biotech, Inc.). The test panel included sera from patients with primary EBV infection, immunocompromised patients with recent cytomegalovirus infection, healthy persons (blood donors), and EBV-seronegative persons. Among the tests for EBV-specific antibodies the sensitivity was good, with only small differences between the different assays. However, there was a greater variation in specificity, which varied between 100 % (Enzygnost) and 86 % (Biotest). Tests for detection of heterophile antibodies based on purified or selected antigen (Avitex, Alexon, Clearview IM, and Cards±OS Mono) were more sensitive than the Paul-Bunnell-Davidsohn and Monosticon tests...|$|E
