5000|$|In biochemistry, diamino acids are of {{particular}} interest. Diamino acids are used for the synthesis of specific <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> such as daPNA. Artificial <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> are capable of forming duplex structures with individual DNA- and RNA-strands and are, therefore, not only called DNA-analog, but also they are considered as candidates for the first genetic material on Earth. The corresponding diamino acids such as 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid were detected in the Murchison meteorite [...] and in a simulated comet.|$|E

50|$|The term {{nucleic acid}} is the overall name for DNA and RNA, {{members of a}} family of biopolymers, and is synonymous with polynucleotide. Nucleic acids were named for their initial {{discovery}} within the nucleus, and for the presence of phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid). Although first discovered within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, nucleic acids are now known to be found in all life forms including within bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, chloroplasts, viruses, and viroids. (note: there is debate as to whether viruses are living or non-living). All living cells contain both DNA and RNA (except some cells such as mature red blood cells), while viruses contain either DNA or RNA, but usually not both.The basic component of biological nucleic acids is the nucleotide, each of which contains a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nucleobase.Nucleic acids are also generated within the laboratory, through the use of enzymes (DNA and RNA polymerases) and by solid-phase chemical synthesis. The chemical methods also enable the generation of altered nucleic acids that are not found in nature, for example <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractOverexpression of {{inducible}} {{nitric oxide}} synthase causes the production of high levels of nitric oxide, which, under pathological conditions, leads to immunosuppression and tissue damage. The results recently obtained using <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> rather than traditional oligonucleotides as antigen and antisense molecules, prompted us to test their efficacy in the regulation of nitric oxide production, thereby overcoming the obstacle of cellular internalization. The cellular permeability of four inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} antisense <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> of different lengths was evaluated. These <b>peptide</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> were covalently linked to a hydrophobic peptide moiety to increase internalization and to a tyrosine to allow selective 125 I radiolabelling.

40|$|Oligonucleotide-templated {{reactions}} are valuable tools for <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sensing both in vitro and in vivo.
