2500|$|While instrumentational {{developments}} were important, {{the history}} of HPLC is primarily about the history and evolution of <b>particle</b> <b>technology.</b> [...] After the introduction of porous layer particles, {{there has been a}} steady trend to reduced particle size to improve efficiency. However, by decreasing particle size, new problems arose. The practical disadvantages stem from the excessive pressure drop needed to force mobile fluid through the column and the difficulty of preparing a uniform packing of extremely fine materials. Every time particle size is reduced significantly, another round of instrument development usually must occur to handle the pressure.|$|E

40|$|The annual {{production}} of Portland cement, estimated at 3. 4 billion tons in 2011, {{is responsible for}} about 7 % of the total worldwide CO 2 -emission. To reduce this environmental impact {{it is important to}} use innovative technologies for the design of concrete structures and mixtures. In this paper, it is shown how <b>particle</b> packing <b>technology</b> can be used {{to reduce the amount of}} cement in concrete by concrete mixture optimization, resulting in more sustainable concrete. First, three different methods to determine the particle distribution of a mixture are presented; optimization curves, particle packing models and discrete element modelling. The advantage of using analytical particle packing models is presented based on relations between packing density, water demand and strength. Experiments on ecological concrete demonstrate how effective <b>particle</b> packing <b>technology</b> can be used to reduce the cement content in concrete. Three concrete mixtures with low cement content were developed and the compressive strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, shrinkage, creep and electrical resistance was determined. By using <b>particle</b> packing <b>technology</b> in concrete mixture optimization, it is possible to design concrete in which the cement content is reduced by more than 50 % and the CO 2 -emission of concrete is reduced by 25 %.

An energy dissipation model for particle damper has been presented based on the powder mechanics and the collision theory. The energy dissipation equations of friction and collision motion are developed for the particle damper. The rationality of energy dissipation model has been verified by the experiment and the distributions for the energy dissipation of particles versus acceleration are nonlinear. As the experiment process includes lots of factors of energy dissipation, such as the noise and the air resistance, the experimental value is about 7 % more than the simulation value. The simulation model can provide an effective method {{for the design of}} particle damper. And the particle parameters for damper have been investigated.
