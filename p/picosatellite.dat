5000|$|Desiring {{to shorten}} the {{development}} cycle experienced on OPAL and inspired by the <b>picosatellites</b> OPAL carried, Twiggs {{set out to find}} [...] "how much could you reduce the size and still have a practical satellite". The <b>picosatellites</b> on OPAL were 10.1×7.6×2.5 cm, a size that was not conducive to covering all sides of the spacecraft with solar cells. Inspired by a 4-inch cubic plastic box used to display Beanie Babies in stores, Twiggs first settled on the larger 10-centimeter cube as a guideline for the new (yet-to-be-named) CubeSat concept. A model of a launcher was developed for the new satellite using the same pusher plate concept that had been used in the modified OPAL launcher. Twiggs presented the idea to Puig-Suari in the summer of 1999 and then at the Japan-U.S. Science, Technology and Space Applications Program (JUSTSAP) conference in November 1999.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-five {{years ago}} in 1986, 25 {{microsatellites}} were launched into orbit; 24 were military communications satellites lofted by the former Soviet Union {{as part of a}} communications constellation. No active nanosatellites or <b>picosatellites</b> were launched that year. Last year (2010), 4 microsatellites, 15 nanosatellites, and 3 <b>picosatellites</b> were launched. Small spacecraft have gotten smaller, and they are being used for more than just communications. Advances in micro/nanoelectronics, microelectromechanical systems, solar cell technologies, global positioning systems, and the Internet have allowed small groups of individuals to design, build, and fly ever-smaller satellites with ever-increasing capabilities. In parallel, small satellite containment and deployment systems like the P-POD for CubeSats have been developed to minimize potential negative impacts on the host launch vehicle and primary payload, thus increasing the number of available launch opportunities.

40|$|The MEMS Reaction Control and Maneuvering for Picosat Beyond LEO {{project will}} further develop a multi-functional small {{satellite}} technology for low-power attitude control, or orientation, of <b>picosatellites</b> beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). The Film-Evaporation MEMS Tunable Array (FEMTA) concept initially developed in 2013, is a thermal valving system which utilizes capillary {{forces in a}} microchannel to offset internal pressures in a bulk fluid. The local vapor pressure is increased by resistive film heating until it exceeds meniscus strength in a nozzle which induces vacuum boiling and provides a stagnation pressure equal to vapor pressure at that point which is used for propulsion. Interplanetary CubeSats can utilize FEMTA for high slew rate attitude corrections in addition to desaturating reaction wheels. The FEMTA in cooling mode {{can be used for}} thermal control during high-power communication events, which are likely to accompany the attitude correction.

40|$|A {{new class}} of ultra-small {{satellites}} is emerging {{as a response to}} growing capabilities to integrate more functionality into an ever smaller volume. The satellites are categorized as <b>picosatellites</b> (100 g– 1 kg) and femtosatellites (3 ̆c 100 3 ̆eg) and, due to their small size, they can be much less expensive to launch into orbit. In particular, {{it may be possible to}} deploy them in large numbers to enable missions requiring a distributed fleet of sensor spacecrafts (e. g., distributed aperture, simultaneous spatial sampling). However, without some degree of propulsion, these spacecraft would behave more as an uncontrolled swarm rather than a coordinated, controlled formation. Further, lifetime is limited for lowmass spacecraft with high area-to-mass ratios. This paper shows that a short, electrodynamic (ED) tether is capable of providing propellantless drag cancellation and even the ability to change orbit to <b>picosatellites</b> and femtosatellies in a range of altitudes in LEO. The ED tether can also be used as an antenna for communication to ground.
