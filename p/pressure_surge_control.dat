The analysis of the industrial background and {{the review of the}} academic literature have highlighted some research needs consisting in: - Improvement of the performance of the pressure controller of the compressor - Integration of <b>pressure</b> and <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> - Analysis of the effect of the recycle configuration on the operation of the compressor. Control configurations have been proposed in order to: - Reduce the interaction between control loops - Guarantee the stable and safe operation of the control system - Deal with partial and full recycle operation in supercritical carbon dioxide applications. Dynamic modelling and simulations have been employed in order to analyse the effect of boundary disturbances on the operation of the open and closed loop compression system. The performance of the system has been evaluated by means of graphical representation of controlled and manipulated variables and also by means of proposed performance indicators. These indicators focus on specific aspects of the operation of a compressor such as control performance, power consumption and amount of gas recycled. The results of the thesis demonstrate that better pressure control reduces the risk of surge. Moreover the interaction between <b>pressure</b> controller and <b>surge</b> controller can be avoided by employing a linear model predictive controller. The controller has been tuned according to various control purposes such as energy saving, <b>surge</b> avoidance or <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> performance. The results also demonstrate that the recycle configuration influences <b>surge</b> occurrence, <b>control</b> stability and power consumption of the compression station.

High amplitude <b>pressure</b> <b>surges</b> up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. <b>Pressure</b> <b>surge</b> amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate.

These factors {{make it difficult to}} analyze the transient problem of pressure evolution using simple programming language, especially in the studies that consider only the magnitude of the positive <b>pressure</b> <b>surge</b> with the negative pressure phase being neglected. Research objectives: determine the magnitude of the negative pressure in the pipes on the experimental model. The propagation distance of the negative pressure wave will be simulated by the valve closure scenarios {{with the help of the}} HAMMER software and it is compared with an experimental model to verify the quality the results. Materials and methods: academic version of the Bentley HAMMER software is used to simulate the <b>pressure</b> <b>surge</b> wave propagation due to closure of the valve in water supply pipe network. The method of characteristics is used to solve the governing equations of transient process of pressure change in the pipeline.

Determination of these values in real-life network is relatively costly and time-consuming but nevertheless necessary for identification of the risk of pipe failure, and therefore, this paper proposes using the simulation model by the HAMMER software.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{compressor}} instabilities in gas turbine engines has received much attention in recent ears. In particular, rotating stall and surge are major causes of problems ranging from component stress and lifespan reduction to engine explosion. In this thesis, modeling {{and control of}} rotating stall and surge using bleed valve and air injection is studied and validated on a low speed, single stage, axial compressor at Caltech. Bleed valve control of stall is achieved only when the compressor characteristic is actuated, due to the fast growth rate of the stall cell compared to the rate limit of the valve. Furthermore, experimental {{results show that the}} actuator rate requirement for stall control is reduced by a factor of fourteen via compressor characteristic actuation. Analytical expressions based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and a high fidelity simulation (37 states) tool are developed to estimate the minimum rate requirement of a bleed valve for control of stall. A comparison of the tools to experiments show a good qualitative agreement, with increasing quantitative accuracy as the complexity of the underlying model increases. Air injection control of stall and surge is also investigated. Simultaneous control of stall and surge is achieved using axisymmetric air injection. Three cases with different injector back <b>pressure</b> are studied. <b>Surge</b> <b>control</b> via binary air injection is achieved in all three cases. Simultaneous stall and <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> is achieved for two of the cases, but is not achieved for the lowest authority case. This is consistent with previous results for control of stall with axisymmetric air injection without a plenum attached. Non—axisymmetric air injection control of stall and surge is also studied. Three existing control algorithms found in literature are modeled and analyzed. A three—state model is obtained for each algorithm. For two cases, conditions for linear stability and bifurcation criticality on control of rotating stall are derived and expressed in terms of implementation—oriented variables such as number of injectors. For the third case, bifurcation criticality conditions are not obtained due to complexity, though linear stability property is derived. A theoretical comparison between the three algorithms is made, via the use of low—order models, to investigate pros and cons of the algorithms in the context of operability. The effects of static distortion on the compressor facility at Caltech is characterized experimentally. Results consistent with literature are obtained. Simulations via a high fidelity model (34 states) are also performed and show good qualitative as well as quantitative agreement to experiments.
