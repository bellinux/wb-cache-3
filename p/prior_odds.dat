Multiple logistic regression modeled the associations with falls (any fall or injurious fall) during 2 years prior to the baseline interview, and baseline fear of falling and falls efficacy with 2 -year prospective risks for falling and fear of falling. Results: The most consistent association for all outcomes was depressive symp-toms. Age was associated with increased risk of prior and prospective falls. Lower-body functional limita-tions were associated with prior falls, baseline fear of falling, and low falls efficacy, whereas low ability with one-leg stands prospectively predicted fear of falling.

When a prosecutor has collected some evidence (for instance a DNA match) {{and has an}} expert testify that the probability of finding this evidence if the accused were innocent is tiny, the fallacy occurs if it is concluded that the probability of the accused being innocent must be comparably tiny. If the DNA match is used to confirm guilt which is otherwise suspected then it is indeed strong evidence. However, if the DNA evidence is the sole evidence against the accused and the accused was picked out of a large database of DNA profiles, the odds of the match being made at random may be increased, and less damaging to the defendant. The odds in this scenario do not relate to the odds of being guilty, {{they relate to the}} odds of being picked at random. While the odds of being picked at random may be low for an individual condition implying guilt, i.e. a positive DNA match, the probability of being picked at random for any condition grows to 1 as more conditions are considered, {{as is the case in}} multiple testing.

Recent large-scale genetic studies may provide additional tools in this regard. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genetic risk scores (GRSs) were constructed in 1, 175 self-identified European American (EA) individuals comprising the family-based Diabetes Heart Study based on 1) 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2) 30 SNPs with previously documented associations with CVD in genome-wide association studies. Associations between each GRS and a self-reported history of CVD, coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC) determined by noncontrast computed tomography scan, all-cause mortality, and CVD mortality were examined using marginal models with generalized estimating equations and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The weighted 13 -SNP GRS was associated with <b>prior</b> CVD (<b>odds</b> ratio [OR] 1. 51 [95 % CI 1. 22 – 1. 86]; P = 0. 0002), CAC (β-coefficient [β] 0. 22 [0. 02 – 0. 43]; P = 0. 04) and CVD mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 35 [1. 10 – 1. 81]; P = 0. 04) when adjusting for the other known CVD risk factors: age, sex, type 2 diabetes affection status, BMI, current smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The weighted 30 -SNP GRS was also associated with prior CVD (OR 1. 33 [1. 08 – 1. 65]; P = 0. 008), CAC (β 0. 29 [0. 08 – 0. 50]; P = 0. 006), all-cause mortality (HR 1. 28 [1. 05 – 1. 56]; P = 0. 01), and CVD mortality (HR 1. 46 [1. 08 – 1. 96]; P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility of two simple GRSs in examining genetic associations for adverse outcomes in EAs with type 2 diabetes. No Full Tex...|$|R
