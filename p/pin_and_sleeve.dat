As with most other connectors, the gender assignment thus corresponds to the innermost electrical component. There are also reverse-polarity ("RP") SMA connectors in which the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> are swapped; so that the [...] "male" [...] RP-SMA has a center sleeve surrounded by an inside-threaded barrel, and the [...] "female" [...] RP-SMA has a center pin and an outside-threaded barrel.

50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sleeve</b> {{circular}} connectors are not {{compatible with}} the newer IEC 60309 type. Current ratings are 30, 60, 100, 200, and 400 A. All are rated for voltages up to 250 V DC or 600 V AC. Contact arrangements are from 2 to 4 pins. There are two styles depending on {{the treatment of the}} ground. Style 1 grounds only on the shell. Style 2 uses one of the contacts as well as the shell, internally connected together. They are not strongly typed for specific circuits and voltages as the IEC 309 are. One insert rotation option is available to prevent mating of similar connectors with different voltages.|$|E

This is {{the arrangement of the}} <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> which occurs when the tool is plunged into the material. The basic positions can be divided into two categories. In the first category, the sleeve and the pin are above the sheet surface or below sheet surface and in the second category the pin is retracted within the sleeve or protrudes from it...|$|E
50|$|The fin {{attachment}} <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> <b>sleeves</b> in the Convair 580 airliner were {{specified by}} the aircraft manufacturer to be hardened to a Vickers Hardness specification of 390HV5, the '5' meaning five kiloponds. However, on the aircraft flying Partnair Flight 394 the pins were later found to have been replaced with sub-standard parts, leading to rapid wear and finally loss of the aircraft. On examination, accident investigators found that the sub-standard pins had a hardness value of only some 200-230HV5.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} a novel low profile antenna is {{presented}} in this paper. By a cross-shaped structure shorted to the ground plane through shorting probes, the size reduction is achieved. A top-loading ring-disc is successfully employed to broaden the impedance bandwidth. Moreover, with the uniformly-arranged shorting <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> a circular <b>sleeve</b> structure placed on the ground, a good omnidirectional performance in the horizontal plane is obtained. An antenna prototype has been implemented and characterized. A measured impedance bandwidth for VSWR ≤ 2 of about 135 % ranging from 1500 to 7800 MHz is achieved, and a monopole-like radiation pattern is also produced. The height of the proposed antenna is very low with 0. 07 λ tall. The proposed antenna is very suitable for indoor base station and the UWB applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{record of}} path of {{insertion}} on the dental cast {{is part of}} the dentist′s work authorization to the dental laboratory technician. The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD). Materials and Methods: The recording of the relation of a cast to a dental surveyor and the transfer of this relationship to the dental laboratory may be done by tripodization, by scoring the base of the cast, or by cementing a reference pin on the cast. Conclusion: Recording the established path of insertion can be difficult when the procedure uses a cemented pin and the casts are mounted in an articulator. This article describes a procedure for innovative dowel <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> device to record the path of insertion of RPDs, which serves the same purpose as the cemented pin but can be easily removed and replaced...|$|E

25|$|After {{investigators}} recovered {{all four}} bolts, <b>sleeves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pins,</b> {{they found that}} the parts that were not replaced were counterfeit and were incorrectly heat-treated during manufacture. Those bolts each could bear only about 60% of their intended breaking strength, making them less than practical to use on the aircraft. The fake bolts <b>and</b> <b>sleeves</b> wore down excessively, causing the tail to vibrate for 16 completed flights and the accident flight.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current space suits {{have limited}} {{movement}} due to gas pressurization during {{exposure to the}} vacuum of space. Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Pressure distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve,</b> only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials. Pressure levels over the hand and wrist {{are similar to those}} of the current U. S. space suit glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve,</b> but additional development is required to increase MCP over the forearm and upper arm...|$|R
