50|$|A {{delivery}} wagon is a wagon used {{to deliver}} merchandise such as milk, bread, or produce to houses or markets, {{as well as}} to commercial customers, often in urban settings. The concept of express wagons and of <b>paneled</b> <b>delivery</b> vans developed in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, delivery wagons were often finely painted, lettered and varnished, so as to serve as advertisement for the particular business through the quality of the wagon. Special forms of delivery wagon include an ice wagon and a milk wagon.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the digital {{control of a}} novel single-phase three-port bidirectional (STB) converter used to interface renewables from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EVs) with the power grid. Using an appropriated power theory, the STB converter {{can be used to}} exchange ener-gy between the PVs, the EVs and the power grid in four distinct modes: (1) The EV receives energy from the power grid (G 2 V - grid-to-vehicle operation mode) or delivers energy to the power grid (V 2 G - vehicle-to-grid operation mode); (2) All the energy produced by the PV <b>panels</b> is <b>delivery</b> to the power grid; (3) All the energy produced by the PV <b>panels</b> is <b>delivery</b> to the EV; (4) The EV can receive energy simultaneously from the PV panels and from the power grid (G 2 V). The currents of the power grid, PV panels and EV are con-trolled through independent predictive current control strategies, which ensure good power quality levels. This paper {{presents the}} architecture of the proposed STB converter and the detailed explanation of the digital implementation of the control algorithms, namely, the power theory and the predictive current control strategies. The control algorithms were validated through computational simula-tions and experimental results.

A similar series was FJs at Work which advertised different home appliance companies like Malleys, Hotpoint, Metters and Simpson. To enable use with many promotions, boxes were decorated generically with newspaper graphics, with none prominent. Stickers were added to the boxes to identify the paper highlighted on the van.|$|R

5000|$|His main {{surviving}} {{works are}} two large altarpieces, the first executed in oil for San Lorenzo Maggiore, probably commissioned about 1445 by Alfonso, which was dispersed in the Napoleonic period. The main <b>panel</b> is <b>Delivery</b> of the Franciscan Rule, whose composition was probably {{inspired by a}} late thirteenth century fresco above {{the door of the}} Chapter House there, showing the saint giving his Rule to the Minor Friars and the Poor Clares. The fresco {{can be seen in the}} monastery Museum. The Colantonio painting hangs in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, along with Saint Jerome in his study, full of Netherlandish detail, which was also part of the altarpiece. This was strongly influenced by a Jan van Eyck depiction of the same subject, then belonging to King Alfonso and located in Naples. Other smaller panels are in various other collections.|$|R
5000|$|Most diecast model {{vehicles}} {{are made of}} the zinc alloy called zamac (also called 'mazak') but many collectible models are made through a different process rendering white metal. Most diecast cars come from the automated injection of molten metal into machined dies, but white metal models are hand-built and produced in far fewer numbers. As the Brooklin website states, this process works better for producing hundreds of vehicles, not hundreds of thousands, or millions. The average run for a Brooklin Model in the 1990s was about 3,000 pieces, though there are special issues of 1,000 cars or less (Brooklin 1994). A few, however, were produced in higher numbers. Between 7,000 to 10,000 of the 1953 Chevrolet <b>panel</b> sedan <b>delivery,</b> were produced (Olson 2008, p. 130). This model appeared in many different promotional liveries, like Gulf Oil, Sunoco, and Trans-Canada Airlines (Olson 2008, pp. 131-132). Most Brooklin models are produced over a five-year period.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1920s trains, cars, trucks, {{military}} vehicles, aircraft, pistols and {{a variety}} of other toys were manufactured by Dowst. Vehicles often had white rubber tires which over time become brittle and often have not survived play-wear and time. One of the unique offerings were a set of 1932 Graham diecast cars - Tootsietoy offered a Graham sedan, town car, coupe, roadster, dual cowl convertible, <b>delivery</b> <b>panel</b> truck and tow truck (Seeley No Date a). A marque not often seen in miniature since, Graham was a household name at Tootsietoy.

40|$|To obtain vehicle {{registration}} data that consistently and accurately reflect {{the distinction between}} automobiles and light-duty trucks, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was asked by FHWA to estimate the current and historical {{vehicle registration}} numbers of automobiles and of other two-axle four-tire vehicles (i. e., light-duty trucks), and their associated travel. The term automobile is synonymous with passenger car. Passenger cars are defined as all sedans, coupes, and station wagons manufactured primarily {{for the purpose of}} carrying passengers. This includes taxicabs, rental cars, and ambulances and hearses on an automobile chassis. Light-duty trucks refer to all two-axle four-tire vehicles other than passenger cars. They include pickup trucks, <b>panel</b> trucks, <b>delivery</b> and passenger vans, and other vehicles such as campers, motor homes, ambulances on a truck chassis, hearses on a truck chassis, and carryalls. In this study, light-duty trucks include four major types: (1) pickup truck, (2) van, (3) sport utility vehicle, and (4) other 2 -axle 4 -tire truck. Specifically, this project re-estimates statistics that appeared in Tables MV- 1 and MV- 9 of the 1995 Highway Statistics. Given the complexity of the approach developed in this effort and the incompleteness and inconsistency of the state-submitted data, it is recommended that alternatives be considered by FHWA to obtain vehicle registration data. One alternative is the Polk`s NVPP data (via the US Department of Transportation`s annual subscription to Polk). The second alternative is to obtain raw registration files from individual states` Departments of Motor Vehicles and to decode individual VINs...|$|R
