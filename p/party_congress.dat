5|$|In 1934, the 17th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> {{refrained from}} {{formally}} re-electing Stalin as General Secretary. However, Stalin was re-elected into all other positions and remained {{leader of the}} party without diminishment.|$|E

He was then tipped to leave the Ministry of Commerce and take over as party chief of Chongqing. Bo's predecessor, political rival Wang Yang, was reassigned as party chief of Guangdong.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{announced}} {{his intention to}} dissolve the CRPP and return to FUNCINPEC. At a <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> on 19 January 2015, he was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president; his half-sister and previous FUNCINPEC president, Norodom Arunrasmy became the first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. In March 2015, Ranariddh held another <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> where he appointed four more vice-presidents to the FUNCINPEC executive committee. He also convinced the congress to adopt a new party logo, which had a design almost identical that of the now-defunct CRPP. Ranariddh supported {{the formation of the}} Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for FUNCINPEC from younger voters, which he was appointed as its honorary president.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels {{spoke at}} party {{meetings}} in Munich {{and at the}} annual <b>Party</b> <b>Congress,</b> held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels {{was involved in the}} planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolize him even more.|$|E

5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> in 2012. His political fortunes {{came to an abrupt}} end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two.|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 {{it became apparent that}} Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E

5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{expressed}} his intent {{to return to}} FUNCINPEC. At the <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> held on 19 January 2015, Ranariddh was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president, succeeding Arunrasmy who was appointed as its first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. However, rifts between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh quickly surfaced as {{the both of them}} sparred with each other over the right to use the party stamp and the appointment of Say Hak as the party's secretary general. Ranariddh eventually gained the upper hand, and Say Hak's appointment was reaffirmed at another <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> held in March 2015. He also managed to convince party delegates present at the congress to adopt a new party logo. At the same time, Ranariddh appointed four more vice-presidents to the party's executive committee, namely You Hockry, Por Bun Sreu, Nuth Sokhom and Nhep Bun Chin.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E

5|$|Lê Duẩn's {{foreign policy}} was criticised by Hoàng Văn Hoan, who {{accused him of}} sacrificing the country's sovereignty. A {{delegation}} led by Vitaly Vorotnikov, visited Vietnam during its National Day, the holiday that celebrated the establishment of North Vietnam after the August Revolution and met with Lê Duẩn. Lê Duẩn attended the 27th Communist <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> and later met with Gorbachev. Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Anatoly Dobrynin attended Lê Duẩn's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee elects the Politburo in the {{aftermath}} of the <b>Party</b> <b>Congress.</b> Since the full Central Committee meets only once a year, the Politburo functions as the Party's leading collective decision-making body. The Secretariat is also elected by the Central Committee, and is headed by the General Secretary. It is responsible for solving organisational problems and implementing the demands of the Central Committee. The Secretariat oversees the work of the Commissions of the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|After World War II (Great Patriotic War), Molotov was {{involved}} in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to Andrei Vyshinsky. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov {{in a speech to}} the 19th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress.</b> However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.|$|E

5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|At this congress, Kim Il-sung {{designated}} his son Kim Jong-il as his successor. The {{move was}} {{criticized by the}} South Korean media and ruling communist parties of the socialist states in Eastern Europe and Asia because it was considered nepotist. The congress also saw the WPK and North Korea move away from orthodox communism by emphasizing the Juche idea over Marxism–Leninism, giving the party a nationalistic bent. The next <b>party</b> <b>congress</b> was not convened before 2016, despite party rules that stipulated that a congress had to be held every fifth year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th <b>Party</b> <b>Congress</b> about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E

[...] Attendance at <b>party</b> <b>congresses</b> was frequently given as a reward for long service. [...] Parties also sometimes held national conferences to address specific issues.|$|R
