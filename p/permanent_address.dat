25|$|Queensland was {{renowned for}} being the lowest taxed state in Australia for much of Bjelke-Petersen's tenure. Over heated {{objections}} by Treasurer Gordon Chalk, Bjelke-Petersen in 1977 announced the removal of state death duties, a move that cost his state $30 million in revenue. So many New South Wales and Victorian residents sought to establish their <b>permanent</b> <b>address</b> in Queensland as a result, boosting state coffers with stamp duty from property transactions, that other states followed suit within months and also abolished the tax. To help compensate for lost revenue, the government introduced football pools; four years later the government granted a casino licence on the Gold Coast, although this too was mired in allegations of corruption and favouritism.|$|E

25|$|Clark, who {{had promised}} to serve as mayor for only one term, {{announced}} his candidacy for the United States Senate in 1956. After winning the Democratic nomination over the opposition of Philadelphia's party leaders, he faced first-term Republican incumbent James H. Duff, a popular former governor, in the general election. During the campaign, Clark ran on a liberal platform which included support for increasing the minimum wage, expanding Social Security, and repealing the Taft–Hartley Act. He also criticized President Dwight D. Eisenhower on international and domestic matters, and attacked Senator Duff's poor attendance record. On November 6, 1956, Clark narrowly defeated Duff {{by a margin of}} 50.1%-49.7%, winning by less than 18,000 out of 4.5 million votes cast.

25|$|Without any <b>permanent</b> <b>address,</b> {{the family}} had to spend {{irregular}} vagrancy life living {{in the corners of}} their relatives manors in various parts of Sweden. This was in Margit Sandemo's opinion somewhat humiliating. During her time in Sweden, she missed her birthplace in Valdres, Norway, which she still considered her true national place. Also her mother's occupation as a teacher may {{have been one of the}} reasons for moving so often. Margit took her compulsory education in a nine-year girl school, after which she studied in various night schools, as in an art school and was as an auditor in Dramaten. She got good grades, the best for behaviour, even though she took never schooling seriously. Sandemo had a gift for arts as a child. She was skilled at painting, singing, playing and poetry, making her mother very proud. However, she did not have any dreams to become a novelist. Margit spent her childhood summer at the estate of her grandparents in Blekinge.|$|E
25|$|Many lodges were {{attached}} British Army regiments. The Moderns {{may have been}} wary of warranting lodges without a <b>permanent</b> <b>address,</b> so {{there was only one}} Grand Lodge of England warrant in the continental army from 1775–1777. The Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were slightly better represented, but the overwhelming majority of regimental lodges held warrants from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Thus it was that a group of African Americans, having been rejected by the lodges in Boston, were initiated into Lodge No 441 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was attached to the 38th Foot (later the 1st Staffordshire). These 15 men formed African Lodge No 1, as the British departed, leaving them a permit to do almost everything but admit new masons. Two of the members were seafarers, and obtained entrance to a lodge in London, being recognised as regularly initiated Masons. This enabled their master, Prince Hall, to apply to the Moderns for a charter, which was duly granted on 29 September 1784, now as African Lodge No 459. Such was the success of the lodge that it became a Provincial Grand Lodge, and Prince Hall the Provincial Grand Master. After his death, the provincial lodges reconstituted themselves as a grand lodge (African Grand Lodge), becoming Prince Hall Grand Lodge in 1847.|$|E

500|$|From the beginning, Malouma sang in {{a variety}} of languages, {{including}} traditional Arabic, Hassania (Mauritanian Arabic), French and Wolof. By singing in various languages, she sought to air her message to a broader audience. It was not long before she appeared on television together with her sister, Emienh, and her brother, Arafat, an instrumentalist. Their style was controversial, especially after the release of her song [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] and a 1988 appearance at the Carthage Festival in Tunis, as she addressed social issues, such as poverty, inequality and disease which were not generally acceptable in Mauritania. Her participation in the Carthage event led to her subsequent appearance on Arab satellite channels, giving her greater exposure. Malouma became nationally known and was a sought after performer until a 1991 song about freedom of speech. After being censored for writing songs promoting women's rights and challenging apartheid, she was banned from appearing on television and radio, holding concerts, and was even denied a <b>permanent</b> <b>address.</b> She did not perform anywhere for a lengthy period but in the late 1990s she began to sing in other African countries, in Europe, and in the United States. While she won audiences among the people, Malouma was persecuted by both the moral authorities and authoritarian governments, her music being completely banned until 2003 when a crowd of 10,000 successfully called on President Ould Taya to cancel her censorship. Some restrictions still remained until the overthrow of the Ould Taya regime in 2005.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Cynthia went on {{vacation}} to Greece, leaving Lennon at Kenwood with Shotton. After {{several days of}} taking LSD and smoking marijuana, Lennon convened {{a meeting at the}} Beatles' business HQ to inform the others that he felt he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Later that day he phoned Ono, whose own husband Tony (Anthony Cox) was in Paris on business, and invited her to Kenwood. Shotton left the two alone, whereupon Lennon invited Ono (who had also taken LSD) up to the attic to hear his largely experimental non-Beatles' recordings. For the rest of the night, the two collaborated on what became the [...] album, and then [...] "made love at dawn", according to Lennon. Cynthia returned early from her vacation, and discovered Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor and staring intently into each other's eyes (Ono was wearing one of Cynthia's bathrobes). In a state of shock, Cynthia then left to stay with friends for a few days, although Lennon and Cynthia were reconciled for a time upon her return to Kenwood. It was during Cynthia's next holiday in Italy that Lennon and Ono finally entered into a permanent relationship, and Lennon asked for a divorce. Cynthia, together with Julian and her mother, moved back into Kenwood for the summer, where Paul McCartney visited her to offer his support. On the journey to Kenwood he composed the song [...] "Hey Jude", which eventually became The Beatles' biggest selling single. Lennon and Ono, meanwhile, were without a <b>permanent</b> <b>address</b> for a time. They stayed with McCartney at his house in Cavendish Avenue (where it is alleged that a further breach occurred in the Lennon–McCartney relationship when Lennon discovered a derogatory note written by McCartney) and with Peter Brown and then Neil Aspinall, before moving into an apartment leased by Starr at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone in London. They were evicted from this flat by the owner following a raid by the drug squad on 18 October 1968, and subsequent November trial, and so moved back into Kenwood for a short time, which had been vacated by Cynthia. In the new year Ono and Lennon moved into the Dorchester Hotel in London, leaving Kenwood for the last time.|$|E

40|$|As IP {{addresses}} {{have become}} a scarce resource most computers on the Internet no longer have <b>permanent</b> <b>addresses.</b> For client computers this is usually not a big problem but {{with the advent of}} P 2 P systems, where every computer acts both as a client and as a server, this has become increasingly problematic. In advanced P 2 P systems ad-hoc connections to peers have to be established, which can only be done if the receiving peer has a <b>permanent</b> IP <b>address.</b> In this paper we propose an approach for a completely decentralized, self-maintaining, light-weight, and sufficiently secure peer identification service that allows us to consistently map unique peer identifications onto dynamic IP addresses in environments with low online probability of the peers constituting the service. For security we apply a combination of PGP-like public key distribution and a quorum-based query scheme. We describe the algorithm as implemented in our P-Grid P 2 P lookup system and give a detailed analytical performance analysis demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our approach. Our approach also can easily be adapted to other application domains, i. e., be used for other name services, because we do not impose any constraints on the type of mappings...|$|R

Richard Meinertzhagen asserts that the rescue took place on July 1, 1918, a date that might have been inaccurate. Meinertzhagen wrote that the rescue was not a complete success because not all the family was rescued. [...] "One child was literally thrown into the plane at Ekaterinburg, much bruised and brought to England where she still is." [...] Critics say that Meinertzhagen's diaries were fantasy. Meinertzhagen's wife, Amorel, traveled from Canada to the United Kingdom aboard the Canadian ship Corsican in August 1918, while the war was still taking place. In the adjoining cabin was a 22-year-old masseuse named Marguerite Lindsay, for whom Occleshaw could find no birth or <b>permanent</b> <b>address</b> records. Occleshaw identified Marguerite Lindsay as a possible cover name for a rescued grand duchess. [...] However, the Ellis Island Web site has two separate listings for travel to New York by passengers named Marguerite Lindsay in 1915 and again in 1923. The Marguerite Lindsay who traveled in 1915 gave her age as 18 and her place of residence as Montreal, Canada; the Marguerite Lindsay who traveled in 1923 gave her age as 27 and her residence as New York City. The Bolsheviks were also reportedly alarmed by an airplane flying over the Ipatiev House in mid-July 1918, Sir Charles Eliot, the British High Commander for Siberia, later reported.
