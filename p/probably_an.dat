5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> indication of the antiquity of {{the tradition of the}} story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{has figured}} {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies {{of his life}} and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure. This is a non-stoichiometric compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH3 is reached. Like LaI2 and LaI, LaH2 is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> electride compound.|$|E
50|$|Welshe's life remains obscure. There {{are other}} Welshes within Morpeth, Northumberland at this time, {{indicating}} he was <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> local man, and <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> burgess of the town.|$|R
25|$|If the loops lie {{across the}} shoe (left to right), the knot is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> square knot. If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> granny knot.|$|R
2500|$|... "Phyllonorycter" [...] fennicella Hering, 1924, {{this species}} was {{described}} from Finland. The larval hostplant is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Salix species. The present taxonomic status is unknown, but is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> junior subjective synonym of Lithocolletis viminetorum or Lithocolletis salictella.|$|R
5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> attempt by the birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
5|$|On the Roman side, Ammianus attests one vexillatio of equites sagittarii (mounted archers) at Strasbourg. It is {{also likely}} {{that at least one}} {{regiment}} of foot archers took part, <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> auxilium of sagittarii (archers). There were thus probably about 1,000 archers in dedicated units on the Roman side. In addition, a number of ordinary infantry units probably included archers.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus was a monk from Rome {{sent to the}} Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, {{along with}} Mellitus and others, {{as part of the}} second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further {{activities}} until he went to Northumbria.|$|E

25|$|The 9th century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical {{discussion of}} instruments cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical {{instrument of the}} Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (<b>probably</b> <b>a</b> type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (<b>probably</b> <b>a</b> bagpipe).|$|R
5|$|Several archaeological {{investigations}} into the tower were {{carried out in the}} post war period. Investigations were carried out during the renovations throughout 1948 to 1956. Further work followed to the east of the tower between 1962 and 1964, uncovering the landing dock. Another project was carried out in 1994 and 1995, uncovering part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining timber house, and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one of the wooden doors on the second floor was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> original feature from 1365.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{smaller than}} Earth's Moon, Europa is {{primarily}} made of silicate rock {{and has a}} water-ice crust and <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{space is}} bathed in soft light, <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E

5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a {{gigantic}} evil sea serpent of Orcadian folklore, capable of contaminating plants and destroying {{animals and humans}} with its putrid breath. It is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent, or world serpent, and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5000|$|Cylicioscapha is an extinct genus {{of fossil}} mollusk, <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> gastropod, a robust-looking euomphalid {{from the upper}} Paleozoic of North America.|$|R

5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his {{residence}} from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling.|$|E
