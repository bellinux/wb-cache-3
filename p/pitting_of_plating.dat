40|$|Abstract — Magnetic {{non-destructive}} testing {{is limited to}} surface inspection, however demand {{for the detection of}} deep defects is increasing. Therefore, we developed a magnetic flux leakage (MFL) system using a tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) device that has high sensitivity and wide frequency range in order to detect deep defects. Using the developed system, back-side <b>pits</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>plates</b> having different depth and diameter were measured and 2 D images were created. Moreover, we analyzed the detected vector signal with optimized phase data. As a result, the developed MFL system can detect a defect that has a wall thinning rate of more than 56 % of 8. 6 mm thick steel plates. Furthermore, the defect’s diameter size was estimated by spatial signal change. Keywords-MFL; magnetic imaging; TMR device; Low-Freaquency field; back-side pit. I...|$|R

5000|$|Canoscio was {{the site}} where a 6th‑century paleo-Christian dinner service of 25 silver pieces came to light under the plough in 1935: the pieces in the Canoscio hoard, now {{displayed}} in the Museo del Duomo, Città di Castello, as Early Christian liturgical silver, may not all have been expressly designed for liturgical use. The pieces, found carefully stowed under a large plate for protection as they were being buried in a shallow <b>pit,</b> consist <b>of</b> six <b>plates,</b> two patens, three unmarked hemispherical chalices, a pyx with its cover, also unmarked, two strainers, a small ladle and nine spoons of purely domestic character. Not all the objects are in forms that {{can be related to}} the liturgy. Names of Aelianus and Felicitas, probably donors, are inscribed on one of the patens. The large plate that protected the hoard, was shattered by the plough: reassembled, it reveals the inscription in its center DE DONIS DEI ET SANCTI MARTYRIS AGAPITI UTERE FELIX.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pitting {{corrosion}} is a {{great concern}} when the integrity of ship's hull structures is considered. Corrosion pits with a conical shape are typically observed on coated hold frames in way of cargo holds of bulk carriers which exclusively carry coal and iron ore. Therefore, {{it is important to}} investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion on local strength of hold frames of bulk carriers. In the present study, a series of 3 -point bend tests with structural models which consist of web, shell and face plates has been conducted. In these tests, a concentrated load has been vertically applied at the center of simply supported models so that shear load would act on the web plate with artificial pits. In this testing condition, load increased even after shear buckling occurred. When there is artificial <b>pitting,</b> fracture <b>of</b> web <b>plates</b> occurs due to strain concentration at the pits. It has been revealed that the empirical formula, which was developed based on non-linear FE-analyses, overestimates the equivalent thickness for the shear ultimate strength obtained in the present experiment, because the effect of web fracture is not taken into account in the analyses...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} the anatomical, chemical and physics characteristics of candeia wood (Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) Macleish). Five trees {{were collected from}} Carrancas-MG, and disks were obtained at the breast high (DBH) to sample preparation. The description and mensuration were performed at the principal anatomical structures (fibers, vessel and radial parenchyma). For chemical analysis, the extractives content, hollocelulose, lignin and inorganic components were determined. The physical properties included the basic specific gravity, specific gravity at 12 % moisture content as well as tangential, radial and volumetric shrinkage and coefficients of shrinkage and anisotropy. The main results found for macroscopic characteristics were: awkward odor due to presence of oil-resin; reversal grain and hardness to the cut; microscopical characteristics: scarce parenchyma axial and radial very thin, elements of vases with numerous and very small <b>pits,</b> short <b>plates</b> <b>of</b> simple perforation, libriforms fibers with thick cellular wall and presence of oil cells in the ray. Chemical composition: 20. 89 % total extractives; 50. 52 % holocelulose; 28. 59 % lignin and 0. 39 % of inorganic constituents. The specific gravity at 12 % was of 0. 98 g/cm 3 and the basic specific gravity of 0. 79 g/cm 3.
