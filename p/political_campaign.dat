5|$|In February 2017, then-Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing {{said that}} if a {{minority}} candidate leaves their group representation constituency (GRC), a by-election will not be called. Chan claimed that the goals of having enough minority members in Parliament, and to ensure no <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> on issues of race and religion, would still be met even if the minority member of the GRC left.|$|E
5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring voting machines in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt to succeed him {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It was the only time in the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> against the insurgency.|$|E

50|$|<b>Political</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{have existed}} {{as long as}} there have been {{informed}} citizens to campaign amongst. Democratic societies have regular election <b>campaigns,</b> but <b>political</b> <b>campaigning</b> can occur on particular issues even in non-democracies so long as freedom of expression is allowed. Often mass campaigns are started by the less privileged or anti-establishment viewpoints (as against more powerful interests whose first resort is lobbying).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and least understood of the software applications in <b>political</b> <b>campaigns</b> is so-called geographical information systems, or GIS. It is technology that allows campaigns to systematically look at their constituencies in new ways, through multilayered and colorful maps. Through a combination of cartography and demographic research, GIS allows candidates and <b>political</b> <b>campaigns</b> to access voters in a multimedia context that can be put together with the most advanced techniques from marketing and demographics to create a sophisticated form of mapping technology with direct applicability to <b>political</b> <b>campaigns.</b> This article is a review of GIS software applications in <b>political</b> <b>campaigns,</b> with particular attention to its use in the 1992 presidential election by the Clinton campaign...|$|R

5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought <b>political</b> <b>campaign,</b> Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler.

However, Cheng Shuyao was soon embroiled in the Five-anti Campaign, a <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> launched by Mao against the capitalist class in 1952. He was accused of embezzlement and confessed to the charges under pressure. Shangguan decided to divorce Cheng; their marriage lasted less than two years.

5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's <b>political</b> <b>campaign,</b> which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|According to Firishta, Malik Kafur, {{the head}} general of Alauddin Khalji, {{the ruler of}} Delhi Sultanate, reached Rameswaram during his <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> in spite of stiff {{resistance}} from the Pandyan princes in the early 14th century. He erected a mosque by name Alia al-Din Khaldji in honour of victory of Islam. During the early 15th century, the present day Ramanathapuram, Kamuthi and Rameswaram {{were included in the}} Pandya dynasty. In 1520 CE, the town came under the rule of Vijayanagara Empire. The Sethupathis, the breakaway from Madurai Nayaks, ruled Ramanathapuram and contributed to the Ramanathaswamy temple. The most notable of them are the contributions of Muthu Kumara Ragunatha and Muthu Ramalinga Sethupathi, who transformed the temple to an architectural ensemble. The region was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740 – 1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725 – 1764 CE) in the middle of 18th century. In 1795 CE, Rameswaram came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency. After 1947, the town became a part of Independent India.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year, the Referendum Party had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise {{to carry out a}} <b>political</b> <b>campaign,</b> establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the centre, region and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing a <b>political</b> <b>campaign</b> bid {{while working as}} a news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff {{he was not going to}} run for Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E
