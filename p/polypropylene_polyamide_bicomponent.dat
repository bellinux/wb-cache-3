40|$|Background and aim: The {{increasing}} number of surgical procedures performed with local anesthesia, followed by immediate patient discharge from the hospital, emphasizes {{the need for a}} tight waterproof suture that is capable of maintaining its tensile strength in the postoperative phase when the wound tumescence, edema due to the anesthetic drug, and surgical trauma disappear. Moreover, the issue of having an accurate surgical wound closure is very relevant in vivo in order to prevent hemorrhage and exogenous microbial infections. This study aimed at designing a new a lab technique {{that could be used for}} evaluating the best surgical material. Using such a technique, we compared the wound-lip-sealing properties of three commonly-used suture threads, namely polyurethane, <b>polypropylene,</b> and <b>polyamide.</b> Materials and methods: The mechanical properties of same-size suture threads made from polyurethane, <b>polypropylene,</b> and <b>polyamide,</b> were compared in order to define the one that possess the best elastic properties by being able to counteract the tension-relaxation process in the first 12 hours following surgery. The tension holding capacity of the suture materials was measured in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. The surface area of the scar associated with the three different suture threads was measured and compared, and the permeability of the three different suture threads was assessed at 0 minute, 2 minute, 4 minute, 6 minute, and 8 minute- interval. Results: Results showed that polyurethane suture threads had significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) better tensile strength, elongation endurance before breakage, and better elasticity coefficient as compared to <b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide</b> suture threads. Moreover, polyurethane suture threads were significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) more impermeable as compared to the other two suture thread types (<b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide).</b> This impermeability was also associated with a tighter wound-lip-sealing ability, and with significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) less scar formation. Conclusion: Among the main concerns that surgeons, physicians, and patients often have is the development infection, oozing, and scar at the incision site following suturing. This always raises the question about which suture to use to avoid the above problems. This study provides evidence that the new technique developed in our lab could be used to compare the wound-lip sealing properties of different surgical suture threads. Using such a technique, the results show that polyurethane is significantly better than other commonly-used suture threads, like <b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide,</b> in relation to wound sealing and scar formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{focus of}} this project is on the {{deformation}} behaviour of thermoplastic composites. The materials used were <b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide</b> resins with glass fibres and talc as fillers. These materials were provided by PLASTAMID (pty) ltd. The injection moulded specimens of <b>polypropylene,</b> <b>polyamide</b> 6 - 6, 30 % talc filled polypropylene, 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polypropylene and 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6 - 6 were tested in tension, flexure and impact (lzod, Charpy and drop-weight). Two different injection-moulding machines were used for specimen manufacture. These were an automated injection moulding machine simulating good control of processing conditions and a simple hand operated injection moulding machine simulating different processing and cooling (crystallisation) conditions. The mechanical tests were performed at different rates of strain and temperatures. The mechanical results show higher ductility of the unfilled polypropylene material. The strength and the elastic modulus of the materials are different for different materials. Addition of short glass fibres enhances the mechanical properties of <b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide</b> 6 - 6. Talc fillers reduce the tensile, Izod and Charpy impact properties of polypropylene while the flexural and dropweight impact strength is increased. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to observe the microstructural features and deformation behaviour such as matrix plastic deformation, matrix crazing and tearing, fibre-matrix debonding, fibre fracture, fibre orientation and crack propagation. These deformation behaviours {{are influenced by the}} test conditions such as strain rate, temperature and the type of the test conducted. The deformation behaviour is also dependent on the constituents of the material. The mechanical test response together with the macro- and microscopic features observed on the fracture surfaces of tested specimens are evidence of the various mechanisms of failure that take place in different thermoplastic composites. The understanding of the mechanical response and the failure mechanisms of thermoplastic matrix composites is important in the design and processing stages...|$|R

40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for identification of linear and nonlinear viscoelastic materials and for prediction of impact {{force on the}} basis of measurements made on impacted bodies. The complex modulus is identified from measured end-point accelerations of an impacted rod specimen, and in-situ from measured strains at three sections of a rod-like member of an impacted structure. The two methods for identification of complex modulus have been tested experimentally on two polymers, viz., <b>polypropylene</b> and <b>polyamide</b> 6, and results have been obtained in frequency ranges of up to two decades. Furthermore, the complex modulus of polyoximethylene has been determined during creep recovery by using the method based on acceleration measurements. Moreover, a method is proposed for identification of nonlinear viscoelastic materials {{on the basis of}} displacements measured at two sections of an impacted rod specimen. The displacements were measured by means of electro-optical displacement transducers. The first step of the method is model identification, i. e., choice of constitutive model. The second is parameter identification, i. e., determination of the parameters of the model chosen. The method has been applied to five polymers of interest in engineering, viz., <b>polypropylene,</b> <b>polyamide</b> 6, polyoximethylene, high density polyethylene, and 60 percent carbon-black filled natural rubber. Finally, a method is established which permits prediction of impact force history from the velocity response of each impacting body to an impulsive force applied to its impact face, and the impact velocity. It is assumed that the impacting bodies behave linearly. The method has been applied to several cases of impact between linearly elastic and linearly viscoelastic bodies.

40|$|Many elegant {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for the quantification of composite micro-mechanical parameters in recent years. Unfortunately, most of these {{techniques have}} found little enthusiastic support in the industrial product development environment, where they are viewed as time consuming, complex, inefficient, labour intensive, and in many cases unproven or inapplicable in 'real' systems. Despite this reaction, there is a real need for a 'user-friendly' micro-mechanics to aid the composites industry to move to the next level of development. A method for deriving values for tau (the interfacial shear strength) and etao (a fibre orientation factor) from a simple combination of the composite tensile stress-strain curve and the fibre length distribution has been available for some time. Despite the recent wealth of activity in the development of micro-mechanical test techniques, there has been little follow-up on this older technique.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, polymer nanocomposites {{have emerged as}} a novel and rapidly {{developing}} class of materials and attracted considerable investment {{in research and development}} worldwide. Driven by the certainty that by the integration of low nano ller amounts, existing material properties can be improved and moreover new material properties can be developed. Despite the clear bene t and therefore, increasing research, production and utilisation of nanomaterials, little is known about how nanocomposites will perform over their whole life cycle, especially in the usage and end of life phase. Under the in uence of environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, moisture, temperature and mechanical actions, nano-sized particles can be potentially released from nanocomposites and thus may have negative e ects on the human health and the environment. Within the scope of this work an extensive literature review has been conducted in which polymer nanocomposites are brie y introduced and release scenarios of engineered nano-sized particles from nanocomposites during their life cycle are discussed. In the experimental part of this work silica based <b>polypropylene,</b> <b>polyamide</b> and polyurethane composites were manufactured and particle exposure mechanism during mechanical processing and testing were monitored and analysed. A series of comprehensive physical characterisation techniques were utilised to assess particle size distribution, shape, and concentration in di erent mediums, once emitted by the solid composite materials. It was observed that during drilling of PA 6 composites, the airborne particle emission rates were 10 times higher than those for the PP based composites. However, the characterisation of deposited particles showed exactly the opposite behaviour, were the total number of particles emitted by the PP based composites was 10 - 100 times higher than those of the PA 6 based composites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst time such work has been reported in the literature. Further, the addition of secondary ller into a polymer/glass- bre composites changed the micro-mechanism during crash testing and therefore controlled the energy absorption characteristics of the composites. However, it was shown that once subjected to higher impact energies the geometric particle size of the released particles increased from approx. 25 nm for the 530 J to approx. 60 nm for the 1560 J impact. Additionally, the tensile modulus increased by 0. 31 GPa and the speci c energy absorbed during impact test increased from 20. 7 kJ to 22. 6 kJ by using nano-SiO 2 alternative to micro-SiO 2 particles in PP/glass- bre matrix. Even though a respective enhancement in mechanical properties were observed by using nano llers over micro llers, no signi cant di erence in particle emission during impact test were measured. Further, it could be shown that during drilling and testing, nano-sized particles were released from all materials studied, regardless of whether they had nanoparticles integrated or not. In one particular case, the neat polymer matrix generated more nano-sized particles during drilling than the exfoliated PA 6 /nanoclay nanocomposite. Hence, the addition of nanoclay can have bene cial impact in terms of controlled particle release. However, in general the addition of nano llers increased the particle emission rates during drilling and impact testing of the nanocomposites. Further, the emitted nano-sized particles were not all free engineered pristine nanoparticles but also hybrid particles consisting of matrix/nano ller material.

Global mechanical properties (such as 0 &# 176; and 90 &# 176; tensile strength), and microscopic mechanical properties (such as work of adhesion, matrix modulus, matrix residual stress, interfacial shear strength and interlaminar fracture toughness in mode II) are experimentally evaluated. Comparison of various prepreg systems using the same carbon fibre illustrates the characteristics of semi-crystalline polymer matrices including <b>polypropylene,</b> <b>polyamide</b> 6 and polyphenylene sulfide and their interfaces with carbon fibre. In addition, the impact of process conditions related to matrix crystallinity on each mechanical property is evaluated. Constitutive models, which describe the failure mechanisms of unidirectional laminates, are constructed using existent techniques, and contributions of fibre and matrix/interface related parameters are clarified. In addition, explanations {{to fill the gap}} between experiment and prediction of tensile strength are presented. They are comprised of a revised carbon fibre strength distribution in the range of small fibre length, the decrease of the matrix shear yield stress under tension and the generation of splitting prior to final failure. Second {{part of this}} thesis studies hybrid designs using the carbon fibre reinforced polypropylene and self-reinforced polypropylene. The hybrids achieve simultaneously high modulus/strength and excellent energy absorption under static tension. A synergy effect is observed in the initial modulus increase of self-reinforced polypropylene, which is induced by the suppression of its Poisson contraction by the carbon fibres.

Also {{two types}} of carbon nanotubes were used, none modified and modified with -NH 2 functional groups. The basic aim {{of the study was}} the connection between the structure/properties relationships of these materials and the modifications that undergo. The morphology, thermal properties, crystalline form and the polymer / filler interactions were examined extensively. Nanocomposites were made by melt mixing technique and by in situ polymerization. The dispersion of the fillers in the polymer matrix was examined through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results were very well, with only a small amount of aggregates in some cases. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) results in all semi-crystalline polymers showed that, by the addition of carbon nanotubes in the polymer matrix, and as the amount of MWCNT increases, the crystallization peak temperature shifts gradually to higher values, as well as the degree of crystallinity, indicating that carbon nanotubes act as nucleating agents. Additionaly, the appearance of a new crystallization peak at higher temperatures was revealed. The origin of this peak is attributed to trans-crystallinity. The crystalline structure of the pure polymers and their nanocomposites in the entire semi-crystalline polymers were examined through X-ray Diffraction patterns (XRD). The addition of carbon nanotubes had everywhere the same effect. CNT promote the formation of the more thermodynamically stable crystal form, making it the dominant phase.

From these considerations conclusions could be drawn with respect to the design and execution of joints, their resistance under thermo-mechanical and environmental solicitation and the testing procedure. 1...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{evaluating}} {{of the resulting}} surface state of the three plastic materials and identification of suitable conditions for laser cutting with CO 2 tube. As representative were chosen <b>polypropylene,</b> polymethylmethacrylate and <b>polyamide.</b> When cutting these types of materials it could melt eventually their re-sintering. A suitable combination of parameters is possible to achieve of sufficient quality of the cut. The samples were cut at different feed speed and laser power. Then they was compared {{on the basis of}} the measured roughness parameters Ra a Rz by using a portable touch roughness Hommel-Etamic W 5 and dates was processed according to ČSN EN ISO 4287. Cutting of samples was realized at the Department of Machining, Assembly and Engineering Metrology, VŠB-TUO...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{permeance}} {{of carbon}} dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and air through commercial polymers based on polyethylene (PE), biaxially oriented <b>polypropylene</b> (BOPP), and <b>polyamide</b> (PA) used for food packaging is reported. The influence of temperature (from 10 to 60 C) and crease stress cycles (30, 50, 70, and 110) on gas permeance is also analyzed. Generally, the highest changes in gas permeance changes with increased stress cycles are observed with films having a metallized layer in the structure, namely BOPPcoex/BOPPcoex. met and, {{to a lesser}} extent, BOPPcoex. met/PE laminate. The lowest crease stress influence on barrier properties is obtained for PE film. In this case, the highest activation energy for the permeability coefficient (P) is obtained. Normal progressions of activation energies for P are: N = Air>CO>O...|$|R
50|$|Many commercially {{produced}} composites use a {{polymer matrix}} material often called a resin solution. There {{are many different}} polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as polyester, vinyl ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide, <b>polyamide,</b> <b>polypropylene,</b> PEEK, and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below {{have been developed to}} reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fibre content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.|$|R
