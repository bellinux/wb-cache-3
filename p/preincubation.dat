50|$|Similar {{to other}} members of the pentraxin family PTX3 binds {{apoptotic}} cells, thereby inhibiting their recognition by DCs. Binding occurs late in the apoptotic process and enhances cytokine production by DCs. In addition, <b>preincubation</b> of apoptotic cells with PTX3 enhances C1q binding and C3 deposition on the cell surface, suggesting a role for PTX3 in the complement-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells. Moreover, in the presence of dying cells, PTX3 restricts the cross presentation of antigens derived from dying cells. These results suggest that PTX3 has a dual role: protection against pathogens and control of autoimmunity.|$|E

40|$|When {{eggs are}} stored beyond 7 d, {{hatchability}} and chick quality decrease. The {{cause of the}} negative effects of prolonged egg storage is not clear. The negative effects may be caused by a decrease in embryo viability due to an increase in cell death. The optimal time and curve of <b>preincubation</b> warming (the <b>preincubation</b> warming profile) may be different for eggs stored over short and long periods of time because embryo viability is dependent on egg storage time. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>preincubation</b> warming profiles affect embryonic development, hatchability, and chick quality when eggs are stored for a short or prolonged time. Two experiments were conducted. In both experiments, a 2 x 2 completely randomized design was used with 2 storage times (4 and 14 d at 17 °C in experiment I and 4 and 13 d at 19 °C in experiment II) and 2 <b>preincubation</b> warming profiles (within 4 or 24 h from storage temperature to 37. 8 °C). In experiment I, results suggested that the effect of <b>preincubation</b> warming profile on hatchability was dependent on storage time. However, because a low number of eggs were used in this experiment, these differences were not significant. In experiment II, the interaction between storage time and <b>preincubation</b> warming profile was observed for embryonic mortality during the first 2 d of incubation and hatchability (P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 01, respectively). When storage time was 13 d, embryonic mortality during the first 2 d of incubation decreased by 4. 4 % and hatchability increased by 5. 7 % when the 24 -h <b>preincubation</b> warming profile was used instead of the 4 -h <b>preincubation</b> warming profile. However, no effect of <b>preincubation</b> warming profile was observed when storage time was 4 d.

Two L. monocytogenes strains were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth under the above <b>preincubation</b> conditions, inoculated at ∼ 6 log cfu g- 1 onto slices of both bologna and summer sausage, vacuum packaged and incubated at 4 °C for 6 weeks. Initially and at weekly intervals L. monocytogenes numbers were determined by plating samples on Modifed Oxford Agar followed by incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. Results indicated that under all <b>preincubation</b> conditions both strains could grow on the bologna and not on the summer sausage. <b>Preincubation</b> at 4 °C resulted in a reduced lag phase of both strains of the pathogen on bologna as compared to the other temperatures. <b>Preincubation</b> at 37 °C, on the other hand, resulted in reduced survival in one strain only on summer sausage as compared to the other temperatures. <b>Preincubation</b> under attached conditions for 48 h had no effect on the growth of either strain on the bologna, but enhanced survival of one of the strains on summer sausage as compared to 96 h attached and planktonic growth conditions.

Antiporter activity was examined after a 2 -day <b>preincubation</b> in control or acid medium, 1 hr after removal from the <b>preincubation</b> fluid.

40|$|Background: Dimethyl {{sulfoxide}} (Me 2 SO) is {{a common}} cryoprotective agent widely used in cell preservation system. Me 2 SO is currently known to cause epigenetic changes which are  critical in stem cells development and cellular differentiation. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} develop cryopreservation techniques that protect cellular functions and avert Me 2 SO adverse effect. Trehalose was able to protect organism in extreme condition such as dehydration and cold. This study aimed to verify the protective effect of trehalose <b>preincubation</b> procedure in cryopreservation. Methods: The study was conducted using experimental design. Thawed mesenchymal (CD 271 +) stem cells from YARSI biorepository were used for the experiment. Trehalose <b>preincubation</b> was performed for 1 hour, internalized trehalose was confirmed by FTIR-ATR measurement. Three groups consisted of (1) cryopreserved without trehalose <b>preincubation,</b> (2) cryopreserved with trehalose <b>preincubation,</b> and (3) did not undergo cryopreservation were evaluated after 24 hours in LN 2 for viability in culture. The absorbance from each group was measured at 450 nm. The analysis performed using paired student t test. Results: Viability of thawed mesenchymal (CD 271 +) stem cells that undergo trehalose <b>preincubation</b> prior cryopreservation was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) compared to group without trehalose <b>preincubation.</b> Higher viability observed between group with trehalose <b>preincubation</b> compared with controlled group suggests protection to trypsinization.

Permeabilized cells of the fluoride-sensitive strain Streptococcus mutans C 180 - 2 and its fluoride-resistant mutant strain C 180 - 2 FR were preincubated at pH 7 or 4 with NaF, the amine fluorides Olaflur and Dectaflur and amine chloride controls. After preincubations, enolase and ATPase activities of the cells were assessed. Enolase activity was more inhibited after <b>preincubation</b> at pH 7 with NaF than with Olaflur. Amine chloride stimulated, although not with statistical significance, the enolase activity of both strains. After <b>preincubation</b> at pH 4 the enolases were strongly inactivated, but the fluoride-resistant strain's enolase to a lesser extent. The results suggested that amine acts to protect enolase activity against the detrimental low pH effect. Gene sequencing showed that the enolase genes of the fluoride-resistant and fluoride-sensitive strain were identical. ATPase activity was not reduced after NaF <b>preincubation</b> at either pH 7 or pH 4. The amine fluorides and their chloride controls in the <b>preincubation</b> mixture reduced the ATPase activity significantly at both pH values. In conclusion, our results showed that <b>preincubation</b> with amine fluoride did not inhibit enolase activity more effectively than NaF.

The differences in CIM <b>preincubation</b> requirements for ARR 5 and ARR 15 expression indicate an additional layer of control for these A-type ARR genes during SIM incubation.

In the latter case the presence of cytosol also increased the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to the microsomal vesicles. Activation energies of the rate of this transfer and of the rate of increase of ACAT activity were similar in the presence {{and in the absence of}} cytosol. Both in the absence and in the presence of cytosol, the presence of NaF (50 mM) in the <b>preincubation</b> mixture considerably decreased the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to microsomal vesicles and the rate of increase of ACAT activity. The presence of Mg 2 + in the <b>preincubation</b> mixture produced no effect on the rate of transfer of cholesterol from liposomal to the microsomal vesicles, although under most conditions it decreased the rate of increase of ACAT activity caused by the <b>preincubation.</b> These results are discussed in relation to the molecular mechanism involved in this intervesicular transfer of cholesterol and to the modulation of ACAT activity by substrate supply, and also in relation to the hypothesis that ACAT activity can be modulated by a mechanism involving the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the roJe of Escherichia coU expressing mannose-resistant hemagglutination and adhesins {{with regard to}} the induction of leukotrienes from a suspension of human lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils (LMBs) compared with human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). Genetically cloned E. coli strains expressing various types of mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRH+) were phagocytosed to a higher degree by monocytes than the nonadherent E. coli strain. The various strains dUfered in their capacity to induce a chemiluminescence response, which showed the same pattern for LMBs and PMNs. Stimulation of LMBs with bacteria alone, unlike granulocytes, did not activate the cells for the release of leukotrienes. However, <b>preincubation</b> of LMBs with bacteria decreased subsequent leukotriene formation when the cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore. The inhibitory eft'ect was dependent on the concentration of bacteria used for <b>preincubation</b> as weil as on the <b>preincubation</b> temperature. The various bacterial strains dift'ered in inhibitory potency for mediator release. <b>Preincubation</b> of LMBs with zymosan, opsonized zymosan, the bacterfal peptide FMLP, and peptidoglycan bad no inhibitory eft'ect or even increased subsequent IeukotrieDe formation. Opsonized bacteria were far less inhibitory than nonopsonized bacteria. In contrast to human LMBs, <b>preincubation</b> of human PMNs with mannose-resistant bacteria led to increased leukotriene 84 generation and reduced w-oxidation of leukotriene 84 • Our data soggest that phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes) respond in a different way for leukotriene formation after Interaction with mannose-resistant E. coli...|$|E
40|$|<b>Preincubation</b> of {{the group}} I intron Ca. LSU from Candida albicans at 37 °C {{in the absence of}} {{divalent}} cations results in partial folding of this intron. This is indicated by increased resistance to T 1 ribonuclease cleavage of many G residues in most local helices, including P 4 -P 6, as well as the non-local helix P 7, where the G binding site is located. These changes correlate with increased gel mobility and activation of catalysis by precursor RNA containing this intron after <b>preincubation.</b> The presence of divalent cations or spermidine during <b>preincubation</b> results in formation of the predicted helices, as indicated by protection of additional G residues. However, addition of these cations during <b>preincubation</b> of the precursor RNA alters its gel mobility and eliminates the <b>preincubation</b> activation of precursor RNA seen in the absence of cations. These results suggest that, in the presence of divalent cations or spermidine, Ca. LSU folds into a more ordered, stable but misfolded conformation that is less able to convert into the catalytically active form than the ribozyme preincubated without cations. These results indicate that, like the group I intron of Tetrahymena, multiple folding pathways exist for Ca. LSU. However, it appears that the role cations play in the multiple folding pathways leading to the catalytically active form may differ between folding of these two group I introns...|$|E
40|$|Background: Delayed {{entry of}} blood culture bottles is {{inevitable}} when microbiological lab-oratories {{do not operate}} for 24 hr. There are few studies reported for prestorage of these bottles. The growth dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomo-nas aeruginosa were investigated with respect to various <b>preincubation</b> conditions. Methods: Fifteen or 150 colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria were inoculated into stan-dard aerobic or anaerobic blood culture bottles. Bottles were preincubated at 25 °C or 37 °C for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, or 48 hr. The time to detection (TTD) then was monitored us-ing the BacT/Alert 3 D system (bioMerieux Inc., USA). Results: Significant difference in TTD was observed following <b>preincubation</b> for 8 hr at 25 °C vs. 4 hr at 37 °C for S. aureus, 4 hr at 25 °C vs. 4 hr at 37 °C for E. coli, 12 hr at 25 °C vs. 4 hr at 37 °C for P. aeruginosa, compared to no <b>preincubation</b> (P < 0. 005). TTD values did not vary significantly with bacterial CFU or with aerobic or anaerobic bottle type. The BacT/Alert 3 D system returned false negatives following <b>preincubation</b> of P. aeruginosa for 48 hr at 25 °C or 24 hr at 37 °C. Conclusions: TTD was mainly affected by <b>preincubation</b> temperature and duration rather than by input CFU quantity or bottle type for the 3 experimental bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Ribulose 1, 5 -diphosphate carboxylase, when {{activated}} by <b>preincubation</b> with 10 mm MgCl 2 and 1 mm bicarbonate {{in the absence}} of ribulose 1, 5 -diphosphate, can be further activated about 170 % with 0. 5 mm NADPH present in the <b>preincubation</b> mixture. NADP+, NADH, and NAD+ are ineffective. The activation by NADPH is comparable to that previously seen with 0. 05 to 0. 10 mm 6 -phosphogluconate in that these specific <b>preincubation</b> conditions are required, but the effects of NADPH and 6 -phosphogluconate are not additive. Moreover, where higher concentrations of 6 -phosphogluconate inhibited the enzyme, higher concentrations of NADPH give a greater activation, saturating at about 1 mm and 200 %. Under the specified conditions of <b>preincubation,</b> fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate has an activation curve similar to that of 6 -phosphogluconate, peaking at 0. 1 mm and 70 %. Above this level, activation decreases, and inhibition is seen at still higher concentrations. Other metabolites tested produced smaller or no effects on the enzyme activity assayed under these conditions. When either reduced NADP or 6 -phosphogluconate are present in the <b>preincubation</b> mixture, it becomes possible to determine the Km for bicarbonate using a Lineweaver-Burk plot, and the Km for bicarbonate under these conditions is 2. 8 mm, corresponding to 0. 3 % CO 2 at pH 7. 8 and 25 C...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} effect of {{d-penicillamine}} (Pen) on human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) was studied {{in relation to}} pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulation. Incubation of PBMC with Pen during or after PWM stimulation resulted in only a slight decrease in blast-cell formation. This effect was dependent on the concentration of Pen. <b>Preincubation</b> of PBMC with 100 micrograms Pen/ml medium for 10 days led to a toxic effect on lymphoid cells and selective survival of mononuclear phagocytes (MNP). <b>Preincubation</b> with 10 and 50 micrograms Pen/ml medium resulted in limited spontaneous blast-cell formation, which did not occur after <b>preincubation</b> with 100 micrograms Pen/ml and 5 micrograms Pen/ml. Despite the decrease in the total number of lymphocytes after 10 days of Pen <b>preincubation,</b> blast-cell formation on subsequent PWM stimulation in the absence of Pen was considerably enhanced compared to controls. The blast-cell formation was suppressed when PWM stimulation of Pen-preincubated PBMC was performed in the presence of Pen. This suppression of blast-cell formation under stimulation in the presence of Pen might explain the therapeutic effect of Pen...|$|E

The role of chemotherapeutic agents and their metabolites in mediat-ing this platelet defect was investigated. 1, 3 -Bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU), but not cyclophosphamide or cis-plati-num, was found to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro in response to activation by either ADP, thrombin, or collagen. Inhibition by BCNU was dose dependent and required <b>preincubation</b> of plate-lets with BCNU. After a 60 -mm <b>preincubation,</b> 30 zM BCNU produced 50 % inhibition of platelets in platelet-rich plasma. The cyclophosphamide metabolites acrolein and 4 -hydroperoxycyclo-phosphamide also inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-de-pendent manner, with a requirement for <b>preincubation.</b> Platelet inhibition occurred at clinically relevant concentrations of BCNU and metabolites of cyclophosphamide.
