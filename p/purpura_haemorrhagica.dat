50|$|<b>Purpura</b> <b>haemorrhagica</b> {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of equine strangles and is caused by bleeding from capillaries which results in red spots on the skin and mucous membranes together with oedema (swelling) of the limbs and the head. Purpura hemorrhagica {{is more common in}} younger animals.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{complications}} {{include the}} horse becoming a chronic carrier of the disease, asphyxia due to {{enlarged lymph nodes}} compressing the larynx or windpipe, bastard strangles (spreading {{to other areas of}} the body), pneumonia, guttural pouch filled with pus, abscesses, <b>purpura</b> <b>haemorrhagica,</b> and heart disease. The average length for the course of this disease is 23 days.|$|E
40|$|During a {{strangles}} outbreak {{within a}} herd of minature horses, a six week old foal developed acute onset clinical signs of sepsis and neurological deficits. The foal was euthanized and submitted for post-mortem at the Animal Health Laboratories, Guelph Ontario. Gross post-mortem examination noted severe bronchopneumonia, hypopyon of the right eye and a singular cerebellar peduncle abscess. Culture of the lungs and cerebellum produced a pure growth of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi. Streptococcus equi ssp. equi, the causative agent of equine strangles, produces an acute pyrexia, purulent lymphadenopathy of submandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Commonly, lymph node abscesses rupture and resolve without complication. Rarely, complications may include: dissemination of the bacteria with diffuse abscess formation, immune mediated disease (<b>purpura</b> <b>haemorrhagica),</b> rarely abscess formation within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) can occur. These can be managed medically with appropriate antibiotics and drugs to reduce intra-cranial pressure, however surgical drainage and debulking of the abscess has been attempted successfully in a few cases...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{compatibility}} {{and efficacy of}} the live strangles vaccine Equilis® StrepE (Intervet International, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) on pregnant mares, lactating mares and weaned foals under field conditions on a stud farm. The vaccine was tested on thirty pregnant and lactating mares (German warm-blooded and Arabian thoroughbred) between three and seventeen years of age, in a placebo controlled study. Twenty-one of these were treated with the product under test and nine were given a placebo. These mares were pregnant between three and ten months {{at the time of}} the first vaccination. The study investigates in particular the efficacy, the systemic and local compatibility as well as possible effects of vaccination on both reproduction and lactation. The passive transfer of maternal vaccine antibodies and their persistence in the foals has also been investigated. The efficacy was tested by investigating the M-protein specific serum antibody response. In order to examine the passive transfer of antibodies the SeM-specific serum antibodies of the suckling foals of the mares tested were controlled using identical procedures. The compatibility was tested by examining the site of the injection and by regular clinical controls of the probands. Pregnancy, parturition and the health condition of the newborn were subject to special supervision. Gravidity, the process of parturition and the condition of the new-born foals were subject to special supervision. During lactation, the mares, their udders and the suckling foals were clinically controlled. Fifty-four foals, both German warm-blood and Arabian thoroughbred, at an age between four and seven months, were examined to test the efficacy and the systemic and local compatibility of the vaccine. In addition, the efficacy of the immunisation of weaned foals against respiratory diseases in the early rearing time was compared with herds of unvaccinated foals. Results: •	Local and systemic compatibility with mares and foals agreed with the details given by the manufacturer. In our opinion the observed local inflammatory reactions, some of these quite severe, in about 15 % of vaccinations are not ideal and clearly show that the vaccine at the tested form has to be improved. •	When this vaccine is used the problems described by Kemp-Symonds et al. (2007), Sweeney et al. (2005) as well as Timoney (2007) should be taken into consideration. On the basis of the investigations carried out in the context of this study concerning serological issues the risk of <b>purpura</b> <b>haemorrhagica</b> (SWEENEY et al. 2005) resulting from vaccination can not be excluded. In our view this risk could be attributed to the recommendations of the manufacturer for revaccination after twelve weeks. •	Our data suggest that contrary to the recommendation by the manufacturer of vaccination intervals of twelve weeks, revaccination intervals of six months are preferable. Thereby the risk of immune-mediated vaccination complications can be avoided on the one hand; on the other hand, SeM-specific serum titres achieved by vaccination persit on a high level for this time. •	The vaccine didn’t show any negative effects with pregnant and lactating mares as to reproduction and lactation. Thus Equilis® StrepE seems to be compatible. •	The application of the vaccine with pregnant and lactating mares stimulated a serum antibody response. Foals of vaccinated mares had higher titres of SeM-specific IgG. •	The persistence of maternal SeM-specific serum antibodies in foals of mares vaccinated shortly before parturition will hold until at least the end of the fourth month of life. •	Vaccination of weaned foals with Equilis® StrepE failed to produce a measurable systemic, solid immunity and didn’t lead to a notable improvement of the disease processes of respiratory bacterial infections with the herd of foals tested in this study. Therefore the efficacy of the vaccine batch used could not be confirmed. Because of high efforts involved in vaccination, the only three-months duration of immunity, the safety issues, the frequent local vaccination reactions and the poor efficacy, a general use of Equilis® StrepE as tested form can not be recommended as a preventive measure. In order to develop an effective strangles vaccine, further studies into the complex im-munological processes concerning S. equi infections as well as the exploration of new methods to stimulate them in an effective way, are necessary. Safe vaccines offering a better and longer protection as well as a greater safety-profile are needed to prevent strangles...|$|E
