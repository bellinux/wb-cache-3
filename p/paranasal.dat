5|$|Negus {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to {{establish}} his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed National Health Service. He was a member of numerous international and national otolaryngology organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists.|$|E
25|$|Other sites: Rare {{sites of}} {{involvement}} are the larynx, nasal cavity, <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, thyroid gland, and the thoracic inlet, {{as well as}} the bladder in extremely rare cases.|$|E
25|$|From about 1870 onwards {{scientists}} have {{generally agreed that}} the post-cranial skeletons of many dinosaurs contained many air-filled cavities (postcranial skeletal pneumaticity, especially in the vertebrae. Pneumatization of the skull (such as <b>paranasal</b> sinuses) is found in both synapsids and archosaurs, but postcranial pneumatization is found only in birds, non-avian saurischian dinosaurs, and pterosaurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{may affect}} the gastrointestinal tract or the skin. In non-trauma cases, it usually begins in the nose and <b>paranasal</b> sinuses {{and is one of}} the most rapidly spreading fungal infections in humans. Common symptoms include thrombosis and tissue necrosis. Treatment consists of prompt and intensive antifungal drug therapy and surgery to remove the infected tissue. The prognosis varies vastly depending upon an individual patient's circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} middle ear and the outside, if not released, {{can result in a}} burst eardrum. This damages hearing, and if this occurs underwater, cold water in the middle ear chills the inner ear, causing vertigo. The {{pressure difference}} can also cause damage to other body air spaces, such as the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses. This can also be caused by damaged sinus ducts.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to provide a more {{consistent}} nomenclature for subtypes of chronic sinusitis. The presence of eosinophils in the mucous lining of the nose and <b>paranasal</b> sinuses has been demonstrated for many patients, and this has been termed eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS). Cases of EMRS may be related to an allergic response, but allergy is not often documented, resulting in further subcategorization into allergic and non-allergic EMRS.|$|E
25|$|Mucus in the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses {{is equally}} thick {{and may also}} cause {{blockage}} of the sinus passages, leading to infection. This may cause facial pain, fever, nasal drainage, and headaches. Individuals with CF may develop overgrowth of the nasal tissue (nasal polyps) due to inflammation from chronic sinus infections. Recurrent sinonasal polyps can occur in 10% to 25% of CF patients. These polyps can block the nasal passages and increase breathing difficulties.|$|E
25|$|CST most {{commonly}} results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). The highly anastomotic venous {{system of the}} <b>paranasal</b> sinuses allows retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. It was previously thought that veins in the area were valveless {{and that this was}} the major cause of the retrograde spread, however, a recent study has found that the ophthalmic and facial veins are not valveless.|$|E
25|$|In the midline of the nose, the septum is a {{composite}} (osseo-cartilaginous) structure that divides the nose into two (2) similar halves. The lateral nasal wall and the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, the superior concha, the middle concha, and the inferior concha, form the corresponding passages, the superior meatus, the middle meatus, and the inferior meatus, on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus; the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses; and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct.|$|E
25|$|A brain or {{cerebral}} abscess, {{like other}} abscesses, {{is caused by}} inflammation and collection of lymphatic cells and infected material originating from a local or remote infection. A brain abscess is a rare, life-threatening condition. Local sources may include infections of the ear, the oral cavity and teeth, the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, or an epidural abscess. Remote sources may include infections in the lung, heart or kidney. A brain abscess may also be caused by head trauma or as a complication of surgery. In children cerebral abscesses are usually linked to congenital heart disease. In most cases, 8–12 weeks of antibacterial therapy is required.|$|E
500|$|These earlier {{works were}} {{followed}} after the Second World War by {{the publication of}} Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx (1949). This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx. It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study {{the function of the}} nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell (olfaction) {{and the role of the}} nose in respiration. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (<b>paranasal</b> sinuses) prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist Adolf Onodi (1857–1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900. Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens. This work was covered in Negus's Hunterian Lecture, delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title [...] "Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and <b>Paranasal</b> Sinuses". This was followed four years later by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and <b>Paranasal</b> Sinuses (1958). Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952, both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the Middlesex Hospital. Negus's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 Lister Medal. This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons. The oration was titled [...] "The Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory Tract in Relation to Clinical Problems". Ten years later, towards the end of his life, Negus published The Biology of Respiration (1965).|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} known skulls (three of P.madagascariensis {{and one of}} P.germainepetterae), {{each of which is}} damaged. All are missing the front (rostral) part, and three are broken at about the same place (at the <b>paranasal</b> cavities, {{at the front of the}} braincase), {{suggesting}} that the front part of the skull was thinner and more fragile than the back part, which consists of thick bones. MacPhee estimated maximum skull length in P.madagascariensis at [...] The length of the frontal bone averages [...] in P.madagascariensis and is [...] in P.germainepetterae.|$|E
500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed <b>paranasal</b> sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, hypercapnia (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} with {{his career as}} a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the comparative anatomy of first the larynx and then the nose and the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses. This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of Master of Surgery (MS), awarded by the University of London. This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist John Hunter. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the Zoological Society of London, Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals. Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924. In addition to this, Negus gave the Arris and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons, with his talk titled [...] "On the Mechanism of the Larynx".|$|E
2500|$|Sinusitis (or rhinosinusitis) {{is defined}} as an {{inflammation}} of the mucous membrane that lines the <b>paranasal</b> sinuses and is classified chronologically into several categories: ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} paired <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, {{including}} the frontal, ethmoidal, maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses. The ethmoidal sinuses are further subdivided into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses, {{the division of}} which {{is defined as the}} basal [...] of the middle turbinate. In addition to the severity of disease, discussed below, sinusitis can be classified by the sinus cavity which it affects: ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are risks}} {{associated}} with HBOT, similar to some diving disorders. Pressure changes can cause a [...] "squeeze" [...] or barotrauma in the tissues surrounding trapped air inside the body, such as the lungs, behind the eardrum, inside <b>paranasal</b> sinuses, or trapped underneath dental fillings. Breathing high-pressure oxygen may cause oxygen toxicity. Temporarily blurred vision {{can be caused by}} swelling of the lens, which usually resolves in two to four weeks.|$|E
2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, <b>paranasal</b> sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of [...] underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10m (33ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30m (100ft) to 40m (130ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).|$|E
2500|$|Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations {{in spite}} of vocal tract anatomy {{differences}} in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of malocclusion between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the dental arch and {{a wide range of}} maxillary and mandible deformities. [...] Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede [...] the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation [...] are gross oral deformations such as hare-lips, cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism). <b>Paranasal</b> sinuses [...] vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their [...] asymmetry.|$|E
