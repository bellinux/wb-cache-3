40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if vitamin A enhances {{the effect of}} iron in preventing <b>piglet</b> <b>anemia.</b> Materials and methods: Neonatal pigs (n = 96) from crossbred sows were assigned to three treatments, with four replicates per treatment. Treatments consisted of control (no iron), 200 mg injectable iron (iron dextran) at 2 days of age (Day 2), and 200 mg injectable iron (iron dextran) with 2000 IU oral vitamin A (vitamin A palmitate) on Day 2. The study was continued until Day 21. Blood samples were collected on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21, and liver and spleen samples were collected on Day 21. Hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, total iron-binding capacity, and iron concentration were measured in plasma, liver, and spleen samples. Body weight was recorded on Days 0 and 21. Deaths were recorded through the study. Results: Weight gain and mortality {{did not differ significantly}} between pigs treated with iron alone and pigs treated with both iron and vitamin A (P>. 05). Hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and iron concentration in plasma, liver, and spleen samples in pigs treated with both iron and vitamin A were higher, and total iron-binding capacity was lower, than in pigs treated with iron alone (P <. 05). Implications: Iron nutrition status is better in piglets provided with both iron and vitamin A than in piglets treated with iron alone. The combination of vitamin A and iron is more effective than iron alone in preventing <b>piglet</b> <b>anemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|A hemoglobina é uma proteína {{globular}} composta por fração protéica (cadeias de globina), fração heme onde ocorre a ligação do íon bivalente de ferro, sendo que, as globinas combinadas ajudam a tipificar as hemoglobina em Hb Adulta (Hb A), Fetal (Hb F) e Adulta 2 (Hb A 2). Na deficiência de ferro, que pode culminar anemia por disfunção eritropoiética, prevalente em leitões e seres humanos, a hemoglobina pode ter alterações estruturais denominadas hemoglobinopatias. O estudo determinou a influência do ferro nos tipos de hemoglobina de leitões neonatos. Perante os resultados se verificou que hemoglobina do leitão tem corrida semelhante à humana, e nos animais que apresentaram anemia ferropriva não houve aparecimento do traçado Hb A 2, que pode estar diminuída em casos de deficiência de ferro em seres humanos. Hemoglobin is a {{globular protein}} {{consisting of the}} protein fraction (globin chains), heme fraction which is the binding of the bivalent iron ion, and the combined globin help classify the hemoglobin in Hb Adult (Hb A), Fetal (Hb F) and Adult 2 (Hb A 2). The iron deficiency can predispose anemia by erythropoietic dysfunction, prevalent in pigs and humans and the hemoglobin may have structural changes denominated hemoglobinopathies. The study determined the influence of iron to the types of hemoglobin neonate pigs. On the results {{was found that the}} pig hemoglobin is similar to human in electrophoresis. The <b>piglets</b> showed deficiency <b>anemia</b> there was appearance of line Hb A 2, which may be diminished in cases of iron deficiency in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of nixtamalization process on the phytic acid loss of maize and the subsequent influence on iron bioavailability of the iron-deficient piglets. Two experiments were conducted to achieve the objective: in the first step, three types of maize varying in phytic acid contents were processed by five lime concentrations treatment (0, 0. 6, 1. 2, 1. 8 and 2. 4 %), four cooking duration (0, 45, 60 and 75 min) and thereafter soaking for five periods (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h) to optimize the best nixtamalization process parameter based on the maximum loss of phytic acid. In the second study, weaning piglets suffered iron-deficient were fed two diets: either lime-cooked maize produced by optimal parameter (NTM) or non-nixtamalized maize as control (CON), {{to examine the effects of}} the nixtamalization on the iron bioavailability, iron status and growth performance. The results showed that: (1) The greatest phytic acid loss of three types of maize and their processing parameters (lime concentration, cooking duration and steeping duration) were 17. 4 % (1. 2 %, 75 min and 4 h), 14. 9 % (1. 8 %, 75 min and 4 h) and 27. 5 % (1. 8 %, 75 min and 4 h), respectively. (2) The hemoglobin concentration (Hb), Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Red Blood Cell count (RBC) and Hemoglobin-Fe (Hb-Fe) content were improved in the NTM piglets compared with CON piglets (p< 0. 05). (3) The Average Daily Gain (ADG) and Average Daily Feed Intake (ADFI) at D 14 and D 28 were higher in NTM than CON group (p< 0. 05). These results demonstrated that nixtamalization process parameter should be varying according to the phytic acid contents of the maize to break down the maize phytic acid effectively. Above all, the lime-cooked maize could enhance the iron status and the growth performance of weaning <b>piglets</b> suffered iron-deficiency <b>anemia,</b> thus could be considered as an effective intervention protecting the consumer (including human and animal) from suffering iron deficiency...|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se a biodisponibilidade de ferro de diferentes compostos visando sua utilização em dietas para leitões desmamados. Utilizaram-se 44 leitões (7 não-anêmicos e 37 anêmicos) desmamados aos 21 dias de idade (7, 3 ± 1, 8 kg) e distribuídos em dois grupos: grupo não-anêmico e grupo anêmico. Durante sete dias, os animais do grupo não-anêmico receberam dieta com FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O (sulfato ferroso hepta-hidratado) na dose de 100 mg/kg e os do grupo anêmico, dieta sem ferro (Iron {{bioavailability}} {{from different}} compounds was evaluated {{to be used}} in diets for weaned piglets. Forty four piglets (7 non-anemic and 37 anemic) weaned at 21 days old (7. 3 ± 1. 8 kg) were distributed into two groups: non-anemic group and anemic group. During seven days, the animals from non-anemic group were fed diet with ferrous sulfate hepthydrate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O) in the dose of 100 mg/kg and of the anemic group, diet without iron (< 15 mg/kg diet). On the seventh day, after the determination blood hemoglobin concentration and diagnosed with <b>anemia,</b> <b>piglets</b> were grouped according to product of the weight (kg) &# 215; hemoglobin (g/dL) and individually housed, for 13 days in cages for digestibility studies, where they were fed with six diets based on corn and powdered milk: three standard diets with FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O in equivalent amount of 80, 150 and 200 mg Fe/kg diet; two experimental diets, one with iron (150 mg/kg) in form of FeSO 4 microencapsulated with carboxymethylcellulose and other chelated with methionine, and a control diet with iron (100 mg/kg). In the days 0, 3, 6, 9 and 13 of the repletion period, the animals were weighed for performance evaluation and blood was collected to determine the hemoglobin concentration. At the end, the animals were slaughtered and liver was collected for determination of total iron concentrations, Fe-heme and Fe non-heme. Liver concentrations of Fe-heme, Fe non-heme and Fe-total did not differ among animals, however, the control group showed excess of Fe-total in the liver, related to iron injected dose in the piglets after weaning. Compared to FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O not encapsulated, iron compounds microencapsulated with carboxymethylcellulose and iron chelate with methionine promote better feed conversion in weaned piglets...|$|R
