25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story <b>perfectly</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interested in {{the will}} of the late John Savage, Frankie consults her family's {{solicitor}} in London and learns that Carstairs consulted him too. Savage was staying with Mr and Mrs Templeton when he became convinced he had cancer, although one specialist told him he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>well.</b> When he died by suicide, his will left seven hundred thousand pounds to the Templetons, who have apparently since left England. Carstairs was on their trail, suspicious of the will. Bobby is kidnapped and Frankie is lured to the same isolated cottage by Roger. They manage to turn the tables on him with the timely arrival of Badger Beadon and find a drugged Moira in the house. When the police arrive, Roger has escaped.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven plough for normal ploughing, {{rather than just}} drainage channels. However normal ploughing was much lighter work that could be achieved <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven plough was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the plough’s efficiency would be to design a plough that could plough in either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the plough that had two ploughs attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two plough blades would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the plough was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly ready for the next furrow.|$|E

25|$|Milner and Haig {{met again}} at GHQ in France (21 September) - Milner warned Haig that {{manpower}} {{would not be}} available for 1919 if squandered now and told Wilson (23 September) that Haig was being “ridiculously optimistic”, might “embark on another Paschendal (sic)” and that he “had grave doubts whether he had got inside of DH’s head”; Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to “watch this tendency & stupidity of DH”. He complained that Haig, Foch and du Cane {{did not understand the}} shortage of manpower – in fact Haig understood it <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> but hoped to win the war before British manpower ran out. Lloyd George still hoped to shift British efforts to other fronts, leaving the Americans to take over more of the burden on the Western Front going forward.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that {{there is no reason why}} the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these can be thought of as open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E
25|$|One modern {{approach}} {{is based on}} the theory of abstract polyhedra. These can be defined as partially ordered sets whose elements are the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. A vertex or edge element is less than an edge or face element (in this partial order) when the vertex or edge is part of the edge or face. Additionally, one may include a special bottom element of this partial order (representing the empty set) and a top element representing the whole polyhedron. If the sections of the partial order between elements three levels apart (that is, between each face and the bottom element, and between the top element and each vertex) have the same structure as the abstract representation of a polygon, then these partially ordered sets carry exactly the same information as a topological polyhedron. However, these requirements are often relaxed, to instead require only that sections between elements two levels apart have the same structure as the abstract representation of a line segment. (This means that each edge contains two vertices and belongs to two faces, and that each vertex on a face belongs to two edges of that face.) Geometric polyhedra, defined in other ways, can be described abstractly in this way, but it is also possible to use abstract polyhedra as the basis of a definition of geometric polyhedra. A realization of an abstract polyhedron is generally taken to be a mapping from the vertices of the abstract polyhedron to geometric points, such that the points of each face are coplanar. A geometric polyhedron can then be defined as a realization of an abstract polyhedron. Realizations that forgo the requirement of planarity, that impose additional requirements of symmetry, or that map the vertices to higher dimensional spaces have also been considered. Unlike the solid-based and surface-based definitions, this works <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> for star polyhedra. However, without additional restrictions, this definition allows degenerate or unfaithful polyhedra (for instance, by mapping all vertices to a single point) and {{the question of how to}} constrain realizations to avoid these degeneracies has not been settled.|$|E

500|$|Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated {{the story}} about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry {{had been talking to}} Epstein about the band for a long time (being the group he {{promoted}} the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, “Brian [...] knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were, they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat.” Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllGame, Shawn Sackenheim {{considered}} the [...] "highly technical" [...] control scheme of 1080° Snowboarding {{one of the}} game's strengths despite its initial difficulty. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games positively reviewed the control scheme, but disagreed on its difficulty, noting [...] "the controls have been implemented so brilliantly that you're able to play <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> with just {{one hand on the}} stick and Z button." [...] GameSpot called the game's control [...] "thoroughly involving" [...] and said that [...] "he crouch move alone– which makes for supertight turns– makes this fun to play." [...] The music was also generally praised, with Matt Casamassina of IGN calling it [...] "a shining example of what can be achieved on the format" [...] and Sackenheim calling it [...] "one of the best N64 soundtracks to date". Sackenheim also praised the game's sound effects.|$|E

Jim Johnson-Smith, in American Science Fiction TV, uses an example of Ezri and Worf's concentration on their romantic relationship in the episode [...] "'Til Death Do Us Part" [...] instead of being more concerned with their capture by the Breen. Ezri was described as [...] "an ill-conceived idea that never really took off and has left many DS9 fans angry that a show favourite (Jadzia Dax) isn't around any more" [...] by the website Flickering Myth. The review on DVD Talk also stated [...] "With its large ensemble cast, DS9 could have gone on <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> without a replacement for Jadzia. Instead, we get a [...] "replacement Dax" [...] who turns out to be, hands down, the least interesting and most annoying character DS9 has been stuck with." ...|$|E

[...] on the front cover, as the Beatles had recorded the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single with Tony Sheridan in Germany. Some months after its release, Epstein supposedly (as stated in his biography), asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single, because a customer, one Raymond Jones, had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961, which made Epstein curious about the group. Harry and McCartney repudiated this story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat), and by McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein's {{version of}} the story was that {{customer}} Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single, which made Epstein curious about the group. Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat—with McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were; they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat".

500|$|Over the years, Longfellow's {{personality}} {{has become}} part of his reputation. He has been presented as a gentle, placid, poetic soul, an image perpetuated by his brother Samuel Longfellow who wrote an early biography which specifically emphasized these points. As James Russell Lowell said, Longfellow had an [...] "absolute sweetness, simplicity, and modesty". At Longfellow's funeral, his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson called him [...] "a sweet and beautiful soul". In reality, his life was much more difficult than was assumed. He suffered from neuralgia, which caused him constant pain, and he also had poor eyesight. He wrote to friend Charles Sumner: [...] "I do not believe anyone can be <b>perfectly</b> <b>well,</b> who has a brain and a heart". He had difficulty coping with the death of his second wife. Longfellow was very quiet, reserved, and private; in later years, he was known for being unsocial and avoided leaving home.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|As the NWC {{continued}} its studies, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) annihilated the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. Japan {{had already been}} a concern of the U.S. Navy. Strategist and Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan had warned then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt in 1897 of a much greater likelihood of conflict in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. Roosevelt himself, as President of the United States, had written before Tsushima to British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, [...] "The Japs interest me and I like them. I am <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> aware that if they win out it may possibly mean a struggle between them and us in the future." [...] Tsushima sealed {{the outcome of the}} Russo-Japanese War in Japan's favor, signaled its emergence as a world power and began a period of rivalry with the United States over intentions in the Pacific theater, as the two now became the dominant military powers there. An immediate consequence was the four [...] armored cruisers, laid down between 1905 and 1908. These ships were designed to carry four [...] guns, a size generally allocated to capital ships and unprecedented for armored cruisers. They would be protected with [...] of belt and turret armour and [...] of deck armour and be capable of a speed of 20.5 knots. The Tsukubas were intended {{to take the place of}} aging battleships and thus showed Japan's intention of continuing to use armored cruisers in fleet engagements. They were also exactly the type of ships for which the college had argued unsuccessfully to add to the U.S. Navy before switching to battlecruisers.|$|E
