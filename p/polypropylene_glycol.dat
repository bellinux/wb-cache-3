40|$|The {{rejection}} thresholds of Phormia regina Meigen for twenty-four glycols {{have been}} determined. A definite {{relationship between the}} concentration of the test material {{and the distribution of}} thresholds has been noted regularly in samples of flies selected at random from a population of known age which had been reared under standard conditions. The scattering of thresholds is normal with respect to the logarithm of concentration. Recalculation of the data of other workers reveals the same sort of relationship with other species of insects and the minnow Phoxinus. The underlying reason for the phenomenon is not known. The glycols in common with other series of homologous alipbatic compounds are rejected at logarithmically decreasing concentrations as the chain length is increased. In general the straight chain diols are more stimulating than the corresponding polyethylene and <b>polypropylene</b> <b>glycols.</b> This difference is related in some manner to the presence of ether linkages in the latter. <b>Polypropylene</b> <b>glycols,</b> with chains of three carbon atoms between the ether linkages are more stimulating than polyethylene glycols, where the spacing is —O—C—C—O—. Unipolymers are more stimulating than mixtures of homologues with the same average molecular weights. Polyethylene glycol 1540 is the largest molecule of measured molecular weight known to stimulate chemoreceptors. The introduction of a second terminal hydroxyl group into the straight hydrocarbon chain reduces the stimulating effect. Alcohols corresponding to the first three diols average about four times as stimulating as the latter while those corresponding to the higher diols average more than one hundred times as stimulating...|$|R

The variations in the apparent molar volumes and heat capacities of both solutes, calculated from the densities and heat capacities of the solutions, are unusually large {{in the vicinity of}} the CMC, reflecting the existence of very strong interactions between CTAB and PPOs.

Surface tension rapidly decreased to an asymptotic value at 2 pphp surfactant. In accordance with this, cell size decreased and closed cell content increased rapidly to constant values at low surfactant concentrations (< 1 pphp).

The apparent and transfer molar volumes and heat capacities of the solutes, surfactant and polymer, were deduced therefrom. From the analysis of their variations {{as a function of}} the surfactant concentration, it was shown that mainly strong hydrophobic interactions are involved between solutes, similar to the medium chain (C 4 –C 6) 1 -alcohols in equivalent surfactant systems. However, the large variations of these properties observed close to the critical micellar concentration signify profound structural changes in micelles caused by the presence of the polymer.

Scientists carefully analyze the scents to match what they are supposed to smell like. Another important factor in the scents is the emission of cyclohexanone and toluene. Though the chemicals are naturally toxic, MEG is careful to use them at levels much lower than established permissible exposure limits, so they are safe. They make the formulas in laboratories in the United States, although the toys are produced in China. This is so because they want to control the quality of the toys.

5000|$|Polymeric polyols {{are usually}} {{polyethers}} or polyesters. Polyether polyols {{are made by}} reacting epoxides like ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with the multifunctional initiator {{in the presence of}} a catalyst, often a strong base such as potassium hydroxide or a double metal cyanide catalyst such as zinc hexacyanocobaltate-t-butanol complex. Common polyether diols are polyethylene glycol, <b>polypropylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol. The examples shown below are fairly low molecular weight triols based on glycerin (a triol) being reacted with propylene oxide, ethylene oxide or a combination of the two. In reality, the chains would not be of equal length in any one molecule and there would be a distribution of molecular weight polyols within the material. Polyether polyols account for about 90% of the polymeric polyols used industrially; the balance is polyester polyols.Another class of polymeric polyols is the polyesters. Polyesters are formed by condensation or step-growth polymerization of diols and dicarboxylic acids (or their derivatives), for example diethylene glycol reacting with phthalic acid. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group and the carboxylic acid (or their derivatives) may be within the same molecule, as in the case of caprolactone. The example below is an idealized structure that could be obtained by reacting pentaerythritol (a tetrol) with gamma-butyrolactone.Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene is a polyol used to produce polyurethane.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{mobility}} at {{glass transition}} was studied {{by means of}} the thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) method in several glass-forming systems, including simply constituted liquids (propylene <b>glycol),</b> polymers (<b>poly(propylene</b> <b>glycols)),</b> and block co-polymers (polyurethanes). In all cases the TSDC thermogram was more complex than thermograms obtained with the same materials using other experimental techniques: classical ac dielectric methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). A sharp dipolar peak is always present in the TSDC thermograms at the glass transition temperature, as it is determined by DSC. The question is examined as to whether a part of the TSDC thermogram is due to space charge formation related to morphology changes at glass transition. The complex TSDC thermograms were experimentally decomposed into approximately single responses by means of special techniques offered by the TSDC method (thermal sampling techniques) and the spectra of activation energies and entropy factors were determined. © 1991...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} foam drainage equation (Leonard and Lemlich, 1965; Goldfarb et al., 1988) {{was taken}} to model froth water flow in laboratory flotation column, using <b>polypropylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (PPG 425 and PPG 725) as frothers. Simulations were run to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} model with respect to operating parameters. In the absence of particles, the model is in agreement with the experiments within a certain range of frother concentration; below and above which, it failed. Experimentally measured water flow rate was overestimated by the model at low and high frother concentration. Such discrepancies may be attributed to the assumptions accompanying the standard foam drainage equation. For instance, the model was modified to accommodate the effect of surface shear viscosity, which was measured using a deep channel surface shear viscometer. When plotted against frother concentration, surface shear viscosity follows the same trend as that of net water flow rate. It showed a maximum value within an intermediate range of frother concentration. The modified foam drainage equation that takes into account the interfacial properties of the gas-liquid interface significantly reduced the discrepancies between the model and experiment. However, a further improvement of the model is necessary to be applicable to three phase flowing froths in mineral processing industry. Laza Randriamanjatosoa, Max Zanin, Stephen Grano[URL]...|$|R

During the extraction process, anionic species like TcO{sub 4 }{sup {minus}} and I{sup {minus}} are selectively transferred to the less dense PEG-rich aqueous phase. The partition coefficients {{for a wide range of}} inorganic cations and anions, such as sodium, potassium, aluminum, nitrate, nitrite, and carbonate, are all less than one. The partition coefficients for pertechnetate ranged from 12 to 50, depending on the choice of waste simulant and temperature. The partition coefficient for iodide was about 5, while that of iodate was about 0. 25. Irradiation of the PEG phase with gamma-ray doses up to 20 Mrad had no detectable effect on the partition coefficients. The most selective extraction systems examined were those based on PPGs, which exhibited separation factors in excess of 3000 between TcO{sub 4 }{sup {minus}} and NO{sub 3 }{sup {minus}}/NO{sub 2 }{sub {minus}}.

40|$|Secondary relaxations with {{properties}} {{closely related}} to the α-relaxation have fundamental importance in glass-forming substances including polymers. To distinguish these secondary relaxations from those involving intramolecular degrees of freedom, they are called the Johari-Goldstein (JG) β-relaxations. Acting as the precursor of the α-relaxation, the JG β-relaxation is supposedly ubiquitous in all glass-formers, a thesis supported by experiments on a variety of glass-formers. Notwithstanding, the JG β-relaxation has not been identified definitively in the hydroxyl-terminated <b>polypropylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (PPGs) with various molecular weights, despite these polymers have been intensively studied experimentally in the last several decades. The difficulty of finding the JG β-relaxation is due to the presence of a faster intramolecular -relaxation and a slower relaxation originating from residual water. This is demonstrated in two recent papers by Gainaru et al. Macromolecules 2010, 43, 1907, and Kaminski et al. Macromolecules 2013, 46, 1973. In this paper, we show the presence of the JG β-relaxation in the PPGs from the dielectric relaxation data by using the time honored criterion derived from the coupling model in conjunction with the observed anomalous temperature dependence of the -relaxation caused by merging with the JG β-relaxation, and new experimental data obtained by applying pressure on PPG 4000 before and after drying the sample to remove the residual water. From the results, we conclude that the behavior of the PPGs is no different from the other glass-formers as far as the omnipresence of the JG β-relaxation is concerned...|$|R

A total of 15 defused military weapons including grenades, mines, rockets, submunitions, and mortars were examined. Swabs and wipes were used to collect trace (residual) amounts of explosives and their organic constituents from the defused military weapons and micrometer-size explosive particles were transferred using a vacuum suction-impact collection device (vacuum impactor) from wipe and swap samples to an impaction plate made of carbon. The particles deposited on the carbon plate were then characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy followed by DART-HRMS providing fingerprint signatures of orthogonal nature. The optical microscope of the micro-Raman spectrometer was first used to localize and characterize the explosive charge on the impaction plate which was then targeted for identification by DART-HRMS analysis in both the negative and positive modes. Raman spectra of the explosives TNT, RDX and PETN were acquired from micrometer size particles and characterized by the presence of their characteristic Raman bands obtained directly at the surface of the impaction plate nondestructively without further sample preparation. Negative mode DART-HRMS confirmed the types of charges contained in the weapons (mainly TNT, RDX, HMX, and PETN; either as individual components or as mixtures). These energetic compounds were mainly detected as deprotonated species [M–H] −, or as adduct [M + 35 Cl] −, [M + 37 Cl] −, or [M + NO 3] − anions. Chloride adducts were promoted in the heated DART reagent gas by adding chloro-form vapors to the helium stream using an Bin-house^ delivery method. When the polarity was switched to positive mode, DART-HRMS revealed a very complex distribution of poly-meric binders (mainly polyethylene <b>glycols</b> and <b>polypropylene</b> <b>glycols),</b> plasticizers (e. g., dioctyl sebacate, tributyl phosphate), as well as wax-like compounds whose structural features could not be precisely assigned.

These results clearly demonstrate the complementarity of micro-Raman microscopy combined with DART-MS. The former technique provides structural information on the type of explosives present at the surface of the sample, whereas the latter provides not only a confirmation {{of the nature of the}} explosive charge but also useful additional information regarding the nature of the complex organic matrix of binders, plasticizers, polymers, oils, and potentially other organic additives and contaminants present in the sample.

It is an alternative to conventional solvent debinding. The topic {{of this study is}} to model and simulate the supercritical debinding stage to elucidate the mechanism of polymer degradation and stabilization with a three-dimensional model. Modelling this extraction process would optimize the process on an industrial scale. It can be physically described by Fick’s law of diffusion. The model’s main parameter is the diffusion coefficient, which is identified by using linear regression based on the least-squares method. In the model, an effective length scale is specially developed to take into account the diffusion in all directions. The tests were performed for extracting polyethylene glycol, an organic additive, using supercritical CO 2 in injected components. The feedstock is composed of <b>polypropylene,</b> polyethylene <b>glycol,</b> and stearic-acid as binder mixed with Inconel 718 super-alloy powders. The identified parameters were used to calculate the diffusion coefficient and simulate the supercritical debinding step on the Comsol Multiphysics® finite-element software platform to predict the remaining binder.

The proposed numerical simulations allow for the determination of the remaining polyethylene glycol (PEG) binder distribution with respect to processing parameters for components during the supercritical debinding process at any time. Moreover, this approach can be used in other formulation, powder, and binder systems...|$|R
40|$|From {{the point}} of better {{biocompatibility}} and sustainability, biobased shape memory polymers (SMPs) are highly desired. We used 1, 3 -propanediol, sebacic acid, and itaconic acid, which have been industrially produced via fermentation or extraction with large quantities as the main raw materials for the synthesis of biobased <b>poly(propylene</b> sebacate). Diethylene <b>glycol</b> was used to tailor {{the flexibility of the}} polyester. The resulted polyesters were found to be promising SMPs with excellent shape recovery and fixity (near 100 % and independent of thermomechanical cycles). The switching temperature and recovery speed of the SMPs are tunable by controlling the composition of the polyesters and their curing extent. The continuously changed switching temperature ranging from 12 to 54 °C was realized. Such temperature range is typical for biomedical applications in the human body. The molecular and crystalline structures were explored to correlate to the shape memory behavior. The combination of potential biocompatibility and biodegradability of the biobased SMPs makes them suitable for fabricating biomedical devices. © 2011 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} thermodynamics of copolymers, {{based on}} ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) units, at the laponite (RD) clay/liquid interface was determined at 298 K. The copolymer nature was tuned at molecular level {{by changing the}} hydrophilicity, the architecture and the molecular weight (Mw) keeping constant the EO/PO ratio. Polyethylene (PEGs) and <b>polypropylene</b> (PPGs) <b>glycols</b> with varying Mw and their mixture were also investigated to discriminate {{the role of the}} EO and the PO segments in the adsorption process. Enthalpies of transfer of RD, at fixed concentration, from water to the aqueous macromolecule solutions as functions of the macromolecule molality were determined. They were treated quantitatively by means of a model based on two equilibria: (1) one-to-one binding between the macromolecule and the site on the solid and (2) two-to-one binding following which one macromolecule interacts with another one adsorbed onto the solid. The good agreement between the equilibrium constants obtained from calorimetry and those determined from kinetic experiments conformed the reliability of the experimental and theoretical approaches. Almost all of the systems investigated are highlighted by the one-to-one binding; the L 35 and 10 R 5 systems present both equilibria. The insights provided by the thermodynamics of adsorption of their homopolymers onto RD were fruitful in obtaining detailed information {{on the nature of the}} forces involved between RD and the copolymers. The data obtained in the present work clearly evidenced that for comparable polymer Mw, PPG is more suitable in building up a steric barrier around the RD particles and, indeed, exhibits several advantages and no drawbacks. Moreover, the parent copolymers may properly functionalize the RD surface by exploiting both their high affinity to the solid surface and the ability to self-assemble onto it as L 35 and 10 R 5 clearly showed...|$|R
