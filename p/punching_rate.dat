50|$|Adegbuyi {{shocked the}} fans in France during the first round, {{dominating}} the champion with excellent power punches and a great jab. He showed no fear whatsoever for Verhoeven and used his advantage in reach to perfection, even rocking the Dutchman with one good shot. Verhoeven countered with great kicks in the second round, forcing Adegbuyi to move more and negate the jab. Adegbuyi missed several big shots, and his <b>punching</b> <b>rate</b> dropped considerably. Adegbuyi tired quickly in the third, as Verhoeven started finding his range and speeding up. His corner urged him on to keep moving, taking advantage of Adegbuyi's relative inexperience and evening's tendency to rely on his boxing too much.|$|E

On {{the base}} of bionics and {{mechanics}} of vibration, the mechanism of the structure and function of robot joint vibration reduction was researched {{for more and more}} prominent vibration problems {{in the design of the}} robot. Drawing the model by Solid works and making finite element analysis (FEA) by Abaqus, vibration frequency was analyzed on different condition, exploring the influence of vibration of robot joint with and without package coatings as well as with and without holes in the package coatings. The experiment and simulation result showed that vibration reduction effect was obvious in robot joint covering package coatings with high <b>punching</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic punch presses, which {{power the}} ram with a {{hydraulic}} cylinder {{rather than a}} flywheel, and are either valve controlled or valve and feedback controlled. Valve controlled machines usually allow a one stroke operation allowing the ram to stroke up and down when commanded. Controlled feedback systems allow the ram to be proportionally controlled to within fixed points as commanded. This allows greater control over the stroke of the ram, and increases <b>punching</b> <b>rates</b> as the ram no longer has to complete the traditional full stroke up and down but can operate within a very short window of stroke.|$|R

To access any of the 256 tracks of 32 words, the drum had one group of 16 read and one group of 16 write heads, each group on independent moveable arms, each capable of moving to one of 16 positions. Access time was 15 milliseconds if the heads were already in position; an additional 35 milliseconds was required if the heads had to be moved. There was no rotational delay incurred when reading from and writing to drum. Data was transferred between drum and one of the 32-word delay lines.|$|R

As the WAP (Wooden Acoustic Panel) {{is a kind}} of newly-emerged {{functional}} and decorative building material, this dissertation conducted a scientific analysis on its qualitative and functional design requirements. The method of QFD (Quality Function Deployment) was introduced in this dissertation. Through market survey, voice of customer about qualitative requirements on the WAP was obtained, while a customer needs deployment table was gained based on requirement transformation and clustering. Then a technical requirement deployment table was prepared corresponding to the customers ’ requirements. Finally, the quality house for product plan and location of components were acquired. The result indicates that the quality and function requirement of WAP obviously cover the following perspectives: firstly attaching great importance to improvement in acoustic absorption and price reduction, specifically paying attention to material selection of core materials, panel thickness, <b>punching</b> <b>rate</b> and aperture; secondly taking environmental protection and decorative function into consideration which means to concern surface material selection, decorative function and glue joint technique, and finally thinking about the sizes of panels and convenience in installation...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{operations}} such as {{die cutting}} and slitting of sheet materials result in wear of the tooling. A new method {{for measuring the}} abrasive properties of paper and other sheet materials is proposed. The method continuously monitors the force required for penetrating a sheet sample as multiple punches are made with a needle. Abrasive wear caused by the sheet sample changes the geometry of the needle, and consequently changes the penetration force. The trend of the force {{is used as a}} measure of the abrasivity of the sheet sample. Several sheet paper samples were tested using this method with two different needle geometries. In all cases, the magnitude of the force decreased with an increasing number of <b>punches.</b> The <b>rate</b> of change of force depends on the type of paper and the initial geometry of the needle...|$|R
5000|$|Reviews of Hero {{have been}} mainly positive. People {{magazine}} was unequivocal in its {{praise for the}} book. It called the novel compelling, funny, and touching, and the characters enigmatic. The Times (London) review on {{the publication of the}} UK edition was also largely positive. [...] "Thom is devoid of the grossly stereotypical attributes that comic books link to their gay characters' sexual preference" [...] and [...] "The book is entertaining, though in contrast to its rich core tackling deep social issues, the writing is light..." [...] The Advocate similarly equivocated in its praise. The gay newsmagazine applauded Moore's original superhero characters and Moore's decision to avoid making Thom Creed an outcast. The review also pointed to wittily-written descriptions of Thom masturbating to Internet porn, coming out to his father, and his first kiss. [...] "But otherwise his play-by-play writing style can seem a bit choppy, especially in the story's more poignant moments," [...] the review noted. Nevertheless, [...] "Hero is a quick, at times shallow, but satisfying novel, the kind we all wanted while growing up and hopefully the first in a new genre of young adult literature." [...] In a very brief review, Entertainment Weekly called the book [...] "pulpy" [...] but with good <b>punch,</b> and <b>rated</b> it an A-minus.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} that Lara would be defending his titles in a rematch from 2012 with Vanes Martirosyan, which ended in a draw. The fight was to take place {{as part of a}} triple header also including the Charlo twins and Austin Trout. The fight took place on May 21, 2016 in Las Vegas. On fight night, Lara unofficially weighed 160.5 pounds while Martirosyan came in at 170 pounds. Martirosyan spent much of the fight attempting to impose his strength and body work on Lara. As a result, Martirosyan inadvertently landed multiple low blows until he was deducted a point in the eleventh round. The bout was also plagued by head clashes much like during their previous encounter. In the early rounds both men stayed in perfect range, each relying on their own reflexes and quick transitions from defense to offense. Lara found openings for his sharp punches. As the fight progressed, he was more mobile and dictated the pace, outmaneuvering Martirosyan while managing to land flashy 1-2-1 combinations. After seizing ring generalship, Paulie Malignaggi noted Lara's [...] "fluid footwork" [...] and a resemblance to Pernell Whitaker as he often ducked low and displayed tricky pivot moves to evade Martirosyan's punches by inches.

Design/methodology/approach: In cold forming (deep drawing) operation, sheet metal is subject to large strains in order to obtain the final desired shape. However, under severe forming conditions the sheet metal may experience some thinning and even some tearing during the process. Parameters of the deep forming process that may contribute to such conditions include, aspect ratio, blank initial thickness, forming temperature, shoulder radii of the die and punch, contact conditions between the blank and the die, holder and <b>punch,</b> <b>punch</b> displacement <b>rate,</b> etc. The work presented in the current paper is a first part study of numerical parametric investigation that is dealing with the most influent parameters in a forming process to simulate the deep drawing of square cup (such as geometric parameters and coefficient of friction).

40|$|The carding of the Lyocell {{cellulose}} fiber {{was done}} with a cylindrical cross lap machine supplied by Cormatex Prato, Italy.

The speed of the cross lap machine, the frequency of needle punching, the number of times the mat goes through needle <b>punching,</b> the feeding <b>rate</b> of the carded fiber and the depth of needle penetration determined the level of en-tanglement of the Lyocell fiber which ultimately increased the mechanical properties of the fiber. The good mechanical properties of the carded Lyocell fiber made it a renewable and environmen-tally friendly alternative as reinforcement in composite manufacturing. Compared with other jute fiber reinforced composites, the mechanical properties of the resulting Lyocell composites were found to be better.

40|$|International audienceArcelor Research is {{developing}} a numerical tool to support the feasibility analysis and to optimize the design of hot stamped parts made of USIBOR 1500 P®. To provide formability data and to feed {{the development of a}} fracture criterion, experimental hot stamping tests are carried out at Cemef (Centre for Material Forming). These hot stamping experiments are based on a modified Nakazima-type test. Results reveal that the achievable strain levels depend on process parameters (stroke, velocity, temperature, friction and heat exchange) and blank parameters (initial temperature, thickness and shape). In parallel, a numerical model of these hot stamping tests has been developed with finite element softwares (Forge 2 ®, Forge 3 ® and Abaqus). The numerical simulations confirm the location and the magnitude of the blank thinning. Furthermore, the numerical results are similar to the experimental measurements in terms of <b>punch</b> load, cooling <b>rate</b> and strain distribution.

50|$|Second {{dilemma is}} the biopsy technique. Even though excisional biopsy (removing the entire lesion) is ideal, and {{advocated}} by pathologists, practical reason dictates {{that this should}} not be done. These tumors are often large and presenting on the facial area. Excision of such large tumor would be absolutely contraindicated if the lesion's identity is uncertain. The preferred method of diagnosis is by using a shave biopsy because punch biopsies give up to an 80% false negative rate. While one section of the tumor might show benign melanocytic nevus, another section might show features concerning of severe cellular atypia. When cellular atypia is noted, a pathologist might indicate that the entire lesion should be removed. It is at this point that one can comfortably remove the entire lesion, thus confirming the final diagnosis of lentigo maligna. Despite the high false negative <b>rate,</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies are often used {{and the size of the}} punch biopsy can vary from 1 mm to 2 mm, but it is preferred to use a punch 1.5 mm or larger. Representative samples of the most atypical part of the nevus should be biopsy, often by the aid of dermatoscopy.|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the failure mechanisms of polyurea when {{is loaded with}} an ultra-high strain pressure wave. This kind of loading is present when polyurea {{is used as a}} protective layer against projectiles in ballistics and explosions. A large amount of research has been done on this polymer at room temperature and at lower strain rates, but there is not a lot of information on the failure mechanism of polyurea when is subjected to ultra-high strain rate and low temperatures. Therefore, to understand the failure mechanisms that occur in these loading situations a noveler technique is necessary. Modifications were made to the Laser Spallation Technique in order to load structures under a single transient wave pulse, resulting in two different setups. This study characterized polyurea shock loaded at extreme pressures, strain rates and temperatures. By sandwiching polyurea between two right angle N-BK 7 prism, the sample was subjected to a combined pressure shear stress at strain rates of 2. 8 x 107 s- 1. The stress at failure was determined by Abaqus, a finite element analysis software, that was loaded by interferometrically measured stress wave in the glass prism before it strikes the polyurea sample. A shear strength of of 90 ï¿½ 9. 9 MPa under a pressure of only 119 ï¿½ 13 MPa was measured. Using a different testing setup, polyurea was loaded in tension-shear stress, the stress state at failure was calculated to be 27. 71 ï¿½ 2. 43 MPa in shear and mean normal stress of and 57. 13 ï¿½ 5. 02 MPa. This occurred at a calculated peak strain rate of 3. 7 x 107 s- 1. To explore an even more extreme loading environment, a specialized test setup was employed to load polyurea at temperatures ranging from room temperature to - 100 ï¿½C in an attempt to elucidate brittle behavior. Under these loading conditions polyurea failed in a different way, depending on the displacement constraints of the sample and the way that the stress wave was generated. In the spallation test setup, the spalled strength found through the FEM stress calculations is equal to 1. 11 GPa with a strain rate of 6. 4 x 107 s- 1. Polyurea formed a Hertian cone crack when a certain combination of temperature and energy fluence was used, a failure mechanism not previously observed at room temperature using the maximum energy of the Nd:YAG laser (2. 3 J). Polyurea columns were loaded at different temperatures and energy fluence, showing wing cracks when the samples were loaded at - 60 ï¿½C with 490 KJ/m 2 fluence. Finally, the mechanical behavior of the polyurea was studied by using a modified high-strain <b>rate</b> <b>punching</b> test, creating shear bands at - 20 ï¿½C with a 512. 6 kJ/m 2...|$|R
