5000|$|The trachea is {{the tube}} that carries {{air from the}} throat to the lungs. It is also {{commonly}} referred to as the windpipe. The trachea {{is one of the most}} important parts of the respiratory system and damage to the trachea can indicate a life-threatening emergency. The normal position of the trachea is straight up and down, running along the center of the front side of the throat. Certain conditions can cause the trachea to shift to one side or the other. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention to discover the cause of the shift and begin an appropriate course of treatment. There are several causes for a tracheal deviation, and the condition often presents along with difficulty breathing, coughing and abnormal breath sounds. The most common cause of tracheal deviation is a pneumothorax, which is a collection of air inside the chest, between the chest cavity and the lung. A pneumothorax can be spontaneous, caused by existing lung disease, or by trauma. Treatment varies, depending on the severity of the pneumothorax. Smaller pockets of air tend to dissipate on their own, while larger areas can cause complications and are usually vented by a needle in the chest. As soon as the pneumothorax is treated, the tracheal deviation also will resolve itself. [...] A congenital lack of one lung, surgical removal of a lung or <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> which is an inflammation of the lung membranes caused by an infection. As a result of the wide range of causes of tracheal deviation, it is absolutely essential to seek medical attention in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.|$|E

Surgical lung biopsy revealed PPFE in the upper lobes, including the nodule, and unclassified interstitial pneumonia in the left lower lobe. Our second patient had a history of exposure to domestic birds, indicating a risk of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and presented with advanced lung disease, predominantly in the upper lobes, together with subpleural fibrosis.

50|$|Chyle {{does not}} {{generally}} cause <b>pleural</b> inflammation or <b>fibrosis.</b> Small stable chylous effusions rarely require intervention once the LAM diagnosis is made. Shortness of breath may mandate possibly repeated drainage. Sirolimus is effective for chylous effusions and most experts believe {{it should be}} used as the first line of therapy. Imaging the source of the leak with heavy T2-weighted MRI or contrast lymphangiography is an advised for refractory effusions. Some leaks are amenable to embolization through catheters threaded from groin lymph nodes into the thoracic duct. Thoracic duct ligation can be considered, but since thoracic effusions sometimes originate from ascites that are siphoned into the chest by the bellows action of the thorax, it is important to rule out an abdominal source before considering this option. Pleural symphysis may be required to prevent nutritional and lymphocyte deficiencies that can result from repeated taps or persistent drainage. Chemical pleurodesis is generally an effective therapy for chylothorax, as is mechanical abrasion and talc poudrage.|$|R

The volume of asbestos-induced <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> was computed from the three-dimensional reconstruction of the HRCT scan. Among those with <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> identified on the HRCT scan (n = 29), {{the volume of the}} pleural lesion varied from 0. 01 % (0. 5 ml) and 7. 11 % (260. 4 ml) of the total chest cavity.

40|$|Background Three {{forms of}} asbestos-related benign pleural disease are recognized: {{discrete}} pleural plaques, pleural effusions and diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Of these, diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> {{is the most}} significant on account of its chronicity and associated morbidity. Aims The objectives of this study were to determine the latency of asbestos-induced diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> its presenting features and its clinical course once established. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 75 patients with asbestos-induced diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> referred for assessment at our institution from 1992 to 2007.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} (TGF) -a and its receptor, the {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor, are induced after lung injury and are associated with remodeling in chronic pulmonary diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis and asthma. Expression of TGF-a in the lungs of adult mice causes <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> thickening, and pulmonary hypertension, in addition to increased expression of a transcription factor, early growth response- 1 (Egr- 1). Egr- 1 was increased in airway smooth muscle (ASM) and the vascular adventitia in the lungs of mice conditionally expressing TGF-a in airway epithelium (Clara cell secretory protein–rtTA 1 / 2 /[tetO] 7 –TGF-a 1 / 2). The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the role of Egr- 1 in TGF-a–induced lung disease. To accomplish this, TGF-a–transgenic mice were crossed to Egr- 1 knockout (Egr- 1 ko/ko) mice. The lack of Egr- 1 markedly increased the severity of TGF-a–induced pulmonary dis-ease, dramatically enhancing airway muscularization, increasing pulmonaryfibrosis, andcausinggreaterairwayhyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Smooth muscle hyperplasia, not hypertrophy, caused the ASM thickening in the absence of Egr- 1. No detectable increases in pulmonary inflammation were found. In addition to the airway remodeling disease, vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension were also more severe in Egr- 1 ko/ko mice. Thus, Egr- 1 acts to suppress {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor–mediated airway and vascular muscularization, fibrosis, and airway hyperresponsive-ness in theabsenceof inflammation.

40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} noninvasive markers of treatment-induced side effects. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated after irradiation, and genetic variation in genes related to ROS metabolism might influence the level of radiation-induced adverse effects (AEs). Methods and Materials 92 breast cancer (BC) survivors previously treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy were assessed for the AEs subcutaneous atrophy and fibrosis, costal fractures, lung <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> thickening, and telangiectasias (median follow-up time 17. 1 years). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 203 genes were analyzed for association to AE grade. SNPs associated with subcutaneous fibrosis were validated in an independent BC survivor material (n= 283). The influence of the studied genetic variation on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression level of 18 genes previously associated with fibrosis was assessed in fibroblast cell lines from BC patients. ResultsSubcutaneous fibrosis and atrophy had the highest correlation (r= 0. 76) of all assessed AEs. The nonsynonymous SNP rs 1139793 in TXNRD 2 was associated with grade of subcutaneous fibrosis, the reference T-allele being more prevalent in the group experiencing severe levels of fibrosis. This was confirmed in another sample cohort of 283 BC survivors, and rs 1139793 was found significantly associated with mRNA expression level of TXNRD 2 in blood. Genetic variation in 24 ROS-related genes, including EGFR, CENPE, APEX 1, and GSTP 1, was associated with mRNA expression of 14 genes previously linked to fibrosis (P≤. 005). ConclusionDevelopment of subcutaneous fibrosis can be associated with genetic variation in the mitochondrial enzyme TXNRD 2, critically involved in removal of ROS, and maintenance of the intracellular redox balance...|$|R
40|$|The marked {{difference}} in biopersistence and pathological response between chrysotile and amphibole asbestos {{has been well}} documented. This study is unique in that it has examined a commercial chrysotile product that {{was used as a}} joint compound. The pathological response was quantified in the lung and translocation of fibers to and pathological response in the pleural cavity determined. This paper presents the final results from the study. Rats were exposed by inhalation 6 h/day for 5 days to a well-defined fiber aerosol. Subgroups were examined through 1 year. The translocation to and pathological response in the pleura was examined by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (CM) using noninvasive methods. The number and size of fibers was quantified using transmission electron microscopy and CM. This is the first study to use such techniques to characterize fiber translocation to and the response of the pleural cavity. Amosite fibers were found to remain partly or fully imbedded in the interstitial space through 1 year and quickly produced granulomas (0 days) and interstitial fibrosis (28 days). Amosite fibers were observed penetrating the visceral pleural wall and were found on the parietal pleural within 7 days postexposure with a concomitant inflammatory response seen by 14 days. <b>Pleural</b> fibrin deposition, <b>fibrosis,</b> and adhesions were observed, similar to that reported in humans in response to amphibole asbestos.

40|$|Lungs {{from seven}} cases of diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> with known {{asbestos}} exposure were studied {{to determine the}} gross and microscopic pathological features and relate these to the analysed mineral fibre content of the lung. All seven individuals had had substantial exposure, ranging from two to 25 years, and chronic chest problems and at necropsy all cases met the criteria for compensatable disease. Macroscopically, all had extensive visceral <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and extensive areas of adhesions, and four also had discrete parietal pleural plaques. The histological features were similar in all the cases [...] most strikingly the basket weave pattern of the thickened pleura and a dense subpleural parenchymal interstitial fibrosis with fine honeycombing, extending up to 1 cm into the underlying lung. The similar histological appearances raise the possibility that diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and pleural plaques have a similar pathogenesis. Amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) counts were high in six of the seven cases and chrysotile counts in four; four cases had high mullite counts, but {{the importance of this}} is not known.

We {{hypothesized that the}} cytokines transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{play a major role}} in pleurodesis after intrapleural silver nitrate (SN) injection. Method. Forty rabbits received intrapleurally 0. 5 % SN alone or 0. 5 % SN + anti-TGF beta 1, anti-IL- 8, or anti-VEGF. After 28 days, the animals were euthanized and macroscopic pleural adhesions, microscopic <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> and collagen deposition were analyzed for characterization of the degree of pleurodesis (scores 0 - 4).

40|$|Background/Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{worldwide}} infections, especially in developing countries. Early diagnosis is very important for prevention of the chronic form of the disease and sequel formation. Chest x-ray (CXR) is an easy, feasible, non-expensive and quick tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. "nPatients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 200 chest x-rays of secondary pulmonary TB cases in university-affiliated hospitals. These cases were all proved by a positive sputum smear or culture for mycobacterium tuberculosis. "nResults: In this study, we correlated CXR findings of 100 male and 100 female patients. The peak age of involvement in both groups was 61 - 80 years. None of the chest x-rays were normal. The main radiographic findings were consolidation-infiltration, <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> effusion, cavitation, pleural thickening and bronchiectasis. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was detected in 9 % of the cases. Pulmonary infiltration with consolidation was the most common finding (55 %). Miliary shadowing, atelectasis and pneumomediastinum were the least common presentations. Lymphadenopathy was more common in 40 to 60 -year-old women. Right lung involvement was more common than the left side and the upper zones were involved in most cases. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Infiltration in diabetic patients and fibrotic appearances in hypertensive patients were common findings. "nConclusion: There was no significant difference between our data and the other studies carried out in Iran. The patients were younger in the studies from other countries. However, cavitary lesions were more common in other studies than this study, which seems to be due to the higher prevalence of underlying diseases such as HIV or diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} a scoring system for high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scans analogous to the International Labour Office (ILO) scoring system for plain chest radiographs in patients with asbestos related disease. Interstitial <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> disease, and emphysema were scored, the reproducibility and the interobserver agreement using this scoring system were examined, and the extent of the various types of disease was correlated with measurements of lung function. Sixty asbestos workers (five women and 55 men) mean age 59 (range 34 - 78) were studied. The lungs were divided into upper, middle, and lower thirds. An HRCT score for the extent of pleural disease and pulmonary disease in each third was recorded in a way analogous to the International Labour Office (ILO) method of scoring pleural and parenchymal disease on chest radiographs. A CT score for the extent of emphysema was also recorded. Pleural disease and interstitial fibrosis on the plain chest radiographs were assessed according to the ILO scoring system. A chest radiographic score for emphysema analogous to that used for HRCT was also recorded. Two independent readers assigned HRCT scores that differed by two categories or less in 96 %, 92 %, and 85 % compared with 90 %, 78 %, and 79 % of cases for chest radiographs for <b>fibrosis,</b> emphysema, and <b>pleural</b> disease respectively. There was better intraobserver repeatability for the HRCT scores than for the chest radiograph scores for all disorders.

40|$|Abstract Background The ATM {{protein is}} {{activated}} {{as a result}} of ionizing radiation, and genetic variants of the ATM gene may therefore affect the level of radiation-induced damage. Individuals heterozygous for ATM mutations have been reported to have an increased risk of malignancy, especially breast cancer. Materials and methods Norwegian breast cancer patients (272) treated with radiation (252 of which were evaluated for radiation-induced adverse side effects), 95 Norwegian women with no known history of cancer and 95 American breast cancer patients treated with radiation (44 of which developed ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence, IBTR) were screened for sequence variations in all exons of the ATM gene as well as known intronic variants by denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by sequencing to determine the nature of the variant. Results and Conclusion A total of 56 variants were identified in the three materials combined. A borderline significant association with breast cancer risk was found for the 1229 T>C (Val>Ala) substitution in exon 11 (P-value 0. 055) between the Norwegian controls and breast cancer patients as well as a borderline significant difference in haplotype distribution (P-value 0. 06). Adverse side effects, such as: development of costal fractures and telangiectasias, subcutaneous and lung <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> thickening and atrophy were evaluated in the Norwegian patients. Significant associations were found for several of the identified variants such as rs 1800058 (Leu > Phe) where a decrease in minor allele frequency was found with increasing level of adverse side effects for the clinical end-points pleural thickening and lung fibrosis, thus giving a protective effect. Overall our results indicate a role for variation in the ATM gene both for risk of developing breast cancer, and in radiation induced adverse side effects. No association could be found between risk of developing ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and any of the sequence variants found in the American patient material. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of non-malignant chest x ray abnormalities in cases of mesothelioma 184 cases of mesothelioma (72 pleural and 112 peritoneal) which had occurred in a cohort of asbestos insulation workers followed up since 1967 were studied. Chest x ray films of satisfactory quality, on which {{the presence or absence}} of non-malignant radiological changes indicating interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> or both, could be assessed with a high degree of certainty were available. In some cases (20 % for pleural mesothelioma, 11. 6 % for peritoneal mesothelioma) non-malignant radiological changes were not radiologically detectable. Parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (small irregular opacities) only was found in a proportion of cases (25. 4 % of pleural mesotheliomas, 12. 5 % of peritoneal mesotheliomas). <b>Pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> only was detected in 17 % of cases of pleural mesothelioma and 27 % of cases of peritoneal mesothelioma. Most patients had both parenchymal and <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Although these results tend to indicate that in peritoneal mesothelioma the proportion of <b>pleural</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is significantly higher, these findings might have been due to the fact that in most cases of pleural mesothelioma non-malignant changes were interpreted in one hemithorax only. In 46 cases (21 pleural, 25 peritoneal) in which sufficient lung tissue was available histopathology of lung parenchyma indicated the presence of interstitial fibrosis; in 20 (43. 5 %) of these the chest x ray film had been read as negative. Thus the absence of radiologically detectable small opacities on the chest x ray film does not exclude the existence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in cases of mesothelioma among insulation workers. With lower levels of exposure (such as in family contacts of asbestos workers) it is conceivable that mesothelioma might occur in the absence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E

Most clinical sign found in pleural TB was dyspnea, swelling of lymph nodes in lymphadenitis TB, weakness of extremities in bone TB, abdominal distention in peritonitis TB, and loss of consciousness in meningitis TB. Microbiology examination was performed in 72, 5 % patients, hematology examination was performed in 69, 1 % patients, biopsy was performed in 67, 6 % patients,and radiology examination was performed in 85, 3 % patients, Most common complication found in <b>pleural</b> TB was <b>fibrosis,</b> abscess in lymphadenitis TB, paraplegia in bone TB, ascites in peritonitis TB, and hydrocephalus in meningitis TB. Most length of stay of EPTB patients was > 2 weeks and 76, 5 % patients were recovered. Conclusions: Clinical patterns of EPTB were greatly varied and additional examinations, such as microbiology, hematology, biopsy, and radiology examination could lead to a proper diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{group of}} {{man-made}} mineral or vitreous fibres (MMMFs or MMVFs) includes glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, glass filaments and microfibres, and refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs). Experimental observations have provided evidence that {{some types of}} MMVF are bioactive under certain conditions. The critical role of size parameters has been demonstrated in cellular and animal experiments, when intact fibres are {{in direct contact with}} the target cells. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the results from these studies to humans since they bypass inhalation, deposition, clearance and translocation mechanisms. Inhalation studies are more realistic, but show differences between animal species regarding their sensibility to tumour induction by fibres. Fibre biopersistence is an important factor, as suggested by recent inhalation studies, which demonstrate positive results with RCF for fibrosis, lung tumours and mesothelioma. There is no firm evidence that exposure to glass-, rock- and slag wool is associated with lung <b>fibrosis,</b> <b>pleural</b> lesions, or nonspecific respiratory disease in humans. Exposure to RCF could enhance the effects of smoking in causing airways obstruction. An elevated standard mortality ratio for lung cancer has been demonstrated in cohorts of workers exposed to MMVF, especially in the early technological phase of mineral (rock slag) wool production. During that period, several carcinogenic agents (arsenic, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) were also present at the workplace and quantitative data about smoking and fibre levels are lacking. It is not possible from these data to determine whether the risk of lung cancer is due to the MMVFs themselves. No increased risk of mesothelioma has been demonstrated in the cohorts of workers exposed to glass-, slag- or rock wool. There are in fact insufficient epidemiological data available concerning neoplastic diseases in RCF production workers because of the small size of the workforce and the relatively recent industrial production.

40|$|Abstract Background Accuracy in the {{clinical}} diagnosis of asbestosis has significant implications for the future health of affected patients as well as serious medicolegal implications for both patients and asbestos-associated industries. The radiographic gold-standard for diagnosis of asbestosis has been the plain chest radiograph, and in many asbestosis-screening clinics, chest radiograph abnormalities {{in conjunction with a}} history of asbestos exposure have been the mainstay of diagnosis. No studies have yet compared the antemortem chest radiographic diagnosis of asbestosis with the subsequent presence of pulmonary fibrosis and lung tissue ferruginous bodies at autopsy. Methods Records were reviewed from 273 autopsies performed to investigate asbestosis over an 11 -year period. Accrued data included age and gender as well as {{the presence or absence of}} the following: occupational exposure to asbestos, antemortem clinical diagnosis of asbestosis by chest radiograph, fibrous pleural plaques, peribronchiolar or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, ferruginous bodies in histologic sections of lung tissue, and ferruginous bodies in digested lung tissue. Results 242 cases with the antemortem radiographic diagnosis of asbestosis (study group) were identified. 31 additional autopsies had been requested based on history of asbestos exposure without radiographic documentation of asbestosis (control group). Comparison of the two groups showed a statistically significant increase in the association of chest radiograph-diagnosed asbestosis and the presence at autopsy of pleural plaques (p = 0. 0109), peribronchiolar or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (p = 0. 0472), and histologically-diagnostic asbestosis (p = 0. 0021). At autopsy, histologically-diagnostic asbestosis was confirmed in only 90 of the 243 study group cases. Comparison of individual parameters within the 242 study group cases showed a statistically significant correlation between the presence of fibrous pleural plaques and histologically-proven pulmonary fibrosis (p = 0. 0025) as well as the subsequent histologic diagnosis of asbestosis (p Conclusion Clinical diagnosis of asbestosis by screening chest radiograph is more predictive of the postmortem presence of fibrous <b>pleural</b> plaques, pulmonary <b>fibrosis,</b> and histologically-proven asbestosis than is occupational exposure history alone. However, chest radiograph-based diagnosis of asbestosis significantly overpredicts the subsequent histologic diagnosis of asbestosis. </p...|$|R
