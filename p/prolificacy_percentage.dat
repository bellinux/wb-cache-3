40|$|With the {{objective}} to evaluate reproductive response in Dorper ewes were studied during non-breeding season under tropical conditions of Mexico. Ewes {{were randomly assigned}} to one of three treatments: T 1 (n = 20) : continuous breeding; T 2 (n = 15) : 65 mg Medroxiprogesterone Acetate (MPA) + 500 I. U. equine Chorionic Gonadotrophin (eCG) at sponge removal+controlled breeding and T 3 (n = 16) : 100 μg of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) (Day 0) + 7. 5 mg of luprostiol (Day 5) and 100 μg of GnRH (Day 6. 5). Estrus percentages were 65, 93. 3 and 25 % for T 1, T 2 and T 3, respectively. The average pregnancy percentage was 43. 7 % with the higher value for T 2 and the lower for T 3 and the <b>prolificacy</b> <b>percentage</b> was 100 % for all the treatments. It is was concluded that intravaginal sponges impregnated with 65 mg of medroxiprogesterone acetate used during 12 days, plus 500 I. U. of eCG, efficiently synchronized estrus in Dorper ewes whereas the ovsynch scheme presented low pregnancy and <b>prolificacy</b> <b>percentage...</b>|$|E
