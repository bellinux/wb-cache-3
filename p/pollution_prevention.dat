5|$|The 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) is {{the only}} global {{organization}} that conserves {{a broad range of}} animals, of which includes marine mammals. Of the agreements made, three of them deal with the conservation of marine mammals: ACCOBAMS, ASCOBANS, and the Wadden Sea Agreement. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) adopted a <b>pollution</b> <b>prevention</b> approach to conservation, which many other conventions at the time also adopted.|$|E
5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and <b>pollution</b> <b>prevention</b> documents. A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a <b>pollution</b> <b>prevention</b> measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, <b>pollution</b> <b>prevention,</b> fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E

With {{increasing}} import {{and export}} volumes of oil products in China, port terminals are under increased pressure to prevent water <b>pollution.</b> The <b>prevention</b> of offshore oil spill accidents, and the remedial and control measures for such accidents {{are one of}} the most important aspects of maritime management, and are also major issues for the entire shipping industry. This paper describes different emergency materials and equipment for oil spill management and describes the use of these techniques in domestic and international ports. Suggested changes to port emergency materials and equipment are also described, based on the processing capabilities for oil spills in different situations, combined with the port's environmental characteristics and ecological situation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addressed}} the suitable width for riparian vegetated buffer strips (RVBS) using topographic analyses, attenuation curves, and an index model. The Chi Chia Wang Stream {{is susceptible to}} pollution because of highly saturated hydraulic conductivity and excessive fertilizer use in the nearby cultivated lands. The buffer strip widths calculated from a potassium attenuation curve in the vegetable plot were the widest due to easy potassium movement in the soil. A potassium safety soil depth of 8. 81 m was calculated or estimated for the vegetable area. The buffer width derived from this safety depth is recommended for maximum agricultural nonpoint source <b>pollution</b> (ANSP) <b>prevention.</b> (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|Pollution {{control is}} a term used in {{environmental}} management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, <b>pollution</b> <b>prevention</b> and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique {{for the prevention of}} urban runoff.|$|E
