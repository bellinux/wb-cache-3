40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} operating hand-held power tools {{has been associated}} with various health consequences. The magnitude of HTV is strongly affected by the hand-handle interface coupling forces, handle geometry and gripping method apart. Assessment of the HTV exposure currently does not incorporate the impact of coupling forces exerted at the hand-handle interface, mostly due to lack of reliable measurement methods for hand-handle interface forces. This dissertation seeks to develop a low cost hand-handle coupling force measurement system and methods for quantifying the hand grip and push forces applied to the tool handles. A hand-handle interface force measurement system was developed using flexible force sensing resistors (FlexiForce). The static properties of the sensors were thoroughly characterized in terms of linearity, hysteresis and repeatability. Moreover, the sensors’ output characteristics were observed by considering the effect of positioning, area and flexibility of the loading medium used to transmit the applied forces. Five different cylindrical and elliptical instrumented handles were subsequently chosen to observe the input-output characteristics of the sensors under stationary and vibrating conditions. The measurements under static and dynamic conditions revealed good linearity and repeatability of the sensors, and affirmed their feasibility for accurate estimations of the hand grip and push forces. The sensors’ outputs also showed strong dependence on the loading medium’s area, position and flexibility as well as the length of the sensor suggesting the need for individual sensor calibration, which was noted as the primary limitation of the system. The effectiveness of the measurement system was further explored through measurements of hand forces on a <b>percussion</b> <b>tool</b> handle and biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm system. The measurement system provided reasonably good estimations of the hand grip and push forces when applied to the <b>percussion</b> <b>tool</b> handle under both stationary as well as vibration conditions. The biodynamic impedance responses measured with six subjects showed trends similar to the reference response. However, a compensation function was necessary and subsequently proposed to account for the limited bandwidth of the sensors. ...|$|E
40|$|A few lithic {{percussion}} tools, probably {{related to}} construction and craftsmanship, {{are stored in}} the National Museum of Archaeology of Valletta (Malta). Dated to the Temple Period (about 4000 - 2500 BCE), many are typologically similar to artefacts from the continental area, but others look distinctive and probably developed in loco in response to specific needs. This paper examines five stone hammers with different hafting methods (three of them show grooves or holes and two both grooves and holes). A huge double hand grip <b>percussion</b> <b>tool</b> belongs to a different and unusual typology: the double grip allowed two opposite-standing men, steadily holding it, to strike with strength on other surfaces, probably when heavy blows were needed. Grooved stone hammers are widespread in various European regions and are mostly associated with mining activities. In the Maltese archipelago the limestone lacks ore deposits, and thus their presence may be reflect other uses, although still associated {{to the work of}} stone on stone: earthworks, quarrying, finishing of stone surfaces, hydraulic works, excavation of burial and rituals structures, and others. The double grip lithic percussor (ID 9120) has no precise parallel and may be unique. This paper aims to fill a gap in the current literature about prehistoric lithic tools, as in many studies the focus is often placed on the results of specific activities rather than on the typological features of the artefacts that made these activities possible...|$|E
40|$|An our {{research}} on Siena and Central Tuscany has {{enabled us to}} formulate hypotheses on the evolution, through time, of the different finishing techniques for exposed brick surfaces. We identified three main phases. 1. The first one dates back to {{between the end of}} the 12 th and {{the second half of the}} 13 th century. The most significant building is the cathedral of Siena: the original brick walls of the Romanesque church are finished with diagonal or herringbone hatching. The hatching was executed with a small flat-bladed axe, working the fired bricks one by one before laying. This technique links Siena cathedral to the Romanesque and early Gothic brick churches of the Po Valley. 2. A new finishing technique, one of the most refined in Europe, was introduced towards the end of the 13 th century. The most significant example is the first floor façade of the Town Hall of Siena. All the building work is in herringbone hatched rubbed bricks. Moreover, the first floor was planned to receive a red colouring directly spread on bricks, enriched, in the decorative features, with golden yellow and light blue. In order to obtain a hatching with accurate parallel lines, they could not have used an axe as in the previous phase. They might have used a thin flat bladed <b>percussion</b> <b>tool,</b> the strokes of which can be recognized. 3. The use of hatching in Siena did not continue beyond the second half of the 14 th century, and this trend seems common to other Tuscan towns. However, the taste for giving exposed brickwork a refined finish had not been exhausted. The 15 th-century façades of many gothic and renaissance buildings were entirely realized with rubbed bricks. According to Leon Battista Alberti the rubbing was done after the firing and before the laying, brick by brick, with the same technique as in the preceding century...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work focused to {{investigate}} {{the use of a}} powered automatic technique to insert acetabular cup implants. The use of a <b>percussion</b> hammer <b>tool</b> as a surgical instrument to insert acetabular cup implants was investigated in current work. Pull-out, lever-out and torque tests were carried out on cup implants inserted into test block specimens of polyurethane (PU) using specifically designed experimental setups as a means of comparing the current mallet and cup introducer (manual impaction) technique against the <b>percussion</b> hammer <b>tool</b> (powered impaction) technique. The experimental tests were based on calculating the maximum forces or moments of forces required to remove the cup implants from a test block specimen, which was representative of the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. It was found, the cup implants inserted using the powered impaction technique required a greater applied force, moment of force and torque in order to remove the cup from the cavity of the PU block specimen in the pull-out, lever-out and torque tests respectively. In terms of stability, the <b>percussion</b> hammer <b>tool</b> has the potential to improve the seating of cup implants within the cavity using a more precise and controlled technique, thus improving the over stability of the inserted cup implant...|$|R

50|$|The {{modern history}} of {{petroleum}} {{began in the}} 19th century with the refining of paraffin from crude oil. The Scottish chemist James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, {{at the same time}} obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery.In 1846, Baku (settlement Bibi-Heybat) the first ever well drilled with <b>percussion</b> <b>tools</b> to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration.In 1848, Young set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.|$|R
5000|$|Hard hammer {{percussion}} is {{the first}} step. It involves knocking off the larger flakes to achieve the desired lithic core for the flake tool.

The DOE and TerraTek continue to wait for Novatek on the optimization portion of the testing program (they are completely rebuilding their fluid hammer). The latest indication is that the Novatek tool would be ready for retesting only 4 Q 2004 or later. Smith International's hammer was tested in April of 2004 (2 Q 2004 report). Accomplishments included the following: (1) TerraTek re-tested the ''optimized'' fluid hammer provided by Smith International during April 2004. Many improvements in mud hammer rates of penetration were noted over Phase 1 benchmark testing from November 2002. (2) Shell Exploration and Production in The Hague was briefed on various drilling performance projects including Task 8 ''Cutter Impact Testing''. Shell interest and willingness to assist in the test matrix as an Industry Advisor is appreciated. (3) TerraTek participated in a DOE/NETL Review meeting at Morgantown on April 15, 2004. The discussions were very helpful and a program related to the Mud Hammer optimization project was noted [...] Terralog modeling work on <b>percussion</b> <b>tools.</b> (4) Terralog's Dr. Gang Han witnessed some of the full-scale optimization testing of the Smith International hammer in order to familiarize him with downhole tools.

5000|$|Salt was a {{valuable}} commodity, and an industry developed near salt springs in the Ohio River Valley, producing salt by evaporating brine from the springs. Salt wells were sunk at the salt springs {{to increase the}} supply of brine for evaporation. Some of the wells were hand-dug, but salt producers also learned to drill wells by <b>percussion</b> (cable <b>tool)</b> methods. In a number of locations in western Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, {{oil and natural gas}} came up the wells along with the brine. The oil was mostly a nuisance, but some salt producers saved it and sold it as illuminating oil or medicine. In some locations, enough natural gas was produced to be used as fuel for the salt evaporating pans. [...] Early salt brine wells that produced byproduct oil included the Thorla-McKee Well of Ohio in 1814, a well near Burkesville, Kentucky, in 1828, and wells at Burning Springs, West Virginia, by 1836.|$|R

5000|$|In bipolar {{percussion}} {{the objective}} piece of toolstone {{is placed on}} an anvil stone, and then the percussion {{force is applied to}} the tool stone. [...] Like projectile <b>percussion,</b> the <b>tool</b> stone is likely to shatter, rather than producing a single flake. Unlike projectile percussion, the technique has some degree of control to it. Bipolar percussion is not popular with hobbyists, but there is evidence that bipolar percussion was the preferred way of dealing with certain problems. Bipolar percussion has the benefit of producing many sharp flakes, and triangular pieces of stone which can be useful as drills. Bipolar percussion also does not require the manufacturer to locate a platform before setting to work, and bipolar percussion can produce sharp flakes almost the size of the original piece of tool stone. The lack of control makes bipolar percussion undesirable in many situations, but the benefits mean that it often has a use, especially if workable material is rare. Bipolar percussion is often used to break open small cobbles, or to have a second chance with spent lithic cores, broken bifaces, and tools that have been reworked so much {{that it is impossible to}} make further useful tools using traditional lithic reduction. The end result of bipolar percussion is often a big mess, with only a few pieces that can be useful as cores or flakes for further working, but if other methods would result in a total dead-end, bipolar percussion may be desirable.|$|R

40|$|Tool {{change is}} one {{among the most}} {{frequently}} performed machining processes, {{and if there is}} improper <b>percussion</b> as the <b>tool’s</b> position is changed, the spindle bearing can be damaged. A spindle malfunction can cause problems, such as a knife being dropped or bias in a machined hole. The measures currently taken to avoid such issues, which arose from the available machine tools, only involve determining whether the clapping knife’s state is correct using a spindle and the air adhesion method, which is also used to satisfy the high precision required from mechanical components. Therefore, it cannot be used with any type of machine tool; in addition, improper tapping of the spindle during an automatic tool change cannot be detected. Therefore, this study proposes a new type of diagnostic framework that combines cloud computing and vibration sensors, among of which, tool change is automatically diagnosed using an architecture to identify abnormalities and thereby enhances the reliability and productivity of the machine and equipment...|$|R
