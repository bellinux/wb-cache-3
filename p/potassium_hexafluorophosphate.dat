40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work by Debye and Hückel in the 1920 s, {{the development of}} electrolyte theory and {{the understanding of the}} thermodynamic behavior of electrolyte solutions have taken many different paths. While the behaviors of many electrolytes in water are well described, the behavior of electrolytes in most solvents is incomplete. In addition, thermodynamic comparisons between salts in water and other solvents require information generally not available. This thesis extends the understanding of electrolyte behavior in two very important electrochemical solvents, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran. Three supporting electrolytes that are particularly important to the field of electrochemistry were studied using two experimental techniques. The three electrolytes were tetrabutylammonium <b>hexafluorophosphate,</b> <b>potassium</b> tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate, and tetrabutylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate. ^ The first experimental technique used to study these electrolyte solutions was vapor pressure measurements. Precise vapor pressure measurements are a useful tool for calculated thermodynamic properties such as the activity coefficients. The osmotic coefficients were fit using the Pitzer equation and the resulting fitting parameters were used to calculate the activity coefficients. ^ The second technique used was conductivity measurements. Conductivity measurements are a classical method to determine the behavior of electrolyte solutions. Properties of the electrolyte and solvent that affect the movement of the ions, and their interactions reveal themselves in the conductivity. ^ Lastly, the equilibrium constants for the formation of ion pairs, also called association constants, were calculated using both the activity coefficients and the conductivity measurements. Both methods showed that association constants in acetonitrile were much smaller than in tetrahydrofuran. In addition, the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate anion electrolytes had smaller association constants than the hexafluorophosphate salt in the low dielectric constant solvent, tetrahydrofuran. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis details {{advances}} made {{within the}} field of electroanalytical chemistry through the use of working electrodes that have been activated through application of ultrasound, heat, geometry, chemical modification or composition. Initially the thesis reports the enhanced analytical utility of chemically and compositionally modified working electrodes when directed towards the detection and determination of NO 3 ¯ and NO 2 ¯ anions in environmental samples. This has been achieved through the use of electrodes that have been a) modified with a Cu deposit and b) fashioned from a Cu-Ni alloy. Nitrate and nitrite anions have been successfully determined in a variety of passivating matrices, at analytically relevant detection limits of the order of 10 - 6 M with a dynamic linear range extending from 10 to 200 μM. The methods presented have been shown to surpass existing electrochemical techniques in terms of nitrate/nitrite speciation through separation of the voltammetric signals, where existing analyses have reported the intereference of both species when present in the same solution. The use of ultrasound as a further enhancement to the sensitivity and versatility of the electrochemical detection of nitrate at a chemically modified electrode is then presented. The influence of ultrasound is shown to remove a portion of the deposited copper, but a significant catalytic layer remains, resulting in greater sensitivity during insonation. The effect of temperature on electrochemical systems involving one- and two-electron redox reactions of K 4 Fe(CN) 6, Ru(NH 3) 6 Cl 3, Fe(C 5 H 5) 2, N,N,N',N'tetramethylphenylenediamine, N,N'dimethylphenylenediamine and tris(4 - bromophenyl) amine have been studied under hydrothermal conditions using a novel hydrodynamic method based on a conventional channel flow cell where the working electrode is heated by radio frequency radiation. The diffusion activation parameters obtained with the radio frequency channel cell and computer simulation were compared with independent data from microelectrode high temperature experiments. The application of the heated flow cell as a tool for mechanistic studies is discussed with the investigation of the well characterised ECE reaction of m-iodo-nitrobenzene in acetonitrile, giving a value of 80 ± 5 kJ mol - 1 for the activation energy of the rate constant for the decomposition of the m-iodo-nitrobenzene radical anion. This represents the first observation of an ECE or mechanistically complex reaction at a locally heated electrode. The work presented in the final two chapters of this thesis examines the enhanced activation achieved from modification of the electrode geometry, and in particular the application of microelectrodes to the development of electroanalytical techniques. The electrochemical reduction of the inhalation anaesthetic agent enflurane (2 -chloro- 1, 1, 2 - trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is reported at a variety of microelectrode substrates (Au, Ag, Cu, Pt and glassy carbon) with electrode dimensions varying from 5 to 60 μm. The solvents water, dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile were investigated along with the supporting electrolytes <b>potassium</b> chloride, tetrabutylammonium <b>hexafluorophosphate</b> and various tetraalkylammonium perchlorates. The use of a gold microelectrode with dimethyl sulfoxide solvent and tetraethylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte was found to give well-defined voltammetry. Linear calibration curves were obtained between 0 and 2 % v/v (gaseous additions) or up to 135 mM (gravimetric additions), offering scope {{for the development of a}} rapid, inexpensive electrochemical gas sensor. The analytical utility of the system has been investigated in the presence of oxygen and nitrous oxide in DMSO solvent. The superoxide anion radical, formed from the electro-reduction of dissolved oxygen, is shown to react with enflurane complicating their simultaneous detection. The kinetics of the enflurane / superoxide reaction are found to be first order with respect to both superoxide and enflurane with a rate constant of 0. 25 M - 1 s - 1 determined by three independent methods: steady-state voltammetry, digital simulation of cyclic voltammetric data and UV/Vis spectroscopic analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ionic liquids 1 -brutyl- 3 -methylimidazolium Tetrafluoroborate [BMIM]BF 4 and 1 -brutyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM]PF 6 were {{synthesized}} {{directly from}} 1 -butylbromide, 1 -methylimidazole, sodium tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate using microwave by one-pot under solvent-free conditions in an unmodified household oven. This method requires {{only a few}} minutes of reaction time, in contrast to the several hours needed using conventional methods by two pots that requires a lot of organic solvent. The reaction yield of ionic liquids with intermittent microwave heating is much higher than that of ionic liquids with conventional microwave heating. Thus the intermittent microwave heating is a good method for the reaction. The yield of the two ionic liquids increased slightly with increment of molar ratio of sodium tetrafluoroborate or <b>potassium</b> <b>hexafluorophosphate...</b>|$|E
40|$|A sensitive, selective, and {{reproducible}} in-tube polypyrrole-coated capillary (PPY) solid-phase microextraction {{and liquid}} chromatographic method for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine enantiomers analysis in plasma samples has been developed, validated, and further {{applied to the}} analysis of plasma samples from elderly patients undergoing therapy with antidepressants. Important factors in the optimization of in-tube SPME efficiency are discussed, including the sample draw/eject volume, draw/eject cycle number, draw/eject flow-rate, sample pH, and influence of plasma proteins. Separation of the analytes was achieved with a Chiralcel OD-R column and a mobile phase consisting of <b>potassium</b> <b>hexafluorophosphate</b> 7. 5 mM and sodium phosphate 0. 25 M solution, pH 3. 0, and acetonitrile (75 : 25, v/v) in the isocratic mode, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. Detection was carried out by fluorescence absorbance at Ex/Em 230 / 290 nm. The multifunctional porous surface structure of the PPY-coated film provided high precision and accuracy for enantiomers. Compared with other commercial capillaries, PPY-coated capillary showed better extraction efficiency for all the analytes. The quantification limits of the proposed method were 10 ng/mL for R- and S-fluoxetine, and 15 ng/mL for R- and S-norfluoxetine, with a coefficient of variation lower than 13 %. The response of the method for enantiomers is linear over a dynamic range, from the limit of quantification to 700 ng/mL, with correlation coefficients higher than 0. 9940. The in-tube SPME/LC method can therefore be successfully used to analyze plasma samples from ageing patients undergoing therapy with fluoxetine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
