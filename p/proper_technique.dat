25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting <b>proper</b> <b>technique,</b> a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|E
25|$|Perceived {{failure or}} {{insufficient}} {{devotion to the}} Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind.

25|$|<b>Proper</b> <b>technique</b> is {{also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by {{visualizing}} a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E

25|$|Dancing en pointe {{stresses}} the feet {{in various ways}} and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to <b>proper</b> <b>technique</b> such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the <b>proper</b> <b>technique.</b> Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the <b>proper</b> <b>technique.</b> By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the <b>proper</b> <b>technique</b> or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either {{too much or too little}} foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, phimosis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with <b>proper</b> <b>technique,</b> and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E
500|$|In 1816, {{the family}} moved to Boston, where Willis's father {{established}} the Boston Recorder and, nine years later, the Youth's Companion, the world's first newspaper for children. The elder Willis's emphasis on religious themes earned him the nickname [...] "Deacon" [...] Willis. After attending a Boston grammar school and Phillips Academy at Andover, Nathaniel Parker Willis entered Yale College in October 1823 where he roomed with Horace Bushnell. Willis credited Bushnell with teaching him the <b>proper</b> <b>technique</b> for sharpening a razor by [...] "drawing it from heel to point both ways... the two cross frictions correct each other". At Yale, he further developed an interest in literature, often neglecting his other studies. He graduated in 1827 and spent time touring parts of the United States and Canada. In Montreal, he met Chester Harding, with whom he would become a lifelong friend. Years later, Harding referred to Willis during this period as [...] "the 'lion' of the town". Willis began publishing poetry in his father's Boston Periodical, often using one of two literary personalities under the pen names [...] "Roy" [...] (for religious subjects) and [...] "Cassius" [...] (for more secular topics). The same year, Willis published a volume of poetical Sketches.|$|E

Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact, the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases.

2500|$|The {{health risks}} with {{conventional}} earlobe piercing are common but {{tend to be}} minor, particularly if <b>proper</b> <b>technique</b> and hygienic procedures are followed.

Pierced ears are a significant risk factor for contact allergies to the nickel in jewelry. [...] Earlobe tearing, during the healing period or after healing is complete, can be minimized by not wearing earrings, especially wire-based dangle earrings, during activities {{in which they are}} likely to become snagged, such as while playing sports.
