40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{sustained}} problem of piracy that costs nearly $ 40 {{billion in annual}} revenue losses, the software industry has adopted a number of technical, legal, and economic strategies to curb piracy and stem the resulting losses. Our work complements and contributes to the existing literature by exploring the possible effect of another economic lever [...] product bundling [...] on the relationship governing piracy and seller profits. The traditional economic rationale of demand pooling from bundling that enables sellers to extract higher surplus and its particular attractiveness for information goods with negligible marginal and bundling costs carry over to our analysis. However, the presence of piracy injects several new facets to our analysis. Bundling creates a shared level of piracy of disparate products, and under certain conditions {{to the detriment of}} one of the products. We argue that by construction of the copyright laws, the act of bundling itself can have a deterrence effect. This deterrence effect, along with shared <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and demand pooling are ingredients that together dictate the overall piracy, pricing, profit, and welfare outcomes. Our analysis reveals several interesting insights. Bundling can be profitable even when the very act of bundling increases the piracy level of one of the products in the bundle. Termed phantom piracy, this represents a situation where sellers trade off higher piracy for one product in favor of lower piracy for the other product while deriving overall higher profits. Extensive simulation analysis shows that the region of phantom piracy is vastly expanded when additional products are introduced to the bundle. Conversely, under certain conditions, a profit maximizing seller opts not to bundle even when bundling can serve to lower the overall level of piracy. Price discounts that are typically offered by bundling are sharply deepened when piracy enters the equation. When piracy is a phenomenon to contend with, product bundling always increases consumer surplus even in scenarios where the seller may not realize higher profits. Unlike other forms of price discrimination that are often viewed by consumers with a jaundiced eye as they attempt to extract additional surplus from the consumers, product bundling in the software context can be a win-win scenario for both the buyers and the sellers. software piracy, bundling, copyright, phantom piracy...|$|E
40|$|The <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> movie <b>products</b> {{resulted}} in 72, 000 lost jobs and 4. 5 billion in lost wages to the United States economy in 2012. The {{purpose of this}} multiple case {{study was to explore}} what strategies movie corporation managers use to inhibit <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> movie <b>products</b> to achieve profitability. The sample consisted of 6 movie industry managers who managed movie corporations for not less than 5 years in New York City. The conceptual framework for this study was based on the general systems theory. Data were collected through face-to-face semistructured interviews. Transcript review and member checking were used to ensure credibility and trustworthiness of the interpretation of participants 2 ̆ 7 responses. The 3 major themes that emerged in the study include the perceived effects of movie industry managers 2 ̆ 7 marketing management strategies, legal management strategies, and customer management strategies for inhibiting product piracy. Findings from this study contribute to social change by indicating strategies that other movie industry managers may use to prevent <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>product,</b> sustain business, and reduce the negative effects of job loss. The results of this study thus may contribute to the prosperity of movie industry leaders, employees, their families, communities, and the local economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} analysis <b>of</b> the <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> copyright <b>products</b> has {{used a variety}} of modeling assump-tions, the majority of which are set in typical industrial organization settings. The results of such models are manyfold, but in general they are ambiguous as to the optimal protection strategy, and the effects of protection on the welfare of copyright holders, and on the existence <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> Concretely, little has been said about which types of protection mechanisms are most adequate for controlling piracy. In the present paper, we depart from the traditional industrial organiza-tion type models, and we analyze piracy in a model that is very familiar to economic dynamics — the prey-predator model. In this model, we show that publicly instigated and financed policies designed to deter piracy can have the effect of increasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> while privately financed strategies (e. g.

Research on IPP codes {{is motivated by}} design of schemes that protect against <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>products.</b> Construction and decoding of maximum IPP codes have been studied in rich literature. General bounds on F(n,q), the maximum size of IPP codes of length n over an alphabet with q elements, have been obtained {{through the use of}} techniques from graph theory and combinatorial design. Improved bounds on F(3,q) and F(4,q) are obtained. Probabilistic techniques are also used to prove the existence of certain IPP codes. We prove a precise formula for F(3,q), construct maximum IPP codes with size F(3,q), and give an efficient decoding algorithm for such codes. The main techniques used in this thesis are from graph theory and nonlinear optimization. Our approach may be used to improve bounds on F(2 k+ 1, q). For example, we characterize the associated graphs of maximum IPP codes of length 5, and obtain bounds on F(5,q). Ph. D.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{government}} has been the sole entity to enforce anti-piracy mea-sures. Of late, software vendors are attempting to thwart <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> their <b>products</b> by limiting the patch to only legal users. By doing so, the vendor can vertically differenti-ate the legal copy from the pirated copy since pirates suffer more from hacker activity. Such an action by the vendor has interesting implications on a vendor’s profit and the social welfare. In this paper, by constructing a game-theoretic model, we analyze the economic as well as the policy implications of restricted patch distribution by a monop-olistic vendor. Based on our analysis, we find that a monopolist does not always benefit from vertical differentiation. More specifically, in the presence of intense anti-piracy effort exerted by {{the government}}, the vendor does not benefit from complementing the government’s action with piracy thwarting action if the cost of providing a good quality patch is high. In addition, our analysis shows that if the government exerts sufficient anti-piracy effort, then it is optimal for the vendor to release the patch to all users. One striking finding of our analysis is that when anti-piracy effort is low, it is welfare improving to strategically utilize hacking activity through restricted patch distribution...|$|R

We study this issue by analyzing the impact of a monopolistic vendor’s action to restrict patches on both the vendor’s profit and the social welfare. Two key distinguishing features of our model are: (i) we endogenize the hacker activity and, therefore, the loss suffered by the users, and (ii) we also endogenize the quality of the patch developed by the vendor. Based on our analysis, we find that a monopolist does not always benefit from vertical differentiation. More specifically, when the government’s anti-piracy effort is intense and the cost of developing a good quality patch is high, the vendor does not benefit from vertical differentiation. Another interesting result of our analysis is that, by strategically utilizing the hacker’s activity, it is possible to improve social welfare relative to that when the patch is universally distributed...|$|R
40|$|Strict {{protection}} of IPR {{can have a}} negative effect on economic development. Regression of economic growth on these indices produces conventional results (positive effect of stricter {{protection of}} IPR on growth) only if indices of institutional capacity (government effectiveness, control over corruption) are not included into the right hand side. If they are included, they kill the effect of IPR protection (because they are very much correlated with the IPR protection indices), so it is hardly possible to separate the effects of stricter IPR protection from the impact of the general strength of institutions. The same procedure was used to evaluate the impact of the IPR protection regime on the average share of R&D expenditure in GDP and the results were largely the same: without control for the institutional capacity, IPR protection seems to stimulate R&D, but after controlling for the institutional indices the effect disappears. There is also a strong negative effect of stricter regime of protection of IPR on the proliferation of the most crucial technology of recent decades – computers. The increase in the total number of PCs in 1995 - 2005, after controlling for the level of development, the size of the country and the institutional index, is negatively correlated with the IPR protection index. If <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> intellectual <b>products</b> allows to overcome the negative impact of IPR protection on the dissemination of new technologies, it is reasonable to talk not about costs <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> but about the benefits <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> and the costs of stricter IPR protection. ...|$|R

Disrupted by the digital revolution, and the significant consumer uptake in the <b>piracy</b> <b>of</b> music <b>product,</b> revenues have fallen substantially over {{a relatively short period of}} time. This case study analyzes the historical timeline <b>of</b> music <b>product</b> formats and distribution methods whilst contextualizing them through the socio-cultural trends that have shaped the shifts in music format and distribution methods, through a business lens. From the distribution <b>of</b> physical music <b>product,</b> through all the transitional periods surrounding the digital revolution, and the new model of non-acquisition consumption through streaming, the consumer behaviour trends that have impacted on music distribution and format are analyzed as important influencing factors. The case study uncovers an industry resistant to change, and an industry that behaves in a wholly reactive way to consumer behaviour trends. This research also discusses the potential future around the sale of recorded music, as socio-cultural trends continue to shape the development of music as a cultural commodity. A distribution strategy for maximizing revenue for each distribution method and format is proposed, by strategically releasing new recorded music products (albums) physically, digitally and through streaming service in a specific timeline in order to avoid the cannibalization of each format. It is further proposed that the future of recorded music may not actually lie in the sale of recorded music being a primary revenue stream for the {{music industry}} going forward, and instead may be more appropriately utilized as a marketing vehicle to drive consumer spending in more lucrative revenue streams such as live performance, and branded merchandise.
