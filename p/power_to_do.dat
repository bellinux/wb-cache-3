5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. There {{is no evidence that}} Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E

50|$|The title 'degree' is {{protected}} under UK law. All valid UK degrees are awarded by universities or other degree-awarding bodies whose <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so are recognised by the UK government; hence they are known as 'recognised bodies'.|$|R
5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1913–14 NHA season, Ross {{refused to}} sign a {{contract}} for the Wanderers, requesting a salary increase. As {{one of the top}} players on the team, the Wanderers agreed to his demands of $1,500 for the forthcoming season, in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games. The next season Ross, again concerned with his salary, began negotiating with other players in the NHA to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages. These actions resulted in his suspension in November 1914 by Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA. Ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the Wanderers was no longer valid. Consequently, although having no technical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Quinn suspended Ross from all organized hockey. The proposed new league failed to materialize and Ross applied for reinstatement to the NHA, which was granted {{at a meeting of the}} team owners on December 18, 1914. The owners realized if they suspended Ross, they would also have to suspend all those he signed, hurting the league. However, Ross's actions led to his release by the Wanderers. At first he trained with the Montreal Canadiens, then joined the Ottawa Senators.|$|E
25|$|They are {{critical}} methods, having, like all criticism, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good {{when there is}} something that must be destroyed, dissolved, or reduced, but capable only of harm when {{there is something to be}} built (Jung, 1966: par. 65).|$|E
50|$|A Magistrate's Court {{exists for}} each {{judicial}} district with limited <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is legally necessary to adjudicate on all {{civil and criminal}} matters arising within the district {{for which it is}} established.

25|$|In early 1780, Sir Henry Clinton {{attacked}} South Carolina, and Charleston {{was thrown}} into a panic. The legislature adjourned upon learning of the British. Their last action was to give Rutledge <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything short of execution without trial. Rutledge {{did his best to}} raise militia forces, but Charleston {{was in the midst of}} a smallpox epidemic, and few dared to enter the city.|$|E

Hilario grows up to become a Professor in physics, and also the superhero Lastikman.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{wanted the}} SRA {{to take a}} more interventionist role with Railtrack and its successor Network Rail, but never gave it the legal <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Those <b>powers</b> rested with - and were jealously guarded by - the Rail Regulator, who frequently clashed with the SRA when he believed that it was over-reaching its jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|Secured {{creditors}} may {{in certain}} instances assume the senior management roles within the bankrupt company, however noted earlier this situation {{occurs when the}} secured creditor(s) have foreclosed on their lien. Large secured creditors again may influence the decision making process, but that secured creditor can not enter into that contract {{on behalf of the}} bankrupt company. Only the bankrupt company's senior management and/or board of directors have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an assignment.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1911 Act, Parliament (that is, the Commons and the Lords acting together) {{delegated}} {{its ability}} to pass legislation to another body (the Commons alone). Following legal principles established when the United Kingdom granted legislative powers to assemblies in its colonies in the late 18th century, a subordinate legislative body cannot use the Act under which legislative power was delegated to it to expand its competence without an express <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in the enabling Act (see Declaratory Act).|$|E
25|$|Whether the President may speak {{publicly}} {{on issues}} without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the 2011 presidential election. While some candidates {{and members of}} the public suggested that the President has <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the Law Minister, K.Shanmugam, stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over whether the President exercises soft power.|$|E

50|$|Also in {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century the Alexandra Company {{operated}} motor omnibus services within Newport Borough; it had the <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as long as they did not compete with any municipal passenger tram route. Two 14-seat buses were acquired from the London and South Western Railway for the purpose. The arrangement lasted from 1906 to 1933.|$|R
25|$|In colonial times, the {{government}} attempted {{to control the}} outbreak of wildfires by legislating against the careless use of fire. This began with the 1847 ordinance against reckless burn-offs of stubble and grass. The challenge of fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires without any formal organisation or authority. In 1913, district councils were given the right to appoint fire control officers given the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything 'necessary or expedient and practicable' to prevent fires or to protect life and property.|$|E
25|$|Pinchot's {{policies}} encountered some opposition. Preservationists {{were opposed}} to massive timber cutting while Congress was increasingly hostile to conservation of the forests, bowing to local commercial pressures for quicker exploitation. In 1907, Congress forbade the creation of more forest reserves in the Western states. Roosevelt designated 16million acres (65,000km²) of new National Forests just minutes before his <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so was stripped by a congressionally mandated amendment to the Agriculture Bill. These were called the Midnight forests. For his contributions to conservation, Pinchot was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{success in}} the battle of Agrigentum, the Romans sought to win all of Sicily, but {{required}} naval <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In order to challenge the already prominent Carthaginian naval forces, Rome built a fleet of one hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes. The famous Greek historian Polybius wrote that Rome used a wrecked Carthaginian quinquereme captured at Messina {{as a model for the}} entire fleet, and that the Romans would have otherwise had no basis for design. However, this may have been an exaggeration, as the Romans had also borrowed Greek quinqueremes previously in 264.|$|E
60|$|So, thank God, {{all goes}} well, and the recompense for {{the trouble is}} in every way great. There is rather an {{alarming}} breakdown at Newcastle, in respect of all the bills having been, in some inscrutable way, lost on the road. I have resolved to send Berry there, with full <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all manner of things, early next week.|$|R
50|$|The state governments, Madison argues, {{are closer}} {{to the people and}} can focus on the welfare of the people, {{regulating}} ordinary affairs such as the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, as well as the internal order of each state, and should have numerous undefined <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, while the national government, being bigger and possessing national resources, can bring victory in war, protect the people’s liberty, and maintain peace between the states, and should have clear, few, defined <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, mostly focusing on external objects such as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce and national taxation. He suggests that in times of peace, the state governments will tend to be larger and more powerful, while in times of crisis and war, the national government will expand as needed. Such a federal system will bring the government as a whole closer to the people than a purely national form of government would.|$|R
50|$|The Company planned {{an ambitious}} scheme to {{construct}} a three-mile tunnel under the Forth to Dunfermline, but the first half-year profits of £297, enabling a dividend of 0.375%, illustrated how impossible such a scheme would be. In despair the directors prepared to abandon the line, and obtained Parliamentary <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but business picked up a little {{and they did not}} proceed with the closure.|$|R
25|$|Justice Chan {{began by}} affirming that the High Court has {{jurisdiction}} {{to issue an}} order of prohibition against the Government. Although section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act states that courts cannot grant an injunction in civil proceedings against the Government, he rejected the State Counsel's argument that based on this provision the Court did not have <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He held that the reference in section 27 to civil proceedings it did not relate to judicial review proceedings and, hence, that provision {{did not affect the}} court's ability to grant an order of prohibition during a judicial review of government proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Around 316 AD, Frumentius and {{his brother}} Edesius from Tyre {{accompanied}} their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travelers except the two brothers, who {{were taken to the}} court as slaves. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum. A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Presidential {{candidates}} and parliamentary candidates {{must be approved}} by the Guardian Council (all members of which are directly or indirectly elected by the Leader) or the Leader before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme Leader. The Leader very rarely does the vetting himself directly, but has the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, in which case additional approval of the Guardian Council would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past. For example, Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by Guardian Council even after winning election, as she had been photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.|$|E
50|$|In 1827, Frances Trollope {{took her}} family to Fanny Wright's utopian {{community}}, Nashoba Commune, in the United States. This community soon failed, and she ended up in Cincinnati, Ohio with her sons. Although she tried {{to find ways to}} support herself, they were unsuccessful. She encouraged the sculptor Hiram <b>Powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Dante Alighieri's Commedia in waxworks. After her return to England, she began writing to support her family.|$|R

50|$|When finance became available, it {{was decided}} to build the new route {{sections}} in standard gauge, so as to avoid the expense of converting and relaying the existing Hayle Railway sections, which were already in that gauge; parliamentary <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so were obtained in 1850. However the powers granted were conditional upon the West Cornwall laying broad gauge rails on six months' notice from any connecting broad gauge line.|$|R
