50|$|CLS {{operates}} a global multi-currency cash settlement system through which settlement risk can be mitigated with finality {{using a combination}} of PvP settlement over CLS central bank accounts, local real-time gross settlements systems (RTGS) and multilateral <b>payment</b> <b>netting</b> supported by a resilient infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|Another {{key element}} of the CLS Settlement Service is the {{liquidity}} efficiencies delivered through multilateral <b>payment</b> <b>netting.</b> On each day participants will very likely {{have more than one}} trade to settle—in practice, major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day. Each day prior to settlement, CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis. The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all payment instructions is reduced, allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency, rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled. On average, CLS netting efficiency is in the region of 96 percent.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{innovation}} in large-value payments systems {{has been the}} design and implementation of liquidity-saving mechanisms (LSMs), tools {{used in conjunction with}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. LSMs give system participants, such as banks, an option not offered by RTGS alone: they can queue their outgoing payments. Queued payments are released if some prespecified event occurs. LSMs can reduce the amount of central bank balances necessary to operate a payments system as well as quicken settlement. This article analyzes the performance of RTGS systems with and without the addition of an LSM. The authors find that, in terms of settling payments early, these mechanisms typically outperform pure RTGS systems. However, there are times when RTGS systems can be preferable to LSMs, such as when many banks that send payments early in RTGS choose to queue their payments when an LSM is available. The authors also show that the design of a liquidity-saving mechanism has important implications for the welfare of system participants, {{even in the absence of}} <b>payment</b> <b>netting.</b> In particular, the parameters specified determine whether the addition of an LSM increases or decreases welfare.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, most central banks, {{concerned}} about settlement risks inherent in <b>payment</b> <b>netting</b> systems, have implemented real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Although RTGS systems can significantly reduce settlement risk, they require greater liquidity to smooth nonsynchronized payment flows. Thus, central banks typically provide intraday credit to member banks, either as collateralized credit or priced credit. Because intraday credit is costly for banks, how intraday liquidity is managed has become a competitive parameter in commercial banking and a policy concern of central banks. This article uses a game-theoretical framework to analyze the intraday liquidity management behavior of banks in an RTGS setting. The games played by banks depend on the intraday credit policy of the central bank and encompass two well-known paradigms in game theory: "the prisoner's dilemma" and "the stag hunt. " The former strategy arises in a collateralized credit regime, where banks {{have an incentive to}} delay payments if intraday credit is expensive, an outcome that is socially inefficient. The latter strategy occurs in a priced credit regime, where postponement of payments can be socially efficient under certain circumstances. The author also discusses how several extensions of the framework affect the results, such as settlement risk, incomplete information, heterogeneity, and repeated play.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the relative merits of}} net versus gross settlement of interbank <b>payments.</b> <b>Net</b> settlement economizes on the costs of holding non-interest-bearing reserves but increases moral hazard problems. The "put option" value of default under net settlement can also distort banks' investment incentives.; Absent these distortions, net settlement dominates gross, although the optimal net settlement scheme may involve a positive probability of default. Net settlement becomes more attractive relative to gross settlement if bank assets have to be liquidated at less than book value.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} (ex post) involuntary unemployment and underemployment {{is explained by}} strategic contracting of firms operating in oligopolistic product markets. Firms {{have an incentive to}} offer labor contracts in which wage <b>payments</b> (<b>net</b> of opportunity costs of labor) exceed layoff payments. Such contracts increase marginal costs in bad states, thus relaxing price competition in the product market. In equilibrium, this strategic incentive leads to inefficiently low expected employment, inefficiently high use of other inputs, and inefficient risk bearing by workers relative to the cost minimizing solution. When the product market becomes fragmented, the distortions in the input markets disappear. Copyright 1994 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R

40|$|The continual {{growth and}} {{proliferation}} of multinational firms {{has made the}} task of managing international cash payments exceedingly complex. This has prompted the design and construction of deterministic network-based models to aid management in deriving efficient programmes of <b>payments</b> <b>netting</b> in a multicurrency environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make a {{comparative}} analysis of modern gross and <b>net</b> <b>payment</b> systems, emphasizing the implications of the availability of intraday liquidity in the former, and of collateral requirements in the latter. In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions—which affects their return—and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a gross system, like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO 1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.

The database runs from 1970 onwards and covers external debt stocks and flows, major economic aggregates, and key debt ratios as well as average terms of new commitments, currency composition of long-term debt, debt restructuring, and scheduled debt service projections.
