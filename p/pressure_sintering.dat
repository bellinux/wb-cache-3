These were then <b>sintered</b> at different <b>pressures</b> and temperatures. Thereafter the impact of pressure on propertiessuch as Density, Coercivity, Porosity and TRS were analyzed. The observations were further supported with Weibullprobability analysis and fracture surface analysis in SEM. It has been shown that there exists a distinct threshold pressure at which significant reduction in porosity occurs forgiven compacted densities. For 3 out of 4 cemented carbide grades it has been observed that P 2 <b>sintering</b> <b>pressure</b> issufficient to meet desired product characteristics.
