It {{is well known that}} sintering shrinkage depends on binder phasecontent, grain size, temperature and pressure. Thus 4 different cemented carbides grades were selected. The gradeswere pressed into standard products and TRS (Tensile Rupture Strength) rods with two different shrinkage factors. These were then <b>sintered</b> at different <b>pressures</b> and temperatures. Thereafter the impact of pressure on propertiessuch as Density, Coercivity, Porosity and TRS were analyzed. The observations were further supported with Weibullprobability analysis and fracture surface analysis in SEM. It has been shown that there exists a distinct threshold pressure at which significant reduction in porosity occurs forgiven compacted densities. For 3 out of 4 cemented carbide grades it has been observed that P 2 <b>sintering</b> <b>pressure</b> issufficient to meet desired product characteristics. The fourth grade required a minimum <b>sintering</b> <b>pressure</b> of P 4 toachieve desired quality criteria.
