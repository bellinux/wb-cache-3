40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the effect of}} permeability variations of tipping and <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> paper {{on the degree of}} filter ventilation and consequently on the smoke yields, a mathematical model for the flow through a layered structure of perforated tipping paper and porous <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> paper was derived. The output of the model was compared to experimental data and a very good agreement was found...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this contribution is to characterise the distribution of adhesive between the <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> paper and the tipping paper on a finished cigarette. On the one hand, {{it is well known}} that this distribution influences various properties of the cigarette, but on the other hand, there are no methods available to completely determine this distribution. The area covered by adhesive, the amount of adhesive, and the thickness and position of the adhesive layer between the <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> and the tipping paper were chosen as essential quantities. Image analysis was used to evaluate the area covered by adhesive, and the amount of adhesive between the papers. The thickness and position of the adhesive layer were determined by processing pictures of paper cross-sections obtained with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) ...|$|E
30|$|Test fungi were {{activated}} by inoculating the test fungi onto test tubes filled with PDA substrate, and cultivating {{for several days}} at the temperature of 28  ±  2 °C and relative humidity of 90  ±  5 %. Purified water was prepared by infusing 10  ml water into test tube, stuffing with cotton <b>plug,</b> and <b>wrapping</b> in kraft, enlacing with cotton string, then sterilizing at 121 °C, 0.1  MPa for 30  min.|$|R
30|$|One hundred {{grams of}} {{air-dried}} powder of WB {{was used for}} the extraction for each of the following solvents: methanol, dichloromethane, and water. About 250  mL of each solvent was poured in a 500 -mL conical flask containing the air-dried WB and covered with cotton wool <b>plug</b> and <b>wrapped</b> with aluminum foil. Extraction was allowed to proceed for 48  h under laboratory conditions. The extracts were filtered using filter paper Whatman No. 1, and then, the solvents were evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. The yields for methanol (ME), dichloromethane (DCME) and water (WE) extracts were 15.12, 17.05; and 21.30  g/ 100 air-dried samples, respectively. All the extracts were kept dry in sealed brown vials and stored at 4  °C until used for GC/MS analysis and biological activity tests.|$|R
5000|$|Later, in 1987 a {{much cheaper}} [...] "baseband" [...] version, also running at 2 Mbit/s {{connected}} computers in daisy-chain style using twisted-pair cables with RJ11 connectors and CSMA/CD. [...] Interface cards had two RJ11 sockets for connecting to {{left and right}} neighbor nodes. The unused sockets {{at the ends of}} the network segment had to be fitted with a terminator {{on one end of the}} chain and a <b>wrap</b> <b>plug</b> on the other. A hybrid star topology was possible using a hub.|$|R
30|$|Cigarette filter {{ventilation}} {{is used to}} dilute, {{during a}} puff, mainstream smoke generated in the tobacco burning zone with air entering through holes or perforations in the filter tipping paper, thereby reducing mainstream smoke yields (Norman 1974). Many cigarettes have a ventilation system in which both the tipping paper and a non-porous <b>plug</b> <b>wrap</b> are perforated by an ‘on-machine laser’ (OML). Ventilation levels are measured on unlit cigarettes {{as the percentage of}} airflow entering the ventilation holes at a puff-flow rate of 17.5  mL/s (equivalent to ISO smoking conditions).|$|E
40|$|Indonesia {{represent}} {{a country that}} rich of medicine crop so that ancestors of our nation could have overcome health problem by simple knowledge for example by exploit ingredients from certain crops. The lack of knowledge and information concern various type of crops that able to be exploited to medicinal treatment become a problem for devotee of medicine crops. Therefore research about exploitation medicine crop was very needed to be conducted so practical benefit from this research able to express knowledge and skill of local society. The research type used was descriptive research. Population used was crop used as medicine by society in Baraler Village Pantar Barat Subdistrict Alor Regency NTT. Variable researched was crop types. Exploitation way of crop, benefit from each of medicine crop type also parts of crop used as medicine. Result {{of this research was}} crop type used by society in Baraler Village as medicine amount of 73 types consist 39 ethnic groups. The exploitation way of crop was conducted by society in Baraler Village there were 2 kinds namely by medicinal treatment from inner (eat or drink) and medicinal treatment from outer (spreader, <b>plugged,</b> dropped, <b>wrapped</b> and made tenderloin of bathe). Benefit of crop used for medicinal treatment toward several disease among others disease because agent trouble (parasite, bacterial, virus), the disease because metabolic disturbing, the disease because sexuality disturbing, the disease because hormonal disturbing, the disease because bone and hinge disturbing, the disease because skin and hair disturbing also the disease because blood disturbing, venous and immune body system. And a part of crop that beneficial for medicine often be used among others leaf, stem, blossom, root, seed, rhizome, sap, fresh herb. Usage status of medicine crop divides become two that are, singular usage and ingredients usage...|$|R
