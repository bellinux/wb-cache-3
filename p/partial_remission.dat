In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full remission, one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. <b>Partial</b> <b>remission</b> {{is characterized by the}} presence of poorly defined residual symptoms.

500|$|Alcoholism often reduces a person's life {{expectancy}} by around ten years. The {{most common cause}} of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications. There is a high rate of suicide in chronic alcoholics, which increases the longer a person drinks. Approximately 3–15 percent of alcoholics commit suicide, and research has found that over 50 percent of all suicides are associated with alcohol or drug dependence. This is believed to be due to alcohol causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry, as well as social isolation. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 25 percent of suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. Among those with alcohol dependence after one year, some met the criteria for low-risk drinking, even though only 25.5 percent of the group received any treatment, with the breakdown as follows: 25 percent were found to be still dependent, 27.3 percent were in <b>partial</b> <b>remission</b> (some symptoms persist), 11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers (consumption increases chances of relapse) and 35.9 percent were fully recovered—made up of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers plus 18.2 percent abstainers. In contrast, however, the results of a long-term (60-year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men indicated that [...] "return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence." [...] There was also [...] "return-to-controlled drinking, as reported in short-term studies, is often a mirage." ...|$|E
500|$|Some scholars, {{for example}} Frank Stenton, {{author of the}} {{standard}} history of Anglo-Saxon England, along with Keynes and Abels, see the Second Decimation as a donation of royal demesne. In Abels' view Æthelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an [...] "avid attention" [...] in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that [...] "Æthelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings", and the mid-20th century historian Eric John observes that [...] "a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as {{when he was on}} his knees". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred Smyth, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that Æthelwulf freed a tenth part of land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it [...] "is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a <b>partial</b> <b>remission</b> of royal dues". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms.|$|E

Thirty eight outpatients aged from 25 to 75 years were treated with interleukin- 2, 3. 6 million Cetus units/m 2 i. v. daily for five days on two successive weeks beginning three days after 350 mg/m 2 of intravenous cyclophosphamide. This schedule was repeated at least twice more with a one-week interval between cycles, usually at the same dosage level. Ten of the 38 patients (26. 3 %) had clinically significant remissions: two complete (5. 3 %), seven partial (18. 4 %), and one ongoing, long-term (greater than 18 mo) "minor" response (2. 6 %). Four others (10. 5 %) had shorter minor responses and four (10. 5 %) a mixed response. One patient with disease restricted to the skin had a complete remission, while the other patient with a complete remission had had three lung nodules and an enlarged hilar lymph node. It was gratifying {{that one of the}} major sites of disease responding to treatment was the liver. Two complete and two <b>partial</b> <b>remissions</b> (i. e., greater than 50 % regressions for greater than four weeks at this site) were obtained in 10 patients with liver involvement. Lung metastases also responded in four of 16 patients (one complete and three <b>partial</b> <b>remissions).</b> Subcutaneous nodules responded in seven of 21 patients (two complete, five <b>partial</b> <b>remissions),</b> while lymph node metastases diminished significantly in four of 14 patients (one complete, three <b>partial</b> <b>remissions).</b> The median duration of response was nine months (range, 1. 5 - 20 months), with four patients treated for more than one year. Toxicity was moderate and controllable, and only two patients required hospitalization, both overnight. Lymphokine activated killer cell activation was induced in 24 of 38 patients, including all nine of the major responders. Conversely, none of 14 patients without lymphokine activated killer cell activation had a significant clinical remission.
