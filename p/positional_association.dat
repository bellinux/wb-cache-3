The conserved regions have the potential to determine the role of the proteins. Many algorithms or techniques to discover motifs require a predefined fixed window size in advance. Due to the fixed size, these approaches often deliver a number of similar motifs simply shifted by some bases or including mismatches. To confront the shifted motifs problem, we cooperate the Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) concept, which is designed for solving the mismatched motifs problem, and propose a new <b>Positional</b> <b>Association</b> Rules algorithm.

40|$|Protein {{sequence}} motifs {{are gathering}} {{more and more}} attention {{in the field of}} sequence analysis. The recurring patterns have the potential to determine the conformation, function and activities of the proteins. In our work, we obtained protein sequence motifs which are universally conserved across protein family boundaries. Therefore, unlike most popular motif discovering algorithms, our input dataset is extremely large. As a result, an efficient technique is essential. We use two granular computing models, Fuzzy Improved K-means (FIK) and Fuzzy Greedy K-means (FGK), in order to efficiently generate protein motif information. After that, we develop an efficient Super Granular SVM Feature Elimination model to further extract the motif information. During the motifs searching process, setting up a fixed window size in advance may simplify the computational complexity and increase the efficiency. However, due to the fixed size, our model may deliver a number of similar motifs simply shifted by some bases or including mismatches. We develop a new strategy named <b>Positional</b> <b>Association</b> Super-Rule to confront the problem of motifs generated from a fixed window size. It is a combination approach of the super-rule analysis and a novel <b>Positional</b> <b>Association</b> Rule algorithm. We use the super-rule concept to construct a Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) by a modified HHK clustering, which requires no parameter setup to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between the motifs. The <b>positional</b> <b>association</b> rule is created and applied to search similar motifs that are shifted some residues. By analyzing the motifs results generated by our approaches, we realize that these motifs are not only significant in sequence area, but also in secondary structure similarity and biochemical properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The role {{of protein}} {{sequence}} motifs is in predicting functional or structural portion of other proteins including prosthetic attachment sites, enzyme-binding sites and DNA /RNA binding sites, and so on. A fixed window size is usually predefined to discover protein sequence motifs for many algorithms and techniques.

In this paper, we use the <b>positional</b> <b>association</b> rules algorithm to form motifs network and adapt a Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks named SCAN to recognize similar motifs. Although association rule based algorithms have been widely adapted in association analysis and classification, few of those are designed as clustering methods.

40|$|The large {{majority}} of EGRET point sources remain without an identified low-energy counterpart, and a large fraction of these sources are most likely extragalactic. Whatever {{the nature of the}} extragalactic EGRET unidentified sources, faint unresolved objects of the same class must have a contribution to the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB). Understanding this component of the EGRB, along with other guaranteed contributions from known sources, is essential if we are to use this emission to constrain exotic high-energy physics. Here, we follow an empirical approach to estimate whether a potential contribution of unidentified sources to the EGRB is likely to be important, and we find that it is.

40|$|Genetic markers such {{as single}} {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) are essential tools for <b>positional</b> cloning, <b>association,</b> or quantitative trait focus mapping and the determination of genetic relationships between individuals. We identified and characterized a genome-wide set of SNP markers by generating 10, 706 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries derived from 6 different accessions, and by analysis of 606 sequence tagged sites (STS) from up to 12 accessions of the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The cDNA libraries for EST sequencing were made from individuals that were stressed by various means to enrich for transcripts from genes expressed under such conditions. SNPs discovered in these sequences may be useful markers for mapping genes involved in interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. The STS loci are distributed randomly over the genome. By comparison with the Col-O genome sequence, we identified a total of 8051 SNPs and 637 insertion/deletion polymorphisms (InDel). Analysis of STS-derived SNPs shows that most SNPs are rare, {{but that it is}} possible to identify intermediate frequency framework markers that can be used for genetic mapping in many different combinations of accessions. A substantial proportion of SNPs located in ORFs caused a change of the encoded amino acid. A comparison of the density of our SNP markers among accessions in both the EST and STS datasets, revealed that Cvi-O is the most divergent accession from Col-O among the 12 accessions studied. All of these markers are freely available via the internet. [References: 32] 3...|$|R

Methods: We performed a combined <b>positional</b> and candidate <b>association</b> screen by identifying known wnt signaling genes in regions linked to schizophrenia. In a staged study we examined over 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 28 wnt signaling genes, first in trios of Chinese origin and then in a case-control series from Hong Kong.

Vertical and horizontal magnetic fields in the internetwork region are considered to be separate entities and have thus far not been investigated in a unified way. We discover clear <b>positional</b> <b>association</b> between the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields in the internetwork region with Hinode. Essentially all of the horizontal magnetic patches are associated with the vertical magnetic patches. Alternatively, half of the vertical magnetic patches accommodate the horizontal magnetic patches. These horizontal patches are located around the borders of the vertical patches. The intrinsic magnetic field strength as obtained with the Stokes V line ratio inside the horizontal patches is weak, and is in sub-equipartition field regime (B< 700 G), while the field strength outside the horizontal patches ranges from weak to strong (kG) fields. Vertical magnetic patches are known to be concentrated on mesogranular and supergranular boundaries, while the horizontal magnetic patches are found only on the mesogranular boundaries. These observations provide us with new information on the origin of the vertical and horizontal internetwork magnetic fields, in a unified way. We conjecture that internetwork magnetic fields are provided by emergence of small-scale flux tubes with bipolar footpoints, and the vertical magnetic fields of the footpoints are intensified to kG fields due to convective collapse. Resultant strong vertical fields are advected by the supergranular flow, and eventually form the network fields.

Their restriction endonuclease maps were compared with each other as well as to that of the prototype-inducible RD- 114 which was molecularly cloned from a chronically infected human cell line. The endogenous sequences analyzed were similar to each other in that they were colinear with RD- 114 proviral DNA, were bounded by long terminal redundancies, and conserved many restriction sites in the gag and pol regions. However, the env regions of many of the sequences examined were substantially deleted. Several of the endogenous RD- 114 genomes contained a novel envelope sequence which was unrelated to the env gene of the prototype RD- 114 env gene but which, like RD- 114 and endogenous feline leukemia virus provirus, was found only in species of the genus Felis, and not in other closely related Felidae genera. The endogenous RD- 114 sequences each had a distinct cellular flank which indicates that these sequences are not tandem but dispersed nonspecifically throughout the genome.

The PLAU gene, which {{is involved in the}} production and degradation of Abeta 42, maps to that region and is therefore a strong <b>positional</b> candidate for <b>association</b> with sporadic AD. We analyzed the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 2227564 in two independent case-control series from Switzerland and Greece and investigated the influence of this SNP on cognition in elderly individuals. Because PLAU modulates the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the degradation of Abeta, we also determined the levels of Abeta in the brain, plasma and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found no evidence for association of this SNP with AD or with AD-related traits such as beta-amyloid load in the medial temporal lobe or Abeta 42 concentration in the CSF and in plasma. Our findings do not support a major role of PLAU polymorphisms as susceptibility factors for AD and suggest that large-scale association studies which combine genetic information from populations with similar genetic background might prevent the generation of spurious associations. Although PLAU may be pathophysiologially related to AD, the contribution of common genetic variants of this gene to the risk for developing AD is likely to be low...|$|R
40|$|Heinz, JeffreyThis {{dissertation}} provides {{support for}} the hypothesis that surface well-formedness in phonological tone patterns is governed by language-specific, local constraints over autosegmental representations. The particular notion of locality invoked in this dissertation is that of banned substructure constraints, which are drawn from the theory of computation, formal language theory, and formal learning theory (McNaughton and Papert, 1971; García et al., 1990; Rogers et al., 2013). Essentially, any pattern describable with such constraints is local because the well-formedness of a structure {{with respect to the}} pattern is based entirely on its composite substructures of a fixed size. The primary novel contribution of the current work is to extend this notion of computational locality from strings to autosegmental structures by way of mathematical graph theory, and to develop a theory of tonal well-formedness based in banned substructure constraints over autosegmental representations. Through analyses of attested edge-based, quality-specific, and <b>positional</b> tone <b>association</b> patterns, as well as long-distance patterns, it is shown that such a theory can describe a range of major tonal generalizations, including ones beyond the power of both string-based local theories and standard explanations of tone in Optimality Theory. Furthermore, a local theory of constraints excludes unattested patterns requiring global evaluation that are predicted by other theories. Finally, it is discussed how banned substructure constraints can be connected to a restrictive theory of phonological input/output generalizations, {{and that there is a}} method for learning them. A secondary contribution of this dissertation is show that autosegmental representations are string-like in that they can be derived through the concatenation of graph primitives. Essentially, important properties of autosegmental representations can be seen as emerging from the concatenation of a finite alphabet of primitives, just as strings are built out of a finite alphabet of symbols. This novel approach to defining autosegmental representations not only makes the correct empirical prediction that languages cannot have unbounded ‘contouring’, it also allows for direct comparison of autosegmental grammars to string grammars. It is also shown how this notion of concatenation can be recruited for understanding input/output generalizations, and how it can be used to learn autosegmental grammars from string inputs.

40|$|The tobacco N and Arabidopsis RPS 2 genes, {{among several}} {{recently}} cloned disease-resistance genes, share highly conserved structure, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS). Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers for the NBS region of N and RPS 2, we have amplified and cloned the NBS sequences from soybean. Each of these PCR-derived NBS clones detected low-or moderate-copy soybean DNA sequences and belongs to 1 of 11 different classes. Sequence {{analysis showed that}} all PCR clones encode three motifs (P-loop, kinase- 2, and kinase- 3 a) of NBS nearly identical to those in N and RPS 2. The intervening region between P-loop and kinase- 3 a of the 11 classes has high (26 % average) amino acid sequence similarity to the N gene although not as high (19 % average) to RPS 2. These 11 classes represent a superfamily of NBS-containing soybean genes that are homologous to N and RPS 2. Each class or subfamily was assessed for its <b>positional</b> <b>association</b> with known soybean disease-resistance genes through near-isogenic line assays, followed by linkage analysis in F 2 populations using restriction fragment length polymorphisms.

A catalog of the genetic variation among inbred mouse strains, however, is required to enable powerful <b>positional</b> cloning and <b>association</b> techniques. A recent whole-genome resequencing study of 15 inbred mouse strains captured a significant fraction of the genetic variation among a limited number of strains, yet the common use of hundreds of inbred strains in medical research motivates the need for a high-density variation map of a larger set of strains. Here we report a dense set of genotypes from 94 inbred mouse strains containing 10. 77 million genotypes over 121, 433 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), dispersed at 20 -kb intervals on average across the genome, with an average concordance of 99. 94 % with previous SNP sets. Through pairwise comparisons of the strains, we identified an average of 4. 70 distinct segments over 73 classical inbred strains in each region of the genome, suggesting limited genetic diversity between the strains. Combining these data with genotypes of 7570 gap-filling SNPs, we further imputed the untyped or missing genotypes of 94 strains over 8. 27 million Perlegen SNPs. The imputation accuracy among classical inbred strains is estimated at 99. 7 % for the genotypes imputed with high confidence.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>positional</b> data in <b>association</b> football allows the {{spatial distribution of}} players during matches to be described {{in order to improve}} the understanding of tactical-related constraints on the behavioural dynamics of players. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify how players' spatial restrictions affected the exploratory tactical behaviour and constrained the perceptual-motor workspace of players in possession of the ball, as well as inter-player passing interactions. Nineteen professional outfield male players were divided into two teams of 10 and 9 players, respectively. The game was played under three spatial constraints: a) players were not allowed to move out of their allocated zones, except for the player in possession of the ball; b) players were allowed to move to an adjacent zone, and; c) non-specific spatial constraints. Positional data was captured using a 5 Hz interpolated GPS tracking system and used to define the configuration states of players for each second in time. The configuration state comprised 37 categories derived from tactical actions, distance from the nearest opponent, distance from the target and movement speed. Notational {{analysis of}} players in possession of the ball allowed the mean time of ball possession and the probabilities of passing the ball between players to be calculated. The results revealed that the players' long-term exploratory behaviour decreased and their short-term exploration increased when restricting their space of interaction. Relaxing players' positional constraints seemed to increase the speed of ball flow dynamics. Allowing players to move to an adjacent sub-area increased the probabilities of interaction with the full-back during play build-up. The instability of the coordinative state defined by being free from opponents when players had the ball possession was an invariant feature under all three task constraints. By allowing players to move to adjacent sub-areas, the coordinative state became highly unstable when the distance from the target decreased. Ball location relative to the scoring zone and interpersonal distance constitute key environmental information that constrains the players' coordinative behaviour. Based on our results, dynamic overlap is presented as a good option to capture tactical performance. Moreover, the selected collective (i. e. relational) variables would allow coaches to identify the effects of training drills on teams and players' behaviour. More research is needed considering these type variables to understand how the manipulation of constraints induce a more stable or flexible dynamical structure of tactical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT The human tau gene, which {{promotes}} assembly of neuronal microtubules, {{has been associated}} with several rare neurologic diseases that clinically include parkinsonian features. We recently observed linkage in idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) to a region on chromosome 17 q 21 that contains the tau gene. These factors make tau a good candidate for investigation as a susceptibility gene for idiopathic PD, {{the most common form of}} the disease. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the tau gene is involved in idiopathic PD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Among a sample of 1056 individuals from 235 families selected from 13 clinical centers in the United States and Australia and from a family ascertainment core center, we tested 5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the tau gene for association with PD, using family-based tests of association. Both affected (n = 426) and unaffected (n = 579) family members were included; 51 individuals had unclear PD status. Analyses were conducted to test individual SNPs and SNP haplotypes within the tau gene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Family-based tests of association, calculated using asymptotic distributions. RESULTS Analysis of association between the SNPs and PD yielded significant evidence of association for 3 of the 5 SNPs tested: SNP 3, P =. 03; SNP 9 i, P =. 04; and SNP 11, P =. 04. The 2 other SNPs did not show evidence of significant association (SNP 9 ii, P =. 11, and SNP 9 iii, P =. 87). Strong evidence of association was found with haplotype analysis, with a positive association with one haplotype (P =. 009) and a negative association with another haplotype (P =. 007). Substantial linkage disequilibrium (P<. 001) was detected between 4 of the 5 SNPs (SNPs 3, 9 i, 9 ii, and 11).
