50|$|Crystalline <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} {{prepared}} at low temperatures as the dihydrate, HMnO4Â·2H2O.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Permanganic</b> <b>acid</b> {{solutions}} are unstable, and gradually decompose into manganese dioxide, oxygen, and water, with initially formed manganese dioxide catalyzing further decomposition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Permanganic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has also}} been {{prepared}} through the reaction of hydrofluorosilicic acid with potassium permanganate, through electrolysis, and through hydrolysis of manganese heptoxide, though the last route often results in explosions.|$|E
50|$|Mn2O7 arises as a {{dark green}} oil by the {{addition}} of concentrated H2SO4 to KMnO4. The reaction initially produces <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid,</b> HMnO4 (structurally, HOMnO3), which is dehydrated by cold sulfuric acid to form its anhydride, Mn2O7.|$|E
50|$|Manganese(VII) oxide (manganese heptoxide) is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Mn2O7. This volatile liquid is highly reactive {{and more often}} discussed than intentionally prepared. It is a dangerous oxidizer and was first described in 1860. It is the acid anhydride of <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Permanganic</b> <b>acid</b> is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula HMnO4. This strong oxoacid has been isolated as its dihydrate. It is the conjugate acid of permanganate salts. It {{is the subject}} of few publications and its characterization as well as its uses are very limited.|$|E
50|$|Permanganates(VII) are salts of <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid.</b> They have a {{deep purple}} colour, due to a charge {{transfer}} transition. Permanganate(VII) is a strong oxidizer, and similar to perchlorate. It is therefore in common use in qualitative analysis that involves redox reactions (permanganometry). According to theory, permanganate {{is strong enough to}} oxidize water, but this doesn't actually happen to any extent. Besides this, it is stable.|$|E
50|$|Although Johns Hopkins was a {{research}} university from the beginning, {{the early years of}} the chemistry department were marked by a lack of students and equipment. Morse was initially discouraged and spent most of his time teaching. Around the turn of the century Morse published a series of papers on the preparation of <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid.</b> This led him to study osmotic pressure. In the first half of the 20th century, the Morse name was mainly associated with his work in this area. With the help of a grant from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, he published a report entitled The Osmotic Pressure of Aqueous Solutions, which summarized the work he performed between 1899 and 1913. For this work he was awarded the Avogadro Medal by the Academy of Sciences of Turin (Academia della Scienze di Turino) - the academy where Avogadro had taught. The medal was a unique prize awarded on the centennial anniversary of Avogadro's law.|$|E
40|$|The cholesteric liquid {{crystalline}} structure in chitosan/polyacrylic acid composite films was studied by surface techniques. A periodical lamellar-like structure {{was observed in}} the <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid</b> etched film surface by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), instead of the thumb-print texture which can be detected with polarized optical microscopy. It is suggested that the periodical lamellar-like structure is induced by the etching selectivity between cholesteric layers due to different molecular arrangement on the film surface. Four kinds of perpendicular disclinations, i. e. chi [...] > tau (-) + lambda (+), chi [...] > lambda (-) + tau (+), chi [...] > tau (-) + tau (+) and chi [...] > lambda (-) + lambda (+) {{were found in the}} composite films from SEM observations. The smallest periodicity of lamellar-like structure (equals to half pitch) is 20 similar to 40 nm measured with AFM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Graphene oxide powders {{prepared}} by two different drying processes, freeze drying and spray drying, were studied {{to compare the}} effect of the drying method on the physical properties of graphene oxide powder. The graphene oxide dispersion was prepared from graphite by chemical delamination with the aid of sulfuric acid and <b>permanganic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the dispersion was further washed and re-dispersed in a mixed solvent of water and isopropyl alcohol. A freeze drying method can feasibly minimize damage to the sample, but it requires a long process time. In contrast, spray drying is able to remove a solvent in a relatively short time, though this process requires exposure to a high temperature for a rapid evaporation of the solvent. The powders {{prepared by}} freeze drying and spray drying were characterized and compared by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and by an elemental analysis. The graphene oxide powders showed similar chemical compositions; however, the morphologies of the powders differed in that the graphene oxide prepared by spray drying had a winkled morphology and a higher apparent density compared to the powder prepared by freeze drying. The graphene oxide powders were reduced at 900 oC in an atmosphere of N 2. The effect of the drying process on the properties of the reduced graphene oxide was examined by SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy...|$|E
