50|$|Generator locking {{can be used}} to {{synchronize}} as few as two isolated sources (e.g., {{a television}} camera and a videotape machine feeding a vision mixer (<b>production</b> <b>switcher)),</b> or in a wider facility where all the video sources are locked to a single synchronizing pulse generator (e.g., a fast-paced sporting event featuring multiple cameras and recording devices). Generator locking {{can also be used to}} ensure that multiple CRT monitors that appear in a movie are flicker-free, as was done in the British TV film Into The Void/Outside the Rules (2002), for example. Generator locking is also used to synchronize two cameras for Stereoscopic 3D video recording.|$|E
50|$|Echolab was {{a digital}} cinema company founded in 1974 and based in Billerica, Massachusetts. It {{designed}} and developed video <b>production</b> <b>switchers</b> for digital media markets, such as broadcasting, live production, and events.

5000|$|Video signals {{generated}} {{and output}} by generator-locked instruments {{are said to}} be [...] Syntonized video signals will be precisely frequency-locked, but because of delays caused by the unequal transmission path lengths, the synchronized signals will exhibit differing phases at various points in the television system. Modern video equipment such as <b>production</b> <b>switchers</b> that have multiple video inputs often include a variable delay on each input to compensate for the phase differences and time all the input signals to precise phase coincidence.|$|R

At present time the station uses {{a variety of}} DV cameras for acquisition, including Panasonic AG-DVC15s, AG-DVC80s, and AG-DVC30s. Packages and shows are completed in post-production on two Avid Xpress Pro workstations. During summer quarter 2006, the station built and equipped a new studio control room and expanded its production space, creating two distinct studios. The control room features an Ampex AVC-33 <b>production</b> <b>switcher,</b> a 30 input video switcher featuring 3 M/E busses, and luma/chroma keying capabilities. Additional control room equipment includes a Mackie CFX20 audio board, Telex intercom system, and various video monitors.

5000|$|Filmed on June 16-17, 2011, at the Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Glee: The 3D Concert Movie {{was shot}} with the Cameron-Pace Group's 3D Fusion camera system. Glen MacPherson served as {{director}} of photography, and utilised seven Fusion 3D rigs {{with a range of}} set-ups, including a Cablecam, Steadicam, and Technocrane. The digital cinematography cameras held by the rigs mainly comprised a combination of Arri Alexas and Red Epics. CPG CEO Vince Pace noted, [...] "One of the biggest challenges {{that we were able to}} overcome was the way these cameras are handled in a live production environment (compared with a feature shoot). The infrastructure of (CPG's mobile 3D production truck) had to accommodate the multiple camera formats and process them as a single format. That is not common in the broadcast world." [...] The production truck was updated accordingly, and acquired, amongst other new technology items, a Kayenne Video Production Center <b>production</b> <b>switcher,</b> which allowed for the creation of line cuts—explained by Vince as cuts [...] "created live and used to capture the energy at the time of the performance." [...] He cited this as a factor which helped enable the film's completion with just a six-week post-production schedule. Though Pace would not disclose the project's budget when interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter, he said that it was around 40% lower than previous 3D concert films, and narrowed the cost gap between 2D productions and CPG's earlier 3D works, such as Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. Such budget was later revealed by The Hollywood Reporter to be $9 million.|$|E
50|$|A {{clean feed}} is a signal {{which has not}} come from the main output of the video switcher, such as the output of a vision mixer before the {{downstream}} keyer stage - the clean feed is identical to the main program output but without any captions keyed into it. Modern production equipment can actually put different keys on multiple outputs, allowing them to go to the clean feed or not. The most sophisticated vision mixers (or <b>production</b> <b>switchers,</b> according to the American nomenclature) can generate a clean feed output for any of their mix/effects (ME) buses.|$|R
40|$|Communication {{between various}} {{broadcast}} equipment {{plays a major}} role in the daily operation of a typical broadcast facility. For example, editing equipment must interface with tape machines, <b>production</b> <b>switchers</b> must interface with font generators and video effect equipment, and satellite ground controllers must interface with satellite dishes and receivers. Communication between these devices may be a simple hardware handshake configuration or a more elaborate software based communications via serial or parallel interfacing. This thesis concerns itself with the software interfacing needed to allow various dissimilar types of equipment to communicate, and therefore, interface with each other. The use of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in a non-typical manner for the purpose of hardware interfacing is the basis for this work...|$|R
5000|$|Implicit in {{the idea}} of time base {{correction}} is that there must be some target time base that the corrector is aiming for. There are two time bases commonly used. The first method is to make the frames, fields and lines come out smoothly and uniformly, at the rates specified by the standards using an oscillator for time reference. The alternative to this method is to align the frames, fields, and lines with some external signal, a procedure called genlocking. [...] Genlocking allows sources that are not themselves genlock-capable to be used with <b>production</b> <b>switchers</b> and A/B roll editing equipment. Stand-alone broadcast model time base correctors typically will genlock the signal to an external sync reference, and also allow the brightness, contrast, chrominance, and color phase ("tint" [...] or [...] "hue") to be adjusted.|$|R

5000|$|The EMD SW1 is a [...] {{diesel-electric}} switcher locomotive {{built by}} General Motors' Electro-Motive Corporation (later Division) between December 1938 and November 1953. Final assembly was at EMD's plant at LaGrange (McCook) Illinois. The SW1 {{was the second}} generation of 3402 cuin L switcher from EMD, succeeding the SC (cast frame) and SW (welded frame). The most significant change from those earlier models {{was the use of}} an engine of EMD's own design, the then-new 567 engine, here in [...] V6 form. 661 locomotives of this design were built, not withstanding diesel <b>switcher</b> <b>production</b> having been suspended between 1942 and 1945 by the War Production Board, as the 567 engines were needed elsewhere, mainly for U.S. Navy LST vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Parts of the {{television}} crew {{are located in the}} first and largest part, the video production area. The television director, technical director, assistant director, character generator (CG) operator and television producers usually sit in front of a wall of video monitors. The technical director sits in front of the video switcher. The video monitors show all the video feeds from various sources, including computer graphics, professional video cameras, video tape recorder (VTR), video servers and slow-motion replay machines. The wall of monitors also contains a preview monitor showing what could be the next source on air (does not have to be depending on how the video switcher is set up) and a program monitor that shows the feed currently going to air or being recorded. The keyed dirty feed (with digital on-screen graphic) is what is actually transmitted back to the central studio that is controlling the outside broadcast. A clean feed (without the graphics) could be sent to other trucks for use in their <b>production.</b> The video <b>switcher</b> is usually operated by one person called the technical director (TD) and is responsible for switching the video sources to air as directed. Behind the directors there is usually a desk with monitors for the editors to operate. It is essential that the directors and editors are in communication with each other during events, so that replays and slow-motion shots can be selected and aired. The [...] "production room" [...] in most sporting events has a graphics operator and sometimes a font coordinator who are in charge of the graphics, statistics, and the showing of the names of commentators or the players to be shown on air. Most sports also have a [...] "box operator" [...] (or [...] "bug box operator") who controls the graphic seen either on the bottom or top of the screen that shows the score as seen at home. These operators can also show on-air stats, control the clock, and many times are also in charge of showing sponsors during play.|$|R
