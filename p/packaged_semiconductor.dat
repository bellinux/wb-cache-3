40|$|Thermal {{characterisation}} of chip-scale packaged power devices {{is crucial}} to the development of advanced electronic packages for communication and automotive applications. Solder thermal interface materials (STIMs) are often employed in the packaging of power semiconductors to enhance heat dissipation from the chip to the heat spreader. However, voids formation in STIMs impedes heat flow and could result in increase in the chip peak temperature. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of lead-free solder void percentages, locations and styles on <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> device. The thermal resistance of each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the electronic package.

40|$|Solder thermal {{interface}} {{materials are}} often used in power semiconductors to enhance heat dissipation from silicon die to the heat spreader. Nonetheless, the presence of voids in the die bond layer impedes heat flow and thus increases the chip junction temperature. Such voids which form easily in the solder joint during solder reflow process at manufacturing stage are primarily occasioned by out-gassing phenomenon. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of lead-free solder void percentages and configurations on <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> device. The thermal resistance for each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the resultant electronic package.

The fabrication of such devices allows to avoid the growth of thick layers of quaternary material with low Ga and As fraction, which are difficult to achieve and grow. Reduced far-field divergence angles (10 27) and improved coupling to cleaved standard single-mode fibers (2. 6 -dB coupling loss) are achieved.

40|$|Thermal effects {{will make}} chip {{temperature}} change with bias current of semiconductor lasers, {{which results in}} inaccurate intrinsic response by the conventional subtraction method. In this article, an extended subtraction method of scattering parameters for characterizing adiabatic responses of laser diode is proposed. The pulsed injection operation is {{used to determine the}} chip temperature of <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> laser, and an optimal injection condition is obtained by investigating the dependence of the lasing wavelength on the width and period of the injection pulse in a relatively wide temperature range. In this case, the scattering parameters of laser diode are measured on adiabatic condition and the adiabatic intrinsic responses of packaged laser diode are first extracted. It is found that the adiabatic intrinsic responses are evidently superior to those without thermal consideration. The analysis results indicate that inclusion of thermal. effects is necessary to acquire accurate intrinsic responses of semiconductor lasers. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|APPLICATION NOTE Thermal {{transient}} data collected to characterize <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> devices is often acquired {{from a number}} of individual samples that then must be averaged together. Yet each individual transient curve has a relatively large experimental uncertainty, which is usually a combination of unmeasurable initial transient thermal response (related to electrical transients that cannot be separated from the thermal signal), coupled with mounting variability not fairly attributable to the device itself being tested (but is rather due to differences in test board characteristics, solder thickness variation, etc.). When a limited range of the data is believed to accurately represent device−only dependence, a useful, simple, yet rigorous method has been developed to allow the analyst to minimize the scatter in the data set, while preserving the average value in the specified range. Application of this method to actual data is presented for purposes of illustration, and additional implications {{in the use of the}} method are discussed. Although this method was developed and is applied here in the context of thermal transient characterization, it is universal in potential application; the underlying mathematical “theorem ” is completely general...|$|E
40|$|APPLICATION NOTE For {{a growing}} number of customers, {{transient}} thermal response of <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> devices is a critical issue. It is not enough to predict “time averaged ” junction temperatures based on average power dissipation, because the actual duty cycle and associated transient response of a device may lead to peak junction temperatures vastly higher than such steady−state predictions. Experimental techniques exist for accurately measuring the thermal transient response of a physical device in the 100 microsecond range, and thermal RC−networks can readily be generated to match these measurements. Such networks can then be exercised with modeling tools such as SPICE to obtain predictions for time−varying power inputs in this time range. Faster experimental measurements are often complicated by uncontrollable electronic interactions, yet in real−life applications, power cycling of a device may necessitate accurate predictions of the thermal response of the system in the microsecond time frame (or faster). It will be shown that a thermal RC−network model based on experimental data can be readily modified by following straightforward rules, such that an arbitrarily fast response can be accommodated. This concept {{can also be used to}} optimize the meshing of 3 D finite−element−models such that accurate transient response is obtained in the desired time domain, yet model size is minimized.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of semiconductor laser diodes and related devices {{is a significant}} issue for their deployment in many applications, creating demand for device diagnostics applicable to packaged devices. Measurements of the transparency current density (J{sub 0 }) in laser diodes and traveling-wave semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) can provide such a diagnostic. It is essential, however, to measure J{sub 0 } on packaged devices, {{so that they can}} be characterized after aging or degradation. This precludes techniques requiring data from multiple devices (e. g., an ensemble with different lengths). J{sub 0 } is conventionally measured using a junction-voltage technique, in which an input optical signal induces a change in carrier density in the active region due to stimulated absorption or emission. The result is a voltage drop across the diode. At material transparency, the stimulated absorption is exactly balanced by the stimulated emission and the voltage drop goes to zero. Since the polarity of the voltage drop changes sign at current densities above J{sub 0 }, the optical input beam is typically modulated and lock-in amplification is employed to sensitively detect the polarity sign flip. Here we show that this technique is not reliable for certain types of laser structures, because the deduced J{sub 0 } is strongly dependent on device packaging [...] that is, the measured J{sub 0 } varies with the manner in which light is coupled into the diode waveguide. For packaged SOAs, we propose and demonstrate an alternative all-optical technique to overcome this problem. One important advantage of the optical method over the junction voltage method is that the actual device optically-guided mode is directly sampled. In the case of <b>packaged</b> <b>semiconductor</b> lasers, our all-optical method can complement the junction-voltage method to resolve device versus packaging degradation...|$|E
