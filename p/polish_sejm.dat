5|$|Among {{the most}} notable {{landmarks}} bearing his name is the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Kraków, and the Juliusz Slowacki Museum in Kremenets, Ukraine, opened in 2004 at his family's former manor house. In 2009 the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> (parliament) declared that year, the two-hundredth anniversary of Słowacki's birth, to be the Year of Juliusz Słowacki.|$|E
5|$|In {{internal}} politics {{he attempted}} to strengthen {{the power of the}} monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> (parliament) to check the King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław was fed up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his position would be much stronger.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The <b>Polish</b> <b>sejm</b> refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm.</b> The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E

25|$|As {{a subject}} of the Polish kings, Hevelius enjoyed the {{patronage}} of four consecutive kings of Poland, and his family was raised {{to the position of}} nobility by the King of Poland Jan Kazimierz in 1660, who previously visited his observatory in 1659. While the noble status was not ratified by the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> Hevelius's coat of arms includes the distinctive Polish royal crown.|$|E
25|$|Various {{estimates}} of the number of Tatars in the Commonwealth in the 17th century are about 15,000 persons and 60 villages with mosques. Numerous royal privileges, as well as internal autonomy granted by the monarchs, allowed the Tatars to preserve their religion, traditions, and culture over the centuries. The Tatars were allowed to intermarry with Christians, which was uncommon in Europe at the time. The May Constitution of 1791 gave the Tatars representation in the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, 14% of Polish {{citizens}} were Jewish. Jews participated in their religious communities, as well as local and federal government. There were several prominent Jewish politicians in the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm,</b> such as Apolinary Hartglas and Yitzhak Gruenbaum. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.|$|E
25|$|After {{the treaty}} of the First Partition, signed in February, was made public on 5 August 1772, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg became the new ambassador. His task was {{to ensure that the}} <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> would ratify the treaty. The Partition Sejm, with many of its deputies bribed by the Russian embassy, indeed {{ratified}} the treaty (on 30 September 1773), and established the Permanent Council – a small body that both promised to reform the inefficient Polish governance which, Stackelberg thought, could also be easily controlled by Russia.|$|E
25|$|Long {{after the}} end of the Soviet {{domination}} in Central Europe, the Polish Parliament Sejm passed a bill in 2012 commemorating the 70th anniversary of the creation of Narodowe Siły Zbrojne in 1942, acknowledging its massive contribution to the fight for Poland's sovereignty. The Sejm pointed out that NSZ members became the most obstinate target of repressions and hate propaganda by security apparatus under Stalinism. The crimes attributed to NSZ were made up by the Soviet-installed government with logistical help from the NKVD, which in itself was a criminal organization according to legal definition passed by the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In his {{political}} career, which lasted from 1945 until 1985, he occupied {{a number of}} different positions. First as the vice-voivod of the Silesian-Dąbrowa Voivodeship, from 1950 its first representative and from 1964 the leader of the voivodeship sejmik. In 1973 he became the voivod himself until 1975. He was also a representative in the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> from 1947 until 1952 and from 1957 until 1985. From 1961 to 1969 he was the chairman of the Sejm Commission of Building and Communal Economy. From 1963 to 1980 {{he was a member of}} the Polish Council of State and from 1980 to 1985 one of its four deputy chairmen.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{authorities}} {{tried to}} blame the pogrom on the local Polish population in order to stir up the hatred between two ethnic groups (both of which generally opposed the Tsar). However Jewish survivors of the violence reported that the local Polish population had in fact sheltered many Jews during the pogrom and {{did not participate in}} it. Apolinary Hartglas, a Polish Jewish leader and later a member of the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm,</b> together with Ze'ev Jabotinsky, managed to obtain secret documents issued by Szeremietiev which showed that the pogrom had been organized well in advance by Russian authorities who had actually transported Russian railroad workers from deep within Russia to participate. A commission set up by the Duma charged with investigating the pogrom came to similar conclusions.|$|E
25|$|In Poland itself, {{however, the}} Polish Socialist Party is {{considered}} 'pro-independence, patriotic left-wing' (in {{contrast with the}} internationalist left-wing) rather than left-wing nationalist. The term nationalism is used nearly exclusively for the right-wing national democracy of Roman Dmowski, and other officially far-right movements such as National Radical Camp and National Revival of Poland. Nowadays, notable parties and organizations that come the closest {{to the idea of}} a 'left-wing nationalism' are Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, under the leadership of Andrzej Lepper, and Zmiana led by Mateusz Piskorski. Both advocate patriotism (at times even nationalism), social conservatism, euroscepticism, anti-imperialism (strong criticism of a NATO and US foreign policies), and economic nationalism. The Self-Defence won 53 seats out of 460 in 2001 elections, and 56 in 2005. From 2005 to 2007 it was in the coalition government with two other parties (one right-wing, the other nationalist). Since then it has no representatives in the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 1921, {{the plans}} for a {{plebiscite}} were abandoned. Neither Lithuania, which was afraid of a negative result, nor Poland, which {{saw no reason to}} change status quo, wanted the plebiscite. The parties could not agree in which territory to carry out the vote and how Żeligowski's forces should be replaced by League's forces. The League of Nations then moved on from trying to solve the narrow territorial dispute in the Vilnius Region to shaping the fundamental relationship between Poland and Lithuania. During 1921, Belgian Paul Hymans suggested several Polish–Lithuanian federation models, all rejected by both sides. In January 1922, parliamentary election to the Wilno Diet (Sejm wileński) resulted in a landslide Polish victory. In its first session on February 20, 1922, the Diet voted for incorporation into Poland as the Wilno Voivodeship. <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> accepted the resolution of the Diet. The League of Nations ended its efforts to mediate the dispute. After Lithuanians seized the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, the League saw recognition of Lithuanian interest in Klaipėda as adequate compensation for the loss of Vilnius. The League accepted the status quo in February 1923 by dividing the neutral zone and setting a demarcation line, which was recognized in March 1923 as the official Polish–Lithuanian border. Lithuania did not recognize this border.|$|E
25|$|Charles XII {{then turned}} south to meet Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was {{formally}} neutral at this point, as Augustus started {{the war as}} an Elector of Saxony. Disregarding Polish negotiation proposals supported by the Swedish parliament, Charles crossed into the Commonwealth and decisively defeated the Saxe-Polish forces in the Battle of Klissow in 1702 and in the Battle of Pultusk in 1703. This successful invasion enabled Charles XII to dethrone Augustus II and coerce the <b>Polish</b> <b>sejm</b> to replace him with Stanisław I Leszczyński in 1704. August II resisted, still possessing control of his native Saxony, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Fraustadt in 1706, a battle sometimes compared to the Ancient Battle of Cannae due to the Swedish forces' use of double envelopment, with a deadly result for the Saxon army. August II was forced to sign the Treaty of Altranstädt in 1706 in which he made peace with the Swedish Empire, renounced his claims to the Polish crown, accepted Stanisław Leszczyński as king, and ended his alliance with Russia. Patkul was also extradited and executed by breaking on the wheel in 1707, an incident which, given his diplomatic immunity, infuriated opinion against the Swedish king, who was then expected {{to win the war}} against the only hostile power remaining, Tsar Peter's Russia.|$|E
25|$|In 1717, Russia {{cemented}} {{its position}} as the dominant force in Poland, {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Northern War and amid the growing likelihood of a civil war in Poland between the Polish king August II the Strong and the Polish nobility. Russian tsar Peter I the Great, posing as the conciliator between the Commonwealth king and the szlachta, ordered units of the Russian army to enter Polish territory—using the treaties of alliance from the Great Northern War—and coerced the <b>Polish</b> <b>Sejm</b> of 1717 into accepting his 'compromise'. During that Sejm (known as the Silent Sejm, as only one person was allowed to speak aloud), laws were passed that not only eliminated the possibility of August strengthening his power, but also ensured by means of restricted taxation (and thus a constrained Polish army) that Poland would not be able to interfere with similar Russian interventions in the future. In reality, if not the letter of the law, the reforms of the Silent Sejm meant that the Commonwealth became a Russian protectorate, and it would be Russian ambassadors and envoys who would be responsible for this territory under the tsar. In 1730 than Russian ambassador to Poland, Karl Gustav von Löwenwolde, was instrumental in the Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (or Löwenwolde's Treaty), an agreement between Commonwealth's neighbours to preserve the dysfunctional state of affairs within it. Russian influence on Poland further increased during the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738), when Russian military intervention overturned the result of the royal election of Stanisław Leszczyński.|$|E
