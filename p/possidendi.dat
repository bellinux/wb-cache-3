50|$|Featured {{within the}} Twelve Tables are five rules {{about how to}} handle debtors and creditors. These rules show how the ancient Romans {{maintained}} peace with financial policy.  In his article Development of the Roman Law of Debt Security, Donald E. Phillipson states the Twelve Tables were, “A set of statues known as the Twelve Tables that was passed by an early assembly served {{as the foundation of}} the Roman private law.  The Twelve Tables were enacted in the mid-fifth century B.C. {{as the result of a}} conflict among social classes in ancient Rome.”  (page 1231-1232). Phillipson also describes the leniency of the relationship between debtor and creditor on how it was changed and arranged in the 5th century B.C. and how Roman law surrounding it was tweaked within the Twelve Tables that initially drew out the legal boundaries surrounding debt.  Specially discussing the influence of creditors rights, Phillipson states, “In the fifth century B.C. only movables were pledged under pignus, although any res in which bonitary ownership was held was capable of being pledged. However, by the late Republic, land and buildings were increasingly pledged in pignus arrangements. This increased usage paralleled the expansion of creditors' rights with respect to the pledged property. The right of possession and seizure (jus <b>possidendi)</b> and the right of foreclosure and sale (jus distrahendi) were probably the most important of the developing creditors' rights. These increased creditors' rights also encouraged and contributed to the expansion of the types of res in which bonitary ownership, and thus pignus arrangements, were possible. For example, the use of pignus expanded to include usufructs, rustic servitudes, rights of way, and even pledges themselves by the second century A.D.” (page 1239).|$|E
40|$|Possession {{as a legal}} {{situation}} The thesis subject could {{be divided into two}} interconnected parts. The first part analyzes the different aspects of possession as an element of the civil law. Possession is studied as both a factual and a legal state in relations to its possible objects. Especially the subjective right as an object of possession and the impact of good faith are taken into consideration. Also two basic factors of possession - corpus possessionis and animus <b>possidendi</b> - are characterised. The second part focuses on possesion in concrete codes of law. Emphasis is placed on the study of possession in the new Czech Civil Code and reflections de lege ferenda.
