The practical part of this thesis presents the analyzed data obtained through a questionnaire on material and hygiene conditions for <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> in 41 schools which carry out a special education program in Slovenia for the school year 2013 / 2014. Schools with special education program have different number of indoor exercise areas for <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> available which vary greatly in size and equipment. Most schools have guaranteed minimum space requirements for <b>physical</b> <b>education.</b> In the vast majority the conditions of indoor training surface are appropriate as they meet the requirements of the appropriate lighting of indoor exercise areas, the possibility of providing adequate ventilation and safety of children and teachers. Schools included in the survey, on average, do not meet the minimum recommended number of sports facilities and installed equipment. Hygiene conditions concerning the use of sports equipment and changing rooms for children are generally suitable but the conditions for maintaining personal hygiene after <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>are</b> less suitable. Hygiene conditions for the teachers who teach <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>are</b> in the vast majority adequate, but not optimal.
