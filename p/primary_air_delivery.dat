40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree-project was to {{investigate}} the possibilities for <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheating into the two smallest waste incineration boilers of Halmstad Energy and Environment. The investigation is a pre-study which has the primary goal to evaluate technical and financial offers from companies that manufacture <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheater, and investigate if it is technically and financially profitable to do a purchase on <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters in the future. In the pre-study it is proposed that it is most efficient to have individual <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheater, one for each incineration boiler and the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> are also proposed to be preheated by hot water in the pre-study. Further in the pre-study it is proposed that the heat-exchanger should have plain tubes instead of finned tubes, to avoid getting dirty fast. The space in the boiler-room is limited, and therefore the major problem was to fit in the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters into the boiler-room. By comparing the different offers from the companies, the result in the pre-study shows that the offer from the company C. A. – MÖRCK has the most optimal <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheater. The results in the pre-study shows that it is technically possible to install <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters into the building, but the limited space in the boiler-room forced the distance between the tube-bundles in the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters to be very small. Pressure-measurements on the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> fans show {{that it is possible to}} use the existing fans with the purposed <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters. This assumes that the air-damper is always in the normal operation position. If it is financially profitable to install <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters is difficult to answer because it is difficult to predict the lifetime on the boilers and what economical profits the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> preheaters may cause...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Ceiling {{fans are}} one of the mostly used comfort device in {{domestic}} use. <b>Air</b> <b>delivery</b> produced from fan is multiple of the rotational frequency of the fan. <b>Air</b> <b>delivery</b> {{is one of the most}} important parameter. To analyze the air delivered from the fan was important to identify the parameters affecting it. Ceiling fans are extensively used to create an indoor breeze, improve the space air distribution and hence enhance the feeling of comfort. The fan speed, room size, number of blades and downrod length all play an important role in deciding the induced flow pattern features in space. Few previous studies have investigated fan induced flow and its characteristics under different geometric and operating conditions. In this study,response surface methodology was used to predict <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> from the fan. The experiments were conducted based on three different Fan Blade, three different room volume, three different downrod lengths, three different fan speeds and mathematical model was developed. For targeted <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> optimum levels of input parameters were selected using optimization analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{measurement}} of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> {{is very important}} for thermal power plants to maintain the safe state of operation. For direct firing pulverizing system, the measuring is essentially affected by pulverized coal particles. Abrasion and occlusion would bring great trouble to the measurement. Many measuring methods are invalid under that circumstance. Lots of efforts have been made to find appropriate ways to measure the flow of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> containing pulverized coal. Venturi tube had been successfully used to measure the flow of air. If a venturi tube is used to measure the flow velocity of <b>primary</b> <b>air,</b> the differential pressure goes higher with the increase of the concentration of pulverized coal in the <b>primary</b> <b>air.</b> The neglect of the affection of pulverized coal on the measuring would result in remarkable deviation. With the aids of coal flow rate, a method of using venturi tube to measure the velocity of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> containing pulverized coal was established. The affection of pulverized coal on flow measuring of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> cannot be ignored...|$|R

40|$|Although {{constant}} positive airway pressure {{therapy is}} currently the most effective form of non-invasive treatment to relieve obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, it has relatively low treatment compliance due to pressure related side effects. Existing commercial continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices rely on the combined airflow characteristics of both the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit and nasal mask vent to regulate treatment pressure. Fluctuation in mask pressure occurs however, due to patient breathing, presenting an opportunity to develop an alternative breathing therapy device capable of achieving dynamic control of mask pressure. Within this research, a computer model of a proposed patient breathing therapy device, based on characteristics of a prototype system, is developed to determine the breathing system <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> requirements whilst operating under a simulated patient breathing load. This model initially utilises an idealised, zero order, <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit behaviour, since this system element {{is yet to be}} built. A review of different types of air compressors is undertaken and the diaphragm type compressor selected as being best suited for practical implementation within the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit of the breathing system, based on constraints of air quality, available machining resource and materials. Thermodynamic design of the compressor is undertaken to determine physical dimensions and a range of actuation methods are reviewed, based on force and speed requirements. A speed controlled 3 phase AC induction motor is selected to actuate the compressor. The diaphragm compressor is built and tested under both steady state and dynamic conditions and proven capable of meeting the breathing system air supply for both air pressure and flow requirements. The <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit within the model simulation, previously based on an idealised, zero order element, is characterised with the same dynamic behaviour as the prototype unit built, established during testing, and shown by simulation to meet the breathing system requirements under dynamic patient breathing load. Implementation of the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit within the completed prototype breathing system shows the mask pressure to fluctuate outside the desire pressure tolerance range; however, to remedy this situation, the compressor requires the development of an appropriate control scheme which {{is beyond the scope of}} this work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{performances}} of centrifugal fans, two <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> fans and two secondary air fans {{were tested in}} BECR load and were compared with design parameters. The results show that air fan capacity excesses in practical BECR are 40 % and 80 %, beyond the design value. An operation optimization test offers the suggestions that keep inlet baffles completely open and regulate air fan loads only by hydraulic couplers. It earns about 20 A of the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> fan di,o, where input voltage is 6000 V. The secondary air fan motor di,o changes from 2 - 27 A depending on the fan load. A driver upgrading prediction shows that the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> fan di,u would have been over 75 A, and the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> fan di,u would have been over 90 A, if the hydraulic couplers are substituted for variable-frequency drive...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid excess {{sweeping}} of coal from the mill, {{only part of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>air,</b> directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the pulverized fuel from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.|$|R

40|$|In active chilled beams, <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> {{from the}} air {{handling}} unit induces room air which passes a cooling coil before it mixes with the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> and discharges into the room.

The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to investigate whether other operating conditions also influence the IR. Three methods of determining the IR are compared in order to strengthen the conclusions. The results indicate that the IR is influenced by the chilled water temperature due to buoyant forces.

The {{gross heating value}} (GHV) of the RDF was 14. 43 MJ/kg with moisture content of 25 % by weight. Parameters of interest for sustainable bed combustion were the fluidization number and <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> factor. The study was performed in a rectangular fluidized bed combustor with dimensions of 0. 3 m in width, 0. 7 m in length and 2 m in height.
