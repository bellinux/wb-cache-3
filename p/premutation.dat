25|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} is typically {{due to an}} expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. This results in not enough fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal development of the connection between neurons. Diagnosis is by genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats in the FMRI gene. Normal is between 5 and 40 repeats, fragile X syndrome occurs with more than 200, and a <b>premutation</b> is said to be present when a middle number of repeats occur. Testing for <b>premutation</b> carriers may allow for genetic counseling.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{causes of}} {{premature}} ovarian failure (POF) include X chromosome deletions and fragile X (FRAXA) <b>premutations.</b> While screening {{a cohort of}} women with POF for FRAXA <b>premutations,</b> a more distal trinucleotide repeat, FRAXE, was also tested. We found an unexpected excess of FRAXE alleles with apparently fewer than 11  repeats in the POF group. However, sequence analysis of these alleles showed that the excess was caused by three females who carry cryptic deletions in FMR 2, the gene associated with FRAXE. We propose that microdeletions within FMR 2 may be a significant cause of premature ovarian failure, being found in 1. 5 % of women with the condition, and in only 0. 04 % of the general female population. The deletions may affect transcription of either FMR 2 or an adjacent gene.    Keywords: FMR 2; deletion; premature ovarian failur...|$|R
50|$|The paradox was {{ultimately}} explained by {{insights into the}} mutation process that {{gives rise to the}} syndrome. Sherman theorized that the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome becomes mutated through a two-step process. The first mutation, called the 'premutation', doesn't cause any clinical symptoms. A second mutation was required to convert the 'premutation' into a 'full mutation' capable of causing the clinical symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome. Additionally, <b>premutations</b> must pass through females in order to transform into the full mutation.|$|R
25|$|Individuals who are {{carriers}} of <b>premutation</b> alleles {{are at risk}} for developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. It is seen in approximately half of male carriers over the age of 70, while penetrance in females is lower. Typically, onset of tremor occurs in the sixth decade of life, with subsequent progression to ataxia (loss of coordination) and gradual cognitive decline.|$|E
25|$|From their 40s onward, {{males with}} FXS begin {{developing}} progressively more severe problems in performing tasks {{that require the}} central executive of working memory. Working memory involves the temporary storage of information 'in mind', while processing the same or other information. Phonological memory (or verbal working memory) deteriorates with age in males, while visual-spatial memory is {{not found to be}} directly related to age. Males often experience an impairment in the functioning of the phonological loop. The CGG length is significantly correlated with central executive and the visual–spatial memory. However, in a <b>premutation</b> individual, CGG length is only significantly correlated with the central executive, not with either phonological memory or visual–spatial memory.|$|E
2500|$|About 20% {{of women}} who are {{carriers}} for the fragile X <b>premutation</b> are affected by fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), which is defined as menopause before the age of 40. [...] The number of CGG repeats correlates with penetrance and age of onset. [...] However premature menopause is more common in <b>premutation</b> carriers than in women with the full mutation, and for premutations with more than 100 repeats the risk of FXPOI begins to decrease. [...] Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is one of three Fragile X-associated Disorders (FXD) caused by changes in the FMR1 gene.FXPOI affects female <b>premutation</b> carriers of Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by the FMR1 gene, when their ovaries are not functioning properly. [...] Women with FXPOI may develop menopause-like symptoms but they are not actually menopausal. [...] Women with FXPOI can still get pregnant in some cases because their ovaries occasionally release viable eggs.|$|E
50|$|DMPK alleles {{with greater}} than 37 repeats are {{unstable}} and additional trinucleotide repeats may be inserted during cell division in mitosis and meiosis. Consequently, {{the children of}} individuals with <b>premutations</b> or mutations inherit DMPK alleles which are longer than their parents and therefore {{are more likely to}} be affected or display an earlier onset and greater severity of the condition, a phenomenon known as anticipation. Interestingly, paternal transmission of the condition is very uncommon, possibly due to selection pressures against sperm with expanded repeats, but anticipation tends to be less severe than in cases of maternal inheritance.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia {{syndrome}} (FXTAS), a novel {{disorder in}} male carriers of <b>premutations</b> of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR 1), was recently described. The clinical presentation of FXTAS most closely resembles multiple system atrophy (MSA) because both disorders manifest with cerebellar ataxia, intention tremor, autonomic dysfunction, and parkinsonism. It {{has been proposed}} that FXTAS might be a common neurodegenerative disorder. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether FXTAS accounts for patients currently diagnosed as having MSA or a related clinical diagnosis. DESIGN: Patients with MSA or related phenotypes were examined by experienced movement disorders neurologists, and DNA samples were obtained for genetic study. SETTING: Salp?i? Hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-seven patients clinically diagnosed as having MSA, 19 as having olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and 27 as having cerebellar ataxia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of FMR 1 repeats was determined in all patients by polymerase chain reaction. Alleles above 40 CGG repeats were controlled by Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: Two patients carried FMR 1 <b>premutations</b> of 110 and 135 repeats: {{a man with a}} familial form of cerebellar ataxia and a woman diagnosed as having MSA-cerebellar type. In addition, 9 patients (7 %) carried alleles in the intermediate size range, from 41 to 53 repeats. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the recent initial description of FXTAS in women. Our data suggest that FXTAS is rare in MSA and indicate that FXTAS might be less prevalent than proposed...|$|R

[...] Approximately 20–28% {{of women with}} an FMR1 <b>premutation</b> (55–200 CGG repeats) {{experience}} fragile x primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and another 23% experience early menopause (i.e., menopause {{before the age of}} forty five).|$|E
2500|$|In {{unaffected}} individuals, the FMR1 gene contains 5–44 repeats of {{the sequence}} CGG, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats.

50|$|A CGG {{sequence}} in the FMR1 gene that is repeated between 55 and 200 times {{is described as}} a <b>premutation.</b> Although most individuals with the <b>premutation</b> are intellectually normal, some of these individuals have mild versions of the physical features seen in fragile X syndrome (such as prominent ears) and may experience mental health problems such as anxiety or depression.|$|E
40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM) is {{the most}} common adult-onset muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1 / 8000. There are two genetically distinct types, DM 1 and DM 2. DM 2 is generally milder with more phenotypic variability than the classic DM 1. Our previous data on co-segregation of heterozygous recessive CLCN 1 mutations in DM 2 patients indicated a higher than expected DM 2 prevalence. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the DM 2 and DM 1 frequency in the general population, and to explore whether the DM 2 mutation functions as a modifier in other neuromuscular diseases (NMD) to account for unexplained phenotypic variability. We genotyped 5535 Finnish individuals: 4532 normal blood donors, 606 patients with various non-myotonic NMD, 221 tibial muscular dystrophy patients and their 176 healthy relatives for the DM 2 and DM 1 mutations. We also genotyped an Italian idiopathic non-myotonic proximal myopathy cohort (n= 93) for the DM 2 mutation. In 5496 samples analyzed for DM 2, we found three DM 2 mutations and two <b>premutations.</b> In 5511 samples analyzed for DM 1, we found two DM 1 mutations and two <b>premutations.</b> In the Italian cohort, we identified one patient with a DM 2 mutation. We conclude that the DM 2 mutation frequency is significantly higher in the general population (1 / 1830; P-value= 0. 0326) than previously estimated. The identification of DM 2 mutations in NMD patients with clinical phenotypes not previously associated with DM 2 is of particular interest and is in accord with the high overall prevalence. On the basis of our results, DM 2 appears more frequent than DM 1, with most DM 2 patients currently undiagnosed with symptoms frequently occurring in the elderly population...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} genetic analyses (PCR and Southern hybridization) of Indian {{patients with}} myotonic dystrophy (DM) {{were carried out}} to determine the degree of repeat expansion and {{an attempt was made}} to correlate the repeat number with disease severity. A scoring system based on the salient clinical features was devised to objectively assess the disease severity. The repeat expansion was seen in 11 of 12 patients examined and showed an inverse correlation with the age of onset confirming the phenomenon of anticipation. This was further established in the two pedigrees studied, dearly demonstrating both clinical and genetic anticipation. The clinical severity score,, however, did not correlate well with the repeat number. Nonetheless, such molecular genetic analyses may have immense value as a screening procedure to identify <b>premutations</b> as well as in prenatal diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a fragile X mosaic male full mutation/normal allele {{detected}} by PCR and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). This combined analysis provides a diagnostic approach for fragile X syndrome (FXS). The method assesses the presence of expansion (full mutation), the CpG methylation status and could determine copy number changes (large deletions/duplications) along the FMR 1 and FMR 2 (fragile X mental retardation) genes. The method avoids detection of <b>premutations,</b> which makes it applicable for newborn screening. It {{can also be used}} in clarification of mosaic cases. The PCR results in our patient showed one normal allele; three repeats larger than his mother’s one. The MS-MLPA showed hypermethylated full mutation pattern in the proband. Both results are compatible with FXS mosaic case full mutation/normal allele. The patient demonstrates atypical mild clinical manifestation of the disease, which correlates to the presence of a normal size allele in the patient’s cells...|$|R
50|$|Reverse {{mutation}} - The mutation can {{revert to}} normal or to a <b>premutation</b> carrier state.|$|E
50|$|The {{explanation}} for this phenomenon is that male carriers pass on their <b>premutation</b> to all of their daughters, with {{the length of the}} FMR1 CGG repeat typically not increasing during meiosis, the cell division that is required to produce sperm. Incidentally, males with a full mutation only pass on premutations to their daughters. However, females with a full mutation are able to pass this full mutation on, so theoretically there is a 50% chance that a child will be affected. In addition, the length of the CGG repeat frequently does increase during meiosis in female <b>premutation</b> carriers due to instability and so, depending on the length of their <b>premutation,</b> they may pass on a full mutation to their children who will then be affected.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{length of}} a protein-coding CAG repeat within the {{androgen}} receptor gene {{appears to be the}} only type of mutation responsible for spino-bulbal muscular atrophy (SBMA or Kennedy disease). We have analysed a large 4 -generation SBMA family and found that the mutant alkie was unstable upon transmission from parent to child, with a documented variation from 46 to 53 repeats and a tendancy to increase in size (7 increases and a single decrease in 17 events), which appeared stronger upon transmission from a male than from a female. Our results suggest also limited somatic instability of the abnormal allele, with observable variation of up to 2 - 3 repeats. This indicates that the behavior of the CAG repeat is similar to that observed for small <b>premutations</b> in the fragile X syndrome, or small abnormal alleles in myotonk dystrophy, two diseases which are caused by expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat...|$|R

40|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} the fragile X {{syndrome}} {{is designed to}} detect the most common mutation, a CGG expansion in the 5 ′-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMRI) gene.

Bands larger than 5. 8 kb observed via Southern analysis are usually considered a methylated full mutation, causing fragile X syndrome in males and varied clinical presentations in females. We observed a 10. 9 -kb band on a Southern blot assay from an autistic girl with language delay. Further investigation identified a novel G-to-A transition at an EcoRI cleavage site, upstream of the CGG repeat region of the FMRI gene. This base change abolished the EcoRI restriction site, resulting in a 10. 9 -kb pseudo-full mutation. This G-to-A base change has not been previously reported and was not identified in a subsequent analysis of 105 male and 30 female patient samples.

40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) is {{the main}} cause of heritable mental retardation. In most patients, it is associated with an increased number of CGG repeats (> 200) within the 5 ′-untranslated region of the FMR 1 gene, and with methylation of the expanded repeats and of the promoter. FXS female carriers and transmitting males have expansions of between 55 and 200 repeats (premutated alleles). Alleles with <b>premutations</b> are unstable in female meioses. Normal and premutated repeats are unmethylated in males and subject to lyonization in females. Here, we report the postnatal and prenatal molecular diagnoses of FXS made with conventional PCR and Southern blotting in a cohort of Italian patients and their families over a period of 15 years. Moreover, we tested two novel high-performance PCR procedures (PCR with a chimeric primer, and the AmplideX™ FMR 1 kit) in our patients and compared the results with our previous observations. We concluded that the high-performance PCR assays complement the results obtained by conventional methods, but they cannot replace the Southern blot procedure. Consequently, also based on cost–benefit considerations, our FXS diagnostic flowchart now consists of conventional PCR and Southern blotting plus the chimeric primer PCR procedure, whereas the AmplideX™ procedure is reserved for doubtful cases...|$|R

The distribution of FRAXE repeats was similar to other English populations but differed from two North American Caucasian series. Observed instability at FRAXE was rare but increased with increasing repeat number, and there were no expansions into the full mutation range, except in pedigrees ascertained through a full mutation. Haplotype analysis suggested division into five groups with each group having a characteristic distribution of FRAXE repeats. Fourteen of the 15 full mutations occurred on a single haplotype and this haplotype also had a significant excess of intermediate-sized alleles, suggesting that full mutations originate from large normal alleles. However, a related haplotype also had a significant excess of intermediates but we observed no full mutations on this haplotype, suggesting either loss or gain of stability determinants on it.
