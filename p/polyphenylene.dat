The increase of the alternating electrical conductivity sigma'(resulting from the real part of the admittance-vector) of the doped <b>polyphenylenes</b> has been explained considering the factors that influence the <b>polyphenylenes</b> structure: the high ratio of para/meta, the presence of both amorphous and crystalline regions, and the presence of polynuclear structures.

Both undoped and doped <b>polyphenylenes</b> were found to have a monoclinic crystallographic unit cell. For the preparation of <b>polyphenylenes</b> with maximum electrical conductivity after doping, the stoichiometric proportion of biphenyl/CuCl 2 = 1 / 2 has to be chosen.

40|$|Poly(p-phenylene) (H-PPP), {{which is}} one of the firstly {{investigated}} conducting polymer, has the disadvantage of difficult processability because it is infusible and insoluble. The use of biphenyl instead of benzene leads to ortho-, meta-, para-polyphenylenes which are more soluble and easier to be processed, however their electrical conductivity is lower. Copolymers of <b>polyphenylenes</b> (C- 1 and C- 2) and corresponding homopolymers (H-PPP and H-PP) were produced by the oxidative cationic polymerization of benzene and/or biphenyl. The soluble (-S) and the insoluble (-I) in chlorobenzene <b>polyphenylenes</b> were separated (H-PP-I, H-PP-S, C- 1 -I, C- 1 -S, C- 2 -I, and C- 2 -S) and they were doped with a solution Of FeCl 3. All <b>polyphenylenes</b> were studied by FTIR, XRD, TGA, and their electrical conductivity with constant current was determined. Pronounced differences between the copolymers and the homopolymers were observed, indicating, the different structure of the former. The values Of the electrical conductivity of doped insoluble copolymers (10 (- 4) and 10 (- 5) S/cm) are between that of H-PPP (10 (- 3) S/cm) and H-PP-I (10 (- 6) S/Cm). The values of the electrical conductivity of doped soluble copolymers (10 (- 5) S/cm) are considerably higher than that of H-PP-S (10 (- 9) S/cm).

By utilizing a controlled, stepwise synthesis, which enables the regioselective incorporation of solubilizing side chains and electron donating or withdrawing groups, {{we were able to}} access many novel PAHs of various shapes and sizes. Using an unprecedented asymmetric protected alcohol-benzyl bromide Collman coupling strategy we have accessed linear oligocyclopentadienones and oligophenylenes not accessible through current methodology. Monomers of these two classes were studied both spectroscopically and computationally in order to fully characterize their electronic structure and see how perturbation of the PAH scaffold affected their respective molecular orbitals. Using a harsher unsymmetrical carbonylative coupling of α,α 2 ̆ 7 -dibromoxylene we were able to access the two previously unknown low molecular weight polymers: Poly(para-phenylene) (2 -isocyano- 2 -tosylpropane- 1, 3 -diyl) (PPIT), and Poly(paraphenylene) (2 -oxopropane- 1, 3 -diyl) (PPOD).
