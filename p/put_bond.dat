40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} framework for hedging a contingent claim by holding static positions in vanilla European calls, <b>puts,</b> <b>bonds,</b> and forwards. A model-free expression is derived for the optimal static hedging strategy that minimizes the expected squared hedging error {{subject to a}} cost constraint. The optimal hedge involves computing a number of expectations that reflect the dependence among the contingent claim and the hedging assets. We provide a general method for approximating these expectations analytically in a general Markov diffusion market. To illustrate the versatility of our approach, we present several numerical examples, including hedging path-dependent options and options written on a correlated asset.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether there is a relationship between corporate governance practices and credit risk and bond yields. This study takes samplefrom companies that published bonds in 2006. First, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practices and credit risk. Credit risk (default risk) can be measured by bond ratings (Billings, 1999). Using ordered probit regressions, we find evidence that the quality of transparency and financial information disclosure that proxied by big- 4 auditors and audit committee havesignificant influence on bond ratings, but the relationship between block holders and institutional ownership is not significant on bond ratings. Second, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practice and bond yields. Using multiple regressions, we find that corporate governance practices is not significant on bond yields. Then we <b>put</b> <b>bond</b> ratings in the equation, we find that bond ratings give incremental effect to the evidence. This evidence is consistent to Bradley et. al, (2007), that bond ratings are the prominent determinant for bond yields. Together with the bond ratings, the corporate governance practices (block holders, institutional ownership, big- 4 auditors) have significant influence on bond yields...|$|E

In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735.

40|$|We {{construct}} a coupling of two distinct Gibbs measures for Markov random fields {{with the same}} specifications, such {{that the existence of}} an infinite path of disagreements between the two configurations has probability 0.

A similar counterexample is given for couplings of Markov chains. 1 Introduction There are many interesting and useful connections between percolation theory on one hand, and Gibbs systems and Markov random fields on the other. One example is the random-cluster model, which <b>puts</b> <b>bond</b> percolation and Potts models in a common parameterized family, and gives percolation-theoretic proofs of phase transition in the latter [8, 1, 10]; another is the equivalence between spin percolation and Gibbs state multiplicity in Ising and Potts models on the square lattice [7, 6].
