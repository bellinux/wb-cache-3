40|$|A {{hand-held}} Garmin eTrex Venture Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver {{operated in}} autonomous mode {{was used to}} investigate the accuracy of autonomous GPS in measuring <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b> The accuracy of GPS-derived <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> was tested by collecting and storing in a laptop computer, every 10 sec, <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> data from the receiver at eight different <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> of a vehicle. The targeted <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> involved were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 km h- 1. The vehicle`s speedometer {{was used as an}} initial indicator of the <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b> A pulse transmitter was utilized to detect the frequency, for every 10 sec, of a magnet fixed on one of the vehicle`s wheels and passing by the transmitter every full rotation of the wheel. Data from the pulse transmitter was acquired and stored in a data logger. Given that the wheel`s circumference was known, frequencies were used to calculate the <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> which were used as a reference. By the use of matching times of GPS and data logger data records, GPS-derived <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> were compared against the reference speed measurements. For nearly 600 data points comprising the data set for the eight test <b>ground</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{it was found that the}} error in GPS-derived <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> was, on the average, 1. 27 km h- 1 (less than 7 %.) However, high fluctuations in vehicle`s <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> when, for example, turning greatly impacted this error. An error of - 80. 16 % was produced due to a drop of vehicle`s <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> from 18. 65 to 11. 19 km h- 1. Results of steady state <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> analysis revealed that the average error was less than 1 km h- 1 (less than 5. 3 %), except for the 15 km h- 1 data set where the average error reached 1. 72 km h- 1 (9. 92 %. ...|$|R

40|$|A key {{question}} in collective behavior is how individual differences structure animal groups, affect {{the flow of}} information, and give some group members greater weight in decisions. Depending on what factors contribute to leadership, despotic decisions could either improve decision accuracy or interfere with swarm intelligence. The mechanisms behind leadership are therefore important for understanding its functional significance. In this study, we compared pigeons’ relative influence over flock direction to their solo flight characteristics. A pigeon’s degree of leadership was <b>predicted</b> by its <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> from earlier solo flights, but not by the straightness of its previous solo route. By testing the birds individually {{after a series of}} flock flights, we found that leaders had learned straighter homing routes than followers, as we would expect if followers attended less to the landscape and more to conspecifics. We repeated the experiment from three homing sites using multiple independent flocks and found individual consistency in leadership and speed. Our results suggest that the leadership hierarchies observed in previous studies could arise from differences in the birds’ typical speeds. Rather than reflecting social preferences that optimize group decisions, leadership may be an inevitable consequence of heterogeneous flight characteristics within self-organized flocks. We also found that leaders learn faster and become better navigators, even if leadership is not initially due to navigational ability. The roles that individuals fall into during collective motion might therefore have far-reaching effects on how they learn about the environment and use social information...|$|R

50|$|Connected to and {{extending}} {{from the front of}} the main bombsight housing is the drift bar, normally forming over ½ of the overall length of the device. The drift bar is pivoted at its base, just in front of the compass area, allowing it to rotate to the left or right. On top of the wind bar, connecting the wind bar to the drift bar, is the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> slider. A pin passing vertically through the wind bar's internal slider to slotted plates in the drift bar and <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> slider translate the motion of the wind bar into components along and across the axis of the drift bar. Motion across the axis pushes the entire wind bar to the left or right, indicating the proper heading to fly to cancel out the wind drift. Motion along the axis pushes the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> slider fore or aft, accounting for the difference between air and <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b> The <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> slider also carries the pin-shaped foresights, so as they move they adjust the sighting angle in order to drop the bombs early or late to account for the <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R

40|$|There is now {{increasing}} evidence that honey bees regulate their <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> in flight by holding constant {{the speed at}} which the image of the environment moves across the eye (optic flow). We have investigated the extent to which <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> is affected by headwinds. Honey bees were trained to enter a tunnel to forage at a sucrose feeder placed at its far end. <b>Ground</b> <b>speeds</b> in the tunnel were recorded while systematically varying the visual texture of the tunnel, and the strength of headwinds experienced by the flying bees.

40|$|A bird's <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> is {{influenced}} by the wind conditions it encounters. Wind conditions, although variable, are not entirely random. Instead, wind exhibits persistent spatial and temporal dynamics described by the general circulation of the atmosphere. As such, in certain geographical areas wind's assistance (or hindrance) on migratory flight is also persistent, being dependent upon the bird's migratory direction in relation to prevailing wind conditions. We propose that, considering the western migration route of nocturnal migrants through Europe, winds should be more supportive in spring than in autumn. Thus, we expect higher <b>ground</b> <b>speeds,</b> contributing to higher overall migration speeds, in spring. To test whether winds were more supportive in spring than autumn, we quantified monthly wind conditions within western Europe relative to the seasonal direction of migration using 30 years (1978 - 2008) of wind data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis dataset. We found that supporting winds were significantly more frequent for spring migration compared to autumn and up to twice as frequent at higher altitudes. We then analyzed three years (2006 - 2008) of nocturnal migratory <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> measured with radar in the Netherlands which confirmed higher <b>ground</b> <b>speeds</b> in spring than autumn. This seasonal difference in <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> suggests a 16. 9 % increase in migration speed from autumn to spring. These results stress the importance of considering the specific wind conditions experienced by birds when interpreting migration speed. We provide a simple methodological approach enabling researchers to quantify regional wind conditions for any geographic area and time period of interest...|$|R

In current research, an interchangeable system for two wheel drive tractors has been designed. Furthermore, it has been assessed after construction. To measure actual and theoretical <b>ground</b> <b>speed,</b> four rotary encoders for sensing the rotation of front and rear wheels have been utilized.

The Micro-controller has been programmed in such a way that the effect of front wheel sliding on slip is eliminated. In all evaluation conditions (in field and on asphalt), the maximum difference between system measurements for slip and speed and calculated slip and speed via conventional method was 2. 4 % and 0. 2 km h- 1, respectively.

30|$|Although {{the effect}} of speed on fuel {{consumption}} of a vehicle has been extensively investigated, {{the effect of}} its air speed has not been studied. This is {{because all of the}} investigations in the past have focused on vehicles moving in still air, in which case the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> becomes the same as the airspeed. However, if the vehicle moves upwind or downwind, the results would be quite different. In fact, any experienced truck driver would testify that fuel consumption of the vehicle varies substantially between driving upwind or downwind all day and, to some extent, driving through crosswind. In this article we show that what really determines the fuel consumption of a vehicle under normal driving conditions is the airspeed of the vehicle rather than its <b>ground</b> <b>speed.</b> However, as mentioned above, if the vehicle travels in still air, its airspeed and <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> are obviously the same.|$|R

Turning a knob at the top of the height bar (or using a slip fitting on earlier models) moves the height slider up or down to set the aircraft's altitude. Once set, the angle between backsights on the height slider and foresights on the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> slider indicates the proper range angle, no lookups required.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{not easy}} to drive a rice-transplanter {{avoiding}} underlapped or overlapped transplanting in paddy fields. An automated guidance system for the riding-type rice-transplanter would be necessary to operate the rice-transplanter autonomously or to assist the beginning drivers as a driving aid. Methods: A prototype of guidance system was composed of embedded computers, RTK-GPS, and a power-steering mechanism. Two Kalman filters were adopted to overcome sparse positioning data (1 Hz) from the RTK-GPS. A global Kalman filter estimated the posture of rice-transplanter every one second, and a local Kalman filter calculated the posture from every new estimation of the global Kalman filter with an interval of 200 ms. A PID controller was applied to the row-following mode control. A control method of U-turning mode was developed as well. A stepping motor with a reduction gear set was used to rotate the shaft of steering wheel. Results: Test trials for U-turning and row-following modes were done in a paddy field after some parameters have been tuned at the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> range of 0. 3 ~ 1. 2 m/s. The minimum RMS error of offset was 3. 13 cm at the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> of 0. 3 m/s while the maximum RMS error was 13. 01 cm at 1. 2 m/s. The offset RMS error tended to increase as the <b>ground</b> <b>speed</b> increased.
