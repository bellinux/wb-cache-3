In this paper, we present an exact analytical equation, which can be efficiently used to compute a suboptimal value for the bias, both forM-PAM and M-QAM constellations. The proposed suboptimal bias minimizes the symbol error probability, and depends on the statistics of the fading gain magnitudes and not on their instantaneous values. For the case of large number of branches, where the central limit theorem can be applied, the proposed equation for the computation of the suboptimal bias is derived in closed-form. Moreover, an approximate simple closed-form expression for the suboptimal bias is obtained, suitable for the high signal-to-noise ratio region.

40|$|Abstract—Error vector {{magnitude}} (EVM) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} accepted figure of merits used to evaluate the quality of communication systems. In the literature, EVM has been related to signalto-noise ratio (SNR) for data-aided receivers, where preamble sequences or pilots are used to measure the EVM, or under the assumption of high SNR values. In this paper, this relation is examined for nondata-aided receivers and is shown to perform poorly, especially for low SNR values or high modulation orders. The EVM for nondata-aided receivers is then evaluated and its value is related to the SNR for quadrature <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (QAM) and <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (PAM) signals over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels, and for systems with IQ imbalances. The results show that derived equations can be used to reliably estimate SNR values using EVM measurements that are made based on detected data symbols. Thus, presented work can be quite useful for measurement devices such as vector signal analyzers (VSA), where EVM measurements are readily available.
