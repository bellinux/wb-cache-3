30|$|Landslides {{are one of}} the key {{problems}} for stability analysis of pipelines in the western region of China where the geological conditions are extremely complicated. In order to offer a theoretical basis for the pipe-soil interaction, the general finite element program ABAQUS is used to analyze the distribution of <b>pipe</b> <b>strain</b> caused by landslide through which the pipeline passes. In this paper the Ramberg-Osgood constitutive equation is used to study the strain-based mechanical characteristics of pipelines. Different calculation schemas are designed by considering the change of spatial relationship between pipeline and landslide, and the change of D/t, diameter-thickness ratio of pipeline. The results indicate that the pipeline is primarily subjected to tension stress when the landslide crosses the pipeline perpendicularly, the <b>pipe</b> <b>strain</b> is a maximum along the central axis of the landslide, and reverse bending occurs on pipeline at both edges of the landslide. The pipeline is primarily subjected to friction force caused by the downward movement of the landslide, and the friction force is relatively small when the landslide is parallel to the pipeline. The <b>pipe</b> <b>strain</b> is in proportional to D/t, and this means decreasing D/t can help to improve security of pipelines subjected to the landslide.|$|E

It is also evident that flexural movement caused by thermal stresses and soil pressure has led to downward bending of the pipe in summer and subsequent upward movement in winter.

A series of three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element (FE) analyses were performed in both opening and closing modes of the elbow section for different initial pipe bending angles. To model the mechanical behavior of sands, two soil models were adopted: Mohr-Coulomb and Nor-Sand soil model. Investigations also included the effects of pipe embedment depth and soil density. Results show that the opening mode exhibits higher ultimate forces and greater localized deformations than the closing mode.

In many global population centres including in Australia, this vital infrastructure has been installed several decades ago, and dealing with frequent pipe failures become a major problem. There are clear evidences that pipe failures significantly depend on <b>pipe</b> <b>strains</b> induced by seasonal temperature and moisture changes. The past pipe failure data also indicate that the pipe failure increases when soils are more reactive. However, not much research work has been performed {{in order to understand}} the possible failure mechanisms of pipe buried in reactive soils. Therefore, in this study, the behaviour of a two meter long polyethylene pipe, which was buried in a box filled with reactive clay, was studied while the clay was subjected to wetting by supplying water to the bottom of the box. With soil wetting, it was observed that the soil swelled and the pipe deflected upwards. A simplified numerical analysis was then conducted on the pipe buried in the soil box using laboratory measured soil and pipe properties. The measured deflected shape of the pipe reasonably agrees with the shape obtained numerically assuming pinned end conditions of the pipe. ...|$|R

The purpose of these experiments was to study the behavior of piping subjected to seismic excitation levels that exceed design levels manyfold and may result in failure/plastification of pipe supports and pipe elements, and to establish seismic margins for piping and pipe supports. The performance of six different dynamic pipe support systems was evaluated and the response, operability, and fragility of dynamic supports and of a typical U. S. gate valve were investigated. Data obtained in the tests are used to validate analysis methods. Preliminary evaluations of the test results lead to the observation that, in general, failures of dynamic supports (in particular snubbers) occur only at load levels that substantially exceed the design capacity. <b>Pipe</b> <b>strains</b> at load levels exceeding the design level threefold are quite small, an d even when exceeding the design level eightfold are quite tolerable.

Specifically, the work described in this paper focuses on the forces that are produced at tee-junctions that lead to axial and bending structural responses of the piping system. Detonation experiments were conducted in a 2 -in. (50 mm) diameter schedule 40 piping system that was fabricated using 304 stainless steel and welded to ASME B 31. 3 standards. The 4. 1 m (162 -in.) long piping system included one tee and was supported using custom brackets and cantilever beams fastened to steel plates that were bolted to the laboratory walls. Nearly-ideal detonations were used in a 30 / 70 H 2 -N 2 O mixture at 1 atm initial pressure and 300 K. Pressure and hoop, axial, and support strains were measured using a high-speed (1 MHz) digital data acquisition system and calibrated signal conditioners. It was concluded that detonations propagate through the run of a 90 Â° tee with relatively little disturbance in either direction. The detonation load increases by approximately a factor of 2 when the detonation enters through the branch. The deflections of the cantilever beam supports and the hoop and axial <b>pipe</b> <b>strains</b> could be adequately predicted by finite element simulations.

It consists of a thin trench 10 a 13 cm width and about 50 cm high, filled with a self-placing concrete in which the polyethylene gas pipe is directly placed. The upper part is made of 5 to 8 cm of asphalt concrete, in continuity with the pavement surface layer in which the trench is constructed. This new concept has the advantages of quick construction and low excavation volumes. It should replace in the future the classical gas trench, 40 or 50 cm width and at least 70 cm hight, filled with unbonded graded material and bituminous concrete, in which the gas pipe is embedded in sandy materials. In order to verify the behavior of this new gas trench under heavy traffic loads, a fatigue experiment has been realized in 2003 by mean of the LCPC's ALT facility. The bituminous pavement of the ring C of the fatigue test track has been equipped by five trenches using the new concept, with different heights from 40 to 80 cm. A classical trench has also been constructed. Five trenches, 3 meters long, were transversal to the ALT traffic, and one of them, 6 meters long, was longitudinal.

The data generally indicated that changes in soil temperature, suction and moisture content were directly related to the local climatic variations.

The HDR-configuration which was not designed for seismic loads withstood a 200 % SSE load without any damage or global residual deformation. - The Energy Absorbers behaved in all aspects as expected. The replacement of 6 snubbers by only 3 Energy Absorbers was sufficient to keep pipe stresses within the limits. - The replacement of all snubbers by Seismic Stops kept the pipe stresses within the allowable limits. - The stiff NRC-configuration was tested up to 8 times the design loads.

The work {{provides}} {{research the}} deflected mode and calculation the relative deformation of {{vertical and horizontal}} diameters of corrugated metal structures (CMS), horizontal ellipse type, and cross section in their interaction with soil backfill depending on the thickness of corrugated metal pipe. Such studies are required for optimal design of CMS, establishing the causes of defects timely, appropriate engineering solutions to improve the bearing capacity of the CMS and reasonable use of funds for their construction or rehabilitation of existing transportation facilities using corrugated metal pipes. Methodology. Stresses and stability calculations of CMS form are conducted using the developed mathematical algorithm in program environment Mathcad 14.

40|$|LecturePg. 129 - 143 From {{time to time}} {{vibration}} probes pick up high vibration at the coupling location on output shafts. Many times the coupling will then be removed {{and sent to the}} shop or to the manufacturer for inspection, repair, and rebalancing. In many of these cases, especially with dry couplings, however, the root cause is elsewhere [1]. The coupling vibration-and sometimes damage can be a symptom of other problems in the train. What these vibrations mean is addressed as related to the coupling and vibration signature. Is it the coupling, or is the rotor out of balance? Or, is there a problem with the fit between the two? What else could be wrong? Field cases are presented where suspected coupling problems turned out to be something entirely different. In one case, an axially vibrating coupling {{turned out to be the}} result of a resonance condition in the feedback loop in the controller of a variable frequency motor. This resonance caused a torsional vibration that showed up axially in the coupling. In another case, three different high performance disc and two different high performance gear couplings were installed before a vibration problem was traced to <b>pipe</b> <b>strain</b> induced misalignment. Other cases are presented, including some where the coupling actually was the problem. Moreover, coupling balancing is covered, especially as it relates to the overall rotor balance condition. How can you be assured that a coupling balanced at the factory will still be in balance when installed in the field? What is the importance of balancing tolerances and how significant are they when referenced to the out of balance due to fits and clearances? It is shown that the setup indication tolerances are a more significant contributor to overall coupling balance than actual balance machine unbalance tolerances. All of the cases presented involve dry couplings-ones that don't have lubricated gear teeth. On almost all new high performance turbomachinery applications, dry couplings have replaced the gear type, and one of the reasons for this is the general lack of coupling problems associated with the dry couplings (except for an occasional wind age problem). There are usually no wearing parts, and there are less clearances (like in gear tooth mesh), which can lead to significant unbalance and vibration in sensitive applications...|$|E
40|$|To support cost {{calculations}} for tendering a pipe lay project, {{the influence}} of weather conditions has to be incorporated by applying workability predictions for the pipe lay vessel. When assuming constant good weather conditions {{it is possible to}} accurately determine the duration of an offshore pipe lay project. In practice however, changing weather influences have to be incorporated to determine the actual total project duration. The objective {{of this study is to}} find a new calculation method that is more accurate and has a short calculation time. First the existing method to predict the workability during pipe laying has been analysed and shortcomings have been identified. Historical project data for the dynamically positioned pipe lay vessel Solitaire has been used. Four areas for improvements of the existing method have been identified: - Wave Prediction: Extra deviation factor - Criterion Limits: Incorporation wave period - Wave Heading: Chosen on solid base - Abandonment and Recovery (A&R) : Dependent on project location The first aspect of interest is the wave prediction. Currently used wave measurements are satellite data combined with buoy measurements. A scatter diagram represents the occurring sea states for a certain location, as combinations of the significant wave height related to the zero crossing period. This is at the moment the best available representation used for wave predictions. In this study a program has been written to determine the standard deviation of the workability prediction caused by variation in the weather conditions. As input for the composed program the limiting sea states for the vessel, project duration and scatter diagram are used. Logically, the project duration has a direct relation to the deviation. Five criteria, (i) <b>pipe</b> <b>strain,</b> (ii) stinger tip clearance, (iii) stinger forces, (iv) tensioner dynamics and (v) dynamic positioning (DP) system limit the sea states for the workability. The vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to determine the workability for the criteria concerning the pipeline (i to iv). When the critical value for one of the criteria is reached, the accompanying vessel motion is determined. The vessel motions are known for the whole scatter diagram and compared with the critical motion to determine the workable limit. For the criterion (v) DP system, which can compensate displacements in the horizontal plane, the same program as for the existing method will be used. For the other criteria the new method incorporates {{the influence of}} the wave period, while for the existing method only the wave height is regarded. The third area is the wave heading. As mentioned before, the vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to give an indication of the influence of waves. For different wave angles the stinger tip motion is plotted. Two angles are chosen as representative values for the whole compass rose. The existing method treats the average and worst wave angle for the vessel. By using the new method more accurate results can be achieved based on solid assumptions. A&R is the lay down process of the pipeline because of bad weather conditions. Currently a fixed percentage of the production time is used to predict the duration of A&R. Not only the duration of bad weather but also the number of times a critical sea state is exceeded determines the duration for A&R. By using old project data a relation between the duration for A&R and the workability percentage has been found. For North Sea projects a relation with the probability of exceedence of the significant wave height is found. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} novel {{applications}} of distributed fiber optic sensors for pipeline structural health monitoring. Specifically, this thesis aims {{to show that}} distributed fiber optic sensors can potentially detect the onset of out-of-roundness in pipes and monitor local stiffness changes on the out-of-round pipe, show the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure and demonstrate the potential of distributed fiber optic sensors for monitoring pipe bursts in a laboratory-based burst test while highlighting the importance of sensor spatial and temporal resolution. The ability of distributed fiber optic sensors to detect out-of-roundness in pipes was demonstrated through an experimental program where fiber sensors were instrumented helically around a PVC pipe. The onset of out-of-roundness in the pipe was induced by filling it with water. Strain measurements made by the fiber sensor after the pipe was filled with water showed an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains along the mid-line of the pipe and minima strains along the top and bottom. This suggested the onset of out-of-roundness. The measurements agreed with an analytical model derived by Brazier describing the deformation of a cylindrical shell due to a bending moment. Internal pressure was then applied to the filled <b>pipe.</b> <b>Strain</b> measurements made with the fiber sensors showed a mean increase in strain and an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains {{at the top and}} bottom of the pipe and minimas along the mid-line. This agreed with an analytical model derived by Haigh describing the expansion of an out-of-round pipe under internal pressure. Local stiffness changes were introduced to the PVC pipe by bonding steel shims to its surface. The distributed fiber optic sensors were found to be capable of locating the shim when the out-of-round pipe was pressurized. These results demonstrate that distributed fiber sensors can potentially be used to detect the onset of out-of-roundness in pipes and monitor local wall stiffness changes in the out-of-round pipe. The theoretical response of the distributed fiber sensor when helically instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure was investigated through finite element methods. An algorithm converting finite element point strains to distributed fiber sensor strains and a finite element model of the out-of-round pipe were developed. The strain distributions predicted by the combined algorithm and finite element pipe were found to show good agreement with the experimental results of Chapter 7. The validated algorithm and model were then used to study the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented helically on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure. The results of this study showed that the theoretical distributed fiber optic sensor strains of the out-of-round pipe subjected to internal pressure, internal pressure and axial loads and internal pressure and bending loads are different suggesting that a single strand of fiber sensor instrumented helically around the pipe can potentially distinguish between the three loading cases. The potential of distributed fiber sensors for monitoring pipe bursts was demonstrated in a laboratory-based study. Distributed fiber optic sensors were instrumented on a cast iron pipe. Various damages sizes were introduced to the pipe to initiate burst and the pipe was pressurized. It was observed that higher spatial and temporal distributed fiber optic sensor resolutions allowed the expansion of the burst site to be monitored until the pipe failed. Spatial and temporal resolutions that were too low however could not detect the burst site. The findings of this thesis are expected to contribute towards the development of smart pipes capable of relaying information on its structural health to pipeline operators...|$|E

The Winkler model is used to schematize the soil-structure interaction. The approach is focused on axial strains, since bending strains in a buried pipe due to the wave propagation are typically a second-order effect. Unlike many works, the inertial terms are considered in solving equations. Accurate numerical simulations are carried out to show the influence of pipe length and constraint conditions on the <b>pipe</b> seismic <b>strain.</b> The obtained results are compared with results inferred from other models present in the literature.

For the specific conditions tested, the largest deflections and strains were for the HDPE pipe when placed just above a rigid base and with uncompacted sand backfill placed below the springline, while local bending was greatest for the PVC pipe with well-compacted gravel backfill. A procedure is presented to account for the maximum local bending strain within a simplified design approach for profiled thermoplastic pipes using an empirical strain factor inferred from the measured results...|$|R
40|$|Two {{finite element}} {{procedures}} are described for predicting the dynamic response of general 3 -D fluid-filled elastic piping systems. The first approach, a low frequency procedure, models each straight pipe or elbow as {{a sequence of}} beams. The contained fluid is modeled as a separate coincident sequence axial members (rods) which {{are tied to the}} pipe in the lateral direction. The model includes the <b>pipe</b> hoop <b>strain</b> correction to the fluid sound speed and the flexibility factor correction to the elbow flexibility. The second modeling approach, an intermediate frequency procedure, follows generally the original Zienkiewicz-Newton scheme for coupled fluid-structure problems except that the velocity potential is used as the fundamental fluid unknown to symmetrize the coefficient matrices. From comparisons of the beam model predictions to both experimental data and the 3 -D model, the beam model is validated for frequencies up to about two-thirds of the lowest fluid-filled labor pipe mode. Accurate elbow flexibility factors are seen to be crucial for effective beam modeling of piping systems...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{for the use of}} spiral welded <b>pipes</b> in <b>strain</b> based design related applications. Since the influence of the spiral weld on the plastic behaviour of the pipe is not yet fully understood, further research on this topic is required. An important aspect of this plastic behaviour is the effect of mixed mode loading on weld defects located in the helical weld. This paper elaborates on the first experimental trials to evaluate ductile tearing by means of single edge notched tensile specimen (SENT) testing with slanted notches. Tests were performed on two SENT specimens, one with a slanted notch and another with a straight notch in order to investigate the influence of mixed mode loading. The crack mouth opening displacement and crack extension were determined experimentally by means of digital image correlation and potential drop measurements respectively. The crack extension and the potential drop measurements were related by means of finite element simulations...|$|R

Five pressurized 76 -m pipeline sections were installed on the Minnehaha Mine highwall near Sullivan, IN, for testing to failure. Four 17 -to 51 -cm-diameter welded steel pipes and one 22 -cm PVC pipe were monitored for vibration, strain, and pressure for a period of 6 months while production blasting advanced up to the test pipeline field. In contrast to previous studies of small-scale, close-in blasting for construction, these tests involved overburden blasts of up to 950 kg per delay in 31 -cm blastholes. Analyses found low <b>pipe</b> responses, <b>strains,</b> and calculated stresses from even large blasts. Ground vibrations of 120 to 250 mm/s produced worst case strains that were about 25 pct of the strains resulting from normal pipeline operations and calculated stresses of only about 10 to 18 pct of the ultimate tensile strength. No pressurization failures or permanent strains occurred even at vibration amplitudes of 600 mm/s...|$|R

The main purpose of this work is devise mathematical-technological models to determinate internal pipe pressure from longitudinal deformation. Devised models were used on data from realized experiment and results were compared with real value of pressures in pipes. This thesis contains three models which were mutually compared. Sensitivity analysis were done on two of these models. Thesis also contains opening research of strain gauge problematics. Description of basic knowledge of physical objects mechanic with focusing on shells also belongs to this theoretical part...|$|R
