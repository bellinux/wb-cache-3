40|$|This article {{presents}} a meta-analysis of recent microeconometric evaluations of active labour market policies. We categorise 199 programme impacts from 97 studies conducted between 1995 and 2007.

Training programmes {{are associated with}} positive medium-term impacts, although {{in the short term}} they often appear ineffective. We also find that the outcome variable used to measure programme impact matters, but neither the publication status of a study nor the use of a randomised design is related to the sign or significance of the <b>programme</b> <b>estimate.</b> Copyright � 2010 TheAuthor(s).

40|$|Full-sib {{families}} were generated from a factorial design between seven female trees of P. strobus and four male trees of P.  wallichiana {{to combine the}} rapid growth of former species with high resistance to blisterrust (Cronartium ribicola) of the latter one. At age two the hybrid {{families were}} artificially inoculated with blister-rust and at age six they were field planted. Total height growth, diameter at 1. 3 m, basal area, stem volume, stem straightness and tree survival were measured at age 19 after planting. Significant (p< 0. 05) and highly significant (p< 0. 01; p< 0. 001) differences among female effects were found for all tested traits including survival suggesting that nuclear additive genes controlled these traits. Male effects were significant only for stem straightness. In all but one trait the σ 2 GCA: σ 2 SCA and σ 2 GCA-F : σ 2 GCA-M ratios were in favour of additive variance suggesting that this variance {{should be used in}} the breeding strategy. Narrow-sense heritability at family level was 0. 778 for volume growth rate and 0. 861 for survival; such high values indicate that the breeding programme, has good chances of success. Two of the 11 tested parents exhibited significant positive g. c. a. effects for survival after heavy blister-rust inoculation.  One parent exhibited highly significant positive g. c. a. effects for volume growth rate.  The three good general combiners should be taken into account in the breeding <b>programme.</b> <b>Estimate</b> of the high-parent heterosis was negative for the volume but positive for survival.  For volume, the hybrid mean was 5. 9 % lower than the mean of the eastern white pine but  85. 4 % greater than blue pine bulk lot for survival.  Estimate of low-parent heterosis for survival was also positive; i. e. the hybrid population mean was 537. 5 % greater than eastern white pine. If the hybrids will be used in operational planting programs, a variable genetic gain between 6. 0 and 10. 5 % for volume and between 6. 8 and 9. 6 % for survival could be achieved. </p...|$|E
