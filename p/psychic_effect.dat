Russell, in private, offered up his implant in order to save his son from grave harm, despite knowing it would most likely lead to his death to have it removed. Owen accepted, and Russell was escorted to a secret surgery facility. Upon his arrival, Russell realized Owen had betrayed him, but he was overpowered by the guards and sedated.

40|$|The first author, {{a proponent}} of {{evidence}} for psychic ability, and the second, a sceptic, have been conducting a systematic programme of collaborative sceptic-proponent research in parapsychology. This has involved carrying out joint experiments in which each investigator individually attempted to mentally influence the electrodermal activity of participants at a distant location. The first two collaborations obtained evidence of,experimenter effects', that is, experiments conducted by the proponent obtained significant results but those conducted by the sceptic did not. This paper describes a new collaborative study that attempted to replicate our previous findings and explore potential explanations for past results. The new study failed to replicate our previous findings. The paper investigates whether the results obtained in our initial studies may {{have been caused by}} a genuine <b>psychic</b> <b>effect,</b> and this third experiment failed to replicate this finding because some aspect of the study disrupted the production of that effect, or whether the results from our first two studies represented chance findings or undetected subtle artifacts, and the results obtained in the present study accurately reflect the absence of a remote detection of staring effect.

40|$|Early {{studies of}} the mammary gland and its {{innervation}} led to the belief, {{at least in some}} quarters, that mammary activity is {{under the control of the}} nervous system. 6 With the development of endocrinology, however, growth and function of the mammary apparatus were found to be determined by secretions of the ovaries and hypophysis. In a number of species mammary development identical with that occurring during pregnancy has been induced by the proper administration of ovarian hormones, and in some species full lactation has followed the administration of lactogenic substance from the hypophysis to animals whose mammary glands have grown under the influence of extrinsic ovarian hormones. " 4 In the normal sequence of events in the intact animal, however, full lactation does not occur until the parturient animal has been suckled. Moreover, cessation of suckling is rather promptly followed in the fully lactating animal by termination of lactation and by mammary involution. 14 In explanation of these commonly observed facts it has been suggested 0 11, 12, 13 that irritation of the nipples by suckling sets up centripetal nerve impulses which, by stimulation of the hypophysis, lead to maintenance of the mammary glands and of lactation. If this explanation is correct, adequate irritation of the nipples by artificial means in the complete absence of young should exert the same effect as suckling, without the complicating factor of a possible <b>psychic</b> <b>effect</b> of the mere presence of the young. The experiments reported here were designed to test this assumption, in the belief that retardation of mammary involution by chemical irritation of the nipples would establish nipple irritation as at least one of the means by which suckling maintains the lactating mammary gland. Mice were used as the test animals and spirits of turpentine was employed as the irritant. At autopsy the mammary glands were removed with the skin and fixed in Bouin's picro-formol.

Inspired by debates about telepathy, brain waves and other <b>psychic</b> <b>effects,</b> members of these cultures imagined and constructed electrical communication technologies that would address a range of psychic puzzles. Although the technological solutions to psychic puzzles ultimately proved inconclusive, they provide historians with striking insights into the role of ‘irrational’ topics in shaping imagined and actual technological development...|$|R

30|$|The Situationists {{took up the}} {{practice}} of urban wandering again, defining it “psychogeographical dérive”. This consisted of {{an exploration of the}} city aimed at understanding the effects of space on the individual and his behaviour, the separation of the social aspects of the topography and the effective dimension of built spaces, and at acknowledging the <b>psychic</b> <b>effects</b> of the urban context (Careri 2001). In the dérive proposed by the Situationists the modern condition of the city is celebrated, in which public spaces have ceased to be the place of dialogue and exchange, to become an unforeseeable fabric determined by multiple itineraries. The dérive is a spatial experience that starts with the figure of the flâneur, introduced by Baudelaire and Benjamin, but proposes a new condition, a route dictated by indeterminacy and chance, an indifference that enables the city to be explored using a map that is not the traditional one, as appears clearly from the plans of Debord’s Naked City and New Babylon by Costant (Sadler 1999). The figure of the flâneur, as well as bearing witness to a bewildered human condition, highlights the desire to understand the city going over and above the traditional interpretative categories and experimenting with new relations with the territory (Benjamin 1986, 2010; Nuvolati 2006). Through these representations the world ceases to appear as an object in itself, but is defined more and more as a background, which cannot be separated from social behaviour and structure (Maciocco and Pittaluga 2001).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} human recognition, defined as {{the extent to which}} an individual is acknowledged by others to be of inherent value by virtue of being a fellow human being. Following a qualitative exposition of human recognition, a formal model is presented that describes provision and receipt of human recognition, its contribution to utility, its effects on health, and its role in development programs. Key predictions from the model are that human recognition receipt has a positive, causal relationship with utility and health outcomes; that multiple equilibria for human recognition can exist; and that only accounting for human recognition’s instrumental effects on material outcomes while ignoring its direct, <b>psychic</b> <b>effects</b> on utility leads to suboptimal programs. By defining and formally modeling human recognition and its role in economic development for the first time, the paper identifies a new component of economic development and offers an example of how such intangible components can be formally modeled.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of cannabis use among Swiss students and to assess their attitudes regarding health and safety issues associated with drug use. Subjects and methods: After a workshop, 173 students (23. 1 % male, 75. 7 % female; 44. 4 % age 16, 43. 8 % age 17 and 11. 8 % age 18) from a Swiss school were surveyed by questionnaire. Results: 59. 3 % (n= 103) of all participants had tried cannabis, and 30. 1 % of those who reported cannabis use had consumed more than 100 joints. Of those 103 students with cannabis experience, 6. 8 % rated the risk of cannabis-related <b>psychic</b> <b>effects</b> as low, and 9. 8 % were not concerned about driving under the influence of cannabis. In cases of heavy cannabis use, the chance of increased tobacco, alcohol or other drug use is higher than for those with less or no cannabis use at all (odds ratios of 4. 33 - 10. 86). Conclusions: This paper deals primarily with cannabis prevalence data in adolescents from previous studies and sources, and shows that our findings deviate significantly - and surprisingly - from past research. Our data from a school survey indicates higher cannabis use than data from official drug policy studies. Additionally, our data shows that the students’ self-reported attitudes towards health and safety issues were mostly realistic. The examination of methodological issues that might impact prevalence estimates should be added to the cannabis literature...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is described which provides excellent surgical conditions with safety through combination of three drugs with minimal adverse pharmacological effects. Hyoscine premedication {{is used for}} amnesic and <b>psychic</b> <b>effects,</b> nitrous oxide for analgesia or light anaesthesia, and subapnoeic amounts of d-tubocurarine for relaxation and quietude. Ventilation is managed by manual augmentation of tidal volume to pro-duce an intermittent apnoea correlated with a lowered Pco 2. This {{technique is}} offered as a useful means of introducing students to a concept of adequate ventilation which can be learned and applied during anaesthesia in accordance with continuing information available from the patient himself. This discourse has two purposes: first to describe and discuss a technique which in our hands has been used successfully since 1950 for thousands of patients; secondly, to illustrate a practical benefit of this technique in teaching a concept of adequate ventilation. The introduction of curare and other muscle relaxants was gradually followed by a general {{turning away from the}} more profound levels of inhalation anaesthesia in favour of lighter anaes-thesia, or even analgesia aided by neuromuscular blockade to provide quietude and suitable surgical conditions. Deeper anaesthesia frequently has sequelae of long-term depressant effects lasting well beyond the surgical period. The avoidance of such effects has measurable benefits in terms of patient response in the immediate postoperative period and is frequently reflected in a shorter hospital stay. Perhaps true anaesthesia is not needed, but only a quiet surgical field together with freedom from unpleasant recollections for the patient. In accordance with these desiderata, a most useful combination of minimal anaesthesia and muscle relaxants utilizes three drugs only: nitrous oxide for unconsciousness, subapnoeic quantitie...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an interdisciplinary}} decolonial, queer {{women of color}} cultural analysis of Xicana representations of trauma. My examination of theatrical texts relies on a decolonial U. S. Third World queer and feminist methodology. Through this methodological lens, I situate Chicanas as (neo) colonial subjects {{by focusing on the}} colonial, imperial, and psychosocial context for Chicana trauma. I detail physical and ontological violence perpetrated upon people in the Indigenous Americas, especially in what has become Mexico and the southwestern United States. I also synthesize mental health statistics that quantify the <b>psychic</b> <b>effects</b> of colonial and imperial changes upon displaced peoples. Xicana plays and performances, I argue, aptly illuminate the embodiment of this locura, a psychosomatic and spiritual dis-ease rooted in colonial and imperial collective and intergenerational trauma. The primary texts for my analysis are Cherríe Moraga’s drama The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea, Adelina Anthony’s performance Las Hociconas: Three Locas with Big Mouths and Even Bigger Brains, and Virginia Grise’s play blu. These texts, I posit, illustrate how colonialism, internal colonialism, and imperialism have created subjects. I conceptualize what I term “subjects of trauma” through these three cultural productions that each make visible the social, political, and economic injustices experienced by Chicanas—many of whom live within internal colonies—in the United States. I interrogate the decolonial tactics that queer Xicana feminist playwrights employ to re-create themselves as subjects and subsequently alleviate psychic pain. I maintain that Xicana feminist theater promotes self-healing vis-à-vis self-making, as it theorizes our subject positions and intersubjective self-hood and, through consistent revisions of what have become traditional narratives, reminds us of the possibility of “decolonizing our selves” by remaking our selves...|$|R

40|$|America's soundscape {{underwent}} tremendous {{changes from}} {{the mid-nineteenth century}} on: {{not only in terms}} of the telegraph, telephone, and phonograph, but also with the noises heard in the city streets, factories, and countryside nearby. During this period, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, and Thomas Wilmer Dewing explored the intersection of auditory experience and artistic production, creating complex works that gave visual form to the changing nature of sound and listening. All three painters pursued the representation of aurality as career-long endeavors, and developed distinct approaches and pictorial syntaxes. Homer, whose life and artistic outlook were marked by his experience as a traveling Civil War illustrator, painted the everyday sounds of laborers in the American countryside and out at sea in terms of issues related to distance and signaling over space. At a time when a growing number of people were communicating with one another with the aid of such machines as the telegraph and telephone, Homer's long-distance aural exchanges probe the human desire for connectivity, and its converse, separation. Eakins piques our aural imagination with the physiognomic and sartorial acuities of his musicians and singers, not to mention the mimeticism of their actions, and attempts to pack the parallel visual and aural experiences of realism tightly into his paintings, despite the limits of the medium. Transferring his photographic experiments of stopping the human body in mid-motion to the painterly stopping of musical sound in mid-song, Eakins's works evince his personal form of transcription. Whereas Eakins sought to unify the eye, ear, and hand in one split second of representation, Dewing sought to fragment aural moments to pictorialize the <b>psychic</b> <b>effects</b> of listening, and promote the vaults of the imagination. Most notably through attenuated sonic transmissions and the idea of pause, Dewing's representations of women in airless domestic interiors and atmospheric landscapes frequently evince a "pulling apart" of sight and sound that render his depictions of music and speech strangely quiet and unsettling. At the same time, these suspended aural scenarios help to cabin the women he so often portrayed...|$|R
