5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity.

5|$|In the 1980s, the Conservancy began a {{gene bank}} {{designed}} {{to preserve the}} genetic material of rare breeds. After collecting genetic material from over a dozen rare breeds, the bank {{was transferred to the}} USDA National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP). It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP, including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds. The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation, an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve germplasm from rare breeds. In the early 1990s, the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, designed to raise <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> declining populations of rare livestock breeds.|$|E

5|$|Recent biographies {{show that}} historians differ about whether Emmeline Pankhurst's militancy helped or hurt the movement; however, {{there is general}} {{agreement}} that the WSPU raised <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement in ways that proved essential. Baldwin compared her to Martin Luther and Jean-Jacques Rousseau: individuals who were not {{the sum total of}} the movements in which they took part, but who nevertheless played crucial roles in struggles of social and political reform. In the case of Pankhurst, this reform took place in both intentional and unintentional ways. By defying the roles of wife and mother as the docile companion, Pankhurst paved the way for feminists who would later decry her support for empire and sustainable social values.|$|E
5|$|The {{accidents}} on {{its opening}} day gave the Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{huge amounts of}} publicity, and greatly increased <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential of rapid transport. The L's passenger service proved immediately successful. In October the Duke of Wellington's special train was put into use as a dedicated first-class train, making four journeys each day between Liverpool and Manchester in each direction. On 4 December 1830 goods operations on the L began, with Planet hauling 75 tons of freight from Liverpool to Manchester. In {{the first six months}} of 1831 the L carried 188,726 passengers and 35,800tons of goods; in the year from the opening in September 1830 to September 1831, almost 500,000 passengers were carried. At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> West German <b>public's</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS atrocities {{grew in the}} 1970s and 1980s, {{the attitudes}} towards Waffen-SS {{veterans}} shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|R
5|$|The murders {{committed}} by Burke and Hare raised <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for bodies for medical purposes, {{and of the}} trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at King's College London led to {{an investigation of the}} London Burkers, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained royal assent nine months later to become the Anatomy Act 1832. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from workhouses unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.|$|E
5|$|One of Duigan's most {{significant}} changes {{resulted in the}} downsizing of the Territorial Force (TF), which was already {{in a state of}} decline. Current recruitment was insufficient to support the theoretical infantry division and three mounted rifle brigades that the TF mobilisation plans called for. Duigan downsized the division to a brigade group and three lots of fortress troops centred around Auckland, Wellington, and Lyttelton. Many infantry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted as battalions, while the mounted regiments were each reduced {{to the size of a}} squadron. Several senior officers were placed in retirement as well. The morale of the TF declined as the remaining senior officers raised concerns—disregarded by Duigan—over the state of the army. Four TF colonels publicly protested the reforms in the press in what became known as the Four Colonels' Revolt. This was a breach of military regulations, which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do so. Instead of a court-martial, which he feared would generate public sympathy for the colonels, Duigan placed all four officers on the retired list as punishment. The revolt did result in greater <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor state of New Zealand's military but little was done to rectify the situation.|$|E
