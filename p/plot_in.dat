40|$|BACKGROUND: Forest plots are {{graphical}} {{displays of}} findings of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Little {{is known about}} the style and content of these plots and whether published plots maximize the graphic's potential for information exchange. METHODS: We examine the number, style and content of forest <b>plots</b> presented <b>in</b> a previously studied cross-sectional sample of 300 systematic reviews. We studied all forest <b>plots</b> <b>in</b> non-Cochrane reviews and a sample of forest <b>plots</b> <b>in</b> Cochrane reviews. RESULTS: The database contained 129 Cochrane reviews and 171 non-Cochrane reviews. All the Cochrane reviews had forest <b>plots</b> (2197 <b>in</b> total), and a random sample of 500 of these <b>plots</b> were included. <b>In</b> total, 28 of the non-Cochrane reviews had forest <b>plots</b> (139 <b>in</b> total), all of which were included. <b>Plots</b> <b>in</b> Cochrane reviews were standardized but often contained little data (80 % had three or fewer studies; 10 % had no studies) and always presented studies in alphabetical order. Non-Cochrane plots depicted a larger number of studies (60 % had four or more studies) and 59 % ordered studies by a potentially meaningful characteristic, but important information was often missing. Of the 28 reviews that had a forest plots with at least 10 studies, 3 (11 %) had funnel plots. CONCLUSIONS: Forest <b>plots</b> <b>in</b> Cochrane reviews were highly standardized but some of the standards do not optimize information exchange, and many of the plots had too little data to be useful. Forest <b>plots</b> <b>in</b> non-Cochrane reviews often omitted key elements but had more data and were often more thoughtfully constructed...|$|R
