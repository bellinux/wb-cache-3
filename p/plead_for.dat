5|$|Your honor, I ask no mercy, I <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> no immunity. I {{realize that}} finally the right must prevail. I never more fully comprehended than now the great {{struggle}} between the powers of greed {{on the one hand}} and upon the other the rising hosts of freedom. I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come into their own.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Ordnance Warwick {{presided over}} an {{increasingly}} important government department, which centrally managed the storage and commissioning of the state's artillery, munitions, and small arms. Prince William of Orange valued English cannons, and Warwickwho fervently believed in the international Protestant causeseems willingly to have supplied him with what he wanted. The Spanish ambassador officially protested against this practice in 1576, since the weapons would have been used against Spanish rule in the Netherlands. In 1573 Warwick {{was admitted to the}} Privy Council. His attendance to business was quite regular until it declined sharply due to his deteriorating health in the 1580s. At the 1587 trial of Mary Stuart he acted as a commissioner and was asked by the Scottish Queen to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> her with his brother, the absent Earl of Leicester. The day sentence was pronounced on her, Warwick did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Cersei convinces Sansa that to {{save her}} father's life, she must {{write a letter to}} her brother Robb imploring him to come to King's Landing and swear fealty to Joffrey. Later, Joffrey and Cersei hold court, where they reward Janos Slynt, the Captain of the City Watch, with a lordship, while Tywin Lannister is named the new Hand of the King. Joffrey also {{relieves}} Ser Barristan Selmy as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and gives his post to Jaime Lannister. Selmy is offered a castle and land in recognition of his service, but a furious Selmy, regarding the offer as an insult, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out in disgust. Sansa takes the opportunity to publicly <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> her father's life, and Joffrey agrees to show mercy if Ned will confess to treason and accept him as the rightful king.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke in}} that low, {{impressive}} voice of his, {{and with those}} soft, appealing tones with which she had once heard him <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> poor Charlotte Corday. Yet now he was not <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> himself, not for his selfish wish or for his own happiness, only <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> his love, that she should know of it, and, knowing it, have pity in her heart for him, and let him serve her to the end.|$|R

5|$|Narseh sent an {{ambassador}} to Galerius to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> {{the return of}} his wives {{and children in the}} course of the war, but Galerius dismissed him. Serious peace negotiations began in the spring of 299. The magister memoriae (secretary) of Diocletian and Galerius, Sicorius Probus, was sent to Narseh to present terms. The conditions of the resulting Peace of Nisibis were heavy: Armenia returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; Caucasian Iberia would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman rule, would become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene (Sophene), Arzanene (Aghdznik), Corduene (Carduene), and Zabdicene (near modern Hakkâri, Turkey). These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the Anti-Taurus range; the Bitlis pass, the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia; and access to the Tur Abdin plateau.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Emperor, John V Palaiologos visited Louis in Buda {{in early}} 1366, seeking his {{assistance}} against the Ottoman Turks , who had {{set foot in}} Europe. This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take off his hat, which offended Louis. John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises. Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to send help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.|$|E

25|$|On 4 December, he {{met with}} the King and again urged delay in any {{decision}} about abdication. On 5 December, he issued a lengthy statement implying that the Ministry was applying unconstitutional pressure on the King to force him to make a hasty decision.

25|$|During {{the second}} encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife. Galerius {{advanced}} into Media and Adiabene, winning successive victories, most prominently near Erzurum, and securing Nisibis (Nusaybin, Turkey) before October 1, 298. He {{moved down the}} Tigris, taking Ctesiphon. Narseh had previously sent an ambassador to Galerius to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> the return of his wives and children.

In the interim, Lieutenant General Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarilas assumed leadership over the Army of Catalonia.

After listening to her plea, the prison authorities let her father go and they both were allowed to return home. The spy activities of the sisters, which continued during the duration of the war, were never discovered by the Union Army.|$|E

25|$|When World War II ended, the American Military Government in Bavaria, {{under the}} command of General George S.

His sister, Princess Alice, {{learning}} of his incarceration, came to Germany with her husband, Major-General The Earl of Athlone (the former Governor General of Canada), to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> his release with his American captors.

The Turkish fleet only stood by during the siege of Calvi, and contributed little. The same inactivity took place during the siege of Bastia, which had been retaken by the Genoese.

25|$|The {{trial of}} Albert Muwalo and Focus Gwede {{was held in}} the Southern Region Traditional Court in March to April 1977. Traditional Courts did not allow defence lawyers to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> the accused, who were not given a summary of the charges against them before the trial, so could not prepare a defence. Defendants had no right to call {{witnesses}} (which was at the discretion of the judges) nor to appeal (which was at the discretion of Minister of Justice, a post held by Banda). Finally, these courts were not bound by the normal rules of evidence.|$|E
25|$|Lehi prisoners {{captured}} by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them and therefore was illegal. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to <b>plead</b> <b>for</b> amnesty, {{even when it was}} clear that this would have spared them the death penalty. In one case Moshe Barazani, a Lehi member, and Meir Feinstein, an Irgun member, committed suicide in prison with a grenade smuggled inside an orange so the British could not hang them.|$|E

After much manipulation, he reveals himself and lets them and their households into Egypt, where Pharaoh assigns to them the land of Goshen. Jacob calls his sons to his bedside and reveals their future before he dies. Joseph lives to an old age and exhorts his brethren, if God should lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them.|$|E
