5|$|It is a {{specialty}} of <b>Purim.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{festival of}} <b>Purim</b> celebrates the {{deliverance}} of the Jewish {{people from the}} plot of Haman to annihilate them in the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire, {{as described in the}} Book of Esther. It is a day of rejoicing and merriment, on which children, and many adults, wear costumes. It is customary to eat a festive meal, seudat <b>Purim,</b> in the late afternoon, often with wine as the prominent beverage, in keeping with the atmosphere of merry-making.|$|E
5|$|Many people prepare {{packages}} {{of food that}} they give to neighbors, friends, family, and colleagues on <b>Purim.</b> These are called mishloach manot ("sending of portions"), and often include wine and baked goods, fruit and nuts, and sweets.|$|E

5|$|The food most {{associated}} with <b>Purim</b> is called ozne haman ("Haman's ears"). These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed, but also other fruit fillings. The triangular shape {{may have been}} influenced by old illustrations of Haman, in which he wore a three-cornered hat.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the <b>Purim</b> festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the clever politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Jewish {{holidays}} {{influence the}} cuisine, with {{the preparation of}} traditional foods at holiday times, such as various types of challah (braided bread) for Shabbats and Festivals, jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) for Hanukah, the hamantaschen pastry (oznei haman) for <b>Purim,</b> charoset, a type of fruit paste, for Passover, and dairy foods for Shavuot. The Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Shabbat lunch, is a significant meal in Israeli homes, together with holiday meals.|$|E
50|$|The track {{incorporates}} a bassline by Alphonso Johnson, as {{performed on the}} title track of Flora <b>Purim's</b> album, Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly. Johnson is probably best known as having been with the jazz-fusion group Weather Report.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4.5 stars. Its review by Jim Newsom states: [...] "This is the album that {{launched}} Flora <b>Purim's</b> solo career with great promise following her magnificent stint with Chick Corea's first incarnation of Return to Forever." ...|$|R
5000|$|The only older tracks {{included}} on the album that did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100 are [...] "Betcha Never" [...] (from The Sweetest Days) and Williams's covers of Flora <b>Purim's</b> [...] "Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly" [...] and Simon Climie's [...] "Oh How The Years Go By". Both these covers were originally released only on multi-artist compilations (although [...] "Oh How The Years Go By" [...] was subsequently {{included on}} Next).|$|R
5|$|Shira Mendelman, an 18-year-old Hasidic girl {{living in}} Tel Aviv, {{is looking forward}} to an {{arranged}} marriage with a young man whom she likes. However, on <b>Purim,</b> her family suffers a tragedy when Shira's older sister Esther dies in childbirth. Shira's father subsequently delays the engagement so as not {{to have to deal with}} an empty house so soon after Esther's death. Esther's husband, Yochay, begins to regularly bring their son, Mordechai, to the Mendelman's house, where Shira cares for him.|$|E
25|$|On <b>Purim</b> day, {{a festive}} meal called the Se`udat <b>Purim</b> is held. Fasting for non-medical reasons is {{prohibited}} on <b>Purim.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Purim</b> Katan is when {{during a}} Jewish leap year <b>Purim</b> is celebrated during Adar II {{so that the}} 14th of Adar I is then called <b>Purim</b> Katan.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, a WIAA State Girls' Basketball Tournament {{conflicted}} with <b>Purim's</b> Fast of Esther. The school's team, {{who had made}} it to State for the first time, had to balance religious obligations with playing and, in the end, decided there would be [...] "no forfeit of faith," [...] garnering significant media coverage. Again in 2011, a WIAA State Girls' Volleyball Tournament conflicted, this time with Sabbath. Northwest's team once again decided [...] "no forfeit of faith." ...|$|R
50|$|Home for <b>Purims</b> {{cast and}} crew {{are in the process}} of making what appears to be a cheap melodrama. The {{director}} (Guest) is constantly adding bizarre camera shots and acting notes. The producer (Coolidge), heiress to a diaper service, dresses flamboyantly but doesnt seem to know much about managing a film beyond paying for expenses. The two writers (Balaban and McKean) are at odds with the director, seeing their script mash together Southern genteel with out-of-place Jewish references and words.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Koster {{released}} The Singing Saw at Christmastime, {{a collection}} of Christmas carols played on the singing saw. This {{was followed by a}} caroling tour, on which he played songs from The Singing Saw at Christmastime and selected tracks from Music Tapes for Clouds and Tornadoes for free wherever fans invited him to play. [...] This evolved into an annual caroling tradition, which transformed into the [...] "Lullabies at Bedsides" [...] house tour of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 which in turn gave way to the long-planned Traveling Imaginary of 2012-2013. After the EP <b>Purim's</b> Shadows in 2011, in 2012, The Music Tapes released their third full-length LP, Mary's Voice.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Purim</b> meal (Se'udat <b>Purim</b> or <b>Purim</b> Se'udah). This meal is {{traditionally}} accompanied by consumption of alcohol, often heavy, although Jewish sages have warned {{about the need}} to adhere to all religious laws even in a drunken state.|$|E
25|$|Shushan <b>Purim</b> {{falls on}} Adar 15 {{and is the}} day on which Jews in Jerusalem {{celebrate}} <b>Purim.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>Purim</b> spiel was {{historically}} a comic dramatization that {{attempted to}} convey the saga of the <b>Purim</b> story. By the 18th century, {{in some parts of}} Eastern Europe, the <b>Purim</b> plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther {{was little more than a}} pretext. Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories. Today, <b>Purim</b> spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews and Judaism that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day.|$|E
5000|$|Pastorius {{appeared}} as a guest on many albums by other artists, as for example in 1976 with Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople, on All American Alien Boy. He can be heard on Airto Moreira's album I'm Fine, How Are You? (1977). His signature sound is prominent on Flora <b>Purim's</b> Everyday Everynight (1978), on which he played the bass melody for a Michel Colombier composition entitled [...] "The Hope", and performed bass and vocals {{on one of his}} own compositions, entitled [...] "Las Olas". Other recordings included Joni Mitchell's Hejira album and a solo album by Al Di Meola, both released in 1976. Near the end of his career, he worked with guitarist Mike Stern, guitarist Bireli Lagrene, and drummer Brian Melvin.|$|R
5000|$|Following Music Tapes For Clouds and Tornadoes, {{the band}} {{began work on}} a {{tripartite}} [...] "Third Imaginary Symphony", announcing that [...] "Mary's Voice" [...] {{would be the first}} of the three albums. The album was preceded in 2011 by <b>Purim's</b> Shadows (The Dark Tours the World), an EP including the single [...] "Nantasket".The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.Merge released Mary's Voice on September 4, 2012. According to Koster, the album was written and recorded in a carnival tent. Koster brought a larger version of said tent, the Traveling Imaginary, on the road for performances beginning in the winter of 2012-2013. The Traveling Imaginary {{is said to be the}} first incarnation of a series of larger-scale Music Tapes projects undertaken by the Orbiting Human Circus, a newly official artistic foundation led by Koster as Artistic Director.|$|R
5000|$|The B-side of {{the album}} has only one track which {{consists}} of three different pieces of music. Probably they have been recorded without breaks {{and this is the}} main reason why they are not separated on three individual tracks; the bass lines skilfully link them together as well. The first seven minutes of the track consist of an improvised introduction featuring Corea, Farrell and Clarke, slow-paced and feeling akin to a Chinese landscape painting. As this section closes the piece moves into [...] "Sometime Ago". It is a Latin-flavored song with <b>Purim's</b> vocals and Farrell soloing on flute. After that song, Farrell switches to soprano saxophone and the band plays [...] "La Fiesta", one of Corea's jazz standards. Corea has written that most Spanish songs deal with matters such as misery or torture but [...] "La Fiesta", however, is about celebration. The song is an instrumental piece that relies on flamenco modes.|$|R
25|$|The Book of Esther (Hebrew אסתר) is read in all Jewish {{communities}} on <b>Purim</b> (us. Feb/March). The public reading is done twice, {{on the evening}} of <b>Purim</b> and once again the next morning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Purim</b> {{is celebrated}} {{annually}} {{according to the}} Hebrew calendar on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar (and on Adar II in Hebrew leap years that take place every 2 to 3 years), the day following {{the victory of the}} Jews over their enemies. In cities that were protected by a surrounding wall {{at the time of the}} Biblical Joshua, <b>Purim</b> is instead celebrated on the 15th of the month of Adar on what is known as Shushan <b>Purim,</b> since fighting in the walled city of Shushan continued through the 14th day of Adar. Today, only Jerusalem and a few other cities celebrate <b>Purim</b> on the 15th of Adar.|$|E
25|$|Shushan <b>Purim</b> {{falls on}} Adar 15 {{and is the}} day on which Jews in Jerusalem {{celebrate}} <b>Purim.</b> The day is also universally observed by omitting the Tachanun prayer and having a more elaborate meal than on ordinary days.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Corea took a {{profound}} stylistic turn from avant garde playing to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz elements with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American musical styles more than on rock music. On {{their first two}} records, Return to Forever featured Flora <b>Purim's</b> vocals, Corea's Fender Rhodes electric piano, Joe Farrell's flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums and percussion, with Stanley Clarke rounding up the group on acoustic bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded upon the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more hard-edged rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by Corea's admiration for Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and the best selling Romantic Warrior.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Lynn began a {{professional}} singing career when she joined singer/musician George Duke and his band for his tour. During this time, The George Duke Band consisted of George Duke, Josie James, Sheila E., Napoleon Murphy Brock, Charles Foster Johnson, Byron Miller, and Leon [...] "Ndugu" [...] Chancler. In 1978, Lynn contributed background vocals on the title-track album [...] "No One Home" [...] by Argentine composer/pianist Lalo Schifrin. In the same year, she contributed background vocals along with The George Duke Band on Flora <b>Purim's</b> album Carry On. In 1979, Lynn contributed background vocals on the songs [...] "Summer Breezin'" [...] and [...] "I Need You Now", which were featured on George Duke's album A Brazilian Love Affair. In mid-1979, Lynn became the featured vocalist on the single [...] "I Want You for Myself", which was released on George Duke's album Master of the Game. The single charted at number 23 on Billboard's Hot R chart and on the Hot Dance Club Songs' chart. In the same year, Lynn began providing background vocals for singer Patrice Rushen, whom she met during the recording sessions with Lalo Schifrin. The songs were featured on Rushen's hit album Pizzazz.|$|R
25|$|<b>Purim</b> {{was born}} in Rio de Janeiro to Jewish parents who were both {{classical}} musicians: her father Naum <b>Purim</b> played violin and her mother Rachel Vaisberg was a pianist. Flora discovered American jazz when her mother played it while her husband {{was out of the}} house.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish Community of Hebron has celebrated two {{historic}} Purims, {{both from}} the Ottoman period. One is called Window <b>Purim,</b> or <b>Purim</b> Taka, in which the community was saved when a bag of money mysteriously appeared in a window, enabling them to pay off an extortion fee to the Ottoman Pasha. Many record the date being the 14th of the month, which corresponds to Purim's date of the 14th of Adar. The other was called The <b>Purim</b> of Ibrahim Pasha, in which the community was saved during a battle.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in New York in 1967, <b>Purim</b> and Moreira became {{immersed}} in the emerging Electric Jazz. They toured Europe with Stan Getz and Gil Evans. In 1972, alongside Stanley Clarke and Joe Farrell, they were, {{for the first two}} albums, members of Chick Corea's fusion band Return to Forever, which released first a self-titled album, Return to Forever, in 1972, followed the same year as Light as a Feather; both received glowing reviews. In 1973, <b>Purim</b> released her first solo album in the United States, titled Butterfly Dreams. It was well received, and soon after she was chosen by the Down Beat reader's poll {{as one of the top}} five jazz singers. <b>Purim</b> also worked with Carlos Santana and Mickey Hart at outdoor festivals and on jazz and classical albums through the 1970s. In the early 1970s, <b>Purim</b> was arrested and briefly incarcerated for cocaine possession.|$|E
25|$|The Cave of the Patriarchs {{massacre}} {{took place}} during <b>Purim</b> of 1994.|$|E
25|$|<b>Purim</b> {{began her}} career in Brazil during the early 1960s. During this period, she made a recording, {{entitled}} Flora e M.P.M., in which she sang bossa nova standards of the day by Carlos Lyra and Roberto Menescal. Later in the 1960s, <b>Purim</b> was lead singer for the Quarteto Novo, led by Hermeto Pascoal and Airto Moreira.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there is}} debate {{as to whether}} {{outlying}} neighborhoods of Jerusalem are obliged to observe <b>Purim</b> on the 14th or 15th of Adar. Further doubts have arisen as to whether other cities were sufficiently walled in Joshua's era. It is therefore customary in certain towns including Hebron, Safed, Tiberias, Acre, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Beersheva, Beit She'an, Beit Shemesh, Gaza, Gush Halav, Haifa, Jaffa, Lod, Ramlah and Shechem to celebrate <b>Purim</b> on the 14th and hold an additional megillah reading on the 15th with no blessings. In the diaspora, Jews in Baghdad, Damascus, Prague, and elsewhere celebrate <b>Purim</b> on the 14th and hold an additional megillah reading on the 15th with no blessings. Since today we are not sure where the walled cities from Joshua's time are, the only city that currently celebrates only Shushan <b>Purim</b> is Jerusalem; however, Rabbi Yoel Elizur has written that residents of Bet El and Mevo Choron should observe only the 15th, like Jerusalem.|$|E
