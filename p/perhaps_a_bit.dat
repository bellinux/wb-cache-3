500|$|According to Yorke, Radiohead {{hoped to}} achieve an [...] "atmosphere that's <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{shocking}} when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds." [...] They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. The exploratory approach was summarised by Jonny Greenwood as [...] "when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it." [...] One reviewer characterised OK Computer as sounding like [...] "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".|$|E
500|$|Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff's {{appearance}} in the film. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff's back (and thighs, and calves) magnified exponentially is <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> creepy. Like the movie, it's all in good fun." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com, who gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, wrote that Hasselhoff [...] "must have a great sense of humor." [...] Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff's role [...] "the best movie cameo I've seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions of a child who {{wanted to go to the}} city. The vision is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E

500|$|This was a {{stressful}} time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints. The South Africans {{were determined to}} intimidate the UN forces, and SWAPO casualties occurred {{in the immediate vicinity}} of several checkpoints. The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints, pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered. The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out-gunned. Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points, the operation was a political success. Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson, commander of the British contingent, said that [...] "the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up to a bunch of South African bullies". Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the [...] "training standards of the Australian Army and <b>perhaps,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of good luck". The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks.|$|E
500|$|The Heliand, an Old Saxon {{adaptation}} of the New Testament from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting {{on the shoulder of}} Christ. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says [...] "In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, but right on his shoulder, the Heliand author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> embarrassed that the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who want to return to the old religion's symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers".|$|E

2500|$|The early 1990s saw the {{emergence}} of The Healy Flute Company as {{a major player in}} fife manufacture. Skip Healy is a champion fife player and well-known Irish fluter from Rhode Island. His fifes are two-piece, six or ten hole instruments with a Boehm style bore (cylindrical foot and truncated parabolic head) and huge tone holes.

The Healy also offers a bit more dynamic control than the McDonagh, though <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> less volume when pushed to the extreme.|$|E
2500|$|Boam {{lived in}} the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Paula, a {{photographer}} and daughter of a Paramount Pictures vice president. They had three children, Tessa, Mia, and Dashiell. USA Today described Boam as [...] "low-key", and The New York Times called him [...] "a polite, soft-spoken family man {{without a trace of}} the frenzied energy of his films." [...] Film critic Christopher Hicks said that Boam could be unusually candid, but that [...] "Boam is simply Boam [...] a reclusive writer rather than a celebrity worried about his image. And {{what you see is what}} you get, if <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> outspoken and opinionated." [...] He died on January 24, 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Dinky offerings at {{this time}} were striking, but {{due to the lack}} of much competition, {{development}} of new models was <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> slow at least until July 1956, when Mettoy introduced a rival line of models under the Corgi brand name. The most obvious difference was the addition of clear plastic window glazing. While Corgi Toys called their vehicles, [...] "The Ones With Windows", Meccano Ltd responded by updating the Dinky Toys range and the models from both companies quickly became more and more sophisticated featuring such things as working suspension, [...] "fingertip steering", detailed interiors, and jewelled headlights. The first model to have jewelled headlights was the no. 196 Holden Special sedan made from 1963-1969.|$|E

None of the diverse roles she has done to date would have suggested her for this part, but this gutsy performance will put her much more prominently on the map." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} rotation, the {{squadron}} {{was involved in}} a wide variety of tasks. The first task was to lead [...] "Operation Safe Passage". This required the squadron members (supported by British signallers) to work as infantry and man border and internal assembly points. At the time these were the only military units that could be re-deployed quickly to northern Namibia. The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) combatants. A total of nine assembly points were established with 10 soldiers and five military observers at each. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; and in effect from this date hostilities largely ceased. Over this period of about three weeks it has been estimated that 251 PLAN combatants were killed for the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other Security Forces. The fact that the Australian soldiers survived this operation without casualty was said to be a tribute to the 'training standards of the Australian Army and <b>perhaps,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of good luck'.|$|E
