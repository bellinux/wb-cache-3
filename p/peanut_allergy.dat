5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, {{the parents}} of a child sued the District alleging failure to make {{accommodations}} for their child due to the child's severe <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy.</b> The Principal of the involved school sent home notices to parents of children in the impacted child's class to stop sending peanuts to school. The suit was settled in 2013 with the terms not made public.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} to eat rice to {{the last}} grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, {{and it is not}} customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, try to move all dishes back to the same position they were {{at the start of the}} meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host. However, this can be set aside for a diner with allergies such as a <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy,</b> or a religious prohibition against certain foods like pork.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 {{study found}} that peanut {{consumption}} by pregnant women without <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> {{was associated with a}} decreased likelihood that their children would develop <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies.</b> A 2003 study found no link to maternal exposure to peanuts during pregnancy or during breast-feeding.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} food allergy in the US {{population}} is a sensitivity to crustacea. Although <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> {{are notorious for}} their severity, <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> are not the most common food allergy in adults or children. Severe or life-threatening reactions may be triggered by other allergens, and are more common when combined with asthma.|$|R
25|$|Celery {{is among}} {{a small group of}} foods (headed by peanuts) that appear to provoke the most severe {{allergic}} reactions; for people with celery allergy, exposure can cause potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. The allergen {{does not appear to be}} destroyed at cooking temperatures. Celery root—commonly eaten as celeriac, or put into drinks—is known to contain more allergen than the stalk. Seeds contain the highest levels of allergen content. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis may be exacerbated. An allergic reaction also may be triggered by eating foods that have been processed with machines that have previously processed celery, making avoiding such foods difficult. In contrast with <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> being most prevalent in the US, celery allergy is most prevalent in Central Europe. In the European Union, foods that contain or may contain celery, even in trace amounts, must be clearly marked as such.|$|E
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy.</b> Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> are {{a serious}} issue that must be {{monitored}} and treated effectively to avoid severe adverse effects and death. In the last decade, their incidence has increased significantly, due to indeterminate factors. Because people typically do not outgrow <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> {{and the effects of}} exposure can be life-threatening, it is important that a cure or management method is developed and refined. Recent research regarding treatment for <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> has focused on the use of immunotherapy, a process aimed at desensitizing children 2 ̆ 7 s immune systems so that they do not reject foods that contain peanuts. Some studies utilizing immunotherapy have provided positive findings, while others show less promising results. Working within the limitations imposed by safety concerns, researchers are seeking to find a reliable treatment that can be utilized in more cases, whether it is through oral, sublingual, or subcutaneous immunotherapy. Since those with <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> are gradually composing a larger percentage of the population, this area of research is relevant and could prove beneficial in improving and saving the lives of many individuals...|$|R

50|$|The {{percentage}} of people with peanut allergies is 0.6% in the United States. In a 2008 study, self-reported incidence of <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> was estimated to affect 1.4% {{of the population of}} the United States, triple the 0.4-0.6% rate found in a 1997 study. In England, an estimated 4,000 people are newly diagnosed with <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> every year; 25,700 having been diagnosed with <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> at some point in their lives. <b>Peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> is one of the most dangerous food allergies, and one of the least likely to be outgrown.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{after the}} {{settlement}} in 1996, Tanox continued to develop Talizumab, not for allergic asthma but for <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy.</b> In 2001-2003, Talizumab entered phase II clinical trials for <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy,</b> and obtained very positive results. Genentech, however, sued Tanox, arguing that their contract in 1996 should prevent Tanox from developing any potential competitor drugs to Xolair. Again, the dispute {{rose to the}} court. Although Tanox won the consent in a federal district court, it lost the arbitration that followed, {{and the development of}} Talizumab for <b>peanut</b> <b>allergy</b> was suspended.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} common food allergies is a {{sensitivity}} to peanuts, a member of the bean family. <b>Peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> may be severe, but children with <b>peanut</b> <b>allergies</b> sometimes outgrow them. [...] Tree nuts, including cashews, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, coconuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Sufferers may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or to many different ones. [...] Also, seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, contain oils where protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.|$|R
