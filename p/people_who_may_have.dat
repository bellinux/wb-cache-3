5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E

5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), {{as well as other}} versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Gaius Antonius Hybrida {{was sent}} {{alongside}} Sulla to Macedonia {{to assist in}} the First Mithridatic War in around 87 B.C. After the end of the First Mithridatic War, while Sulla returned to Rome, Hybrida stayed in Macedonia levying contributions for himself. He was later recalled to Rome. First to face criminal charges in 76 B.C. resulting in his expulsion from the Senate, and then again in 63 B.C. to be elected to the position of Roman Consul and to fight the campaign against Catiline. From here he returned to Macedonia where he began incurring into the territory of Lower and Upper Moesia. He was to be attacked and defeated twice during this time, first by the Dardanians in an unknown location and then second near Histria by a coalition of Bastarnian and Scythian <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been under the command of the Dacian king Burebista.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{modern humans}} inhabiting Spain {{are believed to}} <b>have</b> been Neolithic <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000-40,000 years ago. In more recent times the Iberians {{are believed to have}} arrived or developed in the region between the 4th millennium BC and the 3rd millennium BC, initially settling along the Mediterranean coast.Celts settled in Spain during the Iron Age. Some of those tribes in North-central Spain, which had cultural contact with the Iberians, are called Celtiberians. In addition, a group known as the Tartessians and later Turdetanians inhabited southwestern Spain and who are believed to have developed a separate civilization of Phoenician influence. The seafaring Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians successively founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast {{over a period of several}} centuries. The Second Punic War between the Carthaginians and Romans was fought mainly in what is now Spain and Portugal.|$|R

25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E
500|$|RCA Records CEO Peter Edge {{spoke to}} Billboard on which two {{specific}} groups {{they want the}} album to appeal to, [...] "By the time the album is available, Usher's collective audience will {{have had a chance}} to really sample a number of songs from the album [...] the end result will be an Usher album that appeals to his earliest fans, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> never listened to or owned an Usher album before." [...] Prior to the album's release, Usher was put under the management of Grace Miguel—whom he is in a relationship with—replacing Randy Phillips, who managed Usher for a short period after he split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton for a second time, in 2008.

500|$|Her second studio album, One of the Boys, was {{released}} in June 2008. The pop-rock album was composed {{over a period of}} five years. The lead single, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", was co-written by Perry with Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cathy Dennis, and alludes to bisexuality. Perry was the sole writer of [...] "Thinking of You", [...] "Mannequin", and the album's title track. The songs [...] "Mannequin" [...] and [...] "Lost" [...] have themes of determination and self-belief. The track [...] "Ur So Gay" [...] opens with the lyrics [...] "I hope you hang yourself with your H scarf," [...] which BBC critic Lizzie Ennever believed was Perry's response to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> [...] "wronged her in the past". During the recording process of the album, Perry had written the songs [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] and [...] "Long Shot" [...] with Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, but decided not to include them on the final track list. They were later recorded by American singer Kelly Clarkson for her album All I Ever Wanted (2009).

500|$|Potts devotes several {{pages to}} a fairly {{detailed}} {{criticism of the}} evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies that existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been influenced by the}} more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment [...] "I would know by what means any Priest can maintaine this point of Evidence". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with [...] "foure black things... not like men in the face", with the comment that [...] "The Seminarie [...] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [...] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [...] had a very good face, and was a proper man." ...|$|E

2500|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that sign}} languages are somehow dependent on spoken languages: {{that they are}} spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people.

50|$|However, {{this may}} be a folk {{etymology}} as there were other early temples in different centres with the same name. The monk Zhidun (or Chih Tun) (314-366), who was a famous propagator of Buddhism in the southern capital is recorded as having discussions with Fenghui at the Baima si (Pai ma) monastery in Jiankang (previously Jianye), the capital of the Eastern Jin (317-420). There was also a Baima si at Xiangyang where Daoan and his disciples stayed c. 365. To further complicate the search for the origin of the name, there were peoples known as the 'White Horse Qiang' and 'Di' who lived in the 'White Horse Valley' on {{the upper reaches of the}} Min River, which flows south from the Min Mountains near the town of Zhangla (Chang-la: 32.50° N, 103.40° E) and there are still people calling themselves the 'White Horse Di' living there. It is possible, but unprovable, that the name Baima derived from some of these <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been influenced by Buddhism at an early period, rather than from literal white horse(s) carrying scriptures.|$|R
