50|$|HVDC {{electrodes}} {{are used}} in most bipolar HVDC transmission systems {{as a means to}} improve the reliability of the entire system. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a <b>pole</b> <b>fault</b> will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service. The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, and the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an anode or cathode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of China's ultra {{high-voltage}} (UHV) construction, Henan UHV power grid is the important part. Summer great load mode of Henan power gird is chosen as the typical method. In the background of completing Nanyang UHV extension project, based on single pole running and double pole running of Hami-Zhengzhou UHVDC project respectively, it is simulated and analyzed. The results indicate that power grid cannot maintain stability when single <b>pole</b> block <b>fault</b> or double <b>pole</b> block <b>fault</b> occurs.

To meet the objective the set of measurements were performed on hydropower generating unit, using typical instrumentation like voltage analyzer for three-phase electrical networks, laser tachometer kit, vibration measurement equipment, air gap measuring system etc. The suggested framework states that electric voltage quality is affected by mechanical faults of power generator like rotor air gap eccentricity and stator <b>poles</b> <b>faults,</b> rotor and stator vibration characteristics and unbalance. The voltage characteristics were analyzed based on every generator pole. The proposed framework is beneficial for diagnosis of hydropower units since it relates electrical and mechanical analysis and provides example of data acquisition program suitable for further investigation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{simulation model}} of real network with various neutral earthing methods when a single <b>pole</b> earth <b>fault</b> occurs. Model was made using Matlab. The {{aim of the}} paper is to analyse values of the currents and of the temporary overvoltages with power frequency {{in case of a}} single <b>pole</b> earth <b>fault.</b> The currents of single phase to ground faults depend (along with the neutral earthing method) mostly on the earth capacitances of the overhead lines or cables connected to the network. A comparison of the network with a large number of long cables and network with mostly overhead lines was made with the purpose to determine their influence. With the intention to control results given by simulation models the mathematical model was created as well. The comparison of the simulation model results and calculated values show match.

40|$|Protecting {{a future}} HVDC network from short circuit DC faults is {{presently}} expected to require extensive imple- mentation of fast HVDC circuit breakers, allowing for rapid fault isolation. The requirement for circuit breakers may, however, be reduced or removed {{depending on the}} protection methodology, resulting in a slower post-fault recovery. The expected fault response and the subsequent network recovery {{is dependent on the}} circuit breaker, network, and converter configurations. This paper examines a low speed protection methodology for a symmetrical monopolar HVDC system, a configuration which requires pole to pole balancing following a <b>pole</b> to ground <b>fault.</b> The fault clearance and network recovery timings are therefore evaluated for both pole to pole and <b>pole</b> to ground <b>faults</b> on several case study networks...|$|R
30|$|All {{simulations}} {{were performed}} in PSCAD/EMTDC with a simulation time step of 10  μs and the fault was applied when t =  2.5  s in each simulation case. In the analysis, single <b>pole</b> to ground <b>faults</b> (negative <b>pole</b> to ground, for illustration purpose negative pole voltage {{is measured by}} keeping the reference probe {{on the ground and}} tip on the negative pole so that a fault shows a drop in voltage) were considered, because independent protection design for each pole is expected to be common in DC grid protection [25] and the <b>pole</b> to ground <b>faults</b> are considered as significantly more frequent [26]. The impact of the signal processing circuit used for capturing peak dv/dt was also taken in to account. All voltages are measured with respect to the ground.|$|R
30|$|As {{seen from}} Table  6, {{for the single}} <b>pole</b> to earth <b>faults</b> or the pole-pole faults with {{different}} fault locations and different fault ground resistances, although the fault resistance has a negative influence on the transient energy value, the proposed method can still identify these faults, {{and the results are}} all correct.|$|R

A general purpose motor control contactor may {{be suitable for}} heavy starting duty on large motors; so-called [...] "definite purpose" [...] contactors are carefully adapted to such applications as air-conditioning compressor motor starting. North American and European ratings for contactors follow different philosophies, with North American general purpose machine tool contactors generally emphasizing simplicity of application while definite purpose and European rating philosophy emphasizes design for the intended life cycle of the application.|$|R
30|$|Conversely, in {{the case}} of a PTG or a PTN fault, the method {{considering}} the characteristics in Sect.  2.2 is applied. Although a traveling wave by a PTG or PTN fault spreads to both sides, it is mostly disturbed by branches connected to the <b>faulted</b> <b>pole.</b> Naturally, a larger number of #l* exists in the side of the fault section with #l*max as the center when compared to the opposite side. Thus, the exact fault section is identified by comparing the numbers of #l* on both sides under a PTG or PTN fault.|$|R
30|$|Because of the {{coupling}} influence, the transient {{voltage and current}} can also be detected on the normal line. As shown in Fig.  9 and Table  2, the transient voltage and current on two ends of the positive pole line rise at fault initial stage for a fault at F 2, but the transient energies detected {{on both ends of}} the line don’t exceed the fixed threshold, thus the protection units at two ends will not operate. Therefore, through setting a fixed threshold, a single <b>pole</b> to earth <b>fault</b> has no effect on the fault identification of the normal line.|$|R

30|$|Voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) based {{high voltage}} direct current (HVDC) transmission is most {{suited for the}} wind farm as it allows flexibility for reactive power control in multi-terminal transmission lines and transmits low power over smaller distance. In this work, a novel method has been proposed to detect the fault, identify the section of faults and classify the <b>pole</b> of the <b>fault</b> in DC transmission lines fed from onshore wind farm. In the proposed scheme, voltage signal from rectifier end terminal is extracted with sampling frequency of 1 kHz given as input to the detection, classification and section discrimination module. In this work, severe AC faults are also considered for section discrimination. Proposed method uses fuzzy inference system (FIS) to carry out all relaying task. The reach setting of the relay is 99.9 % of the transmission line. Besides, the protection covers and discriminates the grounding fault with fault resistance up to 300  Ω. Considering {{the results of the}} proposed method it can be used effectively in real power network.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{suspensions}} (MS) {{satisfy the}} long life and low loss conditions demanded by satellite and ISS based flywheels used for Energy Storage and Attitude Control (ACESE) service. This paper summarizes {{the development of}} a novel MS that improves reliability via fault tolerant operation. Specifically, flux coupling between poles of a homopolar magnetic bearing is shown to deliver desired forces even after termination of coil currents to a subset of failed poles. Linear, coordinate decoupled force-voltage relations are also maintained before and after failure by bias linearization. Current distribution matrices (CDM) which adjust the currents and fluxes following a pole set failure are determined for many <b>faulted</b> <b>pole</b> combinations. The CDM s and the system responses are obtained utilizing 1 D magnetic circuit models with fringe and leakage factors derived from detailed, 3 D, finite element field models. Reliability results are presented vs. detection/correction delay time and individual power amplifier reliability for 4, 6, and 7 pole configurations. Reliability is shown for two success criteria, i. e. (a) no catcher bearing contact following pole failures and (b) re-levitation off of the catcher bearings following pole failures. An advantage of the method presented over other redundant operation approaches is a significantly reduced requirement for backup hardware such as additional actuators or power amplifiers...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{required}} operation speed for protection of meshed voltage source converter (VSC) high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids, traveling wave-based algorithms {{operating in the}} sub-millisecond time-frame must be used. The domain in which these algorithms operate, i. e., modal or phase, determines their performance in fault discrimination, fault type classification and <b>faulted</b> <b>pole</b> selection. In the recent literature, high-speed algorithms have been proposed for various VSC HVDC grid configurations and transmission line types; yet the choice of domain has received insufficient attention. This paper offers recommendations for the choice of domain for protection algorithm design of HVDC overhead line or cable systems in symmetric monopolar and bipolar configurations. The theoretical analysis of this paper, {{which is based on}} fundamental wave propagation theory, indicates that the most computationally efficient domain for protection algorithms for cable and overhead line systems are the phase and modal, respectively. Furthermore, the paper provides comprehensive guidelines to construct detection functions for both configurations and discusses the errors introduced by approximations. Finally, study results from a bipolar overhead line test system demonstrate the advantages of modal over phase domain for fast fault discrimination and classification and illustrate practical problems associated with non-ideal detection functions. status: submitte...|$|R
30|$|In [35], line faults {{component}} of current network with voltage {{at the source}} point {{has been used for}} identification of section at low and high frequency based on impedance. The time for fault detection is more than 20 ms, sampling frequency is 10 kHz and fault resistance used is 200  Ω. In [36], a method has been proposed in which the input signals uses five data window having rms three phase input voltages and time averaged DC voltage and current of DC transmission lines with sampling frequency of 4 kHz and fault resistance identification is limited below 100  Ω and average time for responding is 3 / 4 of a cycle. In [37], a method is selected based on natural frequency of travelling wave for fault section detection. This scheme based on distance and reflection coefficient of current signal with high sampling frequency 100 kHz. In [38], a method for two terminal system based on wavelet coefficients of current and rate of change of current has been chosen for detection of fault. In this method high fault resistance is not taken and sampling frequency is 10 kHz. In [39], a section identification method has been proposed based on transverse differential current using the ratio of difference and sum current of pole 1 (P 1) and pole 2 (P 2). Besides the fault resistance is limited up to 50  Ω. In [40], a method based on current signal using discrete wavelet coefficients of signal for different levels has been proposed to detect the fault which has high sampling frequency of 10 kHz.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a new Modular Multi-Level Converter (MMC) on a Line Commutated Converter (LCC) in the same AC-grid, {{representing}} the future system of NordLink and NorNed is investigated. This multi-infeed HVDC system is compared against today's LCC stand alone system. A method for detecting commutation failure is proposed. The commutation failure immunity index is 36 % and 28 % respectively. The result indicate that the MMC-link hence mitigates {{the weakness of the}} LCC-link, and makes the LCC inverter less prone to commutation failure. The multi-infeed HVDC system is analysed in both steady and transient state. The MMC is able to control the active and reactive power, and enhances AC voltage regulation. Existing voltage supporting equipment can thus be utilized for a more continuous voltage regulation when the new MMC-link is connected, and to minimize losses. Single and three phase to ground faults are applied. The results indicate that a LCC inverter in weak AC grids may suffer from commutation failure. The MMC is able to ride through relatively severe AC faults. The results indicates that the multi-infeed system improves the performance when AC faults are applied as compared the existing LCC stand alone system. The MMC-link is able to mitigate the impact of AC faults, thus helping the LCC-link recover faster. The coupling effect between AC and DC overhead lines sharing the same Rights-of-Way is investigated, and a single <b>pole</b> to ground <b>fault</b> is applied. Induced DC currents into AC lines are detected. The peak rms neutral current in the AC lines is found to be 1000 A for fault location close to MMC inverter. Two mitigation methods are proposed. First, an optimal displacement of the middle AC tower is found to be 45 meters apart from the DC tower, and leads to a reduction of 22. 3 % (777 A). Second, transposition of the AC-lines efficiently reduced the coupling effect, as it averages the unbalance between the three phases. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} to {{complete}} {{the description of the}} special mapping method which theoretical basis and principles were published in [Seminsky, 2014]. With reference to data on the Ulirba site located in Priolkhonie (Western Pribaikalie), the content of special mapping is reviewed in detail. The method is based on paragenetical analysis of abundant jointing which specific feature is the lack of any visible displacement indicators. There are three stages in the special mapping method (Fig. 3) as follows: Stage I: Preparation and analysis of previously published data on the regional fault structure (Fig. 1, А–Г), establishment of a networks of stations to conduct structural geological monitoring and mass measurements of joints, re­cord of rock data (Fig. 2, А), general state of the fault network (Fig. 1, Д–З), fracture density (Fig. 2, Б) and, if any, structures of the above-jointing level (Fig. 1, Е, З; Fig. 2, А). Stage II is aimed at processing of field data and includes activities in four groups (II. 1 –II. 4) as follows: Group II. 1 : construction of circle diagrams, specification of characteristics of joint systems and their typical scatters (Fig. 4, А), identification of simple (generally tipple) paragenesises, and determination of dynamic settings of their formation (translocal rank) (Table 1), evaluation of densities and complexity of the joint networks, analysis of their spacial patterns within the site under mapping, and identification of the most intensively destructed zones in the rock massif (Fig. 2, Б–В). Group II. 2 : comparison of jointing diagrams with reference ones showing joint poles (Fig. 4, Б–В; Е–З; Л–Н), and, in case of their satisfactory correlation, making a conclusion of potential formation of a specific joint pattern in the local zone of strike-slip, normal faulting or reverse faulting (Fig. 4,  Г–Д, И–К, О–П; Fig. 5; Fig. 7, Б), and determination of relative age relationships between such zones on the basis analysis of the scatter of joint systems, shearing angles and other relevant information. Group II. 3 : construction of a circle diagram for the specified mapping site with local <b>fault</b> <b>poles</b> (Fig. 8, Б), identification of conjugated systems and dynamic settings of their formation (Fig. 2), plotting the information onto the schematic map of the location under study, and marking the transregional fault zones (Fig. 7, В–К) with observation sites showing similar settings and paragenesises of local faults. Group II. 4 : comparison between diagrams of <b>fault</b> <b>poles</b> of local ranks with reference patterns selected according to the availability of conjugated pairs of fractures (Fig. 9, Б–Г); based on the above comparison, decision making on potential formation of a paragenesis of local faults in the strike-slip, normal and reserve/thrust fault zones (Fig. 9, Д–Ж), and delineation of boundaries of such zones in the schematic map by connecting the observation sites with similar solutions (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Stage III is aimed at interpreting and includes comprehensive analyses of mapping results and priori information, construction of a final scheme of the fault zones showing their subordination by ranks (Fig. 7, О) and schemes of fault zones for various structure formation stages, showing types of faults and specific features of their internal patterns, i. e. definition of the peripheral sub-zone, sub-zones of fractures of the 2 nd order and, if established, the sub-zone of the major fault (Fig. 7, Л–Н). Prospects of the special mapping method can be highlighted upon its comparison with the conventional structural methods applied in studies of faults. On the one side, the method requires time-consuming mass mea­surements and special processing of 'dumb' joints; on the other side, it provides for analyses of abundant jointing data, ensures a high level of detail in mapping of patterns of fault zones, reveals rank subordination of faults and helps to determine other specific features of fractures and faults. Hence, a conventional study of sites with evident tectonics can be based on traditional structural methods, while the special mapping method is recommendable as an additional means of analyses providing information on specific elements of the fault patterns, including establishment of the internal zoning of faults, hierarchy of dynamic settings of faulting etc. In cases when direct observation of faults is limited as the study area is poorly outcropped, or in case of specialized studies such as drilling of wells, the special mapping method can be most useful when applied in its full scope. With account of its specific features, this method is a promising tool for solution of theoretical problems related to studies of divisibility of the Earth's crust into zones and blocks and researches of regularities in development of fault zones in space and time. It can be useful for application-oriented surveys in geology, ore geology, engineering geology and hydrogeology that require detailed mapping of fault zones controlling many associated processes of key importance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} {{properties of}} a bipolar configuration {{composed of a}} Line-Commutated Converter (LCC) and a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) in a multilevel topology (MMC) are investigated. Simulation models {{are made in the}} PSCAD software in order to represent the two bipolar HVDC-links between Norway and Denmark, named Skagerrak 3 and Skagerrak 4. The topology combines two fundamentally different converter technologies with an intricate switching scheme for the function of power reversal. The objective of this thesis is to validate the three simulation models; a monopolar LCC model, a monopolar Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) model, and an LCC-MMC model in a bipolar configuration. By investigating the interaction of the combined LCC model and MMC model, {{a better understanding of the}} challenges of the bipolar link is achieved. The steady state behaviors of the three systems are as expected based on the theory. The LCC consumes reactive power, and require reactive power compensation and filtering. When combined with the MMC, the MMC is able to provide the reactive power consumption by the system. There is an interaction between the MMC and the passive filters of the LCC, resulting in the need to redesign the filters in the bipolar configuration. Also, the DC voltages in the combined model are found to be divided somewhat unevenly between the HVDC-links. When a three-phase to ground fault is applied to the inverter side of the models, the LCC suffer from failure of commutation. This is due to the reduction in the AC voltage, and is to be expected. A DC chopper is placed at the MMC DC-link and reduces the DC voltage overshoot significantly during the fault. When the LCC and MMC systems are combined, they operate in an independent manner, and as a result, no additional protection arrangements are necessary. A single-phase to ground fault at the inverter side of the models, gives rise to harmonic disturbances due to the unbalance of the fault. The reduction in AC voltage results in failure of commutation at the LCC inverter side. The LCC and MMC systems are still almost unaffected by each other during the fault, and so no additional protection systems are required for the combined model. Finally, a DC <b>pole</b> to ground <b>fault</b> is applied to the three simulation models. The LCC model does not recover from the fault, because of loss of controllability in the PI controllers. There are solutions for this problem, for example anti-windup PI controller. An interesting result is observed when the two models are combined into the bipolar configuration. The MMC is able to support the LCC in such a way that it recovers. DC breakers are required for high voltage and current spikes during the DC fault at the MMC link. The LCC and MMC systems are no longer operating independently, and different protection strategies must be implemented when compared to the monopolar models. </p...|$|R
