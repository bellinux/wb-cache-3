Assuming the use of nuclear explosives with a high portion of total yield from fission, it would produce a combined fallout total similar to the surface burst yield of the Mike shot of Operation Ivy, a 10.4 Megaton device detonated in 1952. The comparison is not quite perfect as, due to its surface burst location, Ivy Mike created a large amount of early fallout contamination. Historical above-ground nuclear weapon tests included 189 megatons of fission yield and caused average global radiation exposure per person peaking at 0.11 mSv/a in 1963, with a 0.007 mSv/a residual in modern times, superimposed upon other sources of exposure, primarily natural background radiation, which averages 2.4 mSv/a globally but varies greatly, such as 6 mSv/a in some high-altitude cities. [...] Any comparison would be influenced by how population dosage is affected by detonation locations, with very remote sites preferred.|$|E

40|$|Comparison {{of energy}} inputs for {{inorganic}} fertilizer and manure based corn production. Can. Agric. Eng. 42 : 009 - 017. Energy inputs {{were calculated for}} grain corn production with data from field experiments utilizing inorganic fertilizer and liquid swine manure as sources of plant nutrients. The calculations utilized energy coefficients taken from the literature and actual application rates of the various input products including seed corn, starter fertilizer and regular inorganic fertilizer, herbicides, fuel for field operations, and grain drying. The results showed that grain corn could be produced successfully by substituting manure for inorganic fertilizer. The energy savings in the manured treatments resulted largely from eliminating the energy in fertilizer manufacture and ranged from 31 to 34 % of the energy input for inorganic fertilizer based grain corn production. Published agricultural statistics were used to extrapolate the results to the entire Mixedwood Plains Ecozone which covers the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River Valley regions of Ontario and Quebec. An estimated upper bound of 4. 6 PJ (1 <b>petajoule</b> = 1015 joules) of energy could be saved annually by substituting livestock manure for inorganic fertilizer {{in the production of}} the entire acreage of grain corn grown in the ecozone.

40|$|Abstract: New Zealand’s {{per capita}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are usually calculated by taking total emissions as reported under the Kyoto Protocol or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and simply dividing by population. However this focuses on emissions associated with production within New Zealand. From {{the point of view}} of individuals, these are not the emissions they control, and hence can mitigate. Individuals can calculate their “carbon footprint” but tools to do this typically focus on a few categories of emissions (mostly electricity, direct fuel use and waste) and emissions footprints are not available for a wide range of households so cannot be used for comparative analysis. This paper explores how the carbon emissions related to the consumption categories of households in New Zealand vary with household characteristics. We use product consumption data from the 2007 Household Economic Survey. Consumption within each category is linked to a carbon intensity multiplier (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of consumption) which is derived from: the official 2007 input–output table of 106 industries produced by Statistics New Zealand; energy data on carbon dioxide per <b>petajoule</b> of fuel in each industry from the Energy Data File; and the Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report both provided by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Previous literature has used similar methods to calculate the incidence of a carbon tax (e. g. Creedy and Sleeman [2006]). This paper uses these methods in order to study which sectors of household expenditure offer the greatest opportunities for mitigation and how these opportunities vary with household characteristics such as income decile, region and household composition...|$|E

40|$|Desiccant cooling {{systems are}} energy efficient, cost effective, and {{environmentally}} safe. They {{are used as}} stand-alone systems or with conventional air-conditioning to improve the indoor air quality {{of all types of}} buildings. In these systems, a desiccant removes moisture from the air, which releases heat and increases the air temperature. The dry air is cooled using either evaporative cooling or the cooling coils of a conventional air conditioner. The absorbed moisture in the desiccant is then removed (the desiccant is regenerated, or brought back to its original dry state) using thermal energy supplied by natural gas, electricity, waste heat, or the sun. Commercially available desiccants include silica gel, activated alumina, natural and synthetic zeolites, lithium chloride, and synthetic polymers. Currently, desiccant cooling and dehumidification are being used successfully in industrial and some commercial applications. The Office of Building Technologies in the U. S.
