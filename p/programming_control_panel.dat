50|$|Print Services for UNIX is {{the name}} {{currently}} given by Microsoft to its support of the Line Printer Daemon protocol (also called LPR, LPD) on Windows NT-based systems. It is installed using the Add/Remove <b>Programs</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> applet. This component allows LPD queues to be supported using the native Windows printing system. It does not provide the lpr, lpq, lprm, or lpc commands.|$|R
50|$|Software can be searched, {{downloaded}} and updated. In addition, UpdateStar is a freeware client {{that can}} be easily installed to inform users about available updates for their individual software setup. It allows downloading, installing and uninstalling the programs from within the client, which acts as an enhancement for the Add/Remove <b>Programs</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> applet (<b>Programs</b> and Features on Windows Vista and above).|$|R

50|$|The MS-DOS Executive file manager/program {{launcher}} {{was replaced}} with the icon-based Program Manager and the list-based File Manager, splitting files and <b>programs.</b> The <b>Control</b> <b>Panel,</b> previously available as a standard-looking applet, was re-modeled after {{the one in the}} classic Mac OS. It centralized system settings, including control over the color scheme of the interface.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1880s Herman Hollerith {{invented the}} concept of storing data in {{machine-readable}} form. Later a <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were <b>programmed</b> by <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in a similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with {{the concept of}} the stored-program computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.|$|R
5000|$|With version 2.0 of 98lite, {{the three}} {{programs}} were merged and combined {{into a single}} program. The IE remover was combined with the components converter, making IE uninstallable and reinstallable with the Add/Remove <b>Programs</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> applet as with the other components; the user could also choose the Windows 95 shell and keep Internet Explorer installed. The user now had three installation options. The [...] "sleek" [...] option allowed the user to install 98lite with the Windows 95 shell like in the original release, or the user could choose [...] "chubby", which used the Windows 98 shell with some Active Desktop features disabled. The final option was [...] "overweight", which installed 98lite with the Windows 98 shell and nothing disabled but Internet Explorer still removed. Version 3.0 added support for Windows 98 Second Edition, an upgraded version of Windows 98 with Internet Explorer 5.0 which made 98lite 1.0 through 2.0 obsolete. The current 4.x line has many improvements, including bugfixes and support for Windows Me.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{flexibility}} offered by these synths, patches cannot be <b>programmed</b> from the <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> Instead, patch editing is performed on a PC (connected via 2 dedicated MIDI ports {{in the case}} of the first generation and USB in the second generation or G2 systems), running editor software bundled with the synths.|$|R
50|$|The System Folder is less {{protected}} {{than the}} OS X system folder, {{in that the}} contents are all viewable and most files and folders are editable. However {{it was possible to}} prevent inexperienced users from accidentally altering the contents by using the Protect System Folder Contents checkbox in the General <b>Controls</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Panel.</b> The Startup and Shut Down <b>programs,</b> Appearance themes, <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> fonts, and extensions, as well as items in the Apple Menu, are controlled by adding or removing items from folders in the System Folder.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 602 Calculating Punch, {{introduced}} in 1946, was an electromechanical calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The 602 was IBM's first machine that did division. (The IBM 601, {{introduced in}} 1931, only multiplied.) Like other IBM calculators, it was <b>programmed</b> using a <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> Input data was read from a punched card, the {{results could be}} punched in the same card or a trailing card.|$|R
50|$|Hildon is an {{application}} framework originally developed for mobile devices (PDAs, mobile phones, etc.) running the Linux operating {{system as well}} as the Symbian operating system. The Symbian variant of Hildon was discontinued with the cancellation of Series 90. It was developed by Nokia for the Maemo operating system and is now a part of GNOME. It focuses on providing a finger-friendly interface. It is primarily a set of GTK+ extensions that provide mobile-device-oriented functionality, but also provides a desktop environment that includes a task navigator for opening and switching between <b>programs,</b> a <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> for user settings, and status bar, task bar and home applets. It is standard on the Maemo platform used by the Nokia Internet Tablets and the Nokia N900 smartphone.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{transistors}} was {{a significant}} departure from the previous IBM calculators of this line. The 608 also used magnetic core memory, but was still <b>programmed</b> using a <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> The main memory of the 608 could store 40 nine-digit numbers, and it had an 18-digit accumulator. In raw speed terms, it could perform 4,500 additions per second, it could multiply two nine-digit numbers, yielding an 18-digit result in 11 milliseconds, and it could divide an 18-digit number by a nine-digit number to produce the nine-digit quotient in 13 milliseconds. The 608 could handle 80 program steps.|$|R
40|$|With {{the coming}} of new modern technologies, {{powerful}} computer setups, great amount of additional equipment and omnipresent high speed internet connection, there are even more users playing computer games. These are not simple turn-based games with insufficient graphical processing, but these games are top modeled and promising unlimited fun. There are many multi player games a user can host for his own chosen friends and I have focused on this not exactly simplest issue. I have summarized possible types of servers and operating systems, outlined security dangers and ways how to protect the server against potential attacks from the outside. I have also developed a manual and <b>programmed</b> a admin <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> for easy management of the hosted game...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} bio gas {{cleaning}} by a PSA method and modernizing of a laboratory unit. Raw bio gas contains many unwanted elements like carbon dioxide mostly which lowers its energy potential then. To extend {{the possibilities of}} usage of bio gas {{it is necessary to}} remove such elements. One of the well-known method for eliminating CO 2 out of the bio gas is the method called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA). This work describes PSA method and compares it with other methods for cleaning the bio gas. In the following part of my work I am introducing the original laboratory PSA unit which is placed in the laboratory of UPI institution for research purposes. The modernization of the method was made by changing the manual valves for electromagnetic ones and there was also designed a new control system unit for two control modes. For manual and for automatic. The essential function is based on remote controlling the valves either by switches or by a <b>program.</b> The electric <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> was created for such required modes. The automated process was <b>controlled</b> by Arduino <b>programming</b> platform which was integrated into the panel. In the case of the next measurement and reading there was created a detailed description for user on how to operate the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> and also the comments for <b>control</b> <b>program</b> of automatization...|$|R
