40|$|AbstractLet G be a graph and let v be a vertex of G. The open {{neighbourhood}} N(v) of v is {{the set of}} all vertices adjacent with v in G, {{while the}} closed neighbourhood of v is N(v) ∪ (v). A <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> a graph G {{is a set of}} vertices whose closed neighbourhoods are pairwise disjoint. Equivalently, a <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> a graph G is a set of vertices whose elements are pairwise at distance at least 3 apart in G. The lower <b>packing</b> number <b>of</b> G, denoted ϱL(G), is the minimum cardinality <b>of</b> a maximal <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G while the (upper) <b>packing</b> number <b>of</b> G, denoted ϱ(G), is the maximum cardinality among all packings of G. An open <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G is a set of vertices whose open neighbourhoods are pairwise disjoint. The lower open <b>packing</b> number <b>of</b> G, denoted ϱL 0 (G), is the minimum cardinality of a maximal open <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> G while the (upper) open <b>packing</b> number <b>of</b> G, denoted ϱ 0 (G), is the maximum cardinality among all open packings of G. We present upper bounds on the packing number and the lower <b>packing</b> number <b>of</b> a tree.

Previously, {{this was the}} only known example <b>of</b> a ‘best’ <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> n circles on a sphere with multiplicity greater than one. We present three new examples: n= 62, 76 and 117. We discuss these and related examples as manifestations of symmetry breaking involving structures we call “rotational toggle hexagons”. Additionally, we present exact data for n= 15, and observe that both the hexagonal <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the plane and the icosahedral <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 12 circles on a sphere arise as limiting cases from toggle hexagons...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{obtained}} <b>packing</b> densities <b>of</b> aneurysms treated with the newly introduced GDC 360 ° coils with <b>packing</b> densities <b>of</b> aneurysms treated with either complex Orbit/Trufill coils or helical GDC 10 coils. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two aneurysms in 20 patients were coiled with GDC 360 ° coils. For each of the 22 aneurysms coiled with GDC 360 ° coils, 2 volume-matched controls treated with either complex Orbit/Trufill coils or helical GDC coils were identified from our data base. The <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> these matched controls was compared with the calculated <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> the 22 aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean aneurysm volume between aneurysms treated with any of the 3 types of coils (P. 9). Mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 22. 1 % of aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils was significantly lower than mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 30. 3 % of aneurysms treated with complex Orbit/Trufill coils (P. 0015). Mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 22. 1 % of aneurysms treated with GDC 360 ° coils was not different from mean <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> 21. 6 % of aneurysms treated with helical GDC 10 coils (P. 81). CONCLUSION: The use of complex-shaped GDC 360 ° coils does not lead to increased packing in comparison with that of helical GDC 10 coils. The use of complex Orbit/Trufill coils results i...|$|R

40|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> unit balls in Euclidean 3 -space is the (simple) graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. One {{of the most basic}} questions on contact graphs is to find the maximum number of edges that a contact graph <b>of</b> a <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> n unit balls can have. In this paper, improving earlier estimates, we prove that the number of touching pairs in {{an arbitrary}} <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> n unit balls in E 3 is always less than 6 n− 0. 926 n 23. Moreover, as a natural extension of the above problem, we propose to study the maximum number of touching triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> n unit balls in Euclidean 3 -space. In particular, we prove that the number of touching triplets (resp., quadruples) in an arbitrary <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> n unit balls in E 3 is at most 2...|$|R

The preponderance of preview work has focused on the microstructural model by the random <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> spherical or two-dimensional elliptical particles, and little is known about three-dimensional ellipsoidal particles. In the present work, a new random <b>packing</b> model <b>of</b> three-dimensional ellipsoidal particles was developed to simulate microstructure of cement-based materials. It was based on a novel numerical algorithm for detecting the contact of ellipsoidal particles. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithm were verified by a visualization <b>of</b> the random <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> monodispersed ellipsoidal particles with rigid boundary conditions. According to these numerical algorithms, microstructural model of cement-based materials was constructed by the random <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> polydispersed ellipsoidal particles, of which sizes satisfy a specific distribution. Finally, applied stereological tools and serial sectioning analysis technique, microstructure of cement pastes, composed of ellipsoidal cement particles, was characterized and compared with that of spherical cement particles...|$|R
