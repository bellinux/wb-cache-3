40|$|A method called Dock'n'Flash was {{developed}} to offer site-specific capture and direct UVA-induced <b>photocoupling</b> of recombinant proteins. The method involves the tagging of recombinant proteins with photoreactive p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa) by genetic engineering. The photoreactive pBpa tag is used for affinity capture of the recombinant protein by beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), which provides hydrogen atoms to be abstracted in the <b>photocoupling</b> process. To exemplify the method, a recombinant, folded, and active N 27 pBpa mutant of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi was produced in E. coli. Insertion of pBpa was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy. A inolecular dynamic simulation, with water as solvent, showed high solvent accessibility of the pBpa benzophenone group in N 27 pBpa-cutinase mutant. The formation of an inclusion complex between the benzophenone group of N 27 pBpa-cutinase and beta-CD was shown, and an apparent K-d of 1. 65 mM was determined using H- 1 NMR. <b>Photocoupling</b> of beta-CD to N 27 pBpa-cutinase in a 1 : 1 ratio, upon UVA irradiation at 360 +/- 20 nm, was shown by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. UVA photoimmobilization of N 27 pBpa-cutinase on quartz slides coated with beta-CD was achieved from liquid or dry films by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF).

In more detail, we have successfully explored the possibility to expand the genetic code of E. coli and introduced the photoreactive UAA p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa), and showed that the mutated scFv antibody could be expressed in E. coli with retained structural and functional properties, as well as binding affinity. The pBpa group was then used for affinity capture of the mutated antibody by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), which provided the hydrogen atoms to be abstracted in the subsequent <b>photocoupling</b> process upon irradiation at 365 nm. The results showed that the pBpa mutated antibody could be site-specifically <b>photocoupled</b> to free and surface (array) immobilized β-CD.

Extensive studies have been carried out in our lab on the covalent immobilization of polymers and graphene using PFPA-functionalized surfaces. Here we show that PAAm-based PFPA surface can be used to efficiently immobilize not only graphene and polymers but also nanomaterials and small molecules. This was accomplished by first silanizing silicon wafers with PFPA-silane followed by attaching a thin film of PAAm by UV radiation. Treating the PAAm surface with N-hydroxysuccinimide-derivatized PFPA (PFPA-NHS) yielded the PAAm-PFPA surface. The functionalized surfaces were characterized by ellipsometry (layer thickness), contact angle (surface tension), and ATR-FTIR. The PAAm surface was further characterized by determining the density of amino groups on the surface. The PAAm-PFPA surfaces were subsequently used to covalently immobilize polymers, nanomaterials, carbohydrates and graphene by a simple procedure of coating the molecules or materials on the PAAm-PFPA surface followed by UV irradiation.

In a murine model of quinolone photoallergy, Langerhans cells are photomodified with a systemically given quinolone upon ultraviolet A irradiation {{of skin and}} thus present photohaptenic moieties to sensitize and restimulate T cells. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the site of peptides/proteins photobound to quinolones and to assess the T cell antigenicity of quinolone-photocoupled peptides using Langerhans cells as photoadduct-presenting cells. On an amino acid composition analysis, lysine was preferentially degraded in bovine serum albumin that was ultraviolet A-conjugated with a representative quinolone ofloxacin. An affinity chromatographic study using a quinolone photoadduct-specific monoclonal antibody as ligand demonstrated preferential <b>photocoupling</b> of ofloxacin with a lysine-containing peptide. CD 4 + T cells were purified from lymph nodes of BALB/c mice sensitized subcutaneously with ofloxacin-photomodified epidermal cells and from those sensitized epicutaneously via barrier-disrupted skin with a major histocompatibility complex class II (I-Ad) -binding, ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide. These immune T cells proliferated in vitro in response to Langerhans cells loaded with class II-binding, lysine-containing peptides when photomodified with ofloxacin. Furthermore, epicutaneous application of the ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide was able to prime mice for subsequent elicitation of photoallergy evoked with systemic ofloxacin and ultraviolet A light.

Our results present UV-induced reactions on insulators {{for the formation of}} all sp 2 -carbon architectures, thereby converging top-down lithography and bottom-up on-surface chemistry into technology.

40|$|Affinity {{proteins}} binding to antibody constant regions {{have proved}} to be invaluable tools in biotechnology. Here, protein engineering was used to expand the repertoire of available immunoglobulin binding proteins via improvement of the binding strength between the widely used staphylococcal protein A-derived Z domain and the important immunoglobulin isotype mouse IgG 1 (mIgG 1). Addressing seven positions in the 58 -residue three-helix bundle Z domain by single or double amino acid substitutions, a total of 170 variants were individually constructed, produced in E. coli and tested for binding to a set of mouse IgG 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The best variant, denoted ZF 5 I corresponding to a Phe to Ile substitution at position 5, showed a typical ten-fold higher affinity than the wild-type as determined by biosensor technology. Eight amino acid positions in the ZF 5 I variant were separately mutated to cysteine for incorporation of a photoactivable maleimide-benzophenone (MBP) group as a probe for site-specific photoconjugation to Fc of mIgG 1, The best <b>photocoupling</b> efficiency to mIgG 1 Fc was seen when the MBP group was coupled to Cys at position 32, resulting in adduct formation to more than 60 % of all heavy chains, with no observable non-selective conjugation to the light chains. A similar coupling yield was obtained for a panel of 19 different mIgG 1 mAbs, indicating a general characteristic. To exemplify functionalization of a mIgG 1 antibody via site-specific biotinylation, the ZF 5 I-Q 32 C-MBP protein was first biotinylated using an amine reactive reagent and subsequently photoconjugated to an anti-human interferon-gamma mIgG 1 mAb.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in the possible existence of the N*(1685) narrow nucleon resonance, as predicted by the chiral soliton model. Several eta photoproduction experiments have been performed that rely on extracting neutron observables from deuteron target data. These have shown some evidence of narrow structure, however, no structure was observed in cross section measurements on the proton channel. Within the A 2 collaboration at the MAMI accelerator in Mainz, Germany, a more detailed study has been undertaken using eta photoproduction on a liquid hydrogen target, and is the subject for this thesis. The study utilised the high resolution and high precision possible with the A 2 detector setup, in an attempt to overcome the predicted low <b>photocoupling</b> between the N*(1685) and the proton. The MAMI electron beam was used to produce bremsstrahlung photons, the energies of which are determined by detecting the recoil electrons in the Glasgow-Mainz Tagged Photon Spectrometer. The reaction products from the interaction of the photon beam and liquid hydrogen were detected by the Crystal Ball and TAPS calorimeters. The gamma proton to eta proton reaction channel was identified via the 3 neutral pion decay branch. The reaction cross section was measured between E = 707 and 1477 MeV. Both differential and total cross sections have been presented with a particular emphasis on the centre of mass energy range around 1685 MeV. The peak structure seen on the neutron channel is not observed {{in the case of the}} proton. However, a dip in the cross section is observed, which is more prominent at forward polar angles. The leading models are not fully able to reproduce the data in this energy region. As such, given the high energy resolution of the measurement the results can be used to constrain future models and in doing so aid the understanding of the nucleon's resonance spectrum.
