5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} the immigration of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in the}} 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and <b>pepper</b> industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established gambier and <b>pepper</b> plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose {{to become one of}} the state's major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went up during the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide gambier prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into <b>pepper</b> and opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.|$|E
5|$|Gambier and <b>pepper</b> farming {{were mainly}} {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and <b>pepper</b> plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and <b>pepper</b> trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and <b>pepper</b> plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many <b>pepper</b> plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E

Some varieties mature and stay green and sometimes bell <b>peppers</b> are just picked early and sold as green <b>peppers.</b> As you 2 ̆ 7 ve probably noticed, bell <b>peppers</b> become sweeter as they mature, so red <b>peppers</b> will be sweeter than green.

5000|$|As with pickled cucumbers, {{there are}} {{multiple}} ways of pickling <b>peppers.</b> The most common is as above, pickling in an acidic brine and canned; next is quick-pickled or refrigerator pickling, which skips the canning step and requires the <b>peppers</b> to be stored in the refrigerator as mentioned above. For lacto-fermented pickled <b>peppers,</b> vinegar is omitted from the salty brine; instead, Lactobacilli convert the sugars of the <b>peppers</b> into lactic acid. Such fermented pickled <b>peppers</b> are often used to make hot sauce. At less than 3% acid, fermented pickled <b>peppers</b> are highly perishable if not canned. Sweet pickling with sugar and acid yields [...] "candied" [...] <b>peppers,</b> as for the jalapeños known as [...] "cowboy candy". Pickled <b>peppers</b> are often made into relishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} colors of bell <b>peppers</b> are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple <b>peppers</b> can be seen, {{depending}} on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell <b>peppers</b> are simply ripened green <b>peppers,</b> although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. Green <b>peppers</b> are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange <b>peppers,</b> with red bell <b>peppers</b> being the sweetest. The taste of ripe <b>peppers</b> can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and after-ripened in storage is less sweet.|$|R

5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, many Kangchu {{abandoned}} their plantations in Singapore as gambier produce declined due to over farming of the soil, {{and began to}} establish new gambier and <b>pepper</b> plantations in neighbouring Johor. Nevertheless, many of these Kangchu settled down as merchants in Singapore and managed the gambier and <b>pepper</b> farms by proxy, mainly through the liaison body of the Ngee Heng Kongsi which had members in Singapore and Johor. Some of these merchants purchased the property rights of gambier and <b>pepper</b> farms from the Kangchu in Johor, who would then assume managerial tasks to ensure the smooth operation of the plantation and the settlement.|$|E

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black <b>pepper,</b> cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that <b>pepper</b> for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of <b>pepper</b> and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While <b>pepper</b> was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced <b>pepper</b> in late medieval north French cooking, long <b>pepper,</b> mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or <b>pepper</b> and ginger.|$|E

Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included <b>pepper,</b> cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long <b>pepper</b> (both from vines similar to black <b>pepper),</b> grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey.
