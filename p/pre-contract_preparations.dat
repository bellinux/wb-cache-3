However, the histamine-induced relaxation was still present in the endothelium-removed preparations. The histamine-induced relaxation also was not prevented by astemizole (10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M), cimetidine (10 - 5 M, 10 - 4 M and 10 - 3 M) or thioperamide (10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M and 10 - 4 M), selective antagonists H 1, H 2 and H 3, respectively. The presence of L-NAME 10 - 4 M or L-NAME 10 - 4 M plus indomethacin 10 - 5 M also did not prevent the histamine-induced relaxation observed in rat portal vein. Thus, the histamine-induced relaxation observed in rat portal vein appears to involve a non-endothelial hyperpolarizing mechanism independent of H 1, H 2 and H 3 receptors...|$|R
40|$|Dysfunctional {{regulation}} of airway smooth muscle tone is {{a feature of}} obstructive airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Airway smooth muscle contraction is directly associated with changes in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which is increased by Rho and decreased by Rac. Although cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -elevating agents are believed to relieve bronchoconstriction mainly via activation of protein kinase A (PKA), here we addressed {{the role of the}} novel cAMP-mediated exchange protein Epac in the {{regulation of}} airway smooth muscle tone. Isometric tension measurements showed that specific activation of Epac led to relaxation of guinea pig tracheal <b>preparations</b> <b>pre-contracted</b> with methacholine, independently of PKA. In airway smooth muscle cells, Epac activation reduced methacholine-induced MLC phosphorylation. Moreover, when Epac was stimulated, we observed a decreased methacholine-induced RhoA activation, measured by both stress fibre formation and pull-down assay whereas the same Epac activation prevented methacholine-induced Rac 1 inhibition measured by pull-down assay. Epac-driven inhibition of both methacholine-induced muscle contraction by Toxin B- 1470, and MLC phosphorylation by the Rac 1 -inhibitor NSC 23766, were significantly attenuated, confirming the importance of Rac 1 in Epac-mediated relaxation. Importantly, human airway smooth muscle tissue also expresses Epac, and Epac activation both relaxed <b>pre-contracted</b> human tracheal <b>preparations</b> and decreased MLC phosphorylation. Collectively, we show that activation of Epac relaxes airway smooth muscle by decreasing MLC phosphorylation by skewing the balance of RhoA/Rac 1 activation towards Rac 1. Therefore, activation of Epac may have therapeutical potential in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Previous {{in vitro}} {{research}} demonstrated that ascorbate enhances potency {{and duration of}} activity of agonists binding to alpha 1 adrenergic and histamine receptors. Objectives: Extending this work to beta 2 adrenergic systems in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Ultraviolet spectroscopy was used to study ascorbate binding to adrenergic receptor preparations and peptides. Force transduction studies on acetylcholine-contracted trachealis preparations from pigs and guinea pigs measured the effect of ascorbate on relaxation due to submaximal doses of beta adrenergic agonists. The effect of inhaled albuterol with and without ascorbate was tested on horses with heaves and sheep with carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction. Measurements: Binding constants for ascorbate binding to beta adrenergic receptor were derived from concentration-dependent spectral shifts. Dose- dependence curves were obtained for the relaxation of <b>pre-contracted</b> trachealis <b>preparations</b> due to beta agonists in the presence and absence of varied ascorbate. Tachyphylaxis and fade were also measured. Dose response curves were determined for the effect of albuterol plus-and-minus ascorbate on airway resistance in horses and sheep. Main Results: Ascorbate binds to the beta 2 adrenergic receptor at physiological concentrations. The receptor recycles dehydroascorbate. Physiological and supra-physiological concentrations of ascorbate enhance submaximal epinephrine an...|$|R
40|$|The foramen of Panizza {{is located}} within the outflow tract of the crocodilian heart, between {{the left and right}} aortas. It has been {{suggested}} that the foremen of Panizza has a variable calibre, which could explain the profound changes in the distribution of flows and pressure profiles recorded in the right and left aortas. We investigated this possibility using a modified in-situ perfused heart preparation in combination with isolated strip preparations from the outflow tract. In the perfused heart preparation, bolus injections of adrenaline increased the resistance in the foramen of Panizza, indicating a decrease in its diameter. Isolated strip preparations from the outflow tract showed a concentration-dependent increase in tension in response to adrenaline, while vasoactive intestinal polypeptide caused a relaxation in adrenaline <b>pre-contracted</b> strip <b>preparations.</b> We propose that an increase in the diameter of the foremen of Panizza may be important during pulmonary to systemic shunts to allow blood to flow from the left to right aorta (reverse foramen flow) in order to supply the carotid and coronary arteries.

5000|$|IP is {{classified}} as a relaxant type of prostenoid receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to relax certain <b>pre-contracted</b> smooth muscle <b>preparations</b> and smooth muscle-containing tissues {{such as those of}} pulmonary arteries and veins. When bound to PGI2 or other of its agonists, IP stimulates one or more of three types of G protein complexes, depending on cell type: a) Gs alpha subunit-Gβγ complexes which release Gs that then stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise intracellular levels of cAMP and thereby activate cAMP-regulated protein kinases A-dependent cell signaling pathways (see PKA); b) Gq alpha subunit-Gβγ complexes which release Gq that then stimulates other cell signaling pathways (e.g. phospholipase C/IP3/cell Ca2+ mobilization/diacylglycerol/protein kinase Cs, calmodulin-modulated myosin light chain kinase, RAF/MEK/Mitogen-activated protein kinases, PKC/Ca2+/Calcineurin/Nuclear factor of activated T-cells; and EGF cellular receptors; and c) Gi alpha subunit-Giβγ) complexes which releases Gi that then simulates phospholipase C to cleave phosphatidylinositol triphosphate into inositol triphosphate that raises intracellular CaCa2 levels thereby regulating Calcium signaling pathways and diacylglycerol that activates certain protein kinase C enzymes [...] )that phosphorylate and thereby regulate target proteins involved in cell signaling (see Protein kinase C#Function). Studies suggest that stimulation of Gsβγ complexes is required for activation of the Gqβγ- and Giβγ-dependent pathways. In certain cells, activation of FP also stimulates G12/G13-Gβγ G proteins to activate the Rho family of GTPases signaling proteins and Gi-Gβγ G proteins to activateRaf/MEK/mitogen-activated kinase pathways.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that these variations in the effects of ODQ reflect differences in the mechanisms whereby each NO donor generates NO. On pulmonary artery <b>preparations</b> <b>pre-contracted</b> submaximally with phenylephrine, ODQ (3 μM) almost abolished the relaxant responses to glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and nitroprusside; each of these drugs requires activation in the tissue (by enzymes or reducing agents) to generate NO. In contrast, ODQ (3 μM) caused a parallel shift in the concentration-relaxation curves to linsidomine (SIN- 1), FK 409, MAHMA NONOate and spermine NONOate (1. 63 to 2. 54 log units) with no depression in maximum response; each of these NO donors generates NO in the physiological bathing solution without requiring tissue activation. For the four drugs in this group, the effects of 10 μM ODQ were not significantly greater than the effects of 3 μM ODQ; thus there was an ODQ-resistant component to the response suggesting that part of the response involved a mechanism that was independent of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO donors that require tissue activation probably generate NO within the smooth-muscle cell, whereas those that do not require tissue activation generate NO outside the cell. Hence it is concluded that the site of NO generation (intra- or extracellular) might determine whether or not there is an ODQ-resistant component in the relaxation response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although various endothelium-dependent {{relaxing}} factors (endothelial autacoids) {{are released}} upon {{the elevation of}} endothelial cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration (EC [Ca 2 +] i), the quantitative relationship between EC [Ca 2 +] i and vascular tone remains to be established. Moreover, whether the basal release of endothelial autacoids is modulated by basal EC [Ca 2 +] i is still unclear. We assessed these issues by using a novel method that allows simultaneous recording of EC [Ca 2 +] i and vascular displacement in dissected rat aortic segments. Results Receptor-dependent (acetylcholine) or independent (ionomycin) agonists caused immediate EC [Ca 2 +] i elevation followed by vasorelaxation in <b>preparations</b> <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine. Low doses of agonists induced small EC [Ca 2 +] i elevations (about 100 nmol/L) and concomitant half-maximal vasorelaxation. At high doses, agonists elevated EC [Ca 2 +] i to μmol/L range with little additional vasodilatation. When EC [Ca 2 +] i was plotted against the vasorelaxation, the curves were almost identical for both acetylcholine and ionomycin treatments, in {{the presence or absence}} of various endothelial autacoid inhibitors. Calcium-free solution reduced basal EC [Ca 2 +] i and induced a drastic vasoconstriction. Endothelial autacoid inhibitors reduced EC [Ca 2 +] i changes and abolished both agonist-induced vasodilatation and calcium-free solution-induced vessel contraction. When the EC [Ca 2 +] i was completely chelated by 40 μmol/L BAPTA, the acetylcholine-evoked vasorelaxation could be abolished as well. However, when the EC [Ca 2 +] i was partially chelated by 20 μmol/L BAPTA, the acetylcholine-evoked vasorelaxation was almost unaffected. Conclusions These results indicate that vascular tone is modulated by subtle changes of EC [Ca 2 +] i level, which seems to serve as an integrating signal in both basal and stimulated states. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceCaatinga {{is highly}} {{influenced}} by its seasonality. This species is endemic {{in the northeastern}} region, which is rich in plants with pharmacological potential. Many of these plants are used by the population {{and some of them}} have confirmed pharmacological properties. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. (Mimosaceae) is a native plant from northeastern Brazil׳s caatinga, popularly known as sabiá and cascudo. The tea from the inflorescence of this species is used by the population of the semi-arid for the treatment of hypertension, and the utilization of the plant bark for the staunching of bleedings and wound washing in order to prevent inflammation; also, the ingestion of the bark infusion is used in the treatment of bronchitis. However, its pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action have not yet been studied. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of the ethanolic extract of M. caesalpiniifolia on the cardiovascular system in rats. Material and methodsIn a study for the assessment of the hypotensive effect of the extract, the polyethylene catheters were inserted in the aorta artery and inferior vena cava for the measurement of the arterial pressure and heart rate. When intragastric administration was performed, only one catheter was implanted in the abdominal aorta. In studies for the vasorelaxant activity, mesenteric arterial rings (1 – 2 mm) were used: they were kept in Tyrode׳s solution (95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2) and submitted to tension of 0. 75 g/f for 1 h. The results were expressed as mean±S. E. M., significant to the values of p< 0. 05. ResultsThe administration of the doses through venous pathway (6. 25; 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg, i. v.) promoted hypotension followed by bradycardia in the higher doses. The pre-treatment with atropine (2 mg/kg, i. v.) interrupted both the hypotension and the bradycardia; with hexamethonium, hypotension was reverted and bradycardia was attenuated. While the administration of tea/flowers (25 mg/kg i. v.) also promoted a following section of hypotension, a slight increase in heart rate was observed. When administered orally, MC-EtOH/flowers (100 mg/kg, v. o.) promoted a decrease in the arterial pressure from 90 min on, without a significant alteration in the heart rate in relation to the control. In the in vitro study, a pharmacological trial was performed with the extracts obtained from parts of the species M. caesalpiifolia (leaves, bark, fruit and inflorescences). Among all extracts tested, the ethanolic extract from the inflorescences (MC-EtOH/flowers) presented higher vasorelaxant potency in relation to the other parts of the plant. Henceforth, MC-EtOH/flowers was used in the sequence. In mesenteric <b>preparations</b> <b>pre-contracted</b> with phenylephrine (10 − 5 M), the MC-EtOH/flowers (0. 1 – 750 µg/ml) promoted vasorelaxant effect regardless of the vascular endothelium. MC-EtOH/flowers inhibited the contractions induced by the cumulative addition of phenylephrine (10 − 9 – 10 − 5 mol/l) or CaCl 2 (10 − 6 – 3 × 10 − 2 M), in a concentration-dependent way. In contractions induced by S(-) Bay K 8644, a Cav-L activator, the MC-EtOH/flowers promoted concentration-dependent relaxation, corroborating previous results. ConclusionThe tea of flowers of M. caesalpiniifolia promotes hypotension and tachycardia, whereas ethanolic extract (MC-EtOH) promotes hypotension and bradycardia involving the participation of the muscarinic and ganglionic pathways, as well as vasorelaxant action involving the Ca 2 + influx inhibition blockade...|$|R
40|$|Os efeitos farmacológicos dos extratos etanólicos de Pradosia huberi (EPH) e Attalea excelsa (EAE) sobre o sistema cardiovascular, foram estudados em ratos usando técnicas in vivo e in vitro. EPH (5, 10 e 20 mg. Kg- 1 i. v.) promoveu hipotensão (- 5, 6 ± 0, 5; - 8, 8 ± 1, 3 e - 32, 6 ± 6, 6 %, respectivamente) dose-dependente em ratos não anestesiados, acompanhada por bradicardia (- 0, 3 &# 61617; 0, 9; - 4, 4 &# 61617; 2, 2 e - 45, 3 &# 61617; 6, 0 %, respectivamente) (n= 6). Após tratamento agudo com um antagonista muscarínico (Atropina, 2 mg. Kg- 1), a hipotensão (- 5, 0 ± 0, 8; - 6, 4 ± 0, 9; - 11, 6 ± 1, 8 %, respectivamente) e bradicardia (- 1, 2 ± 0, 4; - 2, 9 ± 0, 8 e - 8, 1 ± 2, 2 %) foram significantemente atenuados. O hexametônio, um bloqueador ganglionar, também atenuou tais efeitos de EPH. Entretanto após L-NAME ambas as respostas não foram modificadas. Em anéis de artéria mesentérica {{superior}} isolada de rato, com endotélio intacto, EPH (1; 3; 10; 30 e 100 &# 61549;g/mL) promoveu relaxamento das contrações induzidas por FEN (10 &# 61549;M) (CE 50 = 17, 14 ± 2, 9; Emax= 87, 8 ± 2, 9, n= 8) de maneira dependente de concentração. Tal efeito foi abolido com a remoção do endotélio funcional, sugerindo o envolvimento de um mecanismo dependente do endotélio. Frações e a 2, 3 -diidromiricetina 3 -&# 61537;-L-raminosídeo, isolada de EPH, não relaxaram ou relaxaram com menos potencia e eficácia as preparação pré-contraídas com FEN. A curva concentração-resposta para EPH foi significantemente atenuada com redução do efeito máximo (Emax), na presença de L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), ODQ (1 &# 61549;M), KCl 20 mM, indometacina(1 &# 61549;M) + L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), 4 -AP (1 mM), BaCl 2 (30 &# 956;M), TEA (1 mM). Na presença de L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M) + L-arginina (1 mM) EPH relaxou as preparações sem alterar o Emax. Em anéis pré-contraídos com KCl 80 mM EPH não induziu relaxamento. Já na presença de atropina (1 &# 61544;M), indometacina (1 &# 61549;M), glibenclamida (10 &# 61549;M) e apamina (1 &# 956;M) a curva para EPH não foi alterada. Em suma, concluímos que o efeito hipotensor de EPH envolve tanto sua ação vasorelaxante como também uma possível ativação indireta de receptores muscarínicos cardíacos e ainda que o efeito vascular de EPH pode envolver a ativação da via eNOS-NO-GMPc, além da participação dos canais para potássio do tipo BKCa, Kv e Kir na musculatura lisa vascular. EAE (5; 10; 20; 40 e 60 mg/kg i. v.) induziu hipotensão (- 3, 7 ± 1, 2; - 6, 1 ± 2, 3; - 8, 5 ± 1, 3; - 9, 9 ± 1, 6 e - 11, 2 ± 1, 8 %, respectivamente) e taquicardia (3, 8 ± 1, 7; 4, 0 ± 1, 6; 3, 8 ± 2, 0; 3, 7 ± 3, 1 e 12, 4 ± 2, 7 %, respectivamente) (n= 5), provavelmente de origem reflexa. Em anéis de artéria mesentérica superior isolada de rato, EAE (1; 3; 10; 30; 100; 300; 500 e 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induziu relaxamento dependente da concentração tanto em anéis intactos (CE 50 = 172, 3 ± 36, 9, Emáx = 100 ± 0, 0 %) como desnudos de endotélio (CE 50 = 166, 7 ± 31, 4, Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %), pré-contraídos com 10 &# 61549;M de FEN, com mesma potencia e eficácia (n= 6). Sugerindo EAE age por mecanismo independente do endotélio. Os experimentos subseqüentes procederam-se em preparações sem endotélio. Diante da incubação com KCl 20 mM, o efeito vasorelaxante de EAE não foi alterado (CE 50 = 108, 1 ± 10, 7 e Emáx = 95, 9 ± 4, 4 %). EAE relaxou com mesma potencia anéis sem endotélio pré-contraídos pelo KCl 80 Mm (Emax= 97, 1 ± 1, 5 %) e pela FEN (Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %). Sugerindo que EAE atua sobre os canais para Ca 2 + dependentes de voltagem. Adicionalmente, EAE antagonizou de maneira dependente de concentração as contrações induzidas por CaCl 2 em meio despolarizante nominalmente sem Ca 2 +. EAE (1; 3; 10; 30; 100; 300; 500 e 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) relaxou contrações induzidas pelo S(-) -Bay K 8644 (Emáx = 128, 8 ± 5, 8 %, n= 8), um agonista de canais para Ca 2 + tipo-L. EAE não alterou as contrações transientes induzidas por cafeína (20 mM) e pouco influenciou aquelas induzidas pela FEN (10 &# 956;M). Em átrio isolado de rato, EAE ocasionou cronotropismo e inotropismo negativo. Estudos eletrofisiológicos em células A 7 r 5 (100 &# 956;M) EAE inibiu correntes de Ba 2 + através dos CaVL 1. 2. Em conclusão, sugere-se que o efeito hipotensor de EAE é resultado de sua ação vasorelaxante que parece decorrente da sua ação sobre o influxo de cálcio através dos CaV 1. 2 nos miocitos vasculares. The pharmacological {{effects of}} Pradosia huberi (EHP) and Attalea excelsa (EAE) ethanolics extracts on the cardiovascular system were studied in rats using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach. In non-anaesthetized rats, EPH (5, 10 or 20 mg. Kg- 1 i. v.) injections produced hypotension (- 5. 6 ± 0. 5; - 8. 8 ± 1. 3 and - 32. 6 ± 6. 6 %, respectively) and bradicardia (- 0. 3 &# 61617; 0. 9; - 4. 4 &# 61617; 2. 2 and - 45. 3 &# 61617; 6. 0 %, respectively) (n= 6). After acute treatment with a muscarinic agonist (atropine, 2 mg. Kg- 1, hypotension (- 5. 0 ± 0. 8, - 6. 4 ± 0. 9 and - 11. 6 ± 1. 8 %, respectively) and bradicardia (- 1. 2 ± 0. 4, - 2. 9 ± 0. 8 and - 8. 1 ± 2. 2 %) were significantly attenuated. Hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, also attenuated {{the effect of}} EPH. After L-NAME both answers were not modified. In isolated rat mesenteric artery rings, with intact endothelium, EPH (1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 &# 61549;g/mL) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the contractions induced by Phe (10 &# 61549;M) (EC 50 = 17. 14 ± 2. 9; Emax= 87. 8 ± 2. 9, n= 8) and this effect was abolished by removal of vascular endothelium, suggesting the involvement of a mechanism endothelium-dependent. Fractions and 2 - 3 dihydromyricetin- 3 -O-&# 61537;-L-rhamnoside isolated from EPH did not relax or relaxed with less potency and effectiveness the <b>preparation</b> <b>pre-contracted</b> with Phe. The concentration-response curve for EPH was significantly shifted to the right with L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), ODQ (1 &# 61549;M), KCl 20 mM, indomethacin (1 &# 61549;M) + L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), 4 -AP (1 mM), BaCl 2 (30 &# 956;M), TEA (1 mM). In the presence of L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M) + L-arginine (1 mM) EHP relaxed preparations without changing the Emax. EPH did not induce relaxation on KCl 80 mM precontracted rings. Once {{in the presence of}} atropine (1 &# 61544;M), indomethacin (1 &# 61549;M), glibenclamide (10 &# 61549;M) and apamin (1 &# 956;M) the curve of EPH was not altered. We concluded that the hypotensive effect of EPH seems result of its vasorelaxant action and can involve an indirect activation of muscarinic heart receptors and still that the vascular effect of EPH can involve the activation of the eNOS-NO-GMPc ways well as the participation of BKCa, KV, and Kir potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle. EAE (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg i. v.) induced hypotension (- 3. 7 ± 1. 2; - 6. 1 ± 2. 3; - 8. 5 ± 1. 3; - 9. 9 ± 1. 6 and - 11. 2 ± 1. 8 %, respectively) and tachycardia (3. 8 ± 1. 7; 4. 0 ± 1. 6; 3. 8 ± 2. 0; 3. 7 ± 3. 1 and 12. 4 ± 2. 7 %, respectively) (n= 5) probably due to a reflex response. In isolated rat mesenteric artery rings, EAE (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner in both intact-(EC 50 = 172. 3 ± 36. 9, Emax = 100 ± 0. 0 %) or removed-endothelium rings (EC 50 = 166, 7 ± 31, 4, Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %) pre-contracted with Phe 10 &# 61549;M with the same potency and effectiveness (n= 6). These results suggest that EAE acts by an endothelium-independent mechanism. Subsequent experiments were accomplished in preparations without endothelium. In preparation pre-incubated with KCl 20 mM, the vasorelaxant activity of EAE was not changed (EC 50 = 108. 1 ± 10. 7 and Emáx = 95. 9 ± 4. 4 %). EAE relaxed with the same potency rings precontracted with KCl 80 mM (Emax = 97. 1 ± 1. 5 %) or with Phe (Emax = 92. 2 ± 7. 1 %) suggesting that EAE acts on the voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channels. Furthermore, in depolarizing medium nominally without Ca 2 +, EAE antagonized CaCl 2 -induced contractions in a concentrationdependent manner. EAE (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induced relaxation concentration-dependent, contractions elicited by the L-type Ca 2 + channel agonist, S(-) -Bay K 8644 (Emáx = 128. 8 ± 5. 8 %, n= 8). EAE did not alter transient contractions induced by caffeine (20 mM) and little influenced those induced by Phe (10 &# 61549;M). In rat isolated atrium, EAE produced negative inotropic and cronotropic effect. Electrophysiological studies on cells A 7 r 5 (100 &# 61549;M) EAE inhibited Ba 2 + current through the CaVL 1. 2. In conclusion, the results suggested that the hypotensive effect of EAE is due to its vasorelaxant action that seems to be attributed to the influx of Ca 2 + through CaV 1. 2 channels in vascular myocytes...|$|R
