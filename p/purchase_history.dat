Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs. It also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including <b>purchase</b> <b>history</b> and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained. Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number {{from the back of the}} credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a [...] "Welcome Back" [...] program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.|$|E

40|$|Behavior-based personalization" {{has gained}} {{popularity}} in recent years, whereby businesses offer personalized products based on consumers' <b>purchase</b> <b>histories.</b> This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based personalization in competitive markets. First, although <b>purchase</b> <b>histories</b> reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such information damages differentiation, {{similar to the}} classic finding that behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the information value of <b>purchase</b> <b>histories.</b> Ideally, if a market leader serves all consumers on day 1, <b>purchase</b> <b>histories</b> contain no information about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are willing to accommodate a market leader, firms {{are more likely to}} offer a mainstream design at day 1, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs. behavior-based personalization, behavior-based price discrimination, revealed preference, segmentation, targeting, competition, customer relationship management, endogenous information generation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We have {{previously}} proposed the ReceiptLog ser-vice platform, which stores user’s <b>purchase</b> <b>histories</b> from daily receipts for value-added consumer services. As a practical {{application of the}} ReceiptLog, we design and implement a shopping support service, called “Sma-Sho”, in this paper. Sma-Sho is designed to cope with two typical problems in daily shopping: duplicate purchase and forgotten purchase. The duplicate purchase is that a user mistakenly buys a product although there is sufficient stock of the same product at home. The forgotten purchase is that a user forgets to buy a product although the product is out of stock. Using the ReceiptLog APIs extensively, Sma-Sho provides useful <b>purchase</b> <b>histories</b> for the user with a mobile terminal, to prevent the above two problems. We also conduct an experimental evaluation with 8 subjects, to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. I...|$|R

50|$|While at its core, clienteling is a sales technique, {{the term}} is {{commonly}} used today to describe the related assisted selling software tools used to support relationship-building activities between store associates and their customers. Software-based clienteling has been said to {{have the advantage of}} collecting data about clients across different interaction channels in a searchable and retrievable database for later use. Clienteling software may also provide digital tools on mobile devices or fixed workstations aimed at enabling retailers to establish long-lasting learning relationships with their customers. While sales history collected in customer relationship management (CRM) platforms can provide some insight into a customer’s tendencies, this insight can be augmented by data collected by an associate working directly with a customer, who can improve the customer profile through each face-to-face interaction. This information can then be used to further personalize future interactions. Capabilities such as notes, wish lists, preferences, alerts, and <b>purchase</b> <b>history</b> are sometimes used to enable associates to enhance client profiles in ways that <b>purchase</b> <b>history</b> and e-commerce activity alone could not. Clienteling can also be an effective means of selling excess inventory without resorting to discounting by pairing products with the right consumers, using their past purchases to predict what they are likely to want to buy.|$|E
40|$|When a firm {{is able to}} {{recognize}} its previous customers, it may use information about their <b>purchase</b> <b>histories</b> to price discriminate. We analyze a model with a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers are able to maintain their anonymity and avoid being identified as past customers, possibly at an (exogenous) cost. When consumers can costlessly maintain their anonymity, they all individually choose to do so, which paradoxically results in the highest profit for the firm. Increasing the cost of anonymity can benefit consumers, but only up to a point, after which the effect is reversed. Privacy, anonymity, price discrimination, electronic commerce...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a probabilistic model of brand choice that captures dynamic preferences and loyalties of consumers over their life-time of purchasing in a product category (i. e., first ever purchase through to last ever purchase {{made in a}} product category). The model is motivated by our theory that choice processes evolve over time, perpetuated by changes in consumer expertise, consumer needs from the product, perceived purchasing risks, {{and changes in the}} marketing environment, to name a few. We capture this process through a series of discrete and concurrent choice models spanning a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s entire <b>purchasing</b> <b>history,</b> parsimoniously estimated in one model, where each choice model captures consumer preferences for a portion of their duration of time spent in the market. We argue this method of capturing choice over discrete intervals of the choice process is just as good, if not better, than one that analyzes choice over time with a continuous function because (1) our method is more in line with actual marketing implementation plans and consumer response to such tactics, (2) our model is able to capture any 2 ̆ 2 non-linearities 2 ̆ 2 in consumer choice over time, and (3) our model permits a parsimonious analysis of all purchases spanning a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s life-time in a category by segmenting the <b>purchasing</b> <b>histories</b> into 2 ̆ 2 stages 2 ̆ 2, and analyzing each stage without having to normalize on any particular stage. ^ The model is calibrated on unique panel data containing the entire <b>purchasing</b> <b>history</b> of panelists in two product categories. We find that preferences and loyalties among certain demographic segments do in fact vary over their duration of purchasing in a category. We also discover that consumers respond differently to price hikes/cuts depending on the length of time they have purchased in a market. Lastly, we find evidence to support the conclusions of previous experimental studies that looked at the long term effect of expertise on choice, but were never validated on actual purchasing data (Meyer and Sathi 1985; Howard and Sheth 1969; and Horsky and Raban 1988). These findings are that consumers with limited information do a considerable amount of brand switching {{in the early stages of}} their purchasing process, as part of their information gathering efforts. However, over time and purchasing occasions, as information is gathered, loyalties develop and consumers become more loyal shoppers. ...|$|R
