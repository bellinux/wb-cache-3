We construct a parsimonious Schumpeterian growth model in which demand from the public sphere can effectively alter the economy's rate of technological change. We incorporate results of various empirical studies arguing that <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demand</b> acts as incentive for private innovation activities. In contrast to the standard Schumpeterian growth framework, we account for industry heterogeneity in terms of innovation potential. This extension allows to bring government demand policy {{within the realm of}} the growth policy debate. By varying the composition of its purchases, the government can induce a reallocation of private resources to stimulate the rate of technological change. This comes along with temporarily faster economic growth. Moreover, our welfare analysis implies that it is always worth implementing a policy in which industries benefit from public purchases subject to their specific innovation size. public demand, endogenous technological change, Schumpeterian growth...|$|E

Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program (DOE/FEMP) criteria used for federal purchasing. Potential savings from energy-efficient purchasing are about $ 1 billion/year for all levels of government; state and local purchasing {{account for more than}} 75 % of this total. Together, state and local agencies spend annually about $ 50 - 70 billion on energy-related products and $ 12 billion on energy bills.

This paper evaluated the relationships of health status and socio-economic variables with utilisation of private care by public primary care clinic attenders. The sample included 2117 randomly selected subjects with clinical diabetes attending 35 government health centres in Trinidad and Tobago. Measures included attendance at a private doctor, the type 2 Diabetes Symptom Checklist, the SF 36 questionnaire, and indicators of socio-economic status. Of the sample, 1256 (59 %) reported attending a private doctor, 577 (27 %) attended a private doctor for diabetes, and 378 (18 %) attended a private doctor regularly. Attendance at a private doctor was associated with lower SF 36 scores. The odds ratio for a 10 unit increase in SF 36 physical component score was 0. 81, 95 % confidence interval 0. 72 - 0. 91. After adjusting for demographic and social factors the relative odds were 0. 89, 0. 80 to 1. 00. After allowing for differences in health status, the relative odds of attending for private care for those without a pipe borne water supply in the home, compared with those with water in the home, were 0. 77, 0. 63 - 0. 94. Those living alone {{were less likely to}} attend a private doctor than those living with their children and partner (odds ratio 0. 60, 0. 43 - 0. 83).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} and analyze the professional expectations of medical students during the 2007 - 2008 academic year at the public medical schools of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, and to identify their social and geographical origins, their professional expectations and difficulties relating to their education and professional future. Methods Data were collected through a standardised questionnaire applied to all medical students registered during the 2007 - 2008 academic year. Results Students decide to study medicine at an early age. Relatives and friends seem to have an especially important influence in encouraging, reinforcing and promoting the desire to be a doctor. The degree of feminization of the student population differs among the different countries. Although most medical students are from outside the capital cities, expectations of getting into medical school are already associated with migration from the periphery to the capital city, even before entering medical education. Academic performance is poor. This seems to be related to difficulties in accessing materials, finances and insufficient high school preparation. Medical students recognize the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demand</b> but their expectations are to combine public sector practice with private work, in order to improve their earnings. Salary expectations of students vary between the three countries. Approximately 75 % want to train as hospital specialists and to follow a hospital-based career. A significant proportion is unsure about their future area of specialization, which for many students is equated with migration to study abroad. Conclusions Medical education is an important national investment, but the returns obtained are not as efficient as expected. Investments in high-school preparation, tutoring, and infrastructure are likely to have a significant impact on the success rate of medical schools. Special attention should be given to the socialization of students and the role model status of their teachers. In countries with scarce medical resources, the hospital orientation of students' expectations is understandable, although it should be associated with the development of skills to coordinate hospital work with the network of peripheral facilities. Developing a local postgraduate training capacity for doctors might be an important strategy to help retain medical doctors in the home country. </p...|$|E

40|$|Assuming that {{liquidity}} constraints {{exist in}} most developing countries, {{the majority of}} analysts believe that increasing real interest rates will raise the volume of lending and hence private investment. The author, focusing on the demand for capital goods, argues that the {{positive effect on the}} domestic credit market may be offset by the negative effect of a portfolio shift from capital goods and public bonds into monetary assets. The author also demonstrates that a policy of financial liberalization could increase the <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> <b>demand</b> for domestic credit, thus limiting the funds available to the private sector. This crowdingout does not result from a change in the government's behavior but from a shift in the portfolio of private agents. Higher demand for bank deposits reduces the private sector's willingness to hold government bonds, so the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> must finance a given budget deficit with more domestic credit. Simulations for Argentina for 1961 - 1982 suggest that the low response of private investors to changes in interest rate policy in those 20 years was attributable not to the low values of interest elasticities but to the interaction of the mechanisms allowed for in the model, which tends to neutralize the impact of such policies. The author concludes that the effect of changes in interest rate policy on the demand for capital goods is weak in Argentina and might affect the quality of private investment more than its quantity.

40|$|Social impact {{measurement}} represents both {{a strength}} and weakness for ‘voluntary, community and social enterprise’ (VCSE) organisations. This tension occurs because social impact measurement approaches seek {{to demonstrate the}} social value that VCSE organisations create; {{but at the same}} time they require skillsets (research), resources (in time and finances), and commitment (from key stakeholders) in order robustly to be carried out. This tension is further exacerbated by the lack of definition around what constitutes social impact (Sairinen and Kumpulainen, 2006); what social value creation looks like as a construct and a process (Emerson, 2000); and the plethora of different (and complex) methodological approaches to social impact measurement that exist globally and in the UK (Inspiring Impact, 2016; Millar and Hall, 2013; Hehenberger et al., 2013). This is problematic for the VCSE sector as the demonstration of the social impact that they deliver is increasingly being viewed as strategically critical in relation to gaining access to resources, achieving legitimacy and as a process of organisational development (Nicholls, 2009; Clifford et al., 2013). There is therefore a need for a concerted effort to be made not just in convincing social enterprises (and wider organisational groups) that social impact measurement is required, but also to develop tools and methodologies that can cater to the varied needs of such organisations, whilst still retaining underlying common frameworks and principles. This chapter seeks to explore these issues through the building of a common framework based upon the European Commission’s GECES sub-committee report on social impact measurement that was published in June 2014 and also the more recent work of Noya (2015) in exploring social impact measurement in social enterprises for the OECD. These publications were produced to bring a cohesion and consistency to impact measurement across the EU Member States, not only in the operation of grant and investment funds under the Social Business Initiative, but also more widely across the social economy. The authors view the utilisation of the GECES framework in the development of a common approach to social impact measurement across the UK as fundamental to the development of the VCSE sector, particularly now that the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 obliges public service commissioners to consider social value in the commissioning and procurement of services. In addition to <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demand,</b> there is also a need for robust impact measurement in the venture philanthropy and social/impact investment markets (Barraket and Yousefpour, 2013; Nicholls, 2010). This is because currently these markets are characterised by a lack of data and information asymmetry (Hazenberg et al., 2014) and robust impact measurement can support the development of new investment products that can assist the VCSE sector to grow (Nicholls, 2010; Wood et al., 2012; Barraket and Yousefpour, 2013). The chapter begins by exploring definitions of social impact, before moving on to examine the recommendations of the GECES report, before concluding with the proffering of a ten-point code that it is suggested all in the sector should adhere to when conducting social impact measurement...|$|E
40|$|The {{devaluation}} {{of a number}} of European currencies, measures to consolidate state budgets and structural problems that cannot be resolved all too quickly have together held the growth in the production component of Austria's overall economy since 1994 below that of the average for the EU's member-states. Austria's economy should manage {{to catch up with the}} EU's growth dynamic as of 1998 as a result of the elimination of exchange rate-related competitive disadvantages, continuing structural improvements, and a somewhat less restrictive budgetary policy. Measured on average for the period 1997 - 2001, real GDP will increase at a rate of 2. 4 percent per year, or, in other words, 1 percentage point more quickly than for the preceding five year period. This forecast rests on the assumption that the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union will be implemented as scheduled on January 1, 1999 and will encompass a large number of participating states. As the expansion of production picks up steam, it will also lead to an increased demand for labor. The growing pool of part-time employees is recruited mainly from manpower reserves – and not from among the unemployed. For this reason, the unemployment rate will only decline slowly (according to traditional definitions, from 7 percent in 1996 to 6 ½ percent in 2001). While exports are currently the motor behind economic growth, additional growth impulses during the course of 1998 should also come from investments. The effort to rationalize, to modernize and to expand capacity will lead to the capital expenditures on machinery and equipment growing much more rapidly than those for construction. Because of the subdued growth in the disposable income available to private households, the level of private consumption will only improve gradually and to a limited extent. The continuing efforts at budgetary consolidation will also keep <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demand</b> in check. During 1997, the public deficit level will fall well below the 3 percent target established in the Maastricht Treaty and will sink below 2 percent GDP at the end of the forecast period. The forecast decline in the current account balance from 2 percent (1997) to approximately 1 percent GDP is largely attributable to an improved balance of trade, which is itself likely as a result of the beneficial conditions which exist for increased competitiveness and the growth in the market share held by exports. The dramatic decline in the travel industry's net receipts should come to a standstill; however, only a very slight recovery is expected for the coming years. As a consequence of the country's accession to the EU, the rate of inflation in Austria has declined markedly. The impact of the restrained growth in the unit labor costs can be witnessed in the forecasts for the rate of inflation. Imports are also expected not to contribute all too much impetus to raising price levels. The European Central Bank is likely to take over from the German Bundesbank the fight against inflation in Europe. The annual rate of inflation during the forecast period will barely reach 2 percent, it will average 1. 8 percent (compared to 2. 7 percent for the period 1992 - 1996).

The transformation of Indonesia's central government budgetary system [...] 4. Paper 3. The implementation of performance-based budgeting within Indonesian local government [...] 5. Conclusion. Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB) has been, and continues to be, implemented within developed and developing countries {{as part of a}} wider public sector reform process. The purpose is to embed accurate performance measurement within public sector organisations (see Franklin, 2006, Aristovnik and Seljak, 2009, Schick, 2007) and provide a more efficient and effective approach to resource allocation (Shah and Shen, 2007). PBB adoption and implementation has not been without criticism and there is ongoing debate as to the real use and effectiveness of PBB. The historical context within which PBB developed, and the justification for why countries decide to implement PBB, {{has been the subject of}} scant research, which has led to a lack of understanding as to its purpose and effects. This thesis undertook an historical examination of PBB as part of fiscal reform within the public sector. It specifically used a case study regarding the adoption and implementation of PBB within the Indonesian government as its central field of analysis. The study used qualitative research methodology, beginning with a historical review of the evolution of PBB as the new public budgeting system, using the Lüder FMR model (2002) as a {{conceptual framework}}. It then utilized new institutional sociology (NIS) theory as a theoretical framework to examine the extent to which isomorphism was evident during PBB implementation within the Indonesian central government. Finally, the Lüder FMR model (2013) was employed as a conceptual framework to investigate the motives that underpinned the development of PBB within Indonesian local government, and the factors influencing its implementation. This study offers three conclusions about the historical context of PBB evolution and the decision by countries to adopt. First, PBB was initially implemented in the United States in 1949 and expanded to developing countries through United States (US) and United Nations (UN) funded projects. Using the Lüder FMR model (2002), this study finds that the primary motive underpinning PBB implementation in the US was <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demand</b> for more informative and measured budgets. Similar motives were also found in the UK, Australia and Denmark. That the implementation of PBB within the US and UK budgeting systems were largely seen as positive, was the primary stimulus for PBB implementation across the globe. Furthermore, this study found the outcome of budgetary reform varied between countries, from that of a single format that involved traditional budgeting methods, to ‘old PBB’, to a dynamic approach involving multiple stages that culminated in PBB modification. Second, the change to the budgetary system was a consequence of the Indonesian central government‘s institutional environment. Two phases of PBB implementation occurred within the Indonesian central government. In the initial period (1990 s), most of the impetus for change originated from Indonesian technocrats (internal governmental officers and academics) who proposed PBB after their participation in an international public sector workshop. During the second period (2003), pressure to implement PBB emanated from the IMF and the World Bank, and the Indonesian central government responded to moderate coercive pressure with an avoidance strategy. This avoidance response, coupled with the occurrence of weak mimetic and strong normative pressure (from Indonesian technocrats) in the institutionalisation of PBB, is evident through the modified form of PBB implemented across the Indonesian central government. This avoidance strategy appears to be the result of the Indonesian government seeking legitimacy from the international community rather than the rational motive of gaining efficiency. Third, the primary motivation for PBB implementation within Indonesian local government was the demand to modernise its financial and reporting system, with support from Indonesian technocrats (government officers and scholars) and foreign donor projects. The harmonisation of planning, budgeting and accounting helped to embed reform. Furthermore, the study found that the Lüder FMR model (2013) is a useful framework to identify the key factors (such as stimuli, reform driver and promoters, and structural features) behind the implementation of PBB within Indonesian local government. However, the weak performance identified after PBB implementation indicated that budgeting reform was at least partly cosmetic. In practical terms, the Indonesian experience of PBB implementation has lessons for other developing countries who are adopting or intend to adopt and implement PBB.

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of the maintenance industry renews the interest of both practioners and academia working in the maintenance field. In the past or even now, most of the maintenance work contractors are selected purely on basis of the lowest tender prices, {{even though they are}} required to be undergone the pre-qualification process. However, it is increasingly admitted that the practice of awarding tenders on a basis of low tender price eventually would lead to the ultimate quality problems. In consequence, there is a serious outcry in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>demanding</b> a revolution in the current tender awarding system. Accordingly, this study intends to test how different managers actually choose maintenance contractors. This in turn would lead us to focus on the identification of the major selection attributes, and the trade-off weightings among attributes during the selection process. In this study, the identification and the trade-off weightings for different contractors selection attributes are revealed by conjoint analysis. Meanwhile, a Likert scale rating is also used to reveal whether there are disparities between the relative perceived importance and the relative weights in actual selection in the contractors selection attributes. Our results found that there are some consistencies in the relative perceived importance and the relative weights in actual contractor selection. On the other hand, our results also reveal that the contractors should put more effort in improving their company reputation in order to win the maintenance contracts.

The current business of healthcare and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> reform <b>demands</b> that practitioners must continue to provide ever improving reliable and high quality services, whilst simultaneously reconfiguring and dismantling these same services (Pederson and Hartley, 2008). At work, and outside work, people are faced with the task of influencing others to do something which they may not want to do - something which requires them to change, or to behave in different ways. The ability to influence others therefore is a transferable skill and an important aspect of continuing personal and professional development...|$|R

The Conference theme was "Consolidating state capacity". The rationale for control and accountability in public administration and management is to ensure efficient and effective resource utilisation to foster public service provision, good governance and development. Thus, any movement towards more professional ethos in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> management <b>demands</b> improved prudence in resource utilisation, increased responsiveness to the citizenry, transparency and, generally accountability. This paper presents and discusses {{the findings of a}} research study conducted to examine how the external control agencies of the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) and the Inspectorate of Government (IG) have enhanced local government systems and processes towards accountability in Uganda. It is demonstrated that local government systemic problems are complex and diverse, and that the accountability deficiency is more ingrained in the inherently weak systems and processes prevalent in local governments (LGs). It is argued that the mere crackdown on those who abuse public authority and misuse public resources do not necessarily improve accountability and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> effectiveness. Instead, identifying the organisationalstructural deficiencies and possible system reforms would be more appropriate to alleviate the problem. Commitment should thus, be put to undertaking system studies geared at improving systems and processes rather than mere inspections and monitoring exercises that encourage administrative tourism...|$|R
40|$|The South African <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> is {{reeling from}} the barrage of new {{initiatives}} {{with respect to the}} government’s transformation agenda, and from a plethora of targets that need to be achieved in the <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> With the <b>demands</b> from communities for improved service delivery, {{it is highly unlikely that}} the South African Government will relax the performance pressures it exerts on <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> organisations. Not surprisingly, leadership sits firmly at the core of this transformation agenda. However, the Government has repeatedly expressed concerns as to the lack of the effectiveness of leadership development initiatives on good governance practices and service delivery outcomes. There is little shared understanding amongst management of the qualities required for effective leadership in the South African <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> Furthermore, leadership theory is driven by conflicting interpretations. However, fundamental to improved leadership is a clearer shared understanding of what leadership behaviours, approaches and models work in delivering public services. Many leadership development initiatives based on Western Leadership models have been undertaken by the South African government, but there is little evidence so far as to their effectiveness. This paper provides an overview of service delivery in South Africa; the critical need for effective leadership to improve service delivery by the South African <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> and an overview of leadership approaches and models. The paper also points to why a particular model of African leadership is suggested in relation to the South African public sector; specifically, its validity with respect to the impact on factors that affect employee performance and thus service delivery outcomes.

40|$|Private Finance Initiative (PFI) {{is a way}} of {{creating}} Public-Finance Partnerships (PPPs) by funding public infrastructure projects with private capital, whilst privatisation is defined as the transfer of activities and function of <b>public</b> <b>sectors</b> to the private sector that only applies to the government enterprise and the implementation of new project by <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> Although the <b>demand</b> of PFI and privatisation is significantly increasing for the better quality of work and valuefor money from <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and private sector, they are facing challenges of restructuring of the national economic and financing. In addition, the insufficient guidelines on how both PFI and privatisation should be dissimilarly implemented plus with limited fund by the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> and financing problem by the private sector have reduced the services and the efforts of ideally implementing both the PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian infrastructure projects. Hence, this paper aims at theoretically reviewing the differences of implementation between PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian infrastructure project. It is expected that {{the findings of this study}} will propose proper guidelines of the different implementation between PFI and privatisation for infrastructure projects in better managing PFI and privatisation in the Malaysian construction industry. The findings are in line with National Key Result Areas (NKRA) to achieve the on-time delivery of construction projects, create opportunity of financial and business services where the Malaysian construction industry will positively develop and become one of the best-performance industries via on-time delivery of infrastructure projects...|$|R

Although the recommendations of the Davidson Report were seemingly sunk by the defeat of the Fraser government in 1983, the authors believe that the Labor government's commitment to monopoly <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> telecommunications may give way to deregulation by default under increasing fiscal restraint and private <b>sector</b> <b>demands.</b> ...|$|R

Coming off a sustained period {{of growth in}} their funding and some complacency about their performance, they now face an environment of ferocious competitiveness abroad and austerity at home. Public managers across Australia and New Zealand are finding themselves wrestling with expenditure reduction, a smaller <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> overall, sustained <b>demands</b> for productivity improvement, and the imperative to think differently about the optimal distribution of responsibilities between states, markets and citizens. Given ever-shrinking resources, in terms of staffing, budgets and time, how can public managers and public services become more productive, more outcome-driven and more agile? How can we achieve better alignment between ever-growing citizen expectations and the realities of constrained service provision? What can we learn from the best combination of innovation and austerity already being delivered in other countries and sectors, including harnessing the grounded wisdom of frontline service delivery practitioners? This book focuses on practical ways public managers {{at home and abroad}} are dealing with these shared dilemmas. It brings together renowned scholars in the fields of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> productivity, performance management, ‘frugal innovation’ and budget stringency, with leading international and Australasian practitioners sharing their successes and challenges...|$|R

A policy of case re-notification to improve HIV information quality resulted in a nine-fold {{increase in the number}} of case reports received in 2013 by the Portuguese HIV surveillance office. We used value stream mapping to introduce improvements to data processing practices, identify and reduce waste. Two cycles of improvement were trialled. Before intervention, processing time was nine minutes and 28 seconds (95 %CI 8 : 53 - 10 : 58) per report. Two months post intervention, it was six minutes and 34 seconds (95 % CI 6 : 25 - 6 : 43). One year after the start of the project, processing time was five minutes and 20 seconds (95 % CI 1 : 46 - 8 : 52) ...|$|R
