40|$|Ending the HIV {{epidemic}} needs additional {{methods to}} better assess the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection. In this study, a new indicator — G-rate {{was developed for}} the evaluation of HIV epidemics across regions with regard to geographic area size. Different from the commonly used incidence and prevalence rates that assess the HIV epidemic with reference to population (termed as <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> in this study), G rate measures the number of new infections (incidence) or cases (prevalence) over a unit land area in one year. We demonstrated the utility of G rates using officially reported data on new HIV infections and persons living with HIV in the United States during 2000 – 2012. Findings of our analysis indicate that relative to <b>P</b> <b>rates,</b> G rates indicated a quicker increase in the HIV epidemic in the United States during the study period. In 2012, 4. 6 persons were newly infected and 101. 4 persons lived with HIV per 1000  km 2 land area. The five states with both highest <b>P</b> prevalence <b>rates</b> and highest G prevalence rates were Florida, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Washington DC, which included New Jersey ranked 8 th by <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> and excluded Massachusetts ranked 5 th by G rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT Inoculation with arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) is {{a strategy}} to improve the efficiency of forest plantations, reducing costs and increasing the survival of plant species. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the response and mycorrhizal dependency of seedlings of the forest species Apuleia leiocarpa (Vogel) J. F. Macbr to inoculation with AMF. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design using a 5 × 5 factorial arrangement with six replications. The treatments consisted of combinations of five <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> (0, 24, 71, 213, and 650 mg kg- 1) with five types of inoculations with AMF (inoculation with the fungi Rhizophagus clarus, Gigaspora margarita, Dentiscutata heterogama, inoculation with an AMF mix of these three species, and a treatment without inoculation). The A. leiocarpa showed the highest biomass accumulations in inoculation with D. hetorogama combined with the <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> of 213 and 650 mg kg- 1, and in the AMF mix combined with the <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> of 71, 213, and 650 kg- 1. Biomass accumulation showed a linear, positive response to inoculation with D. heterogama combined with the different <b>P</b> <b>rates,</b> and a positive square root fit to inoculation with the AMF mix. The plants inoculated with G. margarita had no significant biomass accumulation. The plant species had a positive response to inoculation with R. clarus combined with the lowest P rates; however, it had a negative response to combination with the highest <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> (650 mg kg- 1). The relative benefit of inoculation with these fungi was more than 100 % in most treatments, showing the high mycorrhizal dependency of A. leiocarpa and the nutritional benefit of AMF inoculation for this species.

40|$|To {{quantify}} the HIV epidemic, the classical population-based prevalence and incidence <b>rates</b> (<b>P</b> <b>rates)</b> {{are the two}} most commonly used measures used for policy interventions. However, these <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> ignore the heterogeneity of the size of geographic region where the population resides. It is intuitive that with the same <b>P</b> <b>rates,</b> the likelihood for HIV can be much greater to spread in a population residing in a crowed small urban area than the same number of population residing in a large rural area. With this limitation, Chen and Wang (2017) proposed the geographic area-based rates (G rates) to complement the classical <b>P</b> <b>rates.</b> They analyzed the 2000 – 2012 US data on new HIV infections and persons living with HIV and found, as compared with other methods, using G rates enables researchers to more quickly detect increases in HIV rates. This capacity to reveal increasing rates in a more efficient and timely manner is a crucial methodological contribution to HIV research. To enhance this newly proposed concept of G rates, this article presents a discussion of 3 areas for further development of this important concept: (1) analysis of global HIV epidemic data using the newly proposed G rates to capture the changes globally; (2) development of the associated population density-based rates (D rates) to incorporate the heterogeneities from both geographical area and total population-at-risk; and (3) development of methods to calculate variances and confidence intervals for the <b>P</b> <b>rates,</b> G rates, and D rates to capture the variability of these indices...|$|R

This study {{was set up to}} assess this requirement for the diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT), recently proposed as a soil P test, in comparison with conventional soil P tests viz. Olsen, Colwell, Bray- 1, Mehlich- 3, ammonium oxalate, anion exchange membranes (AEM) and 0. 01 M CaCl 2 solution. METHODS: Maize (Zea mays L.) was grown in two Pdeficient soils from western Kenya with contrasting P sorption characteristics, amended with a low and a high <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> and labelled with 33 P. RESULTS: The SA in the plant shoot corresponded with that of the extracts of the different soil tests, except for CaCl 2 and ammonium oxalate extracts, at the low <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> in the soil with low P sorption capacity, Teso soil. For the high <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> on this soil, differences in SA between maize shoot and soil test were small for all established soil tests, but significant for the Colwell, Bray- 1, Mehlich- 3 and AEM tests. The SA in the soil extracts was significantly smaller than that in the maize shoot for Sega the strongly P-sorbing soil at both <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> for all conventional tests, including AEM. This indicates that these tests extracted P from a pool that is not accessible to the plant. For the DGT test, however, {{there was no difference in}} SA between the maize shoot and the soil test, for any of the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Most conventional soil tests can extract a fraction of P which is not available to maize. The DGT technique, however, only samples P from the plant accessible pool.

However, little known is how to manage phosphorus (P) to enhance P use efficiency of the W/M/S system and to mitigate P leaching that is {{a major source of}} pollution. Field experiments were carried out in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to test the impact of five <b>P</b> application <b>rates</b> on yield and P use efficiency of the W/M/S system. The study measured grain yield, shoot P uptake, apparent P recovery efficiency (PRE) and soil P content. A linear-plateau model was used to determine the critical <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> that maximizes gains in the indexes of system productivity. The results show that increase in <b>P</b> application <b>rates</b> aggrandized shoot <b>P</b> uptake and crops yields at threshold rates of 70 and 71. 5 kg P ha- 1 respectively. With <b>P</b> application <b>rates</b> increasing, the W/M/S system decreased the PRE from 35. 9 % to 12. 3 % averaged over the three years. A rational <b>P</b> application <b>rate,</b> 72 kg <b>P</b> ha- 1, or an appropriate soil Olsen-P level, 19. 1 mg kg- 1, drives the W/M/S system to maximize total grain yield while minimizing P surplus, {{as a result of the}} PRE up to 28. 0 %. We conclude that rational P application is an important approach for relay intercropping to produce high yield while mitigating P pollution and the rational P application-based integrated P fertilizer management is vital for sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Southwest of China...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) -induced zinc (Zn) {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly studied antagonistic interactions in plant nutrition. However, there are many controversial reports about P-Zn interaction, possibly related to growth conditions. In this study, the effects of P supply on the root uptake and tissue concentrations of Zn as well as the development of Zn deficiency were investigated in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in different media. Plants were grown under greenhouse and growth chamber conditions in native soil, autoclaved soil and nutrient solution with different P and Zn supplies. In the soil experiment, the shoot biomass and grain yield were measured whereas in the nutrient solution experiment, the root and shoot biomass were determined. Development of Zn deficiency symptoms was examined. Concentrations of Zn, P and other elements were measured in harvested tissues. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots was scored in soil-grown plants. Root uptake of stable Zn isotope (Zn- 70) was investigated at different <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> in a separate nutrient solution experiment. Higher <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> caused substantial decreases in shoot and grain Zn concentrations in native soil but not in autoclaved soil. Treatment of native soil with increasing P significantly reduced mycorrhizal colonization. At low Zn, P applications aggravated Zn deficiency symptoms in both soil and solution culture. In solution culture, root and shoot Zn concentrations were not lowered by higher <b>P</b> <b>rates.</b> Root uptake of Zn- 70 from nutrient solution was even depressed at low P. The negative effect of increasing P supply on root Zn uptake and tissue Zn concentrations in wheat is mycorrhiza-dependent and may completely disappear in a mycorrhiza-free environment...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in randomized blocks with four replications, in a 3 × 3 × 5 factorial design, in which three soil types, three <b>P</b> <b>rates,</b> and four soil acidity correctives were evaluated in 180 experimental plots. Trials were performed in a greenhouse using corn plants in 20 -dm³ pots. Three <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> (0, 50 and 150 mg dm- 3) were applied in the form of powder triple superphosphate and the soil was incubated for 90 days. After this period, soil samples were collected for routine chemical analysis and P content determination by the extraction methods resin, Mehlich- 1 and remaining P. Based on the results, acidity correctives were applied at rates calculated for base saturation increased to 70 %, with subsequent incubation for 60 more days, when P content was determined again. The acidity correctives consisted of: dolomitic lime, steelmaking slag, ladle furnace slag, and wollastonite. Therefore, our results showed that slags raised the soil P content more than lime, suggesting a positive correlation between P and Si in soil. Silicon did not affect the extractor choice since both Mehlich- 1 and resin had the same behavior regarding extracted P when silicon was applied to the soil. For all evaluated plant parameters, there was significant interaction between <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> and correctives; highest values were obtained with silicate...|$|R

There is a paucity {{of information on the}} long-term fertilizer P effects on rice on these soils. A field experiment was conducted for six years (1993 – 1998) to determine the response of four upland rice cultivars to fertilizer P applied at 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg P ha− 1 only once in 1993, and to residual P in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998. The experimental site was located on an Ultisol, low in available P, in the humid forest zone of Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. This paper discusses long-term P effects on P uptake and efficiency of upland rice cultivars. The cultivars evaluated differed in cumulative agronomic and physiological P efficiencies, and the efficiencies were higher at lower <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> for the P-efficient cultivars.

Furthermore, mycorrhizal associations could contribute to improving plant P uptake. Three experiments were used to evaluate <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> (0, 25, and 50 [*]kg[*]P[*]ha− 1) and fertilizer placement (broadcasted or deep-banded) effects in NT wheat on P recovery efficiency (PRE) yield and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization (AMC) which was assessed in one experiment. Fertilization increased dry matter (DM) and accumulated P. Broadcasted P produced lower P accumulation than deep-banded P only at tillering. Phosphorus rate decreased PRE, and placement method did not affect it. Grain yield response was increased by <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> (857 and 1805 [*]kg[*]ha− 1 for 25 and 50 [*]kg[*]P[*]ha− 1, resp.) and was not affected by placement method (4774 and 5333 [*]kg[*]ha− 1 for broadcasted and deep-banded, resp.). Deep-banded P depressed root AMC compared with broadcast applications. Highest AMC in P broadcasted treatments could help to explain the lack of differences between placement methods. These results indicate that Mollisol have low P retention capacity. Therefore, broadcasted P {{could be used as}} an alternative of fertilizer management for NT wheat...|$|R

We also propose a configurable loosely supervising rating system, and show that this system works inexpensively, and could make trade-off between the false rating attack resistance of the UMR system and the accuracy, responsiveness, whitewashing attack resistance as well as a failure resilience of the SSR system, thus providing a better overall performance according to the application context...|$|R

Experiments were established in switchgrass (cv. Alamo) fields planted at three Oklahoma locations in 2007. Interactions of N and <b>P</b> fertilizer <b>rates</b> were evaluated on two sites that had low soil test P (6 to 9 kg/ha). Interactions of N and K fertilizer rates and harvest system were evaluated on a site that had low soil test K (134 kg/ha). In the N and <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> experiments, biomass yields during establishment were unaffected by treatments, averaging 2145 kg/ha in 2007. During 2008, main effects of location, N, and <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> were significant. Application of 134 kg N/ha increased yields from 7945 to 9967 kg/ha. Applying 101 kg P 2 O 5 /ha increased yields from 8528 to 10242 kg/ha. In the harvest system, N, and K rate experiment, biomass yields were unaffected by treatments in 2007 and 2008, averaging 4603 and 16145 kg/ha, respectively. Cutting biomass twice per year as opposed to once a year, however, removed more N,P, and K.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies in {{the past}} decades have focused on how tuber yield of potato grown on {{different}} types of soil is affected by phosphate fertilizer rates. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of phosphorus availability in the soil and of phosphate fertilization on nutrient uptake and removal by the main potato cultivars currently grown in Brazil. Thus, in this study we investigated the influence of <b>P</b> fertilization <b>rates</b> on dry matter (DM) yield and nutrient uptake and removal in five potato cultivars grown on soils with different levels of P availability. Experiments were conducted on soil with low (14 mg dm- 3), medium (36 mg dm- 3), and high (70 mg dm- 3) P availability, in randomized complete blocks with a 5 × 5 factorial arrangement with four replications. The treatments consisted of five potato cultivars (Agata, Asterix, Atlantic, Markies, and Mondial) and five <b>P</b> <b>rates</b> (0, 125, 250, 500, and 1, 000 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5) applied in the planting furrow. In soils with low, medium, and high P availability, P fertilization increased plant growth and tuber DM yield up to rates of 500, 250, and 125 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5, respectively. At a specific initial P availability, all potato cultivars responded to the same <b>P</b> <b>rate</b> for plant growth, tuber yield, and nutrient uptake and removal. At the highest <b>P</b> fertilization <b>rates,</b> leaf analysis showed that the nutritional status of potato plants was not significantly changed and no nutritional deficiency was induced, regardless of the soil P availability levels. However, in the soils with higher P availability, P fertilization decreased plant Mn and Zn and tuber Mn concentrations in a linear manner. The increases in the uptake of N, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, and Fe and the removal of most nutrients in response to P fertilization were related more to the increase in plant biomass and tuber DM yield than to changes in concentrations of these nutrients in the plant. Application of <b>P</b> at high <b>rates</b> in soil with high P availability caused luxury P uptake, which reduced Mn uptake by 10 % and prevented higher Zn uptake, by reducing plant Zn concentrations, despite the increase in plant biomass...|$|R
