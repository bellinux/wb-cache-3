A premature increase in pressure is sign of a potential blockage and continuing to pump risks burst <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> components. Pumping more than an anticipated amount of fluid is a sign of a loss of integrity and a potential leak path somewhere. In either of these two situations, pumping must be stopped and the potential causes analysed.|$|E

He was retained to defend the officers and crew of the Confederate schooner Savannah, the first vessel to be captured during the Civil War, who were on trial for {{their lives on the}} charge of piracy. Owing to some inimical reports about him, he was arrested and imprisoned, but soon released. After the trial began, public feeling ran so high that his life was threatened if he should appear in their defense. He nevertheless did so, telling his friends that, having been appealed to as a lawyer, he could consider no other course, and the ultimate result of the trial was that the men were exchanged as prisoners of war. From 1870-73 Mr. Sullivan was assistant district attorney for New York city, and upon leaving that office he formed a partnership with Hermann Kobbe and Ludlow Fowler. In 1875, he was appointed public administrator, during which he instituted many reforms, reducing the charges upon estates administered, and, in spite of <b>pressure,</b> <b>retaining</b> in his service efficient assistants of a political party different from his own. In 1878 the firm of Sullivan, Kobbe & Fowler was dissolved and he formed a partnership with William Nelson Cromwell, under the name of Sullivan & Cromwell, which firm name is still retained by the successors to his business. Mr. Sullivan was {{recognized as one of the}} strongest, readiest and most successful jury lawyers in New York, and he was admired and revered by both bench and bar. His kindness, candor and fairness, even during the heat of a trial, were always the subject of remark. Judge Bookstaver, of New York, in speaking of him, said: [...] "He was always welcomed by the court in any case in which he appeared, because it was felt that his learning, ability and absolute truthfulness would assist the court in the trial of any question of law and fact with which it had to deal."

Most generally, trapping P is obtained with this method, based on an independent estimate of T. Here we describe QuIB Calc, a MATLABs program that iteratively solves for garnet growth conditions using the <b>pressure</b> <b>retained</b> in quartz inclusions (as revealed by Raman peak shifts).

40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door is {{obviously}} a sensible part of an aircraft, and the design criteria is much more critical than for the fuselage, so a problem caused by this critical criteria is the heavy weight of the door structure because it should {{be strong enough to}} withstand loads and stiff enough to meet the sealing requirements. In spite of the <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door being so important, it is difficult to find design references. So, in this thesis, the <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door is investigated first, and then a typical structure of a type A door is selected as the study case using both metallic and composite material, in order to generate a standard method for door structure design, and to identify the key factors which can affect the structure weight. The study indicates that the structure weight of a type A door can be kept in a range for different combinations of beams and stringers, and the composite door structure can be 20 % lighter than the metallic door while the stiffness of the two doors remains similar. It is found that the skin contributes much more weight to the door structure than other components and the skin thickness is affected by the short edge of the skin panel divided by beams and stringers. The results also found that it is much more serious when the end stop fails than when the middle stops fail. Therefore, it appears that the composite door is a good material as an alternative to aluminium. Also the method of door structure design is reasonable for the composite door, although {{it would be better to}} consider the stiffness of beams while in the theory design period. Besides IRP, the Group Design Project (GDP) is another important part of the MSc study; it lasts nearly half a year and we complete the Fly-wing concept design.

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak lift loading, with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of <b>pressure</b> <b>retain</b> a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak lift load increase.|$|R

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{degradation}} {{have been observed}} in the containment vessels {{of a number of}} operating nuclear power plants in the United States. Examples of degradation include corrosion of the steel shell or liner, corrosion of reinforcing bars and prestressing tendons, loss of prestressing, and corrosion of bellows. The containment serves as the ultimate barrier against the release of radioactive material into the environment. Because of this role, compromising the containment could increase the risk of a large release in the unlikely event of an accident. It is possible to assess the effect that degradation has on the <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> capacity of the containment vessel by performing structural analysis using a model that takes into account the effects of the degradation. While such an analysis provides useful information about the effects of the degradation on the structural capacity of the containment, it does not necessarily provide a perspective on the effect that the degradation could have on the risk associated with operating a nuclear power plant. To understand the risk, one must take into account both the structural capacity of the containment and the probabilities of occurrence of a variety of loading scenarios. In this study, structural analysis results are integrated with risk models to gain a risk-informed perspectiv...|$|E

Degradation of <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> components in these systems {{would result in a}} significant increase in risk. This inspection is intended to assess the effectiveness of the licensee=s program for monitoring degradation of vital system boundaries. The scope of this inspectable area is limited to the following structures, systems, and components (SSCs) : (1) Reactor coolant system, including steam generator tubes in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). (2) Piping connected to the RCS, failure of which could result in an interfacing system loss of coolant accident. (3) Reactor vessel internals. (4) Risk-significant piping system boundaries. (5) Containment system boundaries (including coatings and post-tensioning systems, where applicable). LEVEL OF EFFORT: Inspections are to be performed during each refueling outage at each reactor unit at a site. The level of ISI activities including steam generator inspections at each plant can vary significantly from outage to outage but typically should be as identified in this procedure.
