The 2/4th came ashore in the second wave of the landing, suffering heavy losses with thirty-four men being killed or missing when their Landing Ship Tank was attacked by Japanese dive and torpedo bombers. After the landing, the 2/4th began reconnaissance and flank <b>protection</b> <b>operations</b> for the 26th Brigade until 30 October, when Lae finally fell and they were sent by barge to reinforce the 20th Brigade at Finschhafen in the clearing of the Huon Peninsula. During this time the 2/4th conducted numerous long range patrols, often being sent ahead of the main advance, before finally being removed from the line at the end of February 1944 and being sent back to Australia for leave.|$|E
25|$|Weir {{took over}} as Commander 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in South Vietnam on 1 September 1969.

Reflecting his aggressive approach, during his tenure the Australians conducted 21 major operations. These operations proved effective and the Viet Cong were unable to mount a major offensive in Phuoc Tuy Province during this time. Meanwhile, following signs that the main forces had left the province Weir pursued the local forces. By early 1970 the Viet Cong 274th Regiment in the Hat Dich no longer posed a threat to the task force, while D440 and D445 Provincial Mobile Battalions were reported to have left the province. After nine-months in command Weir handed over to Brigadier William Henderson on 31 May 1970.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Whether a {{disturbance}} will trigger unexpected <b>protection</b> <b>operation</b> to exacerbate the normal operation state or even {{lead to the}} unstable state depends on the transient energy that the system gains during the fault period. The paper presents a new gradient projection approach to calculate the critical energy for transient stability assessment of the power system with the <b>protection</b> <b>operation.</b> The method takes the projection of the potential energy gradient on the key <b>protection</b> <b>operation</b> surface as search direction and iteratively searches for the critical energy at the surface; in order to let the optimal point be the feasible point, the generator angles are considered as control variables of power flow equation to solve network bus voltage and angle during the searching process.

Of the other Maratha leaders, Holkar was hesitant to enter the war in cooperation with his rival, Scindia, and remained aloof from the hostilities, and the Gaekwad of Baroda placed himself under British <b>protection.</b> <b>Operations</b> in the north were directed by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake who entered Maratha territory from Cawnpore to face Scindia's main army which was commanded by the French mercenary, Pierre Perron. A second British force under the command of Major General Wellesley confronted a combined army of Scindia and Berar in the Deccan. Wellesley was determined to gain the initiative through offensive action and told his senior subordinate, Colonel James Stevenson, that [...] "a long defensive war would ruin us and will answer no purpose whatever".|$|E

The year 1883 saw similar service, along with fishery <b>protection</b> <b>operations</b> in the North Sea; this had become increasingly important due to the rising number of foreign boats illegally fishing in German waters. On 15 October 1883, Drache was once again decommissioned for the winter. She returned to service for more survey work in mid-1884 in the Skagerrak and the coast of Norway. She continued surveying areas of the North Sea through the first half of 1887, before being decommissioned the last time on 30 September. The oceanographic data Drache had gathered over the previous fifteen proved to be indispensable to German U-boat crews and mining operations during World War I. On 13 December, Drache was stricken from the naval register and hulked in Wilhelmshaven. She was towed through the Eider Canal in 1888 and was sunk by the torpedo boat [...] in a demonstration for Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Max von der Goltz.

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel {{computational}} implementation technique of rough-set-theory-based data mining {{in analyzing the}} operation of a numerical distance protective relay, which {{is an integral part}} in the Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) process, is investigated.

Whenever a circuit breaker opens due to a tripping instruction signal relayed by a protective relay, the relay tripping event including the disturbance which caused it must be analyzed by protection engineers to verify that the protection system operated correctly as preferred. However, due to the tremendous amount of raw data in the relay event report, it is an uphill task for a protection engineer to extract useful information for understanding the relay behavior governing the <b>protection</b> <b>operation.</b> Furthermore, in many recent works on power system event analysis, emphasis has been primarily aimed at “fault response analysis ” using data from numerous IEDs rather than analysis on detailed validation and diagnosis of digital protective relay behavior using relay resident data.
