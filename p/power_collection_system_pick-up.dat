The wind <b>power</b> plant <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> is dc based, and connects to the LFAC transmission line with a 12 -pulse thyristor converter. The main advantage of the LFAC technology is the increase of power capacity and transmission distance for a given submarine cable compared to 50 -Hz or 60 -Hz HVAC. This leads to substantial cost savings due to the reduction in cabling requrments (i. e, less lines in parallel for a desired power level) {{and the use of}} normal AC breakers for protection.

For that particular application, C-Cu composites are widely used as electrical contact devices such as carbon brushes and current collector for railway <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system.</b> Due to economic and environment concern, activated carbon produced from MPOB oil palm kernel shell (OPKS) is studies as replacement for conventional carbon/graphite in C-Cu composites. This study intended to investigate the effect in term of characterisation using different particle size of carbon (< 90 μm and < 150 μm) and determine the optimum parameter of C-Cu composites to enhance the physical and mechanical properties. The preparation for producing the sample was started with the OPKS through the crushing and sieving process as well as mixed with copper powder and epoxy resin at selected ratio before it is compacted into shape and then undergoes with warm compaction and post baking process. The effects of different particle size of carbon to physical and mechanical properties of the C-Cu composites were analysed. It is found that the improvements of the mechanical and physical properties are strongly affected by the fine particle carbon (< 150 μm) and after passing warm compaction at 150 °C and post baking at 200 °C conditions. It is concluded that the sample prepared in ratio 65 % C (< 150 μm) + 20 % Cu + 15 % Epoxy resin with warm compaction 150 °C, post baking 200 °C condition is the optimum sample parameter to fabricate of current collector...|$|R

40|$|A {{technical}} and economic comparison is made between DC and AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> of offshore wind farms. DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> have {{the advantages of}} reduced weight {{and size of the}} DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50 / 60 Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the need for a high power DC–DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind <b>power</b> from the <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC–DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> are higher than in AC <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC <b>collection</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} rapidly gaining ground as an {{important}} mean of expanding renewable energy use. Solar tracking is employed {{in order to maximize}} collected solar radiation by a photovoltaic panel. In this paper we present a prototype for Automatic solar tracker that is designed using Arduino UNO with Wind sensor to Cease Wind effect on panels if wind speed exceeds certain threshold. The Proposed solar tracker tracks the location of the sun anywhere in any time by calculating the position of the sun. For producing the maximum amount of solar energy a solar panel must always be perpendicular to the source of light. Because the sun motion plane varies daily and during the day it moves from east to west one needs two axis tracking to follow the suns position. Maximum possible power is collected when two axis tracking is done. However two axis tracking is relatively costly and complex. A compromise between maximum <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> and <b>system</b> simplicity is obtained by single axis tracking where the plane North south axis is fixed while the east west motion is accomplished. This work deals with the design of both single and two axis tracking systems.

The agile beam design offers better aperture efficiency over the entire field of regard compared with reflector designs and better electrical and mass efficiency than active array designs.
