40|$|<b>Pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> {{often leads}} to severe health {{problems}} for, say, those dogs who exist {{as a result of}} the practice. It is also the case that virtually all of those unhealthy animals would not exist at all if it were not for the practice of <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding.</b> If those animals have lives worth living, then it follows that they are not harmed by the practice—assuming that a life worth living is better than no life at all. It would seem, then, that the standard account of harm cannot account for the wrongness of our intentionally creating pets with lower welfare. I argue that there is an overlooked aspect of harm that, when coupled with our responsibilities as animal caretakers, entails that we ought to cease the practice of <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> for the sake of future pets, even if many actual pets are not made worse off by the practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{studies in}} {{allopolyploid}} plants are challenging {{because of the}} presence of similar sub-genomes, which leads to multiple alleles and complex segregation ratios. In this study, we describe a novel method for establishing the exact dose and configuration of microsatellite alleles for any accession of an allopolyploid plant species. The method, named Microsatellite Allele Dose and Configuration Establishment (MADCE), can be applied to mapping populations and <b>pedigreed</b> (<b>breeding)</b> germplasm in allopolyploids. Results Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the power and robustness of the MADCE method. In the mapping case, five microsatellites were analysed. These microsatellites amplified 35 different alleles based on size. Using MADCE, we uncovered 30 highly informative segregating alleles. A conventional approach would have yielded only 19 fully informative and six partially informative alleles. Of the ten alleles that were present in all progeny (and thereby ignored or considered homozygous when using conventional approaches), six were found to segregate by dosage when analysed with MADCE. Moreover, the full allelic configuration of the mapping parents could be established, including null alleles, homozygous loci, and alleles that were present on multiple homoeologues. In the second case, 21 pedigreed cultivars were analysed using MADCE, resulting in the establishment of the full allelic configuration for all 21 cultivars and a tracing of allele flow over multiple generations. Conclusions The procedure described in this study (MADCE) enhances the efficiency and information content of mapping studies in allopolyploids. More importantly, it is the first technique to allow the determination of the full allelic configuration in <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> germplasm from allopolyploid plants. This enables pedigree-based marker-trait association studies the use of algorithms developed for diploid crops, and it may increase the effectiveness of LD-based association studies. The MADCE method therefore enables researchers to tackle many of the genotyping problems that arise when performing mapping, pedigree, and association studies in allopolyploids. We discuss the merits of MADCE in comparison to other marker systems in polyploids, including SNPs, and how MADCE could aid in the development of SNP markers in allopolyploids. </p...|$|R
40|$|A <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> {{population}} of feral Mus cervicolor popaeus {{with a high}} incidence of mammary tumors, arising between 6 and 14 months of age, is described. These mice were chronically infected with a type B retrovirus which is distantly related to the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) of inbred strains of Mus musculus. MMTV-induced mammary tumors in inbred mice frequently (80 %) contained an insertion of the viral genome into the int- 1 or int- 2 loci of the tumor cellular genome. These two cellular genetic loci were also altered by viral insertion in 11 of 20 M. cervicolor popaeus mammary tumor cellular DNAs tested. Results of our study of mammary tumorigenesis in feral mice demonstrate that viral-induced rearrangement and activation of the int loci are not limited to the genetic background of inbred mice selected for highly infectious MMTV and {{a high incidence of}} mammary tumors...|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{development}} of modern commercial meat breeds (chickens, etc.), broilers were mostly young male chickens culled from farm flocks. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>breeding</b> began around 1916.

Our research aims to provide insights in order to further the animal-ethical, political and society-wide discussion regarding the future of <b>pedigree</b> dog <b>breeding</b> in the Netherlands. Guided by the question ‘How far are we allowed to interfere in the genetic make-up of dogs, through breeding and genetic modification?’, we carried out a multi-method case-driven research, reviewing literature as well as identifying the perceptions of <b>pedigree</b> dog <b>breeding</b> of a variety of parties in the Netherlands. We examined what moral arguments and concepts different stakeholders, including breeders, veterinarians and animal protection societies, put forward when considering this question. While welfare arguments were often used as a final justification, we also frequently encountered arguments beyond welfare in practice, in particular the arguments that certain adaptations were unnatural, that they instrumentalised animals, or that they amounted to playing God. We argue that the way these arguments are employed points to a virtue ethical approach, foregrounding the virtue of temperance, as a balance between extreme positions was sought by our respondents in a variety of ways. Moreover, we argue against a rejection of unnaturalness arguments based on the naturalistic fallacy, as philosophers tend to do. We point out that unnaturalness arguments are related to people’s worldviews, including views on the proper human–animal relationship. We argue that such arguments, which we label ‘life-ethical’, should be the subject of more public discussion and should not be relegated to the private sphere...|$|R

5000|$|Simmental cattle {{were brought}} to Poland {{at the end of}} 18th century. In 1909, there were 21 Simmental cattle farms in the Polish Kingdom and in 1920 the Association of Highland Cattle Breeders was founded. In the period between the wars, {{breeding}} of Simmental cattle was concentrated in Eastern Małopolska Region and, specifically, in two districts: Krośnieński and Sanocki. At the time, the best cattle farms in Biłoboki reached the capacity of 6,295 kg of milk with 3.9 l fat content. From the outburst of the Second World War until 1995, a strong downward trend in the popularity of the breed among Polish breeders could be observed. Simmental bulls were liquidated and cows were typically mated with bulls of the Polish red breed. In 1955, by virtue of a decision issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the breeding of Simmental cattle was located in south-eastern part of then Rzeszów Region in several counties and the <b>Pedigree</b> <b>Breeding</b> Center was set up in Brzozów. Between 1956 and 1950, cows and bulls were imported from Switzerland, Romania and Austria and, from 1972 to 1974, also from Germany. In total, between 1956 and 1974, 1,770 Simmental cows and 61 Simmental bulls were imported to Poland. From the early 1990s, the breeding of the Simmental cattle experienced another crisis resulting directly from a general recession in the whole Polish farming sector. The sale of the State <b>Pedigree</b> <b>Breeding</b> Center in Brzozów followed by the Center’s liquidation aggravated the crises. In the end of the 1990s, the condition of the sector began to improve slightly. At present, the population of Simmental cattle in Poland is nearly 40,000.|$|E
50|$|Crucial in the {{decision}} to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, {{which may or may not}} be genetic. Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn (or lines that consistently produce flat kittens), and breeding from them is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not always result in further FCKS kittens. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered since a genetically linked cause for the condition can be introduced into lines that do not produce it by breeding with lines in which it is common. Isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter are unlikely to have a genetic component in the condition, and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in <b>pedigree</b> <b>breeding,</b> especially since this may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.|$|E
