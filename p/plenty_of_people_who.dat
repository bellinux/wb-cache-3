5000|$|The book The Oak Island Treasure by Charles B. Driscoll {{written in}} 1929 states the {{following}} based on secondhand accounts: [...] "The stone {{was shown to}} everyone who visited the Island in those days. Smith built this stone into his fireplace, with the strange characters outermost, so that visitors might see and admire it. Many years after his death, the stone {{was removed from the}} fireplace and taken to Halifax, where the local savants were unable to translate the inscription. It was then taken to the home of J.B. McCulley in Truro, where it was exhibited to hundreds of friends of the McCulleys who became interested in a later treasure company. Somehow the stone fell into the hands of a bookbinder, which used it as a base upon which to beat leather for many years. A generation later, with the inscription nearly worn away, the stone found its way to a bookstore in Halifax, and what happened to it after that I was unable to learn. But there are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living <b>who</b> have seen the stone. Nobody, however, ever seriously pretended to translate the inscription." [...] The stone was supposedly brought by A.O. Creighton of the 1866 expedition from the Smith home to Creighton's bookbindery in Halifax. Harry W. Marshall, the son of one of the owners of the bookbindery, wrote in 1935 that he had seen the stone at the business until it closed in 1919. He believed that the stone was left behind in the building at that time.|$|R

[...] Determined and hard-working, Strauss moved up in the organization to president.

The law man was under, was rather for appropriating. God commanded, and his wants forced him to labour. That was his property which could not be taken from him where-ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we see are joined together. The one gave title to the other. So that God, by commanding to subdue, gave authority so far to appropriate: and the condition of human life, which requires labour and materials to work on, necessarily introduces private possessions.|$|R

60|$|She {{was tired}} of their eternal Newport; she had heard of it a {{thousand}} times and felt already {{as if she had}} lived there half her life; she was sure, moreover, that she should hate the awful little place. This is perhaps as near as she came to having a lively conviction on any American subject. She asked herself whether she was then to spend her life in the Fifth Avenue with alternations of a city of villas—she detested villas—and wondered if that was all the great American country had to offer her. There were times when she believed she should like the backwoods and that the Far West might be a resource; for she had analysed her feelings just deep enough to discover that when she had—hesitating a good deal—turned over the question of marrying Jackson Lemon it was not in the least of American barbarism she was afraid; her dread had been all of American civilisation. She judged the little lady I have just quoted a goose, but that didn’t make New York any more interesting. It would be reckless to say that she suffered from an overdose of Jackson’s company, since she quite felt him her most important social resource. She could talk to him about England, about her own England, and he understood more or less what she wished to say—when she wished to say anything, which was not frequent. There were <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> talked about England; but with them the range of allusion was always the hotels, of which she knew nothing, and the shops and the opera and the photographs: they had the hugest appetite for photographs. There were other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were always wanting her to tell them about Pasterns and the manner of life there and the parties; but if there was one thing Lady Barb disliked more than another it was describing Pasterns. She had always lived with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew <b>of</b> themselves what such a place would be, without demanding these pictorial efforts, proper only, as she vaguely felt, to persons belonging to the classes whose trade was the arts of expression. Lady Barb of course had never gone into it; but she knew that in her own class the business was not to express but to enjoy, not to represent but to be represented—though indeed this latter liability might involve offence; for it may be noted that even for an aristocrat Jackson Lemon’s wife was aristocratic.|$|R
40|$|Rock is revolution! Rock is rebellion! Rock is {{democracy}}! Well, {{at least}} Axl Rose {{seems to think}} so with his new album Chinese Democracy. A rock legend singing to democracy in China seems almost poetically fitting. When people {{tend to think of}} China and rock music, it almost always comes back to democracy, more specifically, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Rock was the theme genre of the liberal, underground democratic movement. Ever since Cui Jian (崔健) played “I Have Nothing” (一无所有) —sometimes translated as “Nothing to My Name”—at the protest, rock music has been associated with democracy in China, and this song its theme song. Few think of Chinese rock as a popular mainstream conformist genre, but they would be mistaken to believe that rock is impervious to pop music trends and the lure of a larger audience (and profit). Since the turn of the century, Chinese rock has made a roaring comeback – surging this time not into a political movement but into the mainstream of Chinese language music. This rock music is different from the rock of the 80 s and 90 s. Mainstream popular music has now fused with rock to form a musical genre fitted to the popular music taste of young Chinese listeners. Whereas rock in the 80 s dealt with depressing themes of individualism, social alienation, and disassociation (though <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> young <b>people</b> <b>who</b> listened to Cui Jian then also consumed their share of gentle and sometimes upbeat Canton Pop on the side), now bands are looking to the same themes that have always figured in modern pop, regardless of the country – love, loss, nostalgia, upbeat felicitation. What’s to account for this change? Some have argued it is government repression of more underground rock music in the recording industry, but I think that is probably giving the government too much credit. Many non-mainstream rock bands do get recorded – just this year one of the elites of Chinese rock, Tang Dynasty (唐朝), came out with its new CD, The Knight of Romance (浪漫骑士, 2008); however, many of these albums from non-mainstream groups never achieve the popularity that turn them into musical figures of national adoration. Even Cui Jian, the father of Chinese Rock, had his latest CD Show You Color (给你一点颜色, 2005) bomb. To put it simply, the majority of Chinese youth generally find it hard it to relate to the lyrics and melodies of some of the more hardcore rock...|$|R

My father literally dug a living out of the dirt. He never complained. He always whistled happily when coming to the house after a long work day. He worked til dark every day and a half day on Saturday. His education was limited. He had only four years of elementary school. Even so he had an appetite for reading. He had little or no money but he subscribed to the morning paper and many times he would subscribe to the evening paper.He became a fan of Huey P. Long. He was not mesmerized by him, but Long ...would find a way to help poor people like him to get a break in life. As governor, Long had blacktopped the roads, made education more accessible to the poor, and brought Louisiana into the 20th century. Elected to the U.S. Senate, he had big plans for the entire nation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had great concerns of Huey's popularity... Long's message was resonating with depression-plagued people across the country. Some people, to this day, believe FDR arranged Long's assassination. ...Huey P. Long was a very wealthy man. He was unscrupulous in his acquiring a fortune and he passed it on to his children and they to their children ... Socialist leaders always {{find a way to get}} wealth and hand out crumbs to the poor to keep them in line and stay in power. History is trying to repeat itself. Socialists are preaching the distribution of wealth in the same manner as Huey P. Long, but with a more sophisticated twist. They fain identification with the poor in their efforts to control them. Modern-day socialists and communists are well organized in this country. They have been making great strides toward their goal of power and control.
