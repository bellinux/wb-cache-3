50|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} as to the way that such associations hold rights. A transfer may be considered {{to have been made}} to the association's members directly as joint tenants or tenants in common. Alternatively, the funds transferred may be considered to have been under the terms of a <b>private</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> Many purpose trusts fail for want of a beneficiary and this may therefore may result in the gift failing. However, some purpose trusts are valid, and, accordingly, some cases have decided that the rights associated with unincorporated associations are held on this basis. The dominant theory, however, is that the rights are transferred to the members or officers absolutely, perhaps on trust for the members, but are importantly bound by contracts inter se.|$|E
50|$|The second {{alternative}} {{is that the}} gift is to the trustees, or those officers who might properly be considered trustees, to be held on trust {{for the purposes of}} the association in a <b>private</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>trust.</b> As a result, many such gifts will fail for want of a beneficiary capable of enforcing the terms of the trust, as with private purposes trusts generally. However, the decision in Re Denley's Trust Deed allows for some trusts of this type to be held valid, and, accordingly, the case of Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts applied this construction to the rights held by an unincorporated association. Reform to purpose trusts, such as making such a trust enforceable by a named individual (the chairman or treasurer, for example) rather than by a beneficiary (of which there may be none) would impact the role of the purpose trust in the voluntary association context.|$|E

40|$|The Uniform Trustee Act {{provides}} for the enforcement of certain non-charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> This paper draws on that concept but extends it by recommending {{an expansion of the}} range of potential enforcement methods for all types of express trusts whether they are for non-charitable purposes, charitable purposes or for persons. In particular, it recommends that, for all types of express trusts, settlors be allowed to indicate possible enforcers. It also recommends that courts be allowed, unless the settlor indicates otherwise, to grant standing to persons to enforce express trusts whether for persons, non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes. It further recommends allowing for Crown enforcement of all types of express trusts (not just charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts)</b> in statutorily specified situations and it recommends extending the availability of cypr√®s and administrative scheme orders to statutorily-identified non-charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> The paper also argues that with Crown enforcement of all types of express trusts in statutorily specified situations, it is no longer necessary to retain several of the distinct features of charitable <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts,</b> such as exclusivity, public benefit and the invalidity of political <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> * Mark Gillen (B.

The West Sussex case considered the effect of the association's dissolution on the rights held by the trust where the trust did indeed fail.

The invalidity of <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> is commonly said to have been set in Morice v Bishop of Durham.

Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, argues that {{this is an example of}} the [...] "strict" [...] rule against <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> A looser application was found in Cocks v Manners, a case with almost identical facts, where the court decided that the trust was valid as a gift to every member of the order individually, with the Mother Superior acting as a trustee.|$|R

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{objections}} to the idea of <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> being valid. Firstly, English trusts law requires there be certainty of what the trust's goal is; most <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> are for vaguely worded requests, such as the [...] "maintenance of good relations between nations [...] the preservation of the independence of newspapers" [...] found in Re Astor. Secondly, there is a general principle that there must be ascertainable beneficiaries. This is because, as said in Morice, [...] "Every trust (other than a charitable one) must have a definite object. There must be somebody, in whose favour the court can decree performance". If there are no beneficiaries, nobody can enforce the trust in the event that the trustees fail to carry out their duties. The third objection is that of perpetuity; a trust cannot exist for all time. The standard rule is that no trust can be drafted so that any interest lasts for longer than the life of the beneficiary, plus 21 years. In addition, no trust can be found valid if its interests last longer than this period. <b>Purpose</b> <b>trusts,</b> without beneficiaries, would cause unnecessary confusion if found valid because there is no marker by which to measure its existence. <b>Purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> may also be held to be invalid as a matter of public policy, where the courts conclude that the purpose is [...] "eccentric or capricious and the court regards it as useless".|$|R
25|$|A <b>purpose</b> <b>trust</b> in English {{law is a}} trust {{created for}} the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against <b>purpose</b> <b>trusts.</b> If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in some respect. <b>Purpose</b> <b>trusts</b> can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|R
