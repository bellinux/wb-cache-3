50|$|The {{start of}} the Claas group took place in 1913 when August Claas, {{developed}} the company in Clarholz, Germany. In 1919, the business was transferred to Harsewinkel, Germany, where the company focused on the production of reapers. Two years later the company obtained their first patent - for a knotter to efficiently bind straw. In 1930, the first Harvester was developed with the European market in mind with the first <b>Pick-up</b> <b>Baler</b> following in 1934. In 1936 Claas started to market the first combine harvester built in Europe, as opposed to imported machines previously available. They then offered trailed combine harvesters (reaper-binders) to the European market.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is focused}} on evaluation of round balers. It is about comparsion of machines from major producers of harvest equipment Krone and Pöttinger. The goal was to find out qualitative and quantitative differences between round baler Pöttinger Rollprofi 3200 LSC with fixed compression chamber and Krone KR 10 - 16 s with variable compression chamber. It was evaluated performance, forage quality, cutting quality, the measure of copressibility and economic indicators. The result was a finding, {{that in terms of}} quality of work, both machines are comparable. The differences are in purchase costs of machines, as a result of higher fixed costs of <b>pick-up</b> <b>baler</b> Krone KR 10 - 16 s. Next differences appears, when different diameters of bales are needed. Then a <b>pick-up</b> <b>baler</b> with variable compression chamber must be used...|$|E

5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{wire tying}} balers used 2 wires. It {{was not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers</b> were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square twine tying baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying hay balers. In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers.</b> Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers</b> were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the comparison of energy demands of fixed- and variable- chamber silage balers. The {{first part of the}} thesis deals with the fodder plants (importance, crop and agrophysical characteristics) and <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers</b> (agrotechnical requirements, division, description and construction of balers). The second part contains measured values and results. To compare the energy demands I have chosen the fixed-chamber silage baler CLAAS ROLLANT 250 ROTOCUT and the variable-chamber silage baler KRONE VARIOPACK 1800 MULTICUT. With both balers I compared their unit weight, performance and fuel consumption measuring. The measuring took place during the hey and silage crops (three cuttings). The gathered data was used for further calculations...|$|R
40|$|After {{accession}} to the EU in 2004 {{the demand for}} tractors and agricultural implements has grown, followed by increasing supply of them. In 2012, the supply of brand-new agricultural tractors was by 185. 4 % higher than in 2003. In 2012 the value of renovation index of tractor fleet in agriculture was by 149. 3 % higher than in 2003. In spite of significant increase of demand for tractors, their production in 2012 was by 39. 2 % lower than in 2003. The downfall in number of tractors produced in Poland caused that imported tractors achieved more and more important share in supplies on Polish market. In 2003 the share of imports amounted to 64. 0 % and in 2012 – 91. 4 %. Production of most other means of agricultural mechanization was in 2012 higher than in 2003. The increase {{in a case of}} manure spreaders amounted to 704. 3 %; self loading or unloading agricultural tractor trailers – 362. 1 %; fertilizer spreader – 335. 2 %; field sowing machines – 245. 3 %; <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers</b> – 222. 1 % and harvester threshers – 194. 8. Decreases were noted in cases of steamers – by 73. 3 %; potato planters – by 49. 7 %; harrows other than disc ones – by 42. 2 %; potato diggers – by 31. 2 % and rototillers – by 22. 8 %...|$|R
40|$|This Diploma Theses {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of two <b>pick-up</b> <b>balers</b> which compress crop into compact bales. The balers are made and delivered by different manufacturers with a variable bale chamber and cutting mode {{at the moment of}} haylage, hay and straw harvesting. Specifically, the given assessment compared John Deere 960 Baler and Kuhn VB 2160 Baler while considering the following parameters: quality of cutting, bale density, haylage, capacity and performance, economic analysis and recommendation for their use in agriculture. John Deere 960 Baler achieved better results in the majority of performed tests. The values of bale density were the following: 666. 25 kg. m- 3 (haylage), 221. 39 kg. m- 3 (hay), 176. 62 kg. m- 3 (straw). The assessment of haylage quality was excellent. The given baler (JD 960) also excelled at harvesting capacities: 20. 89 t. h- 1 (haylage), 15. 61 t. h- 1 (hay) and 12. 54 t. h- 1 (straw). Baling costs per 1 kilogram of forage revealed the following figures: 0. 036 CZK (haylage), 0. 079 CZK (hay) and 0. 101 CZK (straw). Costs assessment for practical use of both balers per operating year indicates that the JD 960 Baler´s use is more cost effective by 1, 320 CZK per 100 hectares (haylage), by 2, 690 CZK (hay) and by 6, 000 CZK (straw) in comparison with Kuhn VB 2160 Baler. As a consequence, the use and operation of John Deere 960 Baler can be recommended to large-sized companies with a sufficient amount of financial resources which can be invested in purchase of the given machinery. The baler is suitable for large areas with the demanding seasonal harvesting. On the other hand, Kuhn VB 2160 Baler did not show such an impressive result as JD 960 Baler. However, its use and operation is recommended to small or medium-sized agricultural companies which can appreciate the baler´s performance especially during hay and straw harvesting...|$|R
40|$|This thesis for {{bachelor}} degree {{focuses on a}} comparison of <b>pick-up</b> round <b>balers,</b> one with a variable bale chamber (baler John Deere 580 with cutting) and one with a constant bale chamber (baler Krone Rond Pack 1250 MultiCut). The two balers were compared in respect {{to the quality of}} cutting, bale density and haylage quality. Other compared parameters included capacity, costs of baling, packaging, loading and transport of baled fodder, analysis of costs per 1 kg of fodder and simple analyses of investment and operating costs. The quality of haylage was better for the JD 580 baler and it was classified as excellent. The baler Round Pack 1250 produced better values of bale density: 221. 09 kg. m- 3 for hay, 428. 57 kg. m- 3 for haylage and 173. 46 kg. m- 3 for straw. Hourly baling capacities were 8. 12 t. h- 1 for hay and 11. 55 t. h- 1 for haylage. The baling costs were 104. 2 CZK. t- 1 for haylage and 210. 36 CZK. t- 1 for hay. The costs per 1 hectare were 376. 6 CZK and the costs per 1 kg of haylage and hay were 0. 539 CZK. kg- 1 and 0. 606 CZK. kg- 1 respectively...|$|R
