5000|$|A {{circus tent}} usually has {{one or more}} oval or {{circular}} arenas surrounded by tiered seating which might accommodate thousands of people. Nowadays such large tents are made of some artificial fibre (<b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl)</b> and are often erected {{with the help of}} cranes. In earlier times it was common for the circus elephants {{to be used as a}} source of power for pulling ropes to haul the canvas into position.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{this process}} uses a low {{viscosity}} (100 to 1000 cP) <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> ester resin along with fiberglass fibers {{to create a}} composite. Normally the process is capable of producing composites with a fiber volume fraction between 40-50%. The resin to fiber ratio is important for determining the overall strength and performance of the final part, with mechanical strength being most influenced {{by the type of}} fiber reinforcement. The type of resin used will primarily determine the corrosion resistance, heat distortion temperature, and surface finish. Resins used in this process must have low viscosities due to the limited pressure differential provided by the vacuum pump. High performance fibers, such as carbon fiber, can also be used. However, their usage is less common and is mainly for the fabrication of high end parts.|$|R
50|$|An awning or {{overhang}} is {{a secondary}} covering {{attached to the}} exterior wall of a building. It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic, cotton <b>or</b> <b>polyester</b> yarn, <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> laminated to <b>polyester</b> fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium, iron or steel, possibly coot or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light {{as possible in the}} winter). The configuration of this structure is something of a truss, space frame or planar frame. Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting. These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fiber diameter, trigger {{geometry}} and section geometry on the crush response of pultruded glass {{fiber reinforced plastic}} tubes, made with either <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> <b>vinyl</b> ester resin, was determined at crush rates from 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s to &mdash; 15 m/s. The rate dependence of the specific energy for the polyester resin tubes was positive, whereas that for the vinyl resin tubes could be either positive or negative, depending upon the par-ticular tube geometry. Increases in the specific energy absorption, previously observed in quasi-static loading, caused by changes in the crush trigger geometry, were found also for dynamic loading. Reductions in the fiber diameter by one half (nominal), for the same glass content, decreased the specific energy by up to &sim; 20 %. Differences in the resin affect the quasi-static crush resistance, the vinyl ester resin tubes having a significantly higher specific energy {{than that of the}} polyester resin tubes. These differences tend to diminish for dynamic crush. Fiber delamination occurs more profusely under dynamic loading con-ditions, and it is suggested that a crush mode change occurs on passing from quasi-static to dynamic loading. A tendency to crush in an unstable manner was found for some square sections under dynamic loading, possibly due to the accumulation of crush debris in the tube interior...|$|R
50|$|A release agent, {{usually in}} either wax or liquid form, {{is applied to}} the chosen mold to allow {{finished}} product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin—typically a 2-part thermoset <b>polyester,</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>or</b> epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly, before the resin starts to cure, unless high temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven. In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.|$|R
