The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support <b>project</b> <b>personnel,</b> who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five air operations centers were created in Laos – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E

The Nivaga III and Manu Folau provide round trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks and travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti 3 to 4 times a year. The Manu Folau is a 50-metre vessel that was a gift from Japan to the people of Tuvalu. In 2015 the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) assisted the government of Tuvalu to acquire MV Talamoana, a 30-metre vessel that will be used to implement Tuvalu's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to transport government officials and <b>project</b> <b>personnel</b> to the outer islands. In 2015 the Nivaga III was donated by the government of Japan; it replaced the Nivaga II, which had serviced Tuvalu from 1989.|$|E

According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a moderately slow groove tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–C–Bm–A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm–A–B9–A7–Dm–C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

The project’s aims are to (a) train their medical personnel at WMC, (b) travel to participat-ing countries to teach, evaluate patients, operate, and promote the development of local centers, and (c) treat children with CHD, at WMC, who lack a local option for care either due to prohibitive costs or unavailability. The <b>project’s</b> <b>personnel</b> are state employees who volunteer to treat additional patients within the framework of their salaries, and community volunteers. Results.
