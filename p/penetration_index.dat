A handlebody of genus g (Henkelkorper von Geschlechte g, [8], p. 219) is a tame closed regular neighbourhood of a wedge of g circles. If g — 1, such a handlebody is a solid torus (i. e., the topo-logical product of Sι with a 2 -disc, called "Vollring " in [7]), and if ίf = 0 we have a 3 -cell. The <b>penetration</b> <b>index</b> Pg(k, p) of k at p, relative to handlebodies of genus g, is the smallest integer n such that there exist arbitrarily small neighbourhoods of p which are handlebodies of genus g, each meeting k on its boundary in n points.

The DCPT tests were conducted at eight sites. The nuclear gage and sand cone methods were used to estimate the dry density and moisture content of the subgrade soils.

The total extent of thoracic injury, Penetrating Thoracic Trauma Index (PTTI), was measured. When associated abdominal injury was present, it was assessed by the Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI) of Moore et al. The severity of total injury sustained by the patient, represented by the Penetrating Trauma Index (PTI), {{was determined by the}} sum total of these scores. The extent of physiologic abnormality induced by cardiac <b>penetration,</b> (Physiologic <b>Index</b> or PI), was graded on a scale of increasing severity from 5 - 20 based on the vital signs of patients on admission. Analysis of 112 patients with penetrating cardiac injuries (1973 - 1983) revealed that the indices, PCTI and PI, showed an excellent correlation with survival (R 2 = 0. 827 and 0. 928, respectively) as did the total extent of trauma (PTI). A composite prognostic score of the sum of PI and PTI demonstrated a significant separation of survivors from nonsurvivors (p less than 0. 001).

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify contact areas by using different methodologies, and pressures of farm equipment employed in production activity and evaluate structural changes caused in a Red Latosol with the presence and absence of straw cover. The design was completely randomized in a factorial scheme of type 4 (tire on front axle, tire on rear axle, tire on a sugarcane wagon and metallic track of sugar cane Harvester) x 2 (presence and absence of straw). The contact area (CA) of the run was obtained by three procedures: analytical measure of the area of an ellipse (CA 1); digital measurement of area of an ellipse (CA 2); and measurement of real contact area (RCA), with digital resources. The contact pressure was calculated from the ratio of mass of each machine's axle and the contact area of the run. The contact area obtained according to the procedure of the ellipse (CA 1 and CA 2) is overrated when compared to actual area obtained digitally (RCA). The straw reduces the contact pressure in the soil, due to the deep tire treads and consequently, increased contact area. Areas where the traffic of the machines occurred with soil covered with the presence of straw showed reduced soil resistance to <b>penetration,</b> cone <b>index</b> and pre-consolidation pressure, confirming that the increased contact area produced by straw reduced the pressure applied and the compression power dissipated in the soil...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceIntegration of Distributed Generation (DG) {{increases}} the intricacy {{of the distribution}} feeder. Determining the optimal location of DG with minimized complexity is an important task for distribution engineers. The DG integration requires the evaluation of technical aspects that demands a wide network of vulnerability and operational effects. The test network adopted in this network is modeled as a directed graph network that is formed from a power flow method in Backward-Forward-Sweep algorithm. The topological importance of each node is derived from betweenness centrality to represent the weights. A DG unit is used to supply the real and reactive power. An Optimal Performance Index (OPI) is introduced in this work to combine technical and critical indices, namely real and reactive power loss, voltage deviation, voltage and current harmonic distortion, vulnerability and marginal <b>indices</b> for DG <b>penetration</b> with Vulnerability <b>Index</b> (VI) weightage factor.

These pressure oscillations were studied in a high pressure single sector combustor with optical access. Two damper configurations were installed and tested {{with respect to their}} damping efficiency in relation to the configuration without dampers. For a variety of test conditions, derived from a part load case, time traces of pressure in the combustor were measured, and amplitudes were derived from their Fourier transformation. These measurements were performed for several combinations of the operating parameters, i. e., injector pressure drop, air/fuel ratio (AFR), pilot/main fuel split, and preheat temperature. These tests “ranked” the respective damper configurations and their individual efficiency with respect to the configuration without dampers. Although a general trend could be observed, the ranking was not strictly consistent for all operating conditions. For several test cases, preferably with pronounced self-excited pressure oscillations, phase-resolved planar optical measurement techniques were applied to investigate the change of spatial structures of fuel, reaction zones, and temperature distributions over a period of an oscillation. A pulsating motion was detected for both pilot and main flame, driven by a pulsating transport of the liquid fuel. This pulsation, in turn, is caused by a fluctuating air velocity, in connection with a prefilming airblast type atomizer. A phase shift between pilot and main injector heat release was observed, corresponding to a shift of fuel <b>penetration.</b> Local Rayleigh <b>indices</b> were calculated qualitatively, based on phase-resolved OH chemiluminescence used as marker for heat release, and corresponding pressure values.

However, this model {{does not account for}} penetration due to rotary drilling bit shear or fluid flow. The simulated rock model is tested for three different strength rock formations. [...] A Specific Energy Index (SEI) and a Performance Index (PI) are employed to evaluate percussive force profiles. SEI reflects the effects of rate of penetration (ROP) and average hammer power where as PI considers rate of penetration, bit force, and input power. SEI is a limited metric because it recommends low frequencies and low rate of <b>penetration.</b> The Performance <b>Index</b> (PI) seems to strike a better compromise between ROP and power, and has the additional potential benefit of accounting for bit wear. [...] To validate the simulated model, rock physical parameters are tuned numerically by introducing a stiffness correction factor (Ks), a damping correction factor (Kb), and considering two different impact test scenarios. Published experimental results from the TerraTek Single Cutter Impact Tester [22, 43 - 45] is used to verify four different rocks, and to study the effect of Bottomhole Mud Pressure (BHP) on penetration and damping correction factors. Another published experimental data from Drilling Research, Inc (DRI) implemented drop tests [48] on Indiana limestone is used to verify the model as well as to observe the change in damping correction factor with four different drop heights. Overall model validation results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Optimal force {{profiles}} {{are essential}} for extracting maximum performance from a percussion drilling system. In this investigation, a visco-elasto-plastic model of rock is simulated using the Bond Graph modeling technique to study the effect of different percussive force profiles on rock failure and to generate optimal force profiles. Physical parameters of the model are estimated from rock material properties like compressive strength, density, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio using Hsieh's equations.
