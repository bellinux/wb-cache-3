50|$|Two {{theories}} have been integrated {{in an attempt}} to account for these differences in work role <b>performance.</b> <b>Trait</b> activation theory posits that within a person trait levels predict future behavior, that trait levels differ between people, and that work-related cues activate traits which leads to work relevant behaviors. Role theory suggests that role senders provide cues to elicit desired behaviors. In this context, role senders (i.e.: supervisors, managers, et cetera) provide workers with cues for expected behaviors, which in turn activates personality traits and work relevant behaviors. In essence, expectations of the role sender lead to different behavioral outcomes depending on the trait levels of individual workers and because people differ in trait levels, responses to these cues will not be universal.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Understanding the {{relationship}} between species and environments {{is at the heart}} of ecology and biology. Ranges of species depend strongly on environmental factors, but our limited understanding of relationships between range and trait stability of species across environments hampers our ability to predict their future ranges. Species that occur over a wide range (and thus have wide niche breadth) will have high variation in morpho-physiological traits in response to environmental conditions, thereby permitting stability of performance traits and enabling plants to survive in a range of environments. We hypothesized that species' niche breadth is negatively correlated with the rate of <b>performance</b> <b>trait</b> change along an environmental gradient. Location: Northern China. Methods: We analysed standing biomass and height of 48 species of Asteraceae (Artemisia and its close relatives) collected from 65 sites along an environmental gradient across northern China. Results: In support of our hypothesis, there were significant negative correlations between climatic niche breadth and rate of change in biomass, a <b>performance</b> <b>trait,</b> but not in height, which is both a morphological and a <b>performance</b> <b>trait.</b> Conclusions: These findings have implications for risk assessment of species under climate change and prediction of unknown distributions of species. They also offer a new avenue of research for species distribution models. We show that there were significant negative correlations between climatic niche breadth and rate of change in biomass, a <b>performance</b> <b>trait,</b> but not in height, which is both a morphological and <b>performance</b> <b>trait.</b> Our findings have implications for risk assessment of species under climate change and prediction of unknown distributions of species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Selection {{programmes}} {{based on}} prion protein (PrP) genotypes are being implemented for increasing resistance to scrapie. Commercial meat sheep populations participating in sire-referencing schemes were simulated {{to investigate the}} effect of selection on PrP genotypes on ARR and VRQ allele frequencies, inbreeding and genetic gain in a <b>performance</b> <b>trait</b> under selection. PrP selection strategies modelled included selection against the VRQ allele and in favour of the ARR allele. Assuming realistic initial PrP frequencies, selection against the VRQ allele had a minimal impact on performance and inbreeding. However, when selection was also in favour of the ARR allele {{and the frequency of}} this allele was relatively low, there was a loss of up to three to four years of genetic gain over the 15 years of selection. Most loss in gain occurred during the first five years. In general, the rate of inbreeding was reduced when applying PrP selection. Since animals were first selected on their PrP genotype before being selected on the <b>performance</b> <b>trait,</b> the intensity of selection on performance was weaker under PrP selection (compared with no PrP selection). Eradication of the VRQ allele or fixation of the ARR allele within 15 years of selection was possible only with PrP selection targeting all breeding animals. </p...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Job performance is a multidimensional construct that can be dichotomized as task and contextual job performance. Task-related performance pertains to the technical core of a job and contextual job performance involves behaviors that support the environment in which the technical core functions. Theory and empirical evidence indicate that organizational socialization, the process by which newcomers learn the ropes of an organization, affects both task-related and contextual performance. In turn, organizational socialization is likely to be influenced by trait Socialization, an individual's tendency to behave in an antisocial or prosocial manner. The primary goal of this thesis was to estimate the validity of both organizational and trait Socialization for the prediction of task-related and contextual job performance. Results indicate that organizational socialization outcome measures and trait Socialization correlate significantly with both task and contextual job <b>performance.</b> <b>Trait</b> Socialization and one of the organizational socialization outcome measures have higher correlations with contextual job performance than with task <b>performance.</b> <b>Trait</b> Socialization accounts for variance in the job performance measures above the variance accounted for by the organizational socialization measures.

40|$|The {{effect of}} drought {{stress on the}} {{association}} of nodule <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> with shoot <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> was studied using six common bean lines with contrasting differences in their adaptation to drought and low phosphorus (P) availability in soil. Drought stress reduced leaf water potential and gas exchange characteristics (CO 2 assimilation, stomatal conductance) in all lines tested but two drought-tolerant lines, BAT 477 and BT_ 34 - 1,- 1 were superior {{in their ability to}} adjust their leaf water status under drought. These two lines were also superior in root growth, rate of CO 2 assimilation, vegetative biomass production, and nitrogen fixing ability under drought stress. A direct relation between symbiotic nitrogen fixation and nodule fresh weight with gas exchange traits as well as biomass production existed suggesting that relative growth of shoot vs. root depends on the provision of nitrogen by symbiotic nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic carbon assimilation. Overall, differences found in nodule, root and shoot <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> indicated that the P-efficient bean line (BT_ 34 - 1 - 1) was superior than the other lines in terms of adaptation to drought.

Significant fixed effects (company, sex and batch), covariates (birth weight, cold carcass weight, and age), random effects (additive, litter and maternal) were fitted in the statistical models. A series of pairwise bivariate analyses were implemented in ASREML to estimate heritability, phenotypic, and genetic {{correlations between}} <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> (n = 9) with meat quality (n = 25) and carcass (n = 19) traits. The animals had a pedigree compromised of 9, 439 animals over 15 generations. <b>Performance</b> <b>traits</b> had low-to-moderate heritabilities (6 SE), ranged from 0. 0760. 13 to 0. 4560. 07 for weaning weight, and ultrasound backfat depth, respectively. Genetic correlations between <b>performance</b> and carcass <b>traits</b> were moderate to high. The results indicate that: (a) selection for birth weight may increase drip loss, lightness of longissimus dorsi, and gluteus medius muscles but may reduce fat depth; (b) selection for nursery weight can be valuable for increasing both {{quantity and quality}} traits; (c) selection for increased daily gain may increase the carcass weight {{and most of the}} primal cuts. These findings suggest that deterioration of pork quality may have occurred over many generations through the selection for less backfat thickness, and feed efficiency, but selection for growth had no adverse effects on pork quality. Low-to-moderate heritabilities for <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> indicate that they could be improved using traditional selection or genomic selection.

Results of analysis indicated low estimates of heritability for lifetime <b>performance</b> <b>traits,</b> e. g., lifetime production and profit (. 11 $ sim$. 13) and longevity (. 07 $ sim$. 09). However, production per day of productive life traits had moderate heritability (. 28 $ sim$. 32). Estimates of genetic and phenotypic parameters decreased from part-lifetime to total lifetime performance because residual variances increased at a greater rate compared to rate of increase in sire variances. Both genetic and phenotypic correlations amongst lifetime production, lifetime profit and longevity traits were very high and approached unity in all cases. Estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations of first lactation production and profit traits with all measures of part and total lifetime performance were positive and high. These correlations decrease from part-lifetime to total lifetime performance due to part to whole relationships. Estimates of parameters of lifetime <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> were mostly free of the effects of selection on milk production. Positive and high genetic correlation of first lactation milk yield with all lifetime <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> indicated that selection on first lactation milk yield alone will improve all measures of lifetime performance.

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the possible association of the PrP genotype and <b>performance</b> <b>traits.</b> The data included 963 genotyped females born between 1991 and 1998 in an experimental Texel flock, in which the Booroola gene was introgressed. The associations of the PrP gene were evaluated using a single trait animal model. The allele frequency from the herd mostly corresponds with genotyped rams in the Netherlands in the same period. The results indicate no significant associations with litter size, and only 3 of 112 estimated associations with weight, growth and body measurements were significant, with a low significance level. Therefore it can be concluded that selection for ARR/ARR rams in this experimental herd seem to have no effect on the <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> due to association. The included data from this study is compared to data from other studies estimating associations between PrP genotype and <b>performance</b> <b>traits.</b> The comparison suggests of a possible small effect, which is only detectable in large datasets, which could be a result of linkage to the PrP genotyp...|$|R
40|$|Meat quality, carcass {{composition}} and <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> were measured in two selection lines selected for either low backfat thickness (BF) {{at a fixed}} live weight or high live weight (WEIGHT) at a fixed age. The <b>performance</b> <b>traits</b> were measured on 3966 to 3985, carcass composition trait on 278 and meat quality traits on 426 to 490 pigs. The meat quality traits were: pH, measured 45 min and 24 h after slaughter in M. semimembranosus and M. longissimus, filter paper score and filter paper weight measuring water-holding capacity, Japanese colour scale and Hunter's colour measurements and a marbling score. Phenotypic and genetic correlations with meat quality traits were higher for lean percentage (LEAN%) and WEIGHT than for BF. From the genetic correlations between performance and meat quality traits and the correlated genetic response of meat quality traits to selection for <b>performance</b> <b>traits,</b> {{it was concluded that}} deterioration of meat quality over many generations occurs. Correlations indicate that BF as an index trait for leanness would result in less deterioration of meat quality than when selecting for LEAN%. The genetic trends showed that selection for WEIGHT resulted in more deterioration of meat quality than selection for BF. A pH measurement 45 min after slaughter could be a good indicator for improving water-holding capacity...|$|R
