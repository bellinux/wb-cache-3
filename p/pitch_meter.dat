Our ultimate aim is to obtain a model that can separate two simultaneous sounds {{on the basis of}} the harmonic structure of at least one of the sounds.

The main modifications incorporated in MDWS consist of a more faithful modeling of auditory frequency analysis and of an alteration to the criterion used to decide which fundamental best fits a set of resolved components. Effects of the latter modification were investigated in a comparison between model estimates of the pitch of inharmonic complex signals and results obtained for humans. Furthermore, the accuracy of model estimates of the pitch of periodic signals (among which were synthesized vowel sounds), partially masked by noise, was compared with the just noticeable difference of fundamental frequency of these sounds for human observers.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{embodied}} music cognition {{states that the}} perception and cognition of music is firmly, although not exclusively, linked to action patterns associated with that music. In this regard, the focus lies mostly on how music promotes certain action tendencies (i. e., dance, entrainment, etc.). Only recently, studies have started to devote attention to the reciprocal effects that people’s body movements may exert on how people perceive certain aspects of music and sound (e. g., <b>pitch,</b> <b>meter,</b> musical preference, etc.). The present study positions itself in this line of research. The central research question is whether expressive body movements, which are systematically paired with music, can modulate children’s perception of musical expressiveness. We present a behavioral experiment in which different groups of children (7 – 8 years, N = 46) either repetitively performed a happy or a sad choreography in response to expressively ambiguous music or merely listened to that music. The results of our study show indeed that children’s perception of musical expressiveness is modulated {{in accordance with the}} expressive character of the dance choreography performed to the music.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in hearing theory {{have resulted in}} the rather general acceptance of the idea that the perception of pitch of complex sounds {{is the result of the}} psychological pattern recognition process. The pitch is supposedly mediated by the fundamental of the harmonic spectrum which fits the spectrum of the complex sound optimally. The problem of finding the pitch is then equivalent to finding the best harmonic match. Goldstein [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 54, 1496 - 1516 (1973) ] has described an objective procedure for finding the best fit for stimuli containing relatively few spectral components. He uses a maximum likelihood criterion. Application of this procedure to various data on the pitch of complex sounds yielded good results. This motivated our efforts to apply the pattern recognition theory of pitch to the problem of measuring pitch in speech. Although we were able to follow the main line of Goldstein's procedure, some essential changes had to be made. The most important is that in our implementation not all spectral components of the complex sound have to be classified as belonging to the harmonic pattern. We introduced a harmonics sieve to determine whether components are rejected or accepted at a candidate pitch. A simple criterion, based on the components accepted and rejected, led to the decision on which candidate pitch was to be finally selected. The performance and reliability of this psychoacoustically based <b>pitch</b> <b>meter</b> were tested in a LPC-vocoder system...|$|E

40|$|Within recent {{performance}} {{studies the}} expressive gestures performers employ in shaping melodic patterns received much attention from researchers. According to a commonly proposed argument, {{the experience of}} motion we have when listening to melodic patterns arises from the recognition of similarities between such patterns and various bodily gestures. Our understanding of gestural meaning depends partly on the structural properties of the melodic patterns as defined by <b>pitch,</b> <b>meter,</b> rhythm and harmony. More importantly, however, attribution of gestural significance derives {{to a large extent}} from the expressive shaping of the melodic figure by the performer through variations in tempo, dynamics, vibrato, etc. In the words of one researcher, ‘to be realized as gestural a pattern must be embodied in an act of performance which conveys a unitary impulse of some kind, or at least be capable of being so embodied’ (Cumming 2000 : 136). One aim of empirical performance research based on measuring the so-called expressive variations has been to explore the microstructure of gestural shapes that performers give to melodic patterns. In these studies, measurements involving spectral and wave-form analysis start with the onset of the sound initiating the musical unit being scrutinized. Obviously, in the absence of sounding phenomena there is nothing to measure. In this chapter, the author presents research regarding initiatory physical movements carried out by the performer before a gestural unit actually starts sounding. These movements take place at the beginning of, and in between, musical gestural units. As such, they are often performed in silence. While they have been entirely neglected in recent performance studies, for the performer, such preparatory gestures are both physically and psychologically {{an integral part of the}} sounding pattern. They prepare the moment of impact between the body and the instrument, and have a profound effect on the expressive/affective shape of the sounding part of the complete gesture. They greatly contribute to the elusive performance phenomenon of touch, and are to a certain degree specific to the instrument. As a professional pianist herself, the author draws all her examples from the piano repertoire. After presenting a short historical survey of relevant literature, she discusses the research methodology appropriate for studying initiatory performance gestures, which she describes through a phenomenological approach. She argues that particular kinds of initiatory gestures are related to particular rhythmic structures. She explores their possible origins in the light of recent neuropsychological and neurophysiological discoveries, and asks whether they have commonalities with gestures we observe in non-musical contexts. She concludes that unless empirical performance research takes these ‘silent’ gestures into account, resulting accounts of performance expression would necessarily remain incomplete.

40|$|This article {{departs from}} many {{discussions of the}} origin, evolution, and {{adaptive}} function(s) of music by treating music not as perceptual qualities (<b>pitch,</b> timbre, <b>meter),</b> formal elements (prosody, melody, harmony, rhythm), performed activity (singing, drumming), or genre (lullaby, song, dance). Rather, music is conceptualized as a behavioral and motivational capacity: what is done to sounds and pulses when they are "musified" made into music and why. For this new view, I employ the ethological notion of ritualization, wherein ordinary communicative behaviors (e. g., sounds, movements) are altered through formalization, repetition, exaggeration, and elaboration, thereby attracting attention and arousing and shaping emotion. The universal sensitivity of infants as young as 8 weeks to such alterations of (or operations on) voice, facial expression, and body movements, when these are presented to them by adults in intimate dyadic interactions within a shared temporal framework, suggests an evolved, adaptive capacity that enabled and reinforced emotional bonding. Such proto-aesthetic (proto-musical) operations existed as a reservoir from which individual cultures could draw when inventing art-saturated ritual ceremonies that united groups temporally and emotionally as they did mother-infant pairs. Music in its origins and evolution {{is assumed to be}} multimodal (visual and kinesic, as well as aural) and a social not solitary activity. An appendix describes important structural and functional resemblances between music, mother-infant interaction, ceremonial ritual, and adult courtship and lovemaking (as differentiated from copulation). These resemblances suggest not only an evolutionary relationship among these behaviors but argue for the existence of an evolved amodal neural propensity in the human species to respond cognitively and emotionally to dynamic temporal patterns produced by other humans in contexts of affiliation. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies. A behavioral failure on {{this test is}} diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls.
