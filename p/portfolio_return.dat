25|$|In finance, {{a common}} problem is to choose a {{portfolio}} when there are two conflicting objectives — the desire to have the expected value of portfolio returns {{be as high as}} possible, and the desire to have risk, often measured by the standard deviation of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the efficient frontier shows the best combinations of risk and expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first moment) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of <b>portfolio</b> <b>return</b> is called a two-moment decision model.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether UK <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns</b> are time varying so that expected returns follow an AR(1) process {{as proposed by}} Conrad and Kaul for the USA. It explores this hypothesis for four portfolios that have been formed {{on the basis of}} market capitalization. The <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns</b> are modelled using a kalman filter signal extraction model in which the unobservable expected return is the state variable and is allowed to evolve as a stationary first order autoregressive process. It finds that this model is a good representation of returns and can account for most of the autocorrelation present in observed <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> This study concludes that UK <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns</b> are time varying {{and the nature of the}} time variation appears to introduce a substantial amount of autocorrelation to <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> Like Conrad and Kaul if finds a link between the extent to which <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns</b> are time varying and the size of firms within a portfolio but not the monotonic one found for the USA. ...|$|R

2500|$|The IRR method {{measures}} {{return in}} the presence of external cash flows. The assumptions of users of the method are independent of the IRR method itself. When comparing investments, making a naive implicit assumption that cash flows are reinvested at the same IRR, would tend to lead to false conclusions. If cash flows received are not reinvested {{at the same rate as}} the IRR, a project with a relatively short duration and a high IRR does not necessarily add more value over a longer time span than another project with a longer duration and a lower IRR. [...] The Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) addresses this issue by including a second investment at a potentially different rate of return, to calculate a <b>portfolio</b> <b>return</b> without external cash flows over the life of the project. [...] However, for capital budgeting, when the objective is to maximize value, finance theory holds that NPV using the firm's cost of capital is a superior metric.|$|E

Analysing the market-wide and portfolio-specific information effects on <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns</b> shows that above stated lead-lag relation {{is associated with the}} market-wide information content in lagged large cap <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> We also document a directional asymmetry in small (large) cap portfolio returns’ reactions to lagged large (small) cap <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> The evidence is contradicting to the previous findings of McQueen, Pinegar and Thorley (1996) and Marshall and Walker (2002) whoose researches are conducted on US and Chile stock markets.

40|$|Prior studies {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between implied volatility and expected stock returns. The existing literature shows that implied volatilities are an important risk factor affecting expected stock returns. In this paper, we use the CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, to extend the understanding of {{the relationship between}} VIX and <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> The extension includes three folds. First, we investigate the impact of the announcement of the macroeconomic news on implied volatility. The macroeconomic news includes unemployment rate, consumer price index, industrial production index, and the annual growth rate of M 2. Second, we analyze the influence of the announcements of the macroeconomic news and the implied volatility on the announcement date on expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> Third, we test the impact of the volatility of implied volatility on expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> The empirical evidence shows that the announcement of unemployment rate, industrial production index, and the annual growth rate of M 2 have significant effect on the implied volatility and expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns,</b> especially on the growth firms. The announcement of unemployment rate has the significantly negative announcement effect on growth firms. But the announcements of industrial production index and the annual growth rate of M 2 have significantly positive announcement effect on growth firms. The announcement effect of consumer price index on both implied volatility and expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns,</b> however, are not significant relative to other macroeconomic news. In addition, the implied volatilities on the announcement date have no significant effect on expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> Finally, the volatility of implied volatility has significantly negative effect on most expected <b>portfolio</b> <b>returns.</b> 過去有許多學者探討隱含波動度與股票報酬之間的關係，且研究發現隱含波動度確實可視為影響股票報酬的重要風險因子。而本文運用芝加哥選擇權交易所編製的隱含波動度指數VIX，將先前的研究再進一步延伸探討。首先討論總體經濟指標宣告對隱含波動度的影響，本文採用失業率、消費者物價指數、工業生產指數和M 2 年增率為指標性的總體變數。接著討論總體經濟指標宣告對投資組合預期報酬的影響，以及總體經濟指標宣告當日的隱含波動度對投資組合預期報酬的影響。最後再探討隱含波動度的變異性對投資組合預期報酬的影響。實證結果發現失業率、工業生產指數和M 2 年增率的宣告效果，對市場的隱含波動度和投資組合預期報酬有顯著影響，尤其對成長型公司的影響更為明顯。其中失業率宣告對成長型公司有存在顯著負向的影響，M 2 年增率宣告和工業生產指數宣告對成長型公司的預期報酬則有正向關係。消費者物價指數的宣告則較無顯著影響效果，此現象的原因可能來自於股價已反映了部分的通貨膨脹率，因此宣告效果並不顯著。然而，總體經濟指標宣告當日的隱含波動度對所有投資組合預期報酬皆無顯著影響，由此判斷宣告日的隱含波動度改變並不能顯著影響投資人對公司未來表現的預期。最後，隱含波動度的條件變異數對大部分投資組合的預期報酬有顯著負向影響，代表投資人對未來市場的預期受隱含波動度變異的影響。第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 1 第二節 研究目的 3 第三節 研究架構 3 第二章 文獻回顧 5 第一節 隱含波動度與股票報酬 5 第二節 總體經濟指標與股票報酬 6 第三節 總體訊息宣告與波動性 7 第四節 VIX的編制 8 第五節 GARCH文獻 10 第三章 研究方法 12 第一節 資料來源 12 第二節 實證模型 13 第四章 實證結果分析 16 第一節 VIX與市場報酬分析 16 第二節 總體經濟指標宣告對股價報酬分析 16 第三節 VIX的變異數對股價報酬分析 26 第五章 結論與建議 29 第一節 結論 29 第二節 研究限制與建議 30 參考文獻 3...|$|R
