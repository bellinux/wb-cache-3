40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} self-attraction and loading (SAL) induced by the projected accumulation of sea water on shallow continental <b>shelf</b> <b>areas.</b> Using output from a climate model, we compute 21 st century changes in regional steric sea surface height and find that steric changes are largest over the deep ocean and relatively small on the shallow continental shelves. The resulting redistribution of sea water towards the <b>shelf</b> <b>areas</b> leads to mass accumulation on the shelves and therefore to increased gravitational attraction as well as increased loading on the sea floor. We find that, depending on the scenario and region, SAL effects may result in an additional sea level rise of 1 – 3 cm on the world's continental <b>shelf</b> <b>areas</b> {{by the end of}} the 21 st century. These estimates are at most 15 % of the combined changes in sea surface height induced by redistribution of water masses and steric expansion.
