50|$|Some {{consider}} that a French bowline {{is the same as}} a <b>Portuguese</b> <b>bowline,</b> i.e. a bowline with two loops that {{can be used as a}} bosun's chair.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>bowline</b> is {{a variant}} of the bowline with two loops. The two loops are {{adjustable}} in size, unlike the Spanish bowline. Rope can be pulled from one loop into the other one even after tightening. Like the Spanish bowline, it {{can be used as a}} makeshift Bosun's chair.|$|E
50|$|This knot has {{an elegant}} {{symmetry}} {{and can be}} tied quickly when mastered. Unlike the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>bowline,</b> each loop is separately fixed, which is a nice feature. It is a complicated knot however and if not properly tightened, it can slip. A fireman's chair knot is another double loop knot which is more practical, easier to tie and less prone to slipping although it lacks the elegance of a Spanish bowline.|$|E
5000|$|The cowboy bowline (also called [...] "Dutch bowline"), French bowline, and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>bowline</b> are {{variations}} of the bowline, each of which makes one loop. (Names of knots are mostly traditional and may not reflect their origins.) A running bowline {{can be used to}} make a noose which draws tighter as tension is placed on the standing part of the rope. The Birmingham bowline has two loops; the working part is passed twice around the standing part (the [...] "rabbit" [...] makes two trips out of the hole and around the tree). Other two-loop bowline knots include the Spanish bowline and the bowline on the bight; these can be tied in the middle of a rope without access to the ends. A triple bowline is used to make three loops. A Cossack knot is a bowline where the running end goes around the loop-start rather than the main part and has a more symetric triangular shaped knot. A slipped version of the cossack knot is called Kalmyk loop ...|$|E
