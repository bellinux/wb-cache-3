50|$|Welding {{and cutting}} processes, {{including}} arc welding and cutting, {{as well as}} brazing produce intense ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and visible light wavelengths. The UV and IR wavelengths cannot be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately. Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder {{to be able to}} look at the intensely glowing metal being welded. An approved face shield or welding helmet can also have filters for optical radiation protection, and offer additional protection against debris and sparks. UV blocking <b>protective</b> <b>spectacles</b> with side shields or welding goggles are considered primary protection, with the face shield or welding helmet considered secondary protection. This way, the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up.|$|E
50|$|Prevention of ocular {{trauma is}} most {{effective}} when soldiers wear polycarbonate eye armor correctly in the battlefield. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Military have made Ballistic Laser <b>Protective</b> <b>Spectacles</b> (BLPS), Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), and Sun/Wind/Dust Goggles (SWDG) available to combatants and associated personnel. These forms of eye protection are available in non-prescription and prescription lenses, and their use has been made mandatory at all times when soldiers are in areas of potential conflict. Despite their proven record of protection against secondary blast trauma, soldier compliance remains low: 85% of soldiers afflicted ocular trauma {{in the first year}} of OEF were not wearing their protective lenses at the time of detonation. While 41% of soldiers could not recall whether or not they were wearing eye protection at the time of detonation, 17% of casualties were wearing eye protection while 26% of casualties were not. Among this group, the poorest visual prognoses were documented in individuals who did not wear eye protection. The lack of compliance has been attributed to complaints about comfort, stylishness, and “misting” of the lenses when in the field. BLPS and SPECS offer the same line of protection against secondary trauma as the SWD goggles, and these lenses may overcome the complaints many soldiers have with their military-issue goggles.|$|E
40|$|In the {{development}} of protective eyewear for military operations, conflicting constraints impact design considerations. Since protection is a key parameter, {{it is important to}} be able to quantify the impact of different levels of coverage of the visual field. The objective of this project was to merge two different techniques [...] (a) methodology to verify visual field coverage and (b) ray trace model for pupil accessibility [...] to produce a coverage metric to represent retinal accessibility to damage from lasers. Data were collected from nine subjects and a computer model was used to determine the proportion of incident rays that could access the pupil. Overall, the combined result provides an efficient methodology to assist when design trade-offs are required in the evaluation of <b>protective</b> <b>spectacles.</b> This technique can be used to quantify the amount of coverage and assign a conservative level of risk to the areas of the visual field that remain uncovered. INTRODUCTION pupil beyond the limits of the frame. Due to competing design constraints, it is critical to quantify the impact of In {{the development}} of protective eyewear for different levels of coverage of the visual field...|$|E
40|$|Brittle cornea {{syndrome}} (BCS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterised by extreme corneal thinning and fragility. Corneal rupture can therefore occur either spontaneously or following minimal trauma in affected patients. Two genes, ZNF 469 and PRDM 5, {{have now been}} identified, in which causative pathogenic mutations collectively account for the condition in nearly all patients with BCS ascertained to date. Therefore, effective molecular diagnosis is now available for affected patients, and those {{at risk of being}} heterozygous carriers for BCS. We have previously identified mutations in ZNF 469 in 14 families (in addition to 6 reported by others in the literature), and in PRDM 5 in 8 families (with 1 further family now published by others). Clinical features include extreme corneal thinning with rupture, high myopia, blue sclerae, deafness of mixed aetiology with hypercompliant tympanic membranes, and variable skeletal manifestations. Corneal rupture may be the presenting feature of BCS, and it is possible that this may be incorrectly attributed to non-accidental injury. Mainstays of management include the prevention of ocular rupture by provision of <b>protective</b> polycarbonate <b>spectacles,</b> careful monitoring of visual and auditory function, and assessment for skeletal complications such as developmental dysplasia of the hip. Effective management depends upon appropriate identification of affected individuals, which may be challenging given the phenotypic overlap of BCS with other connective tissue disorders...|$|R
40|$|Dipcoating, wherein {{an object}} is {{withdrawn}} from a liquid bath, retaining {{a thin layer}} of liquid which then dries, is perhaps the simplest of coating techniques. SOLA Optical asked the MISG to investigate this process as a means of applying a <b>protective</b> coating to <b>spectacle</b> lenses. The theory, as proposed by the group, involves the 'lubrication' form of the equations of slow viscous flow. This yields an estimate of the wet coating thickness variation, which in turn depends on the liquid properties, the pull rate, and the lens curvature. When this thickness is reduced by the volatile fraction of the coating, predicted thicknesses are in rough agreement with reported values. Once applied, the liquid film drains downward and this effect is modelled numerically. An outline of a more complete model, allowing evaporation and drying, is also presented...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for the production of an anti-reflection, anti-fogging layer on the surface of an optical element (1) by applying an anti-fogging polymer layer (2) to the surface, applying a thin layer (3) onto layer (2) and forming a nano-structure (7) by a plasma-etching process. USE - As optical lenses, lenses for <b>spectacles,</b> <b>protective</b> screens, OP masks, helmet visors for motorcyclists or display covers (especially e. g. display covers made of polyester or triacetylacetate sheet). ADVANTAGE - Improved optical elements with an anti-reflection and anti-fogging layer; the improvement is achieved by forming a nano-structure which is color neutral, even with slanting incident light, and shows a good reflection-reducing action without adversely affecting the anti-fogging layer...|$|R
