40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{a new technique}} of the anorectal fistula treatment with acellular extracellular matrix (AEM). METHODS: Thirty patients with anorectal fistula were treated with AEM. All fistula tracts and <b>primary</b> <b>openings</b> were identified using conventional fistula probe. All tracts were curetted with curet and irrigated with hydrogen peroxide and metronidazole. The AEM was pulled into the fistula tract from secondary to primary opening. The material was secured {{at the level of}} the primary opening. The excess AEM was trimmed at skin level at the secondary opening. RESULTS: All of the 30 patients had successful closure of their fistula after a 7 - 14 d follow-up. The healing rate of anal fistula in treatment group was 100 %. The ache time, healing time and anal deformation of treatment group were obviously superior to traditional surgical methods. CONCLUSION: Using AEM anal fistula plug in treatment that causes the anorectal fistula is safe and successful in 100 % of patients. It can reduce pain, shorten disease course and protect anal function...|$|E

40|$|Why {{do we have}} {{to review}} our {{experience}} in managing idiopathic fistula-in-ano regularly?” In order to answer this apparently simple question, we reviewed our clinical and surgical cases and most important relevant literature to find a rational and scientific answer. It would appear that whatever method you adopt in fistula management, there is a price to pay regarding either rate of recurrence (higher with conservative methods) or impairment of continence (higher with traditional surgery). Since, at the moment, reliable data to identify a treatment as a gold standard in the management of anal fistulas are lacking, the correct approach to this condition must consider all the anatomic and clinicopathological aspects of the disease; this knowledge joined to an eclectic attitude of the surgeon, who should be familiar with different types of treatment, is the only guarantee for a satisfactory treatment. As a conclusion, it is worthwhile to remember that adequate initial treatment significantly reduces recurrence, which, when it occurs, is usually due to failure to recognise the tract and <b>primary</b> <b>opening</b> at the initial operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{employed}} light and electron microscopic methods {{to investigate the}} ontogenetic origin of the olfactory organ in bichirs (Cladistia: Polypteridae) and explore its evolution among osteichthyans. In former studies we demonstrated that in teleosts a subepidermal layer {{gives rise to the}} olfactory placode which in turn builds all types of olfactory cells (basal, receptor, supporting, ciliated non-sensory cells). In contrast, the olfactory placodes in sturgeons (Chondrostei: Acipenseridae) {{as well as in the}} clawed frog Xenopus laevis (Anura: Pipidae) originate from two different layers. Receptor neurons derive from cells of the subepidermal (sensory) layer and supporting cells from epidermal cells. As sturgeons and amphibians in some characters show a more primitive condition than teleosts, we extended our study to Polypterus to allow for an approach at the basic osteichthyan pattern. In Polypterus, an internal lumen occurs in early ontogenetic stages surrounded by the epithelium of the olfactory placode. Two different populations of supporting cells follow one another: a primary population derives from the subepidermal layer. Later supporting cells develop from epidermal cells by transdifferentiation.

5000|$|Unlike {{other species}} of bees, B. affinis queens harvest nectar by [...] "nectar spur perforation" [...] or [...] "nectar robbing". [...] This unique {{harvesting}} behavior is accomplished {{through a number of}} maneuvers. A B. affinis queen must first hang inverted from the edges of the inner petals (occasionally using a neighboring flower to steady herself). [...] After squeezing her head in the space between the inner and outer petals, and using her front legs to push the inner petal forward, she perforates the inner petal to gain easy access to the spur. [...] Because B. affinis has a relatively short tongue, this enables them to have easy access to the spurs, where nectar is abundant ({{other species of}} bees, such as B. fervidus, have much longer tongues, which allows them to gather nectar via the flower's <b>primary</b> <b>opening).</b> [...] After gathering the nectar, the queen then rotates her head, sweeps pollen from her legs, and leaves.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} acellular dermal matrix (ADM) bioprosthetic material and endorectal advancement flap (ERAF) in treatment of complex anorectal fistula. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with complex anorectal fistulae admitted to Anorectal Surgical Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University from March 2008 to July 2009, were enrolled in this study. Complex anorectal fistula was diagnosed following its clinical, radiographic, or endoscopic diagnostic criteria. Under spinal anesthesia, patients underwent identification and irrigation of the fistula tracts using hydrogen peroxide. ADM was securely sutured at the secondary <b>opening</b> to the <b>primary</b> <b>opening</b> using absorbable suture. Outcomes of ADM and ERAF closure were compared in terms of success rate, fecal incontinence rate, anorectal deformity rate, postoperative pain time, closure time and life quality score. Success was defined as closure of all external openings, absence of drainage without further intervention, and absence of abscess formation. Follow-up examination was performed 2 d, 2, 4, 6, 12 wk, and 5 mo after surgery, respectively. RESULTS: No patient was lost to follow-up. The overall success rate was 82. 22 % (37 / 45) 5. 7 mo after surgery. ADM dislodgement occured in 5 patients (11. 11 %), abscess formation was found in 1 patient, and fistula recurred in 2 patients. Of the 13 patients with recurrent fistula using ERAF, 5 (11. 11 %) received surgical drainage because of abscess formation. The success rate, postoperative pain time and closure time of ADM {{were significantly higher than}} those of ERAF (P < 0. 05). However, no difference was observed in fecal incontinence rate and anorectal deformity rate after treatment with ADM and ERAF. CONCLUSION: Closure of fistula tract opening with ADM is an effective procedure for complex anorectal fistula. ADM should be considered a first line treatment for patients with complex anorectal fistula...|$|R
40|$|Anal fistula {{is among}} the most common {{illnesses}} affecting man. Medical literature dating back to 400 BC has discussed this problem. Various causative factors have been proposed throughout the centuries, but it appears that the majority of fistulas unrelated to specific causes (e. g. Tuberculosis, Crohn&#x 2019;s disease) result from infection (abscess) in anal glands extending from the intersphincteric plane to various anorectal spaces. The tubular structure of an anal fistula easily yields itself to division or unroofing (fistulotomy) or excision (fistulectomy) in most cases. The problem with this single, yet effective, treatment plan is that depending on the thickness of sphincter muscle the fistula transgresses, the patient will have varying degrees of fecal incontinence from minor to total. In an attempt to preserve continence, various procedures have been proposed to deal with the fistulas. These include: (1) simple drainage (Seton); (2) closure of fistula tract using fibrin sealant or anal fistula plug; (3) closure of <b>primary</b> <b>opening</b> using endorectal or dermal flaps, and more recently; and (4) ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT). In most complex cases (i. e. Crohn&#x 2019;s disease), a proximal fecal diversion offers a measure of symptomatic relief. The fact remains that an &#x 201 C;ideal&#x 201 D; procedure for anal fistula remains elusive. The failure of each sphincter-preserving procedure (30 %- 50 % recurrence) often results in multiple operations. In essence, the price of preservation of continence at all cost is multiple and often different operations, prolonged disability and disappointment for the patient and the surgeon. Nevertheless, the surgeon treating anal fistulas on an occasional basis should never hesitate in referring the patient to a specialist. Conversely, an expert colorectal surgeon must be familiar with many different operations in order to selectively tailor an operation to the individual patient...|$|R
