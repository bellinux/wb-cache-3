5|$|On November 29 a {{disturbance}} in the ITCZ began gaining organization near Palmyra Island, which the ITCZ had been near {{for a week}} prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour <b>pressure</b> <b>tendency,</b> which reported -3.2mbar.

40|$|Air {{pressure}} readings and their variations {{are commonly used}} to make inferences about storm activity. More precisely, {{it is assumed that}} the variation of annual and seasonal statistics of several pressure-based proxies describes changes in the past storm climate qualitatively, an assumption {{that has yet to be}} proven. A systematic evaluation of the informational content of five pressure-based proxies for storm activity based on single-station observations of air pressure is presented. The number of deep lows, lower percentiles of pressure, the frequency of absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> above certain thresholds, as well as mean values and high percentiles of absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> is examined. Such an evaluation needs long and homogeneous records of wind speed, something that is not available from observations. Consequently, the proxies are examined by using datasets of ground-level wind speeds and air pressure from the NCEP-driven and spectrally nudged regional model, REMO. The proxies are gauged against the 95 th and 99 th percentile time series of ground-level wind speeds to quantify the relation between pressure-based proxies and storminess. These analyses rely on bootstrap and binomial hypothesis testing. The analyses of single-station-based proxies indicate that the proxies are generally linearly linked to storm activity, and that absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> have the highest informational content. Further, it is investigated as to whether the proxies have the potential for describing storminess over larger areas, also with regard to surface conditions. It is found that absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> have improved informational value when describing storm activity over larger areas, while low {{pressure readings}} do not show improved informational value...|$|R

5|$|Along with <b>pressure</b> <b>tendency,</b> the {{condition}} of the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
25|$|Barometric {{pressure}} and the <b>pressure</b> <b>tendency</b> (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} weather forecasting since the late 19th century. When used in combination with wind observations, reasonably accurate short-term forecasts can be made. Simultaneous barometric readings from across a network of weather stations allow maps of air pressure to be produced, which were the first form of the modern weather map when created in the 19th century. Isobars, lines of equal pressure, when drawn on such a map, give a contour map showing areas of high and low pressure. Localized high atmospheric pressure acts as a barrier to approaching weather systems, diverting their course. Atmospheric lift caused by low-level wind convergence into the surface brings clouds and sometimes precipitation. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than 3.5hPa (0.1 inHg), the greater the change in weather that can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises, such as {{in the wake of a}} cold front, are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} inconsistency of geostrophic {{flow and}} small surface <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> is discussed. The frequently disastrous consequences in conventional geostrophic barotropic predictions are numerically identified by comparisons with experimental “semi-geostrophic ” barotropic prehctions {{from which the}} inconsistency has been removed. Effects of the inconsistency of the geostrophic wind field with the equations of motion are also quantitatively isolated by comparisons of semi-geostrophic predictions with predictions made with wind fields which satisfy the balance equation. It is concluded that the principal fault of the conventional geostrophic approximation lies in the violation of the continuity equation. Its lack of the dynamic effects expressed in the equations of motion seems also significant, but is less important...|$|R

Our new method solves these problems by using the wind fields in a spherical harmonical form (divergence and vorticity) by mimicing the physics of the weather forecast model as closely as possible. A 3 -D chemistry-transport model was used to show that the calculated ozone fields with the new processing method agree remarkably better with ozone observations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In addition, the calculated age of air in the lower stratosphere show better agreement with observations, although the air remains still too young in the extra tropical stratosphere...|$|R

In a given time frame, ethanol fuel exhibits the highest evaporation rate and followed by methanol, other biofuels and kerosene. Ethanol also propagates the farthest distance and followed by methanol and kerosene. However, all biofuels have a shorter penetration length in the given time. These give penalty costs to biofuels emissions formation. The influences of initial conditions such as temperature and droplet velocity are also explored numerically. High initial temperature and velocity could accelerate evaporation rate.

Surface Q vectors are shown to have qualitative value in short-range forecasts of the location of the storm, but do not forecast storm intensity.

40|$|An {{ensemble}} data {{assimilation system}} for 3 D radar reflectivity data is introduced for the convection-permitting {{numerical weather prediction}} model of the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO) based on the Kilometre-scale ENsemble Data Assimilation system (KENDA), developed by Deutscher Wetterdienst and its partners. KENDA provides a state-of-the-art ensemble data assimilation system on the convective scale for operational data assimilation and forecasting based on the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). In this study, the Efficient Modular VOlume RADar Operator is applied for the assimilation of radar reflectivity data to improve short-term predictions of precipitation. Both deterministic and ensemble forecasts have been carried out. A case-study shows that the assimilation of 3 D radar reflectivity data clearly improves precipitation location in the analysis and significantly improves forecasts for lead times up to 4 h, as quantified by the Brier Score and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score. The influence of different update rates on the noise in terms of surface <b>pressure</b> <b>tendencies</b> and on the forecast quality in general is investigated. The results suggest that, while high update rates produce better analyses, forecasts with lead times of above 1 h benefit from less frequent updates. For a period of seven consecutive days, assimilation of radar reflectivity based on the LETKF is {{compared to that of}} DWD's current operational radar assimilation scheme based on latent heat nudging (LHN).

40|$|IPCC {{chapter 3}} {{did a good}} job {{explaining}} the patterns of climate variability through global teleconnections and defining the circulation indices including the short term and decadal scale oscillations in the Pacific, and Atlantic. It noted that the decadal variability in the Pacific (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO) is likely due to oceanic processes. Extratropical ocean influences are likely to play a role as changes in the ocean gyre evolve and heat anomalies are subducted and reemerge. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is thought to be due to changes in the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Though the IPCC AR 4 describes some of the recent research on these phenomena, it does not draw out their importance for explaining global climate changes over decadal intervals. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Its Effects JPL and University of Washington scientists (Mantua et al., 1997) when examining conditions that might explains multidecadal tendencies in the success of salmon fisheries found a full basin Pacific trend in ocean temperatures they called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
