40|$|Abstract — Switched Digital Broadcast (SDB) is a {{new method}} of distributing video programming. Compared with {{traditional}} broadcast methods, it reduces spectrum requirements {{by taking advantage of}} the fact that not all program channels are being viewed by subscribers at the same time. The actual spectrum savings depends on human TV watching behavior, the popularity of delivered TV programs, streaming bit-rate composition and subscriber group size. We have developed a simulation model of an SDB system that allows us to explore the impact of these factors, in <b>particular</b> <b>subscriber’s</b> channel flipping behavior, on the capacity requirement. Our subscriber viewing model ranges from intense, correlated channel flipping behavior to minimal flipping behavior representing DVR usage. Our results suggest that frequent channel flipping has little effect on the spectrum requirements under normal viewing assumptions...|$|R

Sc. thesis, {{part of the}} EU FP 6 IST project MUSIC, {{presents}} a P 2 PSIP event notification architecture where a traditional SIP event server {{is replaced by a}} distributed P 2 P overlay network. Our objective is a scalable, fault resilient, and redundant SIP architecture that meets {{the state of the art}} in handling event state subscriptions, notifications, and publications. The users of the architecture- non overlay SIP user agents- continue to transparently access the overlay according to the IETF specifications for event state publications (RFC 3903 [1]), and notifications (RFC 3265 [2]). The proposed architecture leverages a structured P 2 P overlay network, an application level multicast protocol, and a modified SIP stack that invokes the P 2 P functionality. The overlay installs a routing and transport infrastructure that distributes the total processing load among the peers. The application level multicast protocol builds dissemination trees each of which serves a <b>particular</b> <b>subscriber</b> group. It also provisions for the failure and recovery features of the overlay in coordination with the P 2 P subsystem. Finally the SIP stack receives out of overlay SIP calls and invokes the internal P 2 P functionality. However, not all the overlay peers need to have a SIP stack; only the ones acting as gateways to out of overlay SIP requests.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how stated-preference methods {{can be applied}} to modeling consumers' preferences in the field of mobile telecommunications, and to measuring and the valuation of network effects. We illustrate this with a case study of mobile phone operators in Poland. We utilize the Choice Experiment method and present the respondents with hypothetical choices of mobile phone operators, while explicitly controlling for network effects in the form of other users in the same network. Based on the hypothetical choices consumers make we construct a conditional random parameters multinomial logit model to analyze their preferences. This approach allows us to calculate welfare effects associated with alternatives, as well as marginal rates of substitution (and hence implicit prices) of the attributes used to describe the choices, such as operator brand and distribution of family and friends between available mobile networks. The latter constitutes a network effect as consumer's utility is influenced by the number (or ratio) of members of his or her family, friends and other users subscribed to the same operator. Our results confirm the existence of a strong network effect, which is related {{to the size of the}} social network group a <b>particular</b> <b>subscriber</b> belongs to, rather than the absolute size of the mobile operator's customer base. We observe that there are two sources of this 'gross' network effect - pecuniary (arising from possible price discounts for on-net calls) and non-pecuniary, and demonstrate a way to disaggregate them. In addition, we find that brand perception and brand loyalty are important determinants of operator choice. Finally, through the application of a non-market valuation method we are able to calculate monetary values of the network effect and brand loyalty, and both turn out to be relatively high. The results might be of a particular interest to mobile phone operators and regulatory authorities - we find that the capacity for vigorous price competition between mobile operators is limited due to significant non-price barriers which mitigate subscribers' mobility in the market. We demonstrate a way to measure these effects in monetary terms based on modeling of consumer preferences.

40|$|Switching {{costs are}} one of the {{barriers}} to entry in telecommunication and also reduce consumer welfare. Many European telecom regulators including Nordic countries have decided to introduce Mobile Number Portability (MNP) policy to the mobile market. The regulators believe that MNP {{plays an important role in}} lowering consumers’ switching costs. However, there is no evidence to evaluate the impacts of this policy, in particular in the Swedish mobile market. This paper presents empirical evidence for investigating MNP in the Swedish mobile market after it was implemented in 2001. It also provides the results of the switching costs. Using Shy’s (2002) model we analyze the change in switching costs among subscribers in the Swedish mobile market. We then assess the effect of introduction of MNP on these switching costs. Our results indicate that the switching cost of Swedish mobile subscribers has decreased over time since the introduction of MNP, in <b>particular</b> for <b>subscribers</b> who switch from the largest operator to smaller operators. We also show that the competition in the Swedish mobile market is changing from pure price strategy to a mixed strategy which can create network externalities. Moreover, porting time and handset subsidy policy might be the reasons why MNP in Sweden has not been well accepted by mobile subscribers. Thus, the role of the regulator is still needed in the Swedish mobile market in order to promote competition and protect consumer welfare from the competition policy point of view...|$|R

But this availability makes video server desgn very difficult because each video sequence will have different statistical characteristics such as mean, variance, symmetry, kurtosis and fractal dimension. Thus, a server needs to be designed as if the most demanding of all video traces will always be selected by users. This is a dimensionality problem. We can say that if a video server offers thousands of titles to subscribers, then its design has thousands of dimensions, since we don’t know what would be the <b>particular</b> arrangement of <b>subscriber</b> selections at any given time, nor can we predict future releases statistical characteristics. These characteristics can require demand of resources that the hardware infrastructure might be able to meet. In this paper, we show a very well known technique known as principal component analysis that can help to dramatically reduce dimensionality by using only a few principal components when creating a characteristic video trace, that will be used as a representative of all video traces for video server design...|$|R

This low complex algorithm can be used for XT channel estimation in dynamic spectrum management (DSM) techniques today. The algorithm as proposed recently, relies on sending perturbing signals on the victim lines (VLs) and reporting the SNRs by those lines to acquire the crosstalk channel from some disturber line (DL) to the VLs. We generalize this concept to include full startup, tracking and joining scenarios as well as the impact of different perturbation signal choices. Simulation results reveal that starting from no crosstalk precompensation, and updating a precoder matrix based on the DS crosstalk channel estimates, the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) free SNR can be reached in few iterations (36 SNR measurements for the four lines case). © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
