5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first <b>patch</b> added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the <b>patch</b> or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second <b>patch</b> on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second <b>patch</b> did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when <b>patch</b> location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether <b>patch</b> location was signaled or not. Signaling <b>patch</b> location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing <b>patch</b> density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing <b>patch</b> density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E

5|$|A strain {{known as}} <b>Patch</b> Hounds was {{developed}} by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion <b>Patch,</b> but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact <b>patch</b> {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} contact <b>patch.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{unofficial}} fan translation <b>patch</b> {{was announced}} in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The <b>patch</b> was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the <b>patch</b> was downloaded 100,000 times {{in the first four}} days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order. Later statements revealed that the <b>patch</b> was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him {{and the rest of the}} team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take the <b>patch</b> down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of Type-0 HD. Work on the <b>patch</b> was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the PlayStation 3 system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Based on in situ and {{ground-based}} observations, a {{new type}} of “polar cap hot patch” has been identified that is different from the classical polar cap enhanced density structure (cold <b>patches).</b> Comparing with the classical polar cap <b>patches,</b> which are transported from the dayside sunlit region with dense and cold plasma, the polar cap hot <b>patches</b> are associated with particle precipitations (therefore field-aligned currents), ion upflows, and flow shears. The hot <b>patches</b> may have the same order of density enhancement as classical <b>patches</b> in the topside ionosphere, suggesting that the hot <b>patches</b> may be produced by transported photoionization plasma into flow channels. Within the flow channels, the hot <b>patches</b> have low-energy particle precipitation and/or ion upflows associated with field-aligned currents and flow shears. Corresponding Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal scintillation measurements indicate that hot <b>patches</b> may produce slightly stronger radio signal scintillation in the polar cap region than classical <b>patches.</b> A new type of polar cap <b>patches,</b> “polar cap hot patches,” is identified to differentiate enhanced density structures from classical <b>patches.</b> Hot <b>patches</b> are associated with particle precipitations, ion upflows, field-aligned currents, and shear flows in the polar cap. Hot <b>patches</b> may lead to slightly stronger ionospheric scintillations of GNSS signals in the polar cap region than classical <b>patches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Patching</b> and {{transition}} <b>patching</b> are two techniques proposed to build efficient video-on-demand (VoD) systems. <b>Patching</b> works by allowing a client to playback video {{data from a}} <b>patching</b> stream while caching video data from another multicast video stream for later playback. The <b>patching</b> stream can be released once video playback reaches {{the point where the}} cached data begins, and playback continues via the cache and the shared multicast channel {{for the rest of the}} session. Transition <b>patching</b> takes this <b>patching</b> technique one step further by allowing a new client to cache video data not only from a full-length multicast channel, but also from a nearby in-progress <b>patching</b> channel as well to further reduce resource consumption. This study further generalizes these <b>patching</b> techniques into a recursive <b>patching</b> scheme where a new client can cache video data recursively from multiple <b>patching</b> streams to further reduce resource consumption. This recursive <b>patching</b> scheme unifies the existing <b>patching</b> schemes as special cases. Simulation results show that it can achieve significant reductions (e. g. 60 %~ 80 %) in startup latency at the same load and with the same system resources. ...|$|R
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact <b>patch</b> and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact <b>patch</b> towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact <b>patch,</b> because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact <b>patch</b> slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|At {{a bend in}} the highway, {{there is}} a small <b>patch</b> of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large <b>patch</b> of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small <b>patch</b> of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of user {{incentives}} on software security in a network of individual users under costly <b>patching</b> and negative network security externalities. For proprietary software or freeware, we compare four alternative policies to manage network security: (i) Consumer self <b>patching</b> (where no external incentives are provided for <b>patching</b> or purchasing); (ii) Mandatory patching; (iii) <b>Patching</b> rebate; and (iv) Usage tax. We show that for proprietary software, when the software security risk and the <b>patching</b> costs are high, for both a welfare maximizing social planner and a profit maximizing vendor, a <b>patching</b> rebate dominates the other policies. However, when the <b>patching</b> cost or the security risk is low, self <b>patching</b> is best. We also show that when a rebate is effective, the profit maximizing rebate is decreasing in the security risk and increasing in <b>patching</b> costs. The welfare maximizing rebates are also increasing in <b>patching</b> costs but can be increasing in the effective security risk when <b>patching</b> costs are high. For freeware, a usage tax {{is the most effective}} policy except when both <b>patching</b> costs and security risk are low, in which case, a <b>patching</b> rebate prevails. Optimal <b>patching</b> rebates and taxes tend to increase with increased security risk and <b>patching</b> costs but can decrease in the security risk for high risk levels. Our results suggest that both the value generated from software and vendor profits can be significantly improved by mechanisms that target user incentives to maintain software security...|$|R
40|$|Eye <b>patching</b> (monocular {{or right}} hemifield) has been {{proposed}} to improve visuospatial attention to the ignored field in patients with neglect. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the literature on the effects of eye <b>patching</b> in hemispatial neglect after stroke in order to convey evidence-based recommendations to clinicians in stroke rehabilitation. Thirteen intervention studies were selected from the Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EBRSR and Health Star databases. Methodological quality was defined according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Overall, seven studies used monocular eye <b>patching,</b> five used right hemifield <b>patching</b> and one compared right monocular with right hemifield <b>patching.</b> Seven studies compared normal viewing to monocular or hemifield <b>patching</b> conditions. Six studies included a period of treatment. Three studies included follow-up evaluations. As to the monocular eye <b>patching,</b> four studies reported positive effects of right monocular <b>patching.</b> One study showed an improvement in hemispatial neglect with left monocular <b>patching.</b> Two studies found no superiority of right versus left monocular <b>patching.</b> One study found no effects of right monocular <b>patching.</b> As to the right hemifield eye <b>patching,</b> one study showed improvements in neglect after right hemifield <b>patching.</b> Three studies found that right hemifield <b>patching</b> combined with another rehabilitation technique was more effective than that treatment alone. One study found no differences between right hemifield <b>patching</b> combined with another treatment and that treatment alone. One study found the same effect between right hemifield <b>patching</b> alone and another rehabilitation technique. Our results globally tend to support the usefulness of right hemifield eye <b>patching</b> in clinical practice. In order to define a level of evidence with the standard rehabilitation evidence rating tools, further properly powered randomized controlled trials or meta-analysis are needed...|$|R

The <b>patch</b> also added in an option to disable the use of Vita-Chambers, a feature requested by players to make the game more challenging, as well as an achievement to complete the game at its hardest setting without using a Vita-Chamber.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{insisted that}} Anvil {{required}} an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark {{was the only}} one in the theater. Then Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters was on its way to the theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander <b>Patch,</b> who had a distinguished combat record leading the soldiers and marines of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific. With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed <b>Patch</b> to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March.

The limiting behaviour of the model is examined as the number of habitat <b>patches</b> increases to infinity.

40|$|The brain {{processes}} objects {{through a}} series of regions along the ventral visual pathway, but the circuitry subserving the analysis of specific complex forms remains unknown. One complex form category, faces, selectively activates six <b>patches</b> of cortex in the macaque ventral pathway. To identify the connectivity of these face <b>patches,</b> we used electrical microstimulation combined with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Stimulation of each of four targeted face <b>patches</b> produced strong activation specifically within a subset of the other face <b>patches.</b> Stimulation outside the face <b>patches</b> produced an activation pattern that spared the face <b>patches.</b> These results suggest that the face <b>patches</b> form a strongly and specifically interconnected hierarchical network...|$|R

30|$|Structurally, the 1992 {{landscape}} of the bi-county region was characterized by several fairly large, contiguous <b>patches</b> of herbaceous vegetation (e.g., two <b>patches</b> > 475, 000  ha plus other large <b>patches)</b> dissected by many small, less spatially connected woody vegetation <b>patches.</b> County-wise, Cimarron County followed the patterns of the study regions, as a whole, while Union County was characterized by more, typically smaller, <b>patches</b> of herbaceous and woody vegetation types. Nonetheless, large swaths of the eastern portion of the Cimarron County landscape were also composed of large agricultural <b>patches</b> (Fig.  3, Table  3).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{series of}} colour <b>patches</b> was discontinued in 1949, {{and a new}} system was introduced in 1987 known as Series I and Series II colour <b>patches.</b> The Series I range are known as the 'Heritage' <b>patches</b> and are the pre-1949 <b>patches</b> maintained in a register with the Series I 'Extended' and Series II range introduced during the 1990s.

30|$|Mean size of {{unchanged}} <b>patches</b> {{was more}} than twice as large for prescribed fires as for wildfires or wildland fire use fires. The size differential also occurred for low severity <b>patches,</b> but it was not as great. Because prescribed fires tended to be low intensity surface fires, they were less likely to open the canopy, and therefore resulted in the large unchanged <b>patches</b> mapped by Thode (2005). Wildfires had the largest <b>patches</b> of moderate severity <b>patches</b> with some nearly twice as large as prescribed and wildland fire use fires. As intensity increases, severity increases creating larger <b>patches.</b> Wildfires had high severity <b>patches</b> that were three times as large as the other two management types, but these <b>patches</b> were only half the size of the moderate severity <b>patches.</b> Most high severity areas occured where fires burned through the canopy {{for a short period of}} time and then dropped back down to the surface. Sustained independent crown fires, which can create large <b>patches</b> of high severity, have been rare and occurred in only the three largest wildfires under extreme weather conditions.|$|R
