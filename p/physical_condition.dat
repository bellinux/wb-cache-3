40|$|Background: Prior {{research}} on the association between affective disorders and <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> {{has been carried out}} in developed countries, usually in clinical populations, on a limited range of mental disorders and <b>physical</b> <b>conditions,</b> and has seldom taken into account the comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods: Eighteen general population surveys were carried out among adults in 17 countries as part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative (N= 42, 249). DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed using face-to-face interviews with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3. 0). Chronic <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were ascertained via a standard checklist. The relationship between mental disorders and <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> was assessed by considering depressive and anxiety disorders independently (depression without anxiety; anxiety without depression) and conjointly (depression plus anxiety). Results: All <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were significantly associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders but there was variation in the strength of association (ORs 1. 2 - 4. 5). Non-comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders were associated in equal degree with <b>physical</b> <b>conditions.</b> Comorbid depressive-anxiety disorder was more strongly associated with several <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> than were single mental disorders. Limitations: <b>Physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were ascertained via self report, though for a number of conditions this was self-report of diagnosis by a physician. Conclusions: Given the prevalence and clinical consequences of the co-occurrence of mental and physical disorders, attention to their comorbidity should remain a clinical and research priority.

5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E

The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E

His <b>physical</b> <b>condition</b> did not allow him many opportunities to play any other positions, so this compelled his managers to leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, when the situation warranted it, as he is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} effects of common mental {{disorders}} and <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> on role functioning in Spain. MethodsCross-sectional study of the general adult population of Spain (n = 2, 121).

40|$|Abstract IMPORTANCE: It {{is clear}} that mental {{disorders}} in treatment settings {{are associated with a}} higher incidence of chronic <b>physical</b> <b>conditions,</b> but whether this is true of mental disorders in the community, and how generalized (across a range of physical health outcomes) these associations are, is less clear. This information has important implications for mental health care and the primary prevention of chronic physical disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of 16 temporally prior DSM-IV mental disorders with the subsequent onset or diagnosis of 10 chronic <b>physical</b> <b>conditions.</b> DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen face-to-face, cross-sectional household surveys of community-dwelling adults were conducted in 17 countries (47   609 individuals; 2   032   942 person-years) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2011. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to retrospectively assess the lifetime prevalence and age at onset of DSM-IV-identified mental disorders. Data analysis was performed from January 3, 2012, to September 30, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime history of <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> was ascertained via self-report of physician's diagnosis and year of onset or diagnosis. Survival analyses estimated the associations of temporally prior first onset of mental disorders with subsequent onset or diagnosis of <b>physical</b> <b>conditions.</b> RESULTS: Most associations between 16 mental disorders and subsequent onset or diagnosis of 10 <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were statistically significant, with odds ratios (ORs) (95...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{link between}} <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and mental health}} is poorly understood. Functional {{disability}} could explain the association of <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> with major depressive episode (MDE) as an intermediary factor. Methods: Data was analyzed from a subsample (N = 8796) of the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional general population survey. MDE during the last 12 months was assessed using a revision of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3. 0). Lifetime chronic <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were assessed by self-report. Functional disability was measured using {{a version of the}} World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). The associations of <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> with MDE and explanation by functional disability were quantified using logistic regression. Results: All <b>physical</b> <b>conditions</b> were significantly associated with MDE. The increases in risk of MDE ranged from 30 % for allergy to amply 100 % for arthritis and heart disease. When adjusted for physical comorbidity, associations decreased and were no longer statistically significant for allergy and diabetes. Functional disability explained between 17 and 64 % of these associations, most substantially for stomach or duodenum ulcer, arthritis and heart disease. Limitations: Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study the temporal relationship of the variables could not be assessed and the amount of explanation cannot simply be interpreted as the amount of mediation...|$|R
