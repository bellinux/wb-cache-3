40|$|A {{high-speed}} input comparator {{and output}} driver with adjustable pre-emphasis for applications in serial interchip communications over backplanes at 20 Gb/s is presented. The circuit was implemented in 130 -nm CMOS and consumes 140 mW from a 1. 5 -V supply. It has over 30 dB dynamic range with a sensitivity of 20 mVp-p and a differential output swing of 700 mVp-p at 20 Gb/ s. The output driver features a novel digital <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>circuit</b> with independent pulse height and width control. Other features include 30 %- 70 % eye-crossing control and adjustable output swing between 170 mVpp and 350 mVp-p per side at data rates up to 30 Gb/s...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{four decades}} after the impulse {{invariance}} (i. i.) method has been in vogue, a correct way of its application has been emphasized independently, {{but at the same}} time, by Jackson and Mecklenbräuker. When there is a discontinuity at t = 0 in the analog impulse response, the correct way requires that one should take half of its value. In spite of this correction, due to under-sampling there persists aliasing error in the frequency domain. In this paper the effect of aliasing is viewed as a 3 dB frequency warping and a pre-warping step prior to its application is proposed to reduce it, thereby making the technique appropriate from the viewpoint of frequency domain also. Simulation examples comparing this approach with the traditional method reveal significant improvement in the frequency response. Further, according to Jackson and Mecklenbräuker and also as written in many a standard textbook available today, i. i. technique cannot be used when the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the parent analog transfer function are equal. An example under this category is the <b>Pre-emphasis</b> <b>circuit</b> or a simple high pass filter. We shall show how the technique can still be used even for a <b>Pre-emphasis</b> <b>circuit.</b> Antoniou proposed (an intelligently) modified impulse invariance technique for certain types of filters by which, aliasing error is nearly eliminated. These cases are neither admitted by the traditional i. i. method nor by that of Jackson and Mecklenbräuker at all. Antoniou’s modified method results in a digital filter of order almost twice as great with an additional task of stabilization. The method in this paper retains the stability and order but gives satisfactory response...|$|E

This led to the need in some cases to enable or disable <b>pre-emphasis</b> or de-emphasis <b>circuits</b> in the radios and/or modems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Multi-Gbps {{serial link}} {{transmitter}} for both off-chip and on-chip transmission are presented. For off-chip transmission, a new pre-emphasis design methodology and circuits for a 4 / 2 PAM transmitter over cable are proposed. A test chip of transmitter with <b>pre-emphasis,</b> PLL <b>circuit</b> and on-chip termination resistors is implemented using tsmc 0. 18 um CMOS process. The measurement results of 10 / 5 Gbps (4 / 2 PAM) {{are carried out}} over 5 meter (m) long cable and is in agreement with our analysis and simulation results. For on-chip transmission, SerDes based serial link architecture is used in on-chip application. Using tsmc 0. 13 um CMOS process, the operation speed and power consumption are 5 Gbps and 3. 2 mW respectively with the interconnect area is half of parallel architecture. I...|$|R
40|$|Power and {{bandwidth}} requirements {{have become more}} stringent for DRAMs in recent years. This is largely because mobile devices (such as smart phones) are more intensively relying {{on the use of}} graphics. Current DDR memory I/Os operate at 5 Gb/s with a power efficiency of 17. 4 mW/Gb/s (i. e., 17. 4 pJ/b) [1], and graphic DRAM I/Os operate at 7 Gb/s/pin [3] with a power efficiency worse than that of DDR. High-speed serial links [5], with a better power efficiency of ~ 1 mW/Gb/s, would be favored for mobile memory I/O interface. However, serial links typically require long initialization time (~ 1000 clock cycles), and do not meet mobile DRAM I/O requirements for fast switching between active, standby, self-refresh and power-down operation modes [4]. Also, traditional baseband-only (or BB-only) signaling tends to consume power super-linearly [4] for extended bandwidth due to the need of power hungry <b>pre-emphasis,</b> and equalization <b>circuits.</b> To overcome aforementioned technical limitations, we propose to implement a Dual (Base+RF) Band Interconnect (DBI) to enable high throughput data rate an...|$|R
40|$|On-chip wires {{will present}} {{increasing}} latency and energy problems as VLSI technologies continue to scale. Interconnects have an RC-limited bandwidth approximately {{proportional to the}} area of the metal cross section and inversely proportional to the squared length. To overcome RC-limited channels, an energy-efficient on-chip transceiver is presented that contains a hybrid transmitter, a current-sense receiver, and self-testing blocks. The main goal of this research is having a relatively low-power transceiver, which can be used as an on-chip communication system. By adding a <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>circuit</b> in the transmitter, pre-cursor inter-symbol interference can be canceled. A hybrid transmitter which combines voltage-mode pre-emphasis with a current-mode main driver is used. This structure can save pre-emphasis current, and leads to reduced power dissipation especially in the static situation. A current-sense amplifier is implemented with a cross-coupled stage and an active inductor equalizer at the receiver, in order to boost the data rate while maintaining good energy efficiency. An offset cancelation circuit is incorporated to make a robust comparator for the receiver. According to simulation results, the transceiver has low power consumption with 1. 2 V, 130 nm CMOS technology. The performance shows that it operates at 8 Gb/s over a 5 mm and 19 dB loss differential channel. The overall dynamic power consumption is 2. 05 mW, without the PRBS generator/checker. Therefore, this transceiver has high data rate and low power consumption...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent {{development of a}} gigabit data transmitter for the Belle-II pixel detector (PXD). The PXD is an innermost detector currently under development for the upgraded KEK-B factory in Japan. The PXD consists of two layers of DEPFET sensor modules located at 1. 8 and 2. 2 cm radii. Each module is equipped with three different ASIC types mounted on the detector substrate with a flip-chip technique: (a) SWITCHER for generating steering signals for the DEPFET sensors, (b) DCD for digitizing the signal currents, and (c) DHP for performing data processing and sending the data off the module to the back-end data handling hybrid via 40 cm Kapton flex and 12 – 15 m twisted pair (TWP) cables. To {{meet the requirements of}} the PXD data transmission, a prototype of the DHP data transmitter has been developed in a 65 -nm standard CMOS technology. The transmitter test chip consists of current-mode logic (CML) drivers and a phase-locked loop (PLL) which generates a clock signal for a 1. 6 Gbit/s output data stream from an 80 cm reference clock. A programmable <b>pre-emphasis</b> <b>circuit</b> is also implemented in the CML driver to compensate signal losses in the long cable by shaping the transmitted pulse response. The jitter performance was measured as 25 ps (1 s distribution) by connecting the chip with 38 cm flex and 10 m TWP cables...|$|E
