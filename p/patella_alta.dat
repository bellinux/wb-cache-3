40|$|Aims: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the incidence and coexistence of multiple knee joint pathologies and the distribution of knee joint pathologies according to age and sex. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using the clinical data of patients evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee joint. Data from 308 patients examined between August 2002 and July 2003 were included into this study. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed {{to examine the relationship between}} the pathological findings and the age and sex of the patients. Results: The ages of the patients ranged between 1 and 74 years (mean: 43. 3 years). Age was significantly correlated with meniscal degeneration and tears, medial collateral ligament degeneration, parameniscal cyst, and chondromalacia patellae. There was a significant correlation between male gender and anterior cruciate ligament injury. Meniscal injury was significantly correlated with bursitis, as well as medial collateral ligament injury. Bone bruise was significantly correlated with medial collateral ligament injury, lateral collateral ligament injury, Baker’s cyst, and anterior cruciate ligament injury. Chondromalacia patellae was significantly correlated with anterior cruciate ligament injury, <b>patellae</b> <b>alta,</b> and osteochondral lesion. Bursitis (in 53. 2 % of the patients) followed by grade-II meniscal degeneration (in 43 % of the patients) were the most common knee pathologies observed by MRI.

40|$|Patellofemoral instability, also {{referred}} to as episodic patella dislocation (EPD), occurs at an incidence of 7 per 100, 000 people across all age groups. Many anatomical factors are known to contribute to EPD. The most common of these are trochlea dysplasia and <b>patella</b> <b>alta.</b> <b>Patella</b> <b>alta</b> is increasingly being recognized as a main contributing factor in EPD. This morphologic abnormality exists when the patella is located in an exaggerated proximal position such that it does not engage in the trochlea appropriately. The exact biomechanical mechanism that links <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> to EPD is unclear, but {{it is likely to be}} multifactorial. A delay in patellofemoral contact and engagement predisposes to patella dislocation and potentially increased rates of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Surgical management of <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> in the setting of EPD aims to restore patella height and patella tendon length back to normal indices. The goal is to improve patellofemoral engagement and prevent further patella dislocations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> leads to a less favourable situation in terms of patellofemoral contact force, contact area and contact pressure than the normal patellar position, and thereby gives rise to anterior knee pain. A dynamic knee simulator system based on the Oxford rig and allowing six degrees of freedom was adapted in order to simulate and record the dynamic loads during a knee squat from 30 degrees to 120 degrees flexion under physiological conditions. Five different configurations were studied, with variable predetermined patellar heights. The patellofemoral contact force increased with increasing knee flexion until contact occurred between the quadriceps tendon and the femoral trochlea, inducing load sharing. <b>Patella</b> <b>alta</b> caused a delay of this contact until deeper flexion. As a consequence, the maximal patellofemoral contact force and contact pressure increased significantly with increasing patellar height (p < 0. 01). <b>Patella</b> <b>alta</b> was associated with the highest maximal patellofemoral contact force and contact pressure.

The {{aim of this study}} was to 1) report the incidence of <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> and patella baja and 2) investigate whether the normal limits of the Insall-Salvati ratio is applicable in adult Middle-Easterners. Methods: A radiographic review of the lateral radiographs of 736 Middle-Eastern knees were performed. Patellar tendon length (TL) and the patellar length (TP) was digitally measured and the ratios of these measures was used to calculate the Insall-Salvati ratio. Results: The overall mean TL/PL ratio was 1. 20 ± 0. 17. The Insall-Salvati ratio was higher (p= 0. 0013) in males (1. 22 ± 0. 12) than in females (1. 18 ± 0. 17).

This study included 61 knees (50 patients) treated for patellar instability with <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> and 24 patients treated for patella infera of mechanical origin. The results of medial transfer of the tibial tuberosity, with or without distal transfer in cases of patellar instability with <b>patella</b> <b>alta,</b> gives excellent results for stability in 76. 8 % of the cases.

40|$|Background: <b>Patella</b> <b>alta</b> is a {{condition}} which may predispose individuals to patellofemoral joint dysfunction. We compared patellofemoral joint alignment and contact area in subjects who had <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> with subjects who had nor-mal patellar position, {{to determine the effect}} of high vertical patellar positions on knee extensor mechanics. Methods: Twelve subjects with <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> and thirteen control subjects participated in the study. Lateral patellar dis-placement (subluxation), lateral tilt, and patellofemoral joint contact area were quantified from axial magnetic resonance images of the patellofemoral joint acquired at 0 °, 20 °, 40 °, and 60 ° of knee flexion with the quadriceps contracted. Results: With the knee at 0 ° of flexion, the subjects with <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> demonstrated significant differences compared with the control group, with greater lateral displacement (mean [and standard error], 85. 4 % ± 3. 6 % and 71. 3 % ± 3. 0 %, respectively, of patellar width lateral to the deepest point in the trochlear groove; p = 0. 007), greater lateral tilt (mean, 21. 6 ° ± 1. 9 ° and 15. 5 ° ± 1. 8 °; p = 0. 028), and less contact area (157. 6 ± 13. 7 mm 2 and 198. 8 ± 14. 3 mm 2; p = 0. 040). Differences in displacement and tilt were not observed at greater knee flexion angles; however, con-tact area differences were observed at all angles evaluated. When data from both groups were combined, the vertical position of the patella was positively associated with lateral displacement and lateral tilt at 0 ° of flexion and was neg-atively associated with contact area at all knee flexion angles.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Reconstruction of the {{extensor}} mechanism after resection of {{the proximal}} tibia is challenging, and several methods are available. A medial gastrocnemius flap commonly is used, {{although it may}} be associated with an extensor lag. This problem also is encountered, although perhaps to a lesser extent, with other techniques for reconstruction of the extensor apparatus. It is not known how such lag develops with time and how it correlates with functional outcome. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:We therefore (1) assessed patellar height with time, (2) correlated patellar height with function using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score, and (3) correlated patellar height with range of motion (ROM) after medial gastrocnemius flap reconstruction. METHODS:Sixteen patients underwent tumor endoprosthesis implantation and extensor apparatus reconstruction between 1997 and 2009 using a medial gastrocnemius flap after sarcoma resection of the proximal tibia. These patients represented 100 % of the population for whom we performed extensor mechanism reconstructions during that time. The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 5 years; range, 2 - 11 years). Fourteen patients were alive {{at the time of this}} study. We used the Blackburne-Peel Index to follow patellar height radiographically with time. Functional outcomes were assessed retrospectively using the MSTS, and ROM was evaluated through active extensor lag and flexion. RESULTS:Eleven patients had <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> develop, whereby the maximal patellar height was reached after a mean of 2 years and then stabilized. More normal patellar height was associated with better functional scores, a smaller extensor lag, but less flexion; the mean extensor lag (and flexion) of patients with <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> was 17 ° (and 94 °) compared with only 4 ° (and 77 °) without. CONCLUSIONS:In our patients <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> evolved during the first 2 postoperative years. <b>Patella</b> <b>alta</b> is associated with extensor lag, greater flexion, and worse MSTS scores. Surgical fixation of the patellar tendon more distally to its anatomic position or strict postoperative bracing may be advisable. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:Level IV, clinical cohort study.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPatella alta {{is one of}} {{the primary}} factors of {{patellofemoral}} instability and its importance lies in the reduced engagement between patella and trochlea during the early degrees of flexion. The evaluation of patellar height is based on conventional x-rays, CT scan and, more recently, MRI. The objective of this multicentric prospective study is to describe a novel index to assess in the sagittal plane the functional engagement between patella and trochlea. Materials and methodsOne hundred and thirty-five patients with objective patellar dislocation were prospectively enrolled between April 2010 and September 2011 and were compared with a second group of 45 controls. All patients underwent a standard MRI and a complete radiographic study. Sagittal engagement was measured as the ratio between the articular cartilage of the patella and the trochlear cartilage length measured on two different MRI slices. ResultsThe mean Sagittal Patellofemoral Engagement (SPE) index was 0. 43 ± 0. 18 and ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 913 in the Objective Patellar Dislocation group versus 0. 42 ± 0. 11 range 0. 22 to 0. 55 in controls. In the Patellar Dislocation group the mean Caton-Deschamps index was 1. 18 ± 0. 21 (range 0. 71 to 1. 91). There were 58 patients with <b>patella</b> <b>alta,</b> in whom the mean SPE was 0. 39 ± 0. 18 (range 0. 02 to 0. 87). Sagittal engagement was significantly higher when compared with patients in the Patellar Dislocation group who had no <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> (mean 0. 46 ± 0. 16, range 0. 1 – 0. 913). DiscussionThe present study introduces a new method to measure the SPE with the use of MRI. The evaluation of the functional engagement of the patella with the femoral trochlea in the sagittal plane can serve as a supplementary tool to the existing methods of evaluating patellar height, and may help to better identify the cases where inadequate engagement is recorded despite the absence of <b>patella</b> <b>alta,</b> so that the need for tibial tuberosity osteotomy may be re-assessed.

40|$|Background: Disruption of the capsule, medial patellar retinaculum, and/or vastus {{medialis}} obliqus {{has been}} associated with recurrent patellar instability. Biomechanical {{studies have shown that the}} medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the main restraint against lateral patella displacement and reconstruction of the MPFL has become an accepted surgical technique to restore patellofemoral stability in patients having recurrent patellar dislocation. We report a prospective series of patients of chronic patellar instability treated by reconstruction of medial patellofemoral ligament. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients (15 knees) with recurrent dislocation of patella, were operated between January 2006 and December 2008. All patients had generalised ligament laxity with none had severe grade of <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> or trochlear dysplasia. The MPFL was reconstructed with doubled semitendinosus tendon. Patients were followed up with subjective criteria, patellar inclination angle, and Kujala score. Results: The mean duration of followup after the operative procedures was an average of 42 months (range 24 - 60 months). 10 knees showed excellent results, 3 knees gave good results, and 2 knees had a fair result. The average patellar inclination angle decreased from 34. 3 ° to 18. 6 °. The average preoperative Kujala functional score was 44. 8 and the average postoperative score was 91. 9.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{superior}} dislocation of the patellatrapped by interlocked osteophytes. Unlike previous reports, in which the mechanism resulted from {{a blow to the}} inferior pole, it is postulated that increased load on the extensor mechanism, combined with <b>patella</b> <b>alta</b> and patellofemoral osteophytes, caused locking of the knee in extension. J Bone Joint Surg [Br] 2000; 82 -B: 890. A 43 -year-old tunnel worker presented with his left knee locked in extension. He had suffered a sudden severe pain in the anterior knee while lifting a heavy load. Although he could bear weight and raise the straight leg against gravity, he was unable to flex the knee. Previously, he had been a professional rugby league player and had undergone a left medial meniscectomy 19 years earlier. A lateral radiograph showed degenerative changes in the femor-otibial articulation, and the patella dislocated superiorly. Inferior patellar and anterosuperior femoral condylar osteophytes were interlocked (Fig. 1). Under general anaesthesia, with the hip flexed and the quad-riceps relaxed, the patella was reduced by upward pressure on the inferior pole. At hyperextension it was possible to reproduce the locking of the osteophytes. After these manipulations, the knee was opened through a medial parapatellar incision and the osteo-phytes were removed. The extensor mechanism was intact and the knee was able to move freely once more.
