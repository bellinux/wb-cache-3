40|$|Recent {{development}} in behavioral decision theory reveals {{the important role}} of decision environment in the consumer's evaluation and choice processes. Often it is referred as "decision framing. " Of particular interest is the online shopping environment, where buyers are usually forced to make their decisions under the sellers' (<b>programmed)</b> <b>guidance</b> on their web sites. How can the decision frames constructed in online shopping environment influence consumers' decision making? What should be done to exploit the characteristics of their framed decisions in the design of online shopping environments? In the present study, we considered an online PC shop as an example because {{it is one of the}} most popular and typical online shops and it will help us get insights into the consumers' online-framed decision characteristics. Buyers are usually led to specify the configurations of personal computers, i. e., CPU, memory and hard drive size, type of optical drives, etc., taking their preferences and budgets into account. In the course of specification processes, their decisions are framed in some ways and influenced by them. Among other things, the way the choice alternatives are presented (upgrading/ downgrading, etc.), from which buyers are expected to choose, is of special interest because it can be easily controlled by the sellers. Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the influence of some decision frames including the flow of selection process, the number of alternatives, the price intervals of the alternatives, and the default choice settings. The extremeness aversion, the shifts of the reference points, and the tradeoff between utility and economic loss aversion, are the examples of the involved effects. Above all, particular attention was paid to the default choice settings that provide the total prices as well as the reference points. Based on the results of the experiments, a set of theoretical conclusions and managerial implications of default choice settings are discussed. online shopping, decision framing, pricing, choice model...|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} current expenditures for secondary school <b>guidance</b> <b>programs</b> in Utah. In addition, the study {{attempted to}} evaluate the adequacy of selected <b>guidance</b> <b>programs</b> and {{to determine if a}} relationship existed between guidance expenditures and adequacy of <b>guidance</b> <b>programs.</b> Fiscal data were collected, tabulated, and analyzed using financial reports from the Utah Office of Education. Further, response forms were administered to students, school administrators, counselors, and teachers in an attempt to elicit responses from these persons relative to their perceptions of <b>guidance</b> <b>program</b> adequacy in their respective schools. Results indicated that Utah districts, as a group, spend 1. 6 percent of their instructional budgets for guidance purposes. This figure is considerably below the three percent usually recommended in the current literature as being necessary for a 2 ̆ 2 minimum 2 ̆ 2 <b>guidance</b> <b>program.</b> Significant differences were observed in the per pupil expenditures between National Defense Education Act, Title V participants and non- participants with the participants allocating the greater amount. Metropolitan districts were observed to be making significantly greater per pupil expenditures than districts with smaller populations. No significant differences were found in the number of 2 ̆ 2 yes, 2 ̆ 2 or positive responses, of students or teachers from 2 ̆ 2 minimum 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 maximum 2 ̆ 2 spending effort schools. A general conclusion was reached that Utah districts do not presently allocate percentages of instructional budgets {{that will allow them to}} develop or maintain sound <b>guidance</b> <b>programs.</b> Either larger budgetary consideration should be provided or else it should be clearly recognized by educators and the lay public that <b>guidance</b> <b>programs</b> that appear to be inadequate may be the result, in part, of unrealistic financing. A general recommendation that encompasses several others presented in the study is that a total re-evaluation of fiscal policies, practices, allocation procedures, and record keeping for <b>guidance</b> <b>programs</b> is in order. Improvement of budgetary practices and <b>guidance</b> <b>programs</b> are such that changes cannot be expected without increased awareness and commitment by counselor educators, administrators, parents, State Office of Education officials, and counselors.
