40|$|Abstract. The Single Point Incremental Forming process (SPIF) {{involves}} extensive plastic deformation. The {{complexity of}} the process results from high nonlinear boundary conditions, {{as well as from}} contact profile and frictional effects. The SPIF analysis is mathematically complex. However, {{due to the nature of}} these models, numerical approaches dominated by the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are now in widespread use. The paper presents the data and the main results of a study on SPIF through FEA. This study has been focusing on the friction coefficient which allows modeling of geometries, boundary conditions and material properties. SPIF has been studied under certain process conditions referring to the test workpiece, <b>punch</b> <b>tool,</b> etc., using ANSYS 11. 0. An important result is showing that the prediction model of the simulation clearly highlights the contact behavior between the <b>punch</b> <b>tool</b> and the workpiece. The study also shows the effect of the contact behavior on the thickness, strain and stress distributions, as well as on the accuracy of the product.

40|$|Abstract — As {{method for}} {{punching}} in oval shapes is not readily available, press tool for punching in oval shapes {{is required in}} various industries according to their applications. There are press tools for punching in circular shape, but when shapes other than circular shape are desired, they have to design according to dimensions required by industry. As application for oval shape punching differs from industry to industry because dimensions required by industries differ from each other. As some industries require more than one oval shaped holes {{that is to be}} done in single stroke for reducing the time required for production, there is need to design such press tool which can perform such operation. Hence to have fast production of required oval size holes, there is need to develop a press tool assembly which can make accurate oval holes on metal sheets. For designing such assembly, it is very necessary to study every aspect of existing design of press tool so that changes required can be easily define. Comparison of existing design with the proposed enables us to find correct way of design. Keywords- <b>Punching</b> <b>Tool,</b> Oval Punching, sheet metal, shee...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Fraunhofer IPT {{recently}} {{developed a new}} hybrid laser-assisted shearing process which enables conventional punching machines to produce punched sheared edges with continuous flush-cut surfaces in stainless steel plates (1. 4301), spring steel plates (1. 4310) and titanium alloy plates (3. 7165). The new combination of localised laser-induced softening of the plate material in the shearing zone and the shearing process significantly reduces both process forces and process-related noise emissions. A modular system-upgrade for existing punching machines allows laser-assisted shearing to be implemented {{without the need for}} expensive new machine designs. The principle of the laser-assisted shearing process is based on briefly and selectively heating the material in the shearing zone via local absorption of laser radiation {{on the underside of the}} sheet metal plate before the <b>punching</b> <b>tool</b> comes into contact on the upper side of the metal plate. Laser-induced heating softens the material in the shearing zone within the material within a few tenths of a second. The laser-induced softening mechanisms also lead to a significant decrease of cutting forces as well as a reduction of tool wear, warping and noise emissions...|$|E

The sheet material was steel of different strength (300 - 900 N/mm 2), an aluminium alloy and a copper alloy. In all series of experiments ceramic stamps with a diameter of 8 mm achieved a higher share of smooth cut area than punches of cemented carbides or high speed steel. The friction and wear investigations according to the pin-on-disc-procedure assist the choice of tool materials for the tribological system consisting of cutting punch, lubricant and sheet metal. The behavior of the friction pairs during dry and lubricated interactions strongly depends on the processing history and the direction of friction relative to the direction of surface grinding. For the development of caking, two mechanisms are proposed: - mechanical hooking similar to cutting and - adhesion during cold welding {{in the absence of}} lubrication. A tool design adjusted to ceramics and the choice of the optimized friction pairs are important conditions for the realization of a high service-life time...|$|E

The disperse raw material has to be conditioned into an agglomerated state and optimized for the uniaxial or isostatic compaction process, which consists of the transport of the bulk solid from the hopper into the <b>punching</b> <b>tool</b> and compaction of the loosely packed granules into a homogeneous prototype. Characterization of the bulk material during processing from the powder mixture into the granulated / agglomerated state is a decisive tool for product design and product processing, i. e. for the producers and processors of ceramic, metal or carbide mixtures or spray powders. Whereas the compaction behaviour describes the transformation of the material structure from bulk density into green density under pressure, the flowability characterizes the behaviour of the bulk solid during discharge, transport storage and metering. The paper describes common and novel granule and bulk solids characterization methods and the related standards. The interaction between single granule properties and the flowability of the complex granule mixture, i. e. the bulk solid, is demonstrated based on an alumina bulk solid.
