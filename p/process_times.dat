40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel method for improving earthwork construction processes by coupling microscopic process simulation and macroscopic optimization approaches. It is designed as an iterative process where simulation and optimization procedures alternate {{with one another}} and exchange data with each other. The optimization module determines the optimal allocation of earthwork masses from cut to fill areas, in the first cycle with respect to distances and later in terms of haulage time. The generated output is used in the simulation module for routing the transport vehicles accordingly. Subsequently, the <b>process</b> <b>time</b> is determined in the simulation procedure by including diverse microscopic conditions. The resulting <b>process</b> <b>time</b> on each route is then used in the next optimization step as input for optimizing the earthwork allocations. The coupling cycle is repeated iteratively until the total earthwork <b>process</b> <b>time</b> converges. Initial tests based on input data of real high-way construction projects record a significant reduction in the total earthwork <b>process</b> <b>time.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|The {{consensus}} {{view is that}} BPS reduces <b>process</b> <b>time,</b> {{defined as}} the end-to-end time required to serve a customer or to create one unit of the process output (Münstermann et al. 2010). The positive effect of BPS on <b>process</b> <b>time</b> is supported both conceptually and empirically. First, standardized processes can be performed more easily than non-standardized processes and, thus, require less time (Lillrank and Liukko 2004). By {{reducing the number of}} process variants, BPS also enhances process knowledge and transparency, two effects that enable employees working faster (Wüllenweber et al. 2008). Second, BPS increases employees’ experience with executing the process tasks and handling material, making it easier to identify sources of delay and parallelization (Jayaram and Vickery 1998). Third, process documentations can significantly reduce <b>process</b> <b>time</b> (Siha and Saad 2008). Combined {{with the fact that the}} master process must be documented to be rolled out, BPS shortens the <b>process</b> <b>time</b> via the documentation of the master process (Ungan 2006). Beyond these conceptual underpinnings, two empirical studies corroborate the positive effect of BPS on <b>process</b> <b>time.</b> In a study of 57 top-tier suppliers to the North American automotive industry, Jayaram et al. (2000) found BPS to be the most influential enabler of time reductions. In addition, Münstermann et al. (2010) found in a cross-industry study that BPS had a significantly positive effect on the duration of human resource processes.|$|R

Examinations are made to correct for phase velocity lateral heterogeneity and source <b>process</b> <b>time.</b> A simple regionalization (stable continent, tectonic region, young ocean, and old ocean) improves results of the linear inversion, but the phase correction is not large enough, and the discontinuous change of phase velocity across the boundary between regions causes an artificial rapid change in apparent phase velocity {{as a function of}} azimuth. Therefore, a more detailed but gradual representation of the lateral heterogeneity is desirable to correct for the propagation effect in the linear inversion. A source <b>process</b> <b>time</b> which consists of the nondirectional part of the apparent duration of main faulting and the delay time of the faulting from initial break is estimated by a phase analysis of Rayleigh waves. The source <b>process</b> <b>time</b> is generally proportional to the seismic moment on the log-log scale, but some earthquakes deviate considerably from the general relation. Therefore, the measurement of the source <b>process</b> <b>time</b> should be made before the moment tensor inversion.
