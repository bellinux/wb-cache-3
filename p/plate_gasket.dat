40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to find the pressure difference of the process of steam condensation across the port to channel in plate heat exchangers. In the present study, low corrugation angle (30 degrees) plates have been used for different number of channels, namely, 10 and 80. The process steam entered at 1 bar with a small degree of superheat. Water has been used as the cold fluid. The pressure probes are inserted through the <b>plate</b> <b>gasket</b> into both the inlet and exit ports of the channel. The pressure drop of the process steam has been measured and recorded at the first, middle, and last channels at different flow and exit conditions for each plate package of the heat exchanger. Also, the overall pressure drop has been measured at different conditions at the outlet of the process steam, i. e., full and partial condensation. The pressure drop measurements have indicated that there is a considerable variation in pressure drop from the first channel to the last channel due to flow maldistribution. The experimental data has been analyzed to show how the flow maldistribution affects the pressure drop of a plate condenser...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to find the flow and the pressure difference across the port to channel in plate heat exchangers {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds number. 1000 - 17000. In the present study, low corrugation angle plates have been used for different number of channels, namely, 20 and 80. Water has been used as working fluid for both hot and cold fluids. The pressure probes are inserted through the <b>plate</b> <b>gasket</b> into both the inlet and exit ports of the channel. The pressure drop is recorded at the first, middle and last channels for each plate package of the heat exchanger. Also. the overall pressure drop has been measured for various flow rates. This overall pressure drop is a function of the flow rate, the cross-sectional area ratio of channel to port and number of channels per fluid. A simplified non-dimensional channel velocity has been suggested based on the channel pressure drop and the mean channel pressure drop of plate package, to measure the deviation of the particular channel flow rate from the mean channel flow rate. The results indicated that the flow maldistribution increases with increasing overall pressure drop in the plate heat exchangers. The experimental results are verified with M. K. Bassiouny and H. Martin's [Chemical Engineering Science 39 (4) (1984) 693 and 701] analytical results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|Plate-type marine heat {{exchangers}} {{are designed with}} sets of multiple parallel plates that are compressed to form the main cooler unit. This type has a small foot print in comparison to other types of {{heat exchangers}}. The plates are designed {{in such a way}} that when placed next to each other they create passageways to the fluid to flow between the <b>plates.</b> <b>Gaskets</b> are placed around the edge of each plate in order to prevent the mixing of the two fluids. Due to the temperature and pressure constraints of the rubber used to make the <b>gaskets</b> <b>plate</b> type heat exchangers are used for low pressure, low temperature applications, under 290 psig and 300 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|R

50|$|The most {{practical}} modification for the 4R70W is the J-mod. It involves modifying the valve body separator <b>plate</b> and <b>gaskets</b> {{as well as}} changing or removing accumulator springs to alter the shift timing of the transmission. While these modifications {{can be done to}} 4R75W transmission, the results are not as dramatic as some of the details of the J-Mod (bigger holes in the separator <b>plate</b> and <b>gasket)</b> were done to the transmission in its design. These modifications are specified by one of the Ford engineers who designed the transmission. It offers faster engagement, quicker shifting, smoother operation, and increased service life. All parts can be bought at Ford dealers for less than $60 including the fluid.|$|R
40|$|A <b>gasketed</b> <b>plate</b> heat {{exchanger}} {{that has a}} seal pressure of 6. 5 MPa or more has been developed. This {{heat exchanger}} {{can be applied to}} heat exchangers (design temperature: 182 C, design pressure: 3. 43 MPa) for the residual heat removal (RHR) systems of boiling water reactors (BWR). Practical use of <b>gasketed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers under the condition of higher temperature and higher pressure has been achieved by developing a high-pressure-retaining plate and frame, as well as a heat- and radiation-resistant gasket. Various element tests related to strength and performance were conducted in the process of this development. A verification test using a prototype heat exchanger was also conducted, and pressure resistance, heat resistance, radiation resistance, endurance against thermal transients, and heat transfer performance have been confirmed. As a result of this development, <b>gasketed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers can be applied for use under the condition of higher temperature and higher pressure, and various effects such as lower system flow, smaller footprint, easier maintenance, and lower cost for weld inspection are expected, compared to conventional shell & tube heat exchangers...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are important, {{and used}} {{frequently in the}} processing, heat and power, air-conditioning and refrigeration, heat recovery, transportation and manufacturing industries. Such equipment is also important in electronics cooling and for environmental issues like thermal pollution, waste disposal and sustainable development. The present book concerns plate heat exchangers (PHEs), which {{are one of the}} most common types in practice. The overall objectives are to present comprehensive descriptions of such heat exchangers and their advantages and limitations, to provide in-depth thermal and hydraulic design theory for PHEs, and to present state-of-the-art knowledge. The book starts with a general introduction and historical background to PHEs, then discusses construction and operation (PHE types, plate pattern, etc.) and gives examples of PHEs in different application areas. Material issues (<b>plates,</b> <b>gaskets,</b> brazing materials) and manufacturing methods are also treated. The major part of the book concerns the basic design methods for both single-phase and two-phase flow cases, various flow arrangements, thermal-hydraulic performance in single-phase flow and for PHEs operating as condensers and evaporators. Fouling problems are also discussed and in a section on extended design and operation issues, modern Research and Development (R & D) tools like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are discussed. Unique features for PHEs are discussed throughou...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Jam {{petrochemical}} complex (JPC), Iran, {{the plates}} (ASTM A. 240 Type. 316) of some heat exchangers {{have been damaged}} due to the occurrence of cracks at the sitting place of gaskets. A comprehensive failure analysis including the chemical analysis, visual inspection, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the cracks spread over the plates together with the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the corrosion products and the measurement of chloride and sulfide ions content of the process water were employed for {{the examination of the}} failure mode and its causes. The obtained results indicate the building-up of the chloride and sulfide ions at the crevices between <b>plates</b> and <b>gaskets</b> at high temperature leads to stress cracking corrosion (SCC) of the plates. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of chloride and sulfide in the media hastens the SCC failure in the heat exchanger plates...|$|R
40|$|Improvement of polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) requires an in-depth {{understanding of the}} water transport mechanisms in the carbon fibre-based porous materials. These materials, known as the gas diffusion layers (GDLs), provide conductive electrical pathways for current collection. The fibrous microstructures also act as passages for water removal, which is necessary to prevent flooding and fuel starvation [1, 2]. Therefore, proper water management {{is the key to}} improving PEMFC performance. The current work explores the use of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to investigate water saturation of GDLs with different microstructures. Using a previously designed millimeter-scale ex-situ apparatus designed to facilitate flow field compression [3], a GDL sample was injected with liquid water at a controlled flow rate from an opening with a 0. 8 mm diameter. Figure 1 shows the components of the apparatus, which consists of a compression <b>plate,</b> a <b>gasket,</b> a GDL sample, and a back plate...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{methodology}} that incorporates the implementation and validation of experimental data {{analysis for the}} creation of a predictive tool of heat exchanger fouling effects. The goal is to determine a realistic fouling kinetics in order to develop an adapted maintenance practice for minimizing energetic and intervention costs. The test bench implemented is equipped with <b>plate</b> and <b>gaskets</b> heat exchanger provided with industrial plates sizes. Particles are injected into the cold fluid to simulate a fouling. A metrology device is used on heat exchanger in order to control thermal and hydraulic performance through usual parameters. Several realistic conditions are tested during a learning phase to establish predictive models based on these experimental data. Results are analyzed using: (i) the asymptotic fouling models of Kern and Seaton (ii) several predictive models from a statistical approach by different methods (multiple linear regression, artificial neural network). For each of them, conclusions are made about the accuracy of the modes and their application limits...|$|R
50|$|In oil tankers {{and other}} marine vessels used for {{transporting}} fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as sampling, inspection, gauging and cleaning. When the service opening {{is not in}} use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, {{commonly referred to as}} a Butterworth cover. Butterworth hatches are not the main access hatches, but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover <b>plate</b> with a <b>gasket</b> that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is fastened down with nuts or dogs.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{comparatively}} different methods of pressure drop calculation in the <b>gasket</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers (PHEs), using correlations recommended in literature on industrial {{data collected from}} a vegetable oil refinery. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the results obtained with these correlations, in order to choose one or two for practical purpose of pumping power calculations. We concluded that pressure drop values calculated with Mulley relationship and Buonopane & Troupe correlation were close and also Bond’s equation gave results pretty close to these but the pressure drop is slightly underestimated. Kumar correlation gave results far from all the others and its application will lead to oversize. In conclusion, for further calculations we will chose either the Mulley relationship or the Buonopane & Troupe correlation...|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} {{method for}} determining the best configuration(s) of <b>gasketed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers is presented. The objective is to select the configuration(s) with the minimum heat transfer area that still satisfies constraints {{on the number of}} channels, the pressure drop of both fluids, the channel flow velocities and the exchanger thermal effectiveness. The configuration of the exchanger is defined by six parameters, which are as follows: the number of channels, the numbers of passes on each side, the fluid locations, the feed positions and the type of flow in the channels. The resulting configuration optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of the exchanger heat transfer area and a screening procedure is proposed for its solution. In this procedure, subsets of constraints are successively applied to eliminate infeasible and nonoptimal solutions. Examples show that the optimization method is able to successfully determine a set of optimal configurations with a minimum number of exchanger evaluations. Approximately 5 % of the pressure drop and channel velocity calculations and 1 % of the thermal simulations are required for the solution...|$|R
40|$|A new {{structure}} of separator plate assembly (SPA), {{which consisted of}} a separator plate, flow field plates, perforated plates, frame <b>plates</b> and seal <b>gaskets.</b> was developed for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) in this study. In this structure, the separator plate, flow field plates and perforated plates were hard-contacted (directly contacted each other); meanwhile the frame plates and the separator plates were bound with the inorganic seal gaskets. SPA and electrodes could be combined {{together to form a}} unit of electrode-SPA. The {{new structure}} SPA promoted the smooth volatilizing and complete burning of the organic compounds in the matrix. It was effective and reliable to press the stack with a suitable stacking pressure. It was facile and simple to assemble a stack by using electrode-SPA. With the electrode-SPAs, two NICK stacks were assembled in co-flow and counter-flow, respectively. The performance of Stack B in counter-flow was higher than that of Stack A in co-flow at the same current density. The more uniform temperature distribution and current density distribution in Stack B were responsible for its higher performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} (PHEs) {{are among the}} most applicable thermal facilities in diverse industries, particularly in oil and gas operations. Due to their high thermal efficiencies, PHEs are widely used in industries. Plate {{heat exchangers}} are mainly made of thin plates that are pressed into a whole frame and shaped in a package. They are designed in various types based on which the plates might be flat or curved with different angles according to their applications. PHEs are much more sensitive to temperature and pressure than other heat exchangers. Their sensitivity is due to their structures that are mainly specified by <b>plate</b> perforations and <b>gasket</b> designs. In this article, a behavioral analysis of velocity Boundary layer in a flat plate heat exchanger in laminar flow condition through CFD simulation using software is done. The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the velocity vectors between the flat plates of heat exchanger. In addition wake occurrence, differences of velocity at different surfaces between plates, angles of velocity vectors and effect of wake phenomenon on the shear stresses exerted on the plates are discussed in detail. The study reveals results graphically based on fluid’s behavior in co-current and counter current flows and discusses thermal indexes consisting of heat transfer coefficient, Nusslet and total heat flux in both conditions...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{a commonly}} used device {{in many different}} industries, with many different applications. The heat exchanger used in the brewing program here at Central Washington University is a brazed plate and frame heat exchanger, so it cannot be taken apart for cleaning. Due to this, the overall efficiency of the heat exchanger will be reduced, causing fouling, because of the buildup of brewing material. In order to effectively combat this fouling, a heat exchanger must be constructed that can be disassembled for cleaning, and then reassembled with ease, while still being able to perform {{the same amount of}} heat transfer as the brazed system. Specifically, a <b>gasketed</b> <b>plate</b> and frame heat exchanger was constructed for this purpose, which utilizes rubber gaskets to seal the system, instead of brazing. This heat exchanger was constructed using twenty stainless steel plates, with four flow holes punched for the fluid paths, and arranged with the attached gaskets in a cross flow pattern. To test the effectiveness of this system, the heat exchanger will operate using cold tap water to cool down water heated to approximately 200 °F. The output temperature of the water will be measured in order to see how well the heat exchanger is able to transfer heat between the two fluids. The results of this test will indicate the viability of this system, state the specific rate of heat transfer within this system, and compare this value to the previously utilized brazed heat exchanger...|$|R
