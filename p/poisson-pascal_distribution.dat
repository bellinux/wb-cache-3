40|$|Abst ract. The present article {{shows that}} a {{limiting}} argument that is essentially the law of small numbers produces a proper discrete multivariate distribution from any generalized Poisson distribution. Based on this result, Engen's Extended Negative Binomial (ENB) model {{is derived from the}} <b>Poisson-Pascal</b> <b>distribution,</b> which is a generalization of the inverse Gaussian-Poisson distribution. The ENB model is also derived from Sichel's generalized inverse Gaussian-Poisson distribution. The application of the ENB model is discussed thereto. Key words and phrases: Compound Poisson, conditional inverse Gaussian Poisson, infinitely divisible, random clustering, species abundance. 1...|$|E
