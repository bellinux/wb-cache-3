5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's <b>police</b> <b>car</b> {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running <b>police</b> <b>car</b> parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E

The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on a computer in their <b>police</b> <b>car.</b> When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} the EV types, very few works have {{specified}} the type of the EV, such as buses [10, 12, 15], <b>police</b> <b>cars</b> [32], ambulances [4, 14]. While other works have merged several types of EV at the same time, such as in [39] where the authors have defined an EV as a vehicle that need priority to serve public needs, like fire trucks, ambulance, <b>police</b> <b>cars,</b> or in [24] where authors have concidered buses, tram, <b>police</b> <b>cars,</b> and ambulance as EVs.|$|R
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a <b>police</b> <b>car</b> travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the <b>police</b> <b>car</b> stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a <b>police</b> <b>car</b> matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
