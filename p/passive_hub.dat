50|$|Passive hubs {{limited the}} {{distance}} between a node and an active hub to 100 ft. A <b>passive</b> <b>hub</b> could not be connected directly to another <b>passive</b> <b>hub.</b> Unused ports on both types of hubs had to be terminated with a special connector.|$|E
50|$|To reduce costs, {{while still}} {{allowing}} coverage {{over a wide}} area, a common practice was to use one or more interconnected active hubs, each of which provided coverage for nodes no more than 200 ft away. Cable was run from each port of the active hubs to a different location no more than 100 ft away. A <b>passive</b> <b>hub</b> would then {{be attached to the}} end of the cable, and cables would be run locally from the <b>passive</b> <b>hub,</b> allowing connection of up to three nodes. In this way, a single 8-port active hub could be used to connect 24 networked devices over an area not exceeding 400 ft in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The {{centre section}} of The Bentway spans the Fort York neighbourhood. The trail will proceed along the Fort Front, where natural and {{recreation}} spaces are provided. A bridge called the Iconic Crossing will then carry the trail across Fort York Boulevard, immediately east of June Callwood Park. The trail then enters the <b>Passive</b> <b>Hub,</b> a water-themed area, and then crosses Bathurst Street.|$|E
40|$|Saha, Sandvik Tamrock Oy There are applications, {{where both}} maximum {{available}} bandwidth and reliability are needed. In those applications many issues- like effects of harsh environment, power supply, network length, available bandwidth, bus load, bus topology- {{must be taken}} into account to meet the requirements. There are different solutions to build CAN-networks and every solution has it's own benefits and drawbacks. The packet structure of CAN frames causes most of the limitations, when compared i. e. with Ethernet. Especially with high bit rates, up to 1 Mb/s, those limitations force to very careful network design. This paper will present, that in all selections of networking solutions must be done by taking into account the requirements of the application. Bus, star and tree topologies are examined with active and <b>passive</b> <b>HUBs,</b> repeaters and switches and many pitfalls are found and analyzed. In high speed CAN-networks, inter-segment routing has been found to be one of the most reliable implementation in complex systems. Based on the comparisons can be stated, that the most general solution for combining high-speed CAN-segments, which also meets standards, is to use switches with fully isolated CAN-interfaces. Those systems are electrically reliable, easy to assemble and terminate and maintain over system's life cycle...|$|R
5000|$|Original ARCNET used RG-62/U {{coaxial cable}} of 93 Î© {{impedance}} and either <b>passive</b> or active <b>hubs</b> in a star-wired bus topology. At {{the time of}} its greatest popularity, this was a significant advantage of ARCNET over Ethernet. A star-wired bus was much easier to build and expand (and was more readily maintainable) than the clumsy linear bus Ethernet of the time. The [...] "interconnected stars" [...] cabling topology made it easy to add and remove nodes without taking down the whole network, and much easier to diagnose and isolate failures within a complex LAN.|$|R
50|$|ARCNET had the {{disadvantage}} of requiring either an active or <b>passive</b> <b>hub</b> between nodes if {{there were more than}} two nodes in the network, while thin Ethernet allowed nodes to be spaced anywhere along the linear coax cable. However, ARCNET passive hubs were very inexpensive, being composed of a simple, small, unpowered box with four ports, wired together with nothing more than four discrete resistors, so {{the disadvantage}} was not significant.|$|E
5000|$|Token Ring network {{interface}} cards contain {{all of the}} intelligence required for speed autodetection, routing and can drive themselves on many Multistation Access Units (MAUs) that operate without power (most MAUs operate in this fashion, only requiring a power supply for LEDs). Ethernet {{network interface}} cards can theoretically operate on a <b>passive</b> <b>hub</b> to a degree, but not as a large LAN {{and the issue of}} collisions is still present.|$|E
50|$|A bus-powered hub (<b>passive</b> <b>hub)</b> is a hub {{that draws}} all its {{power from the}} host computer's USB interface. It does not need a {{separate}} power connection. However, many devices require more power than this method can provide and will not work {{in this type of}} hub. It may be desirable to use a bus-powered hub with self-powered external hard-disk units, as they may not go into sleep mode immediately upon computer shut-down or sleep mode when using a self-powered hub since they will continue to see a power source on the USB ports when using a self-powered hub.|$|E
