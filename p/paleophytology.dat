A synonym is <b>paleophytology.</b> Paleobotany includes the study of terrestrial plant fossils, {{as well as the}} study of prehistoric marine photoautotrophs, such as photosynthetic algae, seaweeds or kelp. A closely related field is palynology, which is the study of fossilized and extant spores and pollen.|$|E
