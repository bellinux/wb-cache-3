Using such logs collected by a production Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> device {{over a period of}} 15 months, we generate a diurnal model of network accesses. These models are used to detect anomalous authentications, which merit further investigation by a security analyst. We intend that this work will dramatically reduce the amount time spent by analysts identifying anomalous events and allow them to focus on in-depth analysis of these anomalies.

40|$|A virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) {{provides}} <b>private</b> <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> over {{a publicly}} accessible shared network. Bandwidth provisioning for VPNs leads to challenging optimization problems. In the hose model proposed by Duffield et al., each VPN endpoint specifies bounds {{on the total}} amount of traffic that it will send or receive at any time. The network provider must provision the VPN so that there is sufficient bandwidth for any traffic matrix that is consistent with these bounds. While previous work has considered tree routing and single-path routing between the VPN endpoints, we demonstrate that the use of multipath routing offers significant advantages. On the one hand, we present an optimal polynomial-time algorithm that computes a bandwidth reservation of minimum cost using multi-path routing. This is in contrast to tree routing and single-path routing, where the problem is computationally hard. On the other hand, we present experimental results showing that the reservation cost using multi-path routing can indeed be significantly smaller than with tree or single-path routing...|$|R

The effective allocation of bandwidth for VPNs assumes {{significance in the}} present scenario due to varied traffic. Each VPN endpoint specifies bounds on {{the total amount of}} traffic that it is likely to send or receive at any time. The network provider tailors the VPN so that there is sufficient bandwidth for any traffic matrix that is consistent with these bounds. The approach incorporates the use of Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, with a view to accomplish an enhancement in the performance of the mobile networks. The NS 2 based simulation results are evaluated in terms of its metrics for different bandwidth allocations, besides analyzing its performance in the event of exigencies such as link failures. The results highlight the suitability of the proposed strategy in the context of real time applications.

Making {{use of the}} combination of these technologies for the data transmission and for the signaling of the communication, we analyze several scenarios with increasing complexity. The complete picture appears in the last scenario where all technologies are invol ved and the network is composed of heterogeneous mobile nodes. The paper also presents a solution for the setup of a secured communication channel (i. e. a Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> <b>connection)</b> between several heterogeneous mobile nodes controlled by the cellular network operator. The mobile nodes can be either cellular aware or non-cellular aware in this framework. We propose to setup the heterogeneous network communications via the cellular network using the cellular aware nodes...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{extensive}} description of my internship at Janssen Pharmaceuticals in Beerse. During {{a period of}} 9 weeks I have worked at the Pharmaceutical Research and Development Information Technology department. Computational scientists at Janssen Pharmaceuticals carry out research on drugs using computer analysis in order to discover new medicines. Since {{it has become a}} common practice that scientists are working from home at least one day a week, the objective of my internship was to investigate this. How these scientists can work efficiently from different settings and to what extent working remotely affects their everyday job. The following cases are handled in this regard: 1. 	A brief introduction of the company Janssen Pharmaceuticals. 2. 	The approach and the goal of this internship are described. These are based on a survey conducted of the scientists about the possibilities, impossibilities, needs, usability etc. when working remotely. 3. 	Creating, duplicating and copying a virtual machine of the company 2 ̆ 7 s standard operating systems are compared for different tools. On these virtual machines, are the standard tools available and working on remote locations? Are the Centrify user accounts still working? 4. 	Accessing Janssen Pharmaceuticals 2 ̆ 7 network via their virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> <b>connection</b> from different operating systems. 5. 	On a Windows computer, different tools for remote access and file sharing that can be used when using the virtual private network remotely. 6. 	On a Linux computer, different tools for remote console access and file sharing that can be used when using the virtual private network remotely. 7. 	Various tools for remote desktop sharing on different operating systems are tested and compared. 8. 	The performance and usability of working from home is measured by running jobs with different sets of data at work and at home. The results are plotted and compared. Different tools to work remotely are proposed. Their advantages and disadvantaged are compared for different setups. 9. 	The available possibilities to continue a job that has been launched previously are discussed. 10. 	When working remotely, data needs to be secure according to the guidelines of the company. 11. 	The scientific tools for data analysis mentioned by scientists are defined. The final goal would be to empower scientists so they can spend more time on important issues, instead of searching for tools that fit their needs to work more efficiently. Therefore, I hope that this thesis benefits the company in its constant innovation by providing information about the possibilities of home-based worker...|$|E

50|$|SBCs {{are often}} used by {{corporations}} along with firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to enable VoIP calls to and from a protected enterprise network.

SBCs also replace the function of application-level gateways. In larger enterprises, SBCs can also be used in conjunction with SIP trunks to provide call control and make routing/policy decisions on how calls are routed through the LAN/WAN. There are often tremendous cost savings associated with routing traffic through the internal IP networks of an enterprise, rather than routing calls through a traditional circuit-switched phone network.|$|R

Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) <b>connection</b> on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office.

In this project the initial process execution {{time of a}} Virtual <b>Private</b> <b>Network</b> (VPN) <b>connection</b> request has been reduced from some 60 days to 2 days. This has been achieved {{by the use of}} a new business process reengineering (BPR) implementation approach that was developed by the Utrecht University. The implementation approach is based on a combination of Enterprise Information Architecture (EIA), Business Process Modeling (BPM), Knowledge Management and Management Control methodologies and techniques. The method has been applied to improve the performance of a Dutch e-government service department (DeGSD). DeGSD is an e-government service department that supports and promotes electronic communication. It can be described as an electronic mail office for consumers that provides the ICT infrastructure to communicate with the government. The goal is to reduce administrative activities for both the government and consumers. Also supporting technology and part of the process is outsourced. In our approach we used EIA as a starting point because it {{describes a}}ll relations and information exchange with all stakeholders. This is different compared to more traditional approaches which (when it comes to automation) tend to have a main focus on the internal processes whereas our approach aligns the processes and systems across different participants, such as suppliers and customers, in the supply chain. Also included in the implementation approach are management control design mechanisms to ensure that the organizations strategy is in sync with its processes and activities that are performed by the employees. Management control is crucial in enabling the continuous measuring and improving of the organizational performance. Although the proposed BPR implementation approach worked in the project at DeGSD, further validation is necessary. Therefore we suggest that more case studies are performed at both government and profit organizations...|$|R
