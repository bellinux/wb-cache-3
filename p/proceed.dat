40|$|We {{separate}} equity issuance <b>proceeds</b> {{into two}} parts: option <b>proceeds</b> generated by {{employee stock option}} exercises and non-option <b>proceeds</b> engendered by all other forms of equity issues. We document that over the period 1998 - 2013, the aggregate amount of option <b>proceeds</b> exceeds that of non-option <b>proceeds</b> for a large sample of U. S. firms. In particular, firms allocate option <b>proceeds</b> predominantly to cash holdings, followed by investment and equity repurchase, while non-option <b>proceeds</b> are mainly allocated to investment and cash holdings. Further analysis shows that financial constraints affect the allocation of equity issuance <b>proceeds</b> by shifting the use of option <b>proceeds</b> away from stock repurchases to investment and cash savings, while directing non-option <b>proceeds</b> away from investment to cash savings...|$|R

First, it allows the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize property which it suspects to be the <b>proceeds</b> of crime for up to 21 days. Second, it reduces the threshold value of property which can be pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau from €13,000 to €5,000.|$|R

5|$|According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, Hawker's {{interest}} {{may have}} also been stimulated {{by the presence of}} Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation author Francis K. Mason expressed a contrary view, stating that Hawker's decision to <b>proceed</b> was independent of British government initiatives, and that the P.1127 project was primarily based upon the NATO requirement instead. Hawker had a keen ally in its development in the form of Bristol, but by that point the latter was experiencing financial difficulties, and the lack of foreseeable commercial applications for the Pegasus engine in particular, coupled with refusals from HM Treasury, mean that development would have to be financed by NATO institutions instead. The close cooperation between Hawker and Bristol was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as a key factors which had enabled the P.1127's development to <b>proceed</b> in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.|$|E

The main chapters of the first part of this thesis are chapters dealing with court fee and lawyer fee. The second part of this thesis concentrates on the difference between paying and compensating the costs of <b>proceeding,</b> the issue of deciding on costs, together with the right of court not to compensate the costs of <b>proceeding</b> as they should be compensated under normal circumstances. The final chapter gives a comparison of the costs of civil dispute <b>proceeding</b> between Czech legislation and the legislation of the states that share borders with the Czech Republic and finally it describes shortly the costs of <b>proceeding</b> at the European Court of Justice...|$|R

5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should <b>proceed</b> to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to <b>proceed</b> are given by the conductor.|$|E
