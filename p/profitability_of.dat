The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the LGOC and had a negative impact on the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the whole UERL group.|$|E

If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} associated with innovation, {{it is difficult to}} assess the <b>profitability</b> potential <b>of</b> business model innovations. However, since theory predicts and explains, and assessing the <b>profitability</b> potential <b>of</b> a business model is about predicting what its profitability will be in the future, we can use strategy theories to help with the assessment.

5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Other than parasites and disease, {{predation}} is {{a threat}} to sheep and the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.|$|E

The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and there were {{only a limited number of}} aggressive incidents.

5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Stjørdal {{remained}} a controversy. The river Stjørdalselva created a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, making it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river until Hegra. This would make the line bypass Stjørdalshalsen on the north shore, the largest town between Trondheim and Östersund. Despite massive local protests, Parliament ultimately chose the southern alternative. The added distance reduced Stjørdalshalsen's trade role while reducing railway revenue as the steam ships continued to run on the route, thus reducing the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the line. Stjørdalselva Bridge was opened in 1902 when the Hell–Sunnan Line opened to Stjørdal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the {{agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual {{rate of growth of}} exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification.|$|E
30|$|Literature {{considers}} entrepreneurship as {{an important}} catalyst {{in the process of}} improving firm performance and growth. This study analyzes the impacts of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) dimensions (i.e., innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking) on the <b>profitability</b> growth <b>of</b> local Tanzania’s construction firms. A survey to 132 Tanzanian construction firms was undertaken using a questionnaire. With the help of STATA 13.0 Software, data collected was analyzed by using a multiple regression analysis. The findings show that both innovativeness and risk taking dimensions have a significantly positive effect on the growth <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> for local Tanzania’s construction firms, whereas the proactiveness dimension has a negative significant effect. This study contributes to the field of entrepreneurship in developing countries and enhances the knowledge of the impacts of EO dimensions on the <b>profitability</b> growth <b>of</b> firms (in particular construction firms).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{financial}} trading system whose strategy is developed by means of an artificial neural network approach based on a recurrent reinforcement learning algorithm. In general terms, this kind of approach consists in specifying a trading policy based on some predetermined investor’s measure <b>of</b> <b>profitability,</b> and in setting the financial trading system while using it. In particular, with respect to the prominent literature, in this contribution: first, we take into account as measure <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> the reciprocal <b>of</b> the returns weighted direction symmetry index instead of the wide-spread Sharpe ratio; second, we obtain the differential version of this measure <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> and obtain all the related learning relationships; third, we propose a procedure for the management of drawdown-like phenomena; finally, we apply our financial trading approach to some of the major world financial market indices. ...|$|R
