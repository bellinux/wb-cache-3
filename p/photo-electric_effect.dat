40|$|Formulations {{for second}} and higher {{harmonic}} frequency {{up and down}} conversions, as well as multi photon processes directly assume summability and divisibility of photons. Quantum mechanical (QM) interpretations are completely congruent with these assumptions. However, for linear optical phenomena (interference, diffraction, refraction, material dispersion, spectral dispersion, etc.), we have a profound dichotomy. Most optical engineers innovate and analyze all optical instruments by propagating pure classical electromagnetic (EM) fields using Maxwell s equations and gives only lip-service to the concept "indivisible light quanta". Further, irrespective of linearity or nonlinearity of the phenomena, the final results are always registered through some <b>photo-electric</b> or photo-chemical <b>effects.</b> This is mathematically well modeled by a quadratic action (energy absorption) relation. Since QM does not preclude divisibility or summability of photons in nonlinear & multi-photon effects, it cannot have any foundational reason against these same possibilities in linear optical phenomena. It implies that we must carefully revisit the fundamental roots behind all light-matter interaction processes and understand the common origin of "graininess" and "discreteness" of light energy...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} motion of dust grains into the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) around {{redshift}} z = 3, {{to test the hypothesis}} that grains can efficiently pollute the gas with metals through sputtering. We use the results available in the literature for radiation-driven dust ejection from galaxies as initial conditions, and follow the motion onward. Via this mechanism, grains are ejected into the IGM with velocities> 100 km s − 1; as they move supersonically, grains can be efficiently eroded by non-thermal sputtering. However, Coulomb and collisional drag forces effectively reduce the charged grain velocity. Up-to-date sputtering yields for graphite and silicate (olivine) grains have been derived using the code TRIM, for which we provide analytic fits. After training our method on a homogeneous density case, we analyze the grain motion and sputtering in the IGM density field as derived from a ΛCDM cosmological simulation at z = 3. 27. We found that only large (a � 0. 1 -µm) grains can travel up to considerable distances (few × 100 kpc physical) before being stopped. Resulting metallicities show a well defined trend with overdensity δ. The maximum metallicities are reached for 10 < δ < 100 (corresponding to systems, in QSO absorption spectra, with 14. 5 < log N(Hi) < 16). However the distribution of sputtered metals is very inhomogeneous, with {{only a small fraction of}} the IGM volume polluted by dust sputtering (filling factors of 18 per cent for Si and 6 per cent for C).

In spite of this, the observational situation remains very limited; the last instrument dedicated to X-ray polarimetry flew decades ago on OSO- 8, and the few recent measurements {{have been made by}} instruments optimized for other purposes. However, the technical capabilities to greatly advance the observational situation are in hand. Recent developments in micro-pattern gas detectors allow use of the polarization sensitivity of the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect,</b> which is the dominant interaction in the band above 2 keV. We present the scientific and technical requirements for an X-ray polarization observatory consistent with the scope of a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission, along with a representative catalog of what the observational capabilities and expected sensitivities for the first year of operation could be. The mission is based on the technically robust design of the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX (GEMS) which completed a Phase B study and Preliminary Design Review in 2012.

40|$|From {{a formal}} and {{academic}} point of view, the Hounsfield number definition is only truly independent {{of energy for}} water and vacuum. The X-ray attenuation coefficients of other substances do not vary with energy {{in the same way}} as water and indeed they are often very different. Thus before even considering energy spectra and beam hardening effects, the definition is already ambiguous because the mono-energetic X-ray beam is undefined. Many papers have been published on the compensation of beam hardening and among those papers there is a subcategory that proposes some form of integration over the energy spectrum for practical X-ray sources. Usually, there is some mention of the “effective beam energy” 1 or mapping values to “some mono-chromatic energy”, 2 which in the case of Reference 2 is 70 keV. Thus, both academically and practically, there is a need for defining the conditions under which the Hounsfield number definition is valid. This requires not only the energy to be defined but also the attenuation coefficient. For the former, an alternative might be to define an energy spectrum, but this appears more difficult, at least at first sight. For the latter, it would mean specifying the attenuation coefficient for either scattering plus the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> or for just the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect.</b> When measuring uniform samples for a standard, it would be possible to adapt the detector to include or exclude scattered photons to a high level of accuracy. Of course, the adoption of a rigorous definition would not cure all CT problems overnight, but it would create a firmer foundation and would open the way to publishing standard Hounsfield values for common materials.
