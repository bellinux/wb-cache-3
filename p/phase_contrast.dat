5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>contrast</b> and {{differential}} interference contrast (DIC) microscopy {{are important}} tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> and DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under <b>phase</b> <b>contrast.</b> Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} lies in the detailed comparison of the predictions of linear elastic properties of mean field homogenization approaches and full field, voxel-based homogenization methods for short-fiber reinforced materials. In the former case, the self-consistent, the interaction direct derivative and a two-step-bounding approach, applying the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds, are used. In the latter case, the boundary value problem for representative volume elements is solved using fast Fourier transformation. Model microstructures with unidirectional aligned and two misaligned fiber configurations are considered exemplarily. Fiber volume fractions of 13 %, 17 % and 21 % and <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> of 44, 100 and 1000 in the elastic moduli have been taken into account. The different homogenization schemes are compared by means of effective directional dependent Young's modulus. This detailed comparison shows that mean field and full field solutions deliver similar results for moderate <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> and volume fractions.

For study one, a rubric based on the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) design standards was developed to assess the overall quality of SCR design methodology employed by each of the 24 included studies. One study met all design standards, 10 studies met one or more design standards with reservations, and 13 studies did not meet {{one or more of the}} design standards. For study two, the Tau-U effect size was used to synthesize SCR design data and estimate the overall effect size of SSIs on school-related challenging behavior. A total of 301 <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> were analyzed from the 75 participants. The aggregated Tau-U effect size across the 24 included studies was. 67 (SE =. 02) with a confidence interval of CI_(95) =. 63 to. 71.

It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based <b>phase</b> <b>contrast,</b> talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details.

40|$|Background: Tear {{desiccation}} on a {{glass surface}} followed by transmitted-light microscopy {{has served as}} diagnostic test for dry eye. Four distinctive morphological domains (zones I, II, III and transition band) have been recently recognized in tear microdesiccates. Physicochemical dissimilarities among those domains hamper comprehensive microscopic examination of tear microdesiccates. Optimal observation conditions of entire tear microdesiccates are now investigated. One-mu l aliquots of tear collected from individual healthy eyes were dried at ambient conditions on microscope slides. Tear microdesiccates were examined by combining low-magnification objective lenses with transmitted-light microscopy (brightfield, <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> Ph 1, 2, 3 and darkfield). Results: Fern-like structures (zones II and III) were visible with all illumination methods excepting brightfield. Zone I was the microdesiccate domain displaying the most noticeable illumination-dependent variations, namely transparent band delimited by an outer rim (Ph 1, Ph 2), homogeneous compactly built structure (brightfield) or invisible domain (darkfield, Ph 3). Intermediate positions of the condenser (BF/Ph 1, Ph 1 /Ph 2) showed a structured roughly cylindrical zone I. The transition band also varied from invisibility (brightfield) to a well-defined domain comprising interwoven filamentous elements (<b>phase</b> <b>contrasts,</b> darkfield). Conclusions: Imaging of entire tear microdesiccates by transmitted-light microscopy depends upon illumination. A more comprehensive description of tear microdesiccates {{can be achieved by}} combining illumination methods.

40|$|International audienceModelling {{transport}} and long-term creep in concrete materials {{is a difficult}} problem when {{the complexity of the}} microstructure is taken into account, because it is hard to predict instantaneous elastic responses. In this work, several numerical methods are compared to assess their properties and suitability to model concrete-like microstructures with large <b>phase</b> properties <b>contrast.</b> The methods are classical finite elements, a novel extended finite element method (μ-xfem), an unconstrained heuristic meshing technique (amie), and a locally homogenising preprocessor in combination with various solvers (benhur).

25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in optical density. <b>Phase</b> <b>contrast</b> {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> image. One disadvantage of phase-contrast microscopy is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of heat treatment on the structure and morphology of spray formed structurally amorphous steel, several small samples were cut from one spray formed amorphous steel ingot (DAR – 35). The samples were heat treated at 700 o C in a tube furnace under a constant flow of 99. 9 % argon for up to 120 hours. The samples were furnace cooled to 300 o C. Later they were quenched in water. The structure was investigated using x-ray diffraction and the morphology of the polished and lightly etched samples was examined under both optical and scanning electron microscopes. The {{results indicate that the}} spray formed steels were amorphous. However, their microstructure is not homogeneous. The microstructure is composed of three distinctively different <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> (viz. light gray, dark gray and bright white contrasts). The bright white phase contained maximum amount of tungsten and molybdenum, it had the least amount of iron. Both light and dark gray phases contained nearly the compositionally expected amount of iron, and more chromium than compositionally expected. The effect of heat treatment at 700 o C had no effect on the three different <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts.</b> However, the heat treatment at 700 o C showed some effect on the crystallization of the structure. The heat treatment for up to 24 hours has very little effect on the structure and morphology of the amorphous steel samples. However, if the samples were heat treated at 700 o C for more than 24 and below 72 hours, it appears that a partial crystallization of the steel occurs. Significant crystallization of the spray formed amorphous steel occurs due to prolonged heat treatment above 72 hours...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{interesting}} {{outcomes of the}} study of the physical applications of spectral singularities in PT-symmetric optical systems is the discovery of CPA-lasers. These are devices that act both as a threshold laser and a coherent perfect absorber (CPA) for the same values of their physical parameters. Unlike a homogeneous slab that is made to act as a CPA, a slab CPA-laser would absorb the incident waves coming from the left and right of the device provided that they have appropriate intensity and <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts.</b> We provide a comprehensive study of one of the simplest experimentally accessible examples of a CPA-laser, namely a PT-symmetric optical slab system consisting of a balanced pair of adjacent or separated gain and loss components. In particular, we give a closed form expression describing the spectral singularities of the system which correspond to its CPA-laser configurations. We determine the intensity and <b>phase</b> <b>contrasts</b> for the TE and TM waves that are emitted (absorbed) whenever the slab acts as a laser (CPA). We also investigate the behavior of the time-averaged energy density and Poynting vector for these waves. This is necessary for determining the optimal values of the physical parameters of the system that make it act as a CPA-laser. These turn out to correspond to situations where the separation distance $s$ between the gain and loss layers is an odd multiple of a characteristic length scale $s_ 0 $. A curious by-product of our study is that, except for the cases where $s$ is an even integer multiple of $s_ 0 $, there is a critical angle of polarization beyond which the energy of the waves emitted from the lossy layer can be larger than the energy of those emitted from the gain layer.

Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for <b>phase</b> <b>contrast,</b> differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with <b>phase</b> <b>contrast</b> microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes.
