2500|$|The RFB is a {{semi-automatic}} firearm chambered for 7.62Ã—51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines, which insert {{straight into the}} magazine well and {{do not need to}} rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system. The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and <b>pivot</b> <b>upwards</b> to extract the spent case after firing. [...] Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute {{to the left of the}} barrel. To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger. The weapon is fully ambidextrous, much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights. A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.|$|E
50|$|In these trucks after {{transporting}} the missile, the missile-launching mechanism {{with the}} missile {{on it is}} <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards</b> {{to put it into}} position for launching.|$|R
50|$|The tip-up was {{the first}} {{revolver}} design for use with metallic cartridges in the Smith & Wesson Model 1, on which the barrel <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards,</b> hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. On the S&W tip-up revolvers, the barrel release catch is located {{on both sides of}} the frame in front of the trigger.|$|R
50|$|These {{multiple}} missile {{batteries are}} also <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards</b> for launching and the launcher {{in some cases}} can be rotated around on the chassis (or platform) of the truck. To prepare for launching operations, outriggers are extended from the truck and placed {{on the ground to}} stabilize the truck from a recoil reaction during a missile launch.|$|R
50|$|When the gun {{was ready}} to fire, a round {{would be in the}} chamber and the bolt and barrel group would be locked together, with the locking block {{at the rear of the}} bolt. When the rear of the trigger was <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards</b> by the operator, the front of the trigger tipped downward, pulling the sear out of {{engagement}} with the spring-loaded firing pin, allowing it to move forward and strike the primer of the cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The Smith & Wesson Model 2 Army is {{a single}} action tip-up revolver, on which the barrel <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards,</b> hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. It can be {{identified}} by its octagonal barrel, smooth cylinder (lacking fluting) and the flat shape of the grip butt. The revolvers were available in blued or nickel-plated finishes and the majority were produced with 5 or 6-inch barrels. 4-inch barrels were rare and a few revolvers with 8 and 10-inch barrels an extreme rarity.|$|R
25|$|The tip-up was {{the first}} {{revolver}} design for use with metallic cartridges in the Smith & Wesson Model 1, on which the barrel <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards,</b> hinged on the forward end of the topstrap. On the S & W tip-up revolvers, the barrel release catch is located {{on both sides of}} the frame in front of the trigger. Smith & Wesson discontinued it in the third series of the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2 but it was fairly widely used in Europe in the 19th century, after a patent by Spirlet in 1870, which also included an ejector.|$|R
5000|$|A hybrid between {{full face}} and open face helmets for street use is the modular or [...] "flip-up" [...] helmet, also {{sometimes}} termed [...] "convertible" [...] or [...] "flip-face". When fully assembled and closed, they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts. Its chin bar may be <b>pivoted</b> <b>upwards</b> (or, in some cases, may be removed) {{by a special}} lever to allow access {{to most of the}} face, as in an open face helmet. The rider may thus eat, drink or have a conversation without unfastening the chinstrap and removing the helmet, making them popular among motor officers. It is also popular with people who use eyeglasses as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{back several}} {{inches of the}} barrel (the chamber) is a {{separate}} piece that <b>pivots</b> <b>upwards</b> from the front for reloading, similar in concept to the later Norwegian kammerlader. In essence, the weapon was still loaded front to back, but without the need to ram the charge {{all the way from}} the muzzle, similar in concept to loading a cylinder of an early cap-and-ball (percussion) revolver. One could also think of it as similar to loading a short barreled, single shot muzzle-loading [...] "horse pistol", which then hinges down behind an extra several feet of barrel, avoiding the need for extracting the long ram-rod from its underbarrel rings, rotating it so the ramming head faced the muzzle, ramming the charge down the barrel, extracting the rod, flipping it again, and then returning it to its holding rings. With the short chamber, a simple hand-held tool could be used to easily and quickly seat the bullet onto the charge. More importantly, as with all breechloaders (and muzzle-loaders, prior to the invention of the Minie ball), the fact that one didn't need to load through the whole barrel allowed for the use of rifling in a standard-issue front-line military weapon (as opposed to weapons issued in small numbers to elite troops such as sharpshooters). In order for rifling to work, the projectile must fit very snugly in the barrel, which makes it harder and slower to ram the bullet down the barrel. Once fired, black powder builds up thick fouling very quickly, which makes the gun even harder to load; a typical muzzle-loading rifle couldn't be fired more than 3-4 times before requiring cleaning, or the bullet would be impossible to force down the barrel on loading, even with the mallet typically issued to riflemen to aid in forcing the bullet through the rifling while loading after the first two shots. This fact is why soldiers were still issued smoothbore muskets firing loose-fitting round balls, long after the merits of rifling were known; rifles simply couldn't be loaded fast enough for use in open-field combat, even though they were far more effective shot-for-shot. The loose fit of a musket ball allowed for faster loading, even after fouling built up, but also made adding rifling useless, since it wouldn't work without a tight-fitting projectile. With a breech-loader, a tight-fitting projectile can be used, as it doesn't have to be forced down the barrel, which allows the use of rifling as well as a fast rate of fire. This fact means that even a breechloader that only achieved the same rate of fire as a muzzle-loading musket would still be superior to the musket, as the breechloader could be rifled and the musket couldn't, although in fact, breechloaders generally also had a greater rate of fire.|$|R
5000|$|Remington {{manufactured}} {{more than}} 150,000 over-under double-barreled derringers from 1866 {{until the end}} of their production in 1935. The gun was made only in [...]41 rimfire. The Remington derringer design doubled the capacity, while maintaining a compact size, by adding a second barrel on top of the first and <b>pivoting</b> the barrels <b>upwards</b> to reload. Each barrel then held one round, and a cam on the hammer alternated between top and bottom barrels. There were four models with several variations. The Remington derringer was in [...]41 Short caliber and achieved wide popularity. The [...]41 Short bullet moved very slowly, at about 425 ft/s, around half the speed of a modern [...]45 ACP. It could be seen in flight, but at very close range, such as at a casino or saloon card table, it could easily kill.|$|R
5000|$|A derringer is {{generally}} the smallest usable handgun {{of a given}} caliber. They were frequently used by women, because they are easily concealable in a purse or as a stocking gun. Such weapons designed specifically for women were called [...] "muff pistols", due to their compact size enabling them to be carried in a muff. Derringers are not repeating firearms - repeating mechanisms such as those used in semi-automatic handguns and/or revolvers would add significant bulk to the gun, defeating the purpose. The original cartridge derringers held only a single round, usually a pinfire or rimfire [...]40 caliber cartridge, with the barrel pivoted sideways on the frame to allow access to the breech for reloading. The famous Remington derringer design doubled the capacity, while maintaining the compact size, by adding a second barrel {{on top of the}} first and <b>pivoting</b> the barrels <b>upwards</b> to reload. Each barrel then held one round, and a cam on the hammer alternated between top and bottom barrels. The Remington derringer was in [...]41 Short caliber and achieved wide popularity.|$|R
