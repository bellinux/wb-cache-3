As an island is growing, an initial <b>pure</b> <b>bend</b> texture of the c-director changes into a reversing spiral at a critical size.

40|$|Curvature of a {{single-mode}} {{optical fibre}} {{gives rise to}} two principal forms of additional transmission loss, namely transition loss and <b>pure</b> <b>bend</b> loss. The transition loss and the associated ray radiation, which have been observed {{at the beginning of}} a bend, can be satisfactorily explained by a modified coupled mode theory. The radiation modes are represented by a quasi-guided mode having an average propagation constant beta(e). The introduction of a gradual change of curvature reduces the transition loss much more than the <b>pure</b> <b>bend</b> loss. Analysis of the microbending loss shows that the transition component is a maximum at a given correlation length which can be simply expressed in terms of beta(e). The contributions of both transition and bend components to the total microbend loss have been derived for the case of a randomly-curved fibre for several autocorrelation and density functions...|$|R

40|$|Extremely large mode area fibers {{that are}} single-moded over a broad {{wavelength}} range {{can be created}} using holey fiber technology. However, as with any fiber, the largest mode areas that are practically feasible are ultimately determined by bending losses. It is therefore essential to {{gain an understanding of}} the factors that influence bend loss in these fibers in order to form accurate predictions that can facilitate improved bend loss design. Here, we present the first detailed study of transition loss and <b>pure</b> <b>bend</b> loss in a holey fiber, and consider the impact of the fiber structure. A theoretical model is derived that retains the full refractive index profile of a holey fiber. This approach is used to predict the bend loss in large mode area holey fibers and is validated through comparison with experimental data. For the fibers under study here, we demonstrate that <b>pure</b> <b>bend</b> loss is the dominant component of macro-bend loss and that the hole configuration within the cladding can strongly influence this loss.

The free energy term of the K 13 -type is rigorously zero, whereas the term affected by K 24 is different from zero, and is dependent only on the twist angles at the walls, and not on their first derivatives. Such a situation allows us to solve the variational problem and to evaluate K 24, by measuring the shift of the critical field, provided the anchoring strengths at both walls are suitably chosen...|$|R

This bending stress may be superimposed with axially applied stresses, which will cause a shift in the neutral (zero stress) axis.|$|E
50|$|This {{situation}} is magnified {{when the number}} of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the permissible stress σ (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to <b>pure</b> <b>bending,</b> this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these I profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value c which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the volume indicator W. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.|$|E
40|$|A locking-free meshfree {{curved beam}} {{formulation}} {{based on the}} stabilized conforming nodal integration is presented.

Furthermore, to obtain the exact <b>pure</b> <b>bending</b> solution (bending exactness condition), the integration constraints corresponding to the Galerkin weak form are derived. A nodal integration with curvature smoothing stabilization that satisfies the integration constraints is proposed under the Galerkin weak form for shear deformable curved beam. Numerical examples demonstrate that the resulting meshfree formulation can exactly reproduce <b>pure</b> <b>bending</b> mode with arbitrary dicretizations, and the method is stable and free of shear and membrane locking. Computational efficiency and accuracy are achieved simultaneously in the proposed formulation...|$|E
40|$|Nondimensional {{parameters}} and equations governing the buckling behavior of rectangular symmetrically laminated plates are presented {{that can be}} used to represent the buckling resistance, for plates made of all known structural materials, in a very general, insightful, and encompassing manner. In addition, these parameters can be used to assess the degree of plate orthotropy, to assess the importance of anisotropy that couples bending and twisting deformations, and to characterize quasi-isotropic laminates quantitatively. Bounds for these nondimensional parameters are also presented that are based on thermodynamics and practical laminate construction considerations. These bounds provides insight into potential gains in buckling resistance through laminate tailoring and composite-material development. As an illustration of this point, upper bounds on the buckling resistance of long rectangular orthotropic plates with simply supported or clamped edges and subjected to uniform axial compression, uniform shear, or <b>pure</b> inplane <b>bending</b> loads are presented. The results indicate that the maximum gain in buckling resistance for tailored orthotropic laminates, with respect to the corresponding isotropic plate, is in the range of 26 - 36 % for plates with simply supported edges, irrespective of the loading conditions. For the plates with clamped edges, the corresponding gains in buckling resistance are in the range of 9 - 12 % for plates subjected to compression or <b>pure</b> inplane <b>bending</b> loads and potentially up to 30 % for plates subjected to shear loads...|$|R

Molds mounting a razor blade inside were used to make ice blocks for specimens. Distilled water poured to the mold was cooled into ice block with a sharp notch formed at the blade. Specimens were shaped up out of these ice blocks. Two types of specimens were used, parallel and orthogonal, which mean the directions of the notch plane be parallel and orthogonal respectively to the crystal growing direction. Fracture Toughness presented by K 1 f in this paper was calculated by ordinally used equation of K 1 in <b>pure</b> <b>bend.</b> Experimental results are as follows. The order of K 1 f values was 0. 1 MPa m 1 / 2, which is smaller than that of glass, about 0. 4 MPa m 1 / 2.
