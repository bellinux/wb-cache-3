50|$|A {{glowplug}} (alternatively spelled as {{glow plug}} or glow-plug) is a heating device used to aid starting diesel engines. In cold weather, {{high speed diesel}} engines {{can be difficult to}} start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition (which relies on that heat). <b>Pre-chambered</b> engines use small electric heaters (glowplugs) inside the <b>pre-chambers.</b> Direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. The glowplug is a pencil-shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip. This heating element, when electrified, heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum, hence the term glowplug. The visual effect is similar to the heating element in a toaster. The fuel injector spray pattern then impinges directly upon the hot tip of the glow plug during the injection of fuel at top dead center. This ignites the fuel even when the engine is insufficiently hot for normal operation, which reduces the cranking time to start the engine.|$|R
50|$|In cold weather, {{high speed}} diesel engines can be {{difficult}} to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. <b>Pre-chambered</b> engines make use of small electric heaters inside the <b>pre-chambers</b> called glowplugs, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. Many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine block heaters (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power standby Diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning methanol. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).|$|R

More importantly the engine and cab was moved forward so that the engine was mounted above the front axle.

Only turbocharged models of the 603 series were available to the U.S. market. The single camshaft and injection pump are driven by duplex chain from the crankshaft.

It was the first Scania-Vabis truck with left hand drive. The L10 Series had a four-cylinder variant of the module engine Scania-Vabis had introduced in the late 1930s, which was also built in the six- and eight cylinder versions, as petrol or diesel engine.

50|$|An {{indirect}} {{diesel injection}} system (IDI) engine delivers fuel {{into a small}} chamber called a swirl chamber, pre combustion chamber, pre chamber or ante-chamber, which {{is connected to the}} cylinder by a narrow air passage. Generally the goal of the pre chamber is to create increased turbulence for better air / fuel mixing. This system also allows for a smoother, quieter running engine, and because fuel mixing is assisted by turbulence, injector pressures can be lower. Most IDI systems use a single orifice injector. The <b>pre-chamber</b> has the disadvantage of lowering efficiency due to increased heat loss to the engine's cooling system, restricting the combustion burn, thus reducing the efficiency by 5-10%.. IDI engines are also more difficult to start and usually require the use of glow plugs. IDI engines may be cheaper to build but generally require a higher compression ratio than the DI counterpart. IDI also makes it easier to produce smooth, quieter running engines with a simple mechanical injection system since exact injection timing is not as critical. Most modern automotive engines are DI which have the benefits of greater efficiency and easier starting; however, IDI engines can still be found in the many ATV and small diesel applications.|$|E
50|$|In {{the true}} diesel engine, only air is {{initially}} {{introduced into the}} combustion chamber. The air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between 15:1 and 23:1. This high compression causes {{the temperature of the}} air to rise. At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. This may be into a (typically toroidal) void {{in the top of the}} piston or a <b>pre-chamber</b> depending upon the design of the engine. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets. The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber, the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn, getting smaller, until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt. Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke. The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston (not shown on the P-V indicator diagram). When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further; the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (pure vegetable oil). A feature of the Ricardo Comet <b>pre-chamber</b> design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for rotary injection pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable oils thicken when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type coolant heated fuel filter that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing winterising agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, winterising additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to explore and {{understand}} the combustion phenomenon in engines operating on gaseous fuels, and develop technologies {{as an alternative to}} the present diesel engine technologies for heavy duty applications; which are facing severe challenges like stringent emissions norms, high technology costs and unsustainable fuel supply. The studies presented in this thesis focus on the application of <b>pre-chamber</b> ignition system in heavy duty natural gas engines, as a means to improve fuel efficiency and reduce NOx emissions. Initial experiments using <b>pre-chamber</b> spark plugs without auxiliary fueling showed improvements in combustion stability, but with only a marginal extension in the dilution limit with excess air and EGR; and hence no significant fuel efficiency improvements. Following these observations, a literature survey was conducted and it was soon realized that additional fueling to the <b>pre-chamber</b> will help scavenge the <b>pre-chamber</b> at the beginning of every cycle and also lead to the formation of an easily combustible mixture inside the <b>pre-chamber,</b> even while the main chamber is extremely fuel-lean. Further experiments conducted on a single cylinder engine with a custom made <b>pre-chamber</b> assembly with auxiliary fueling showed considerable extension of the dilution limit of main chamber combustion, from an excess air ratio of about 1. 7 (with an un-fueled <b>pre-chamber)</b> to over 2. 6.

The emerging jets from the <b>pre-chamber,</b> the ignition process and early flame propagation are studied. Measurements reveal {{the presence of a}} significant temporal delay between the occurrence of a pressure difference across the <b>pre-chamber</b> holes and the appearance of hot burnt/burning gases at the nozzle exit. Variations in the delay affect the combustion timing and duration. The combustion rate in the <b>pre-chamber</b> does not influence the jet propagation speed, although it still has an effect on the overall combustion duration. PLIF images also show that there is mainly lean unburnt gas, originating from the main-chamber, that exit the <b>pre-chamber</b> in the initial phase of ignition, indicating incomplete mixing of the gases in the <b>pre-chamber</b> prior ignition. These findings are also supported by CFD modeling performed on the Wärtsilä 34 SG combustion system. Similar to the air entrainment in a diesel spray, the jets exiting the <b>pre-chamber</b> causes pronounced entrainment of compressed fresh charges into the burning jets, thus promoting heat transfer and subsequent ignition...|$|E
40|$|Jet {{ignition}} and {{direct fuel injection}} are potential enablers of higher efficiency, cleaner Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Very lean mixtures of gaseous fuels could be burned with pollutants formation below Euro 6 levels (in the ultra-lean mode), efficiencies approaching 50 % full load and small efficiency penalties when operating part load. The lean burn Direct Injection Jet Ignition (DI-JI) ICE uses a fuel injection and mixture ignition system comprising one main chamber direct fuel injector and one small size jet ignition <b>pre-chamber</b> per engine cylinder. The jet ignition <b>pre-chamber</b> {{is connected to the}} main chamber through calibrated orifices and accommodates a second direct fuel injector. In the spark plug version, the jet ignition <b>pre-chamber</b> includes a spark plug that ignites the slightly rich <b>pre-chamber</b> mixture that then bulk ignites the ultra lean, stratified main chamber mixture through multiple jets of hot reacting gases entering the in-cylinder. This paper uses coupled CAE and CFD simulations to provide better details of the operation of the jet ignition <b>pre-chamber.</b> They have been analysed so far with downstream experiments or standalone CFD simulations, enabling {{a better understanding of the}} complex interactions between chemistry and turbulence that governs the <b>pre-chamber</b> flow and combustion. CAE simulations are performed for a production 11 litre, in-line six, 24 valve Diesel Truck engine. It is turbo charged, with inter cooler and cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). It is modified to fit the jet ignition <b>pre-chamber</b> and run propane fuel by replacing the Diesel fuel injector with a direct injector for the LPG fuel plus reducing the compression ratio and changing the piston shape. Operation full load with same air-to-fuel equivalence ratio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{application}} of a <b>pre-chamber</b> type ignition device in a heavy duty engine operated with natural gas. A particular <b>pre-chamber</b> ignition strategy called Avalanche Activated Combustion (originally ’Lavinia Aktyvatsia Gorenia’ in Russian), {{commonly referred to as}} LAG-ignition process, has been studied by performing a parametric study of various pre- and main chamber mixture strength combinations. This strategy was first proposed in 1966 and has been mostly applied in light duty automotive engines. A majority of published data are results from developmental studies but the fundamental mechanism of the LAG-ignition process is unclear to date. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the study presented in this article is the first generalized study to gain deeper understanding of the LAG-ignition process in heavy duty engines operating with natural gas as fuel for both chambers. The experiments are performed on a single cylinder 2. 1 L engine fitted with a custom made <b>pre-chamber</b> capable of spark ignition, fuel injection and pressure measurement. Measured cylinder pressure is used to perform heat release analysis to understand combustion in the <b>pre-chamber</b> and subsequent ignition and combustion of fuel-lean charge in the main chamber. Results show substantial extension in lean limit of operation and corresponding improvement in indicated efficiency by burning fuel rich in the <b>pre-chamber.</b> Data related to engine-out regulated emission species are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Spark-less jet {{ignition}} pre-chambers are enablers of high efficiencies and load control by quantity of fuel injected when coupled with direct injection of main chamber fuel, thus permitting always lean burn bulk stratified combustion. Towards {{the end of}} the compression stroke, a small quantity of hydrogen is injected within the <b>pre-chamber,</b> where it mixes with the air entering from the main chamber. Combustion of the air and fuel mixture then starts within the <b>pre-chamber</b> because of the high temperature of the hot glow plug, and then jets of partially combusted hot gases enter the main chamber igniting there in the bulk, over multiple ignition points, lean stratified mixtures of air and fuel. The paper describes the operation of the spark-less {{jet ignition}} <b>pre-chamber</b> coupling CFD and CAE engine simulations to allow component selection and engine performance evaluation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{details and}} reviews the {{development}} of a <b>Pre-Chamber</b> Stratified Charge Combustion System developed on a Ricardo E 6 /Mk 6 single cylinder, variable compression, spark ignition research engine in the Thermodynamics Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Canterbury. Operating a spark ignition engine on an overall lean charge has tile potential to simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and maintain good thermal efficiency. However, problems associated with ignition of the lean mixture to increased exhaust emissions and reduced thermal efficiency. Stratified charge engines offer the potential to overcome these ignition problems, and restore thermal efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The stratified charge combustion process developed was centred around the separate injection of methane and air into a <b>pre-chamber,</b> located in an auxiliary spark plug hole in the cylinder head, to form an easily ignitable mixture which would establish a flame which would propagate through a lean mixture located in the main combustion chamber. Timing and duration of the injected methane was controlled electronically, whereas the air introduced into the <b>pre-chamber</b> was controlled by a metering valve and a check valve connected to the <b>pre-chamber.</b> The main charge to the engine was formed by using a gas carburettor...|$|E

The movies are taken at 5. 34 kHz and monitor OH* chemilumiscence. The <b>pre-chamber</b> is filled with stoichiometric ethylene-air mixture, it is ignited by a focused 1064 nm laser pulse, and the ensuing flame ignites the outer mixture.

40|$|Lean ethanol-water/air {{mixtures}} {{have potential}} for reducing NOx and CO emissions in internal combustion engines. Igniting such mixtures {{is not possible}} with conventional ignition sources. An improved catalytic ignition source is being developed {{to aid in the}} combustion of aqueous ethanol. The operating principle is homogeneous charge compression ignition in a catalytic <b>pre-chamber,</b> followed by torch ignition of the main chamber. In this system, ignition timing can be adjusted by changing the length of the catalytic core element, the length of the <b>pre-chamber,</b> the diameter of the <b>pre-chamber,</b> and the electrical power supplied to the catalytic core element. A multi-zone energy balance model has been developed to understand ignition timing of ethanol-water mixtures. Model predictions agree with pressure versus crank angle data obtained from a 15 kW Yanmar diesel engine converted for catalytic operation on ethanol-water fuel. Comparing the converted Yanmar to the stock engine shows an increase in torque and power, with improvements in CO and NOx emissions. Hydrocarbon emissions increased significantly, but are largely due to piston geometry not well suited for homogeneous charge combustion. Future engine modifications have the potential to lower emissions to current emission standards, without requiring external emission control devices...|$|E
