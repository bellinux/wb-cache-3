5|$|By 1721, the Baptist {{community}} in Taunton had grown large, and reasonably affluent.

5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Reverend Samuel R. Davidson {{became the}} first pastor at Randolph. He was {{appointed}} by the Tennessee Conference of the United Methodist Church. After his appointment as a <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, a congregation formed around Davidson and built a church at Randolph. The second church at Randolph was built by the congregation in 1883.

50|$|Charles Bertheau (1660-1732) was a French {{pastor in}} London, {{was born at}} Montpelier, and educated partly in France and partly in Holland. He was {{admitted}} to the ministry at the synod held at Vigan in 1681, and shortly afterwards became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pastors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then important church <b>of</b> Charenton, Paris. <b>The</b> revocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Edict <b>of</b> Nantes drove him out of France, and he came to England in 1685. In the following year he was chosen one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pastors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French church in Threadneedle Street, London, a post which he occupied for forty-four years.|$|R

50|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>pastors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish being <b>of</b> Irish descent, {{as well as}} some {{lingering}} parishioners, {{the parish}} quickly reflected the neighboring Italian American community and the new church was planned reflecting this demographic change.|$|R
5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E
5|$|Dora Caroline Stevens {{was born}} on October 26, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens.

During the summer of 1970, while a graduate student at Harvard, Geraty studied at Hebrew University in Jordan on a Fulbright Scholarship.|$|E
50|$|After the {{government}} waged war on Poland and thus started the Second World War, male members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confessing Church, such as Fritz Müller (member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second preliminary church executive), were preferently drafted for the army. Kerrl demanded Werner {{to calm down}} <b>the</b> struggle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> churches, since the Wehrmacht wanted no activities against <b>pastors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confessing Church during the war. So Gestapo and official church functionaries concentrated on <b>pastors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confessing Church, who were not drafted. In January 1940, urged by the Wehrmacht, Hitler repeated that no wide-ranging actions against the Confessing Church are to be taken, so that the Gestapo returned to selective forms of repression.|$|R

5|$|Presbyterian Reverend and {{historian}} Dr. William Henry Foote succeeded Johnston as principal of Romney Academy around 1826. Foote served {{in that capacity}} until his departure from Romney around 1837 or 1839. Foote also concurrently served as the <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romney Presbyterian Church. Foote introduced courses in theology into the school's curriculum, which broadened the make-up {{of the student body}} to include young men preparing for the ministry. As the school's popularity grew and knowledge of its curriculum under Dr. Foote spread, Romney Academy began to attract students from beyond the South Branch Potomac River valley region. Following Foote's departure, Reverend Theodore Gallaudet served as Romney Academy's principal.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|Randolph is a rural unincorporated {{community}} in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States, {{located on the}} banks of the Mississippi River. Randolph was founded in the 1820s and in 1827, the Randolph post office was established. In the 1830s, the town became an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. In 1834, the first <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Methodist congregation was appointed. The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable mail route and other factors. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the Civil War in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} founded by Aldo Benzi, who {{converted}} to Christianity after being healed from a pleurisy. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became <b>pastor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person farming {{community}} of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C.
