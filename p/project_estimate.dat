The purpose of the survey was to identify the state of practice in SHAs for unit cost development. The survey helped to identify SHAs doing considerable work in unit cost development and interviews were conducted with these agencies to know their unit cost development process in detail. The results from survey and the interviews were then used in defining the framework.

50|$|In 2014 the institute, in {{collaboration}} with Sage Bionetworks, announced a new project aiming to genotype up to 1 million people {{with the goal of}} identifying the rare biological mechanisms that keep people healthy when they have genetic variants that should cause disease. The Resilience Project will scan the genomes of healthy people age 30 and older who contribute their DNA to the effort with an initial focus on 127 diseases. Scientists anticipate that finding protective mechanisms for Mendelian diseases will be more straightforward than finding ones for complex or multifactorial diseases.

50|$|Initial {{start-up}} costs were projected at $2.9 million, with annual operating costs at $4.8 million. Backers of the <b>project</b> <b>estimate</b> 884,000 rides per year, 1,300 daily, with a fare revenue of $2.4 million. The remainder would be subsidized {{by state and}} local governments. The project has received funding commitments from the Michigan Department of Transportation, the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority, and the Northfield Township Downtown Development Authority. Attempts to obtain a $1 million grant from the Federal government fell through. Both the University of Michigan and the Ann Arbor offices of the Environmental Protection Agency would pay the fares of any employees who took the train in lieu of commuting. Backers conducted a $150,000 feasibility study of the line, with money pledged by the University of Michigan, the Great Lakes Central Railroad, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), Washtenaw and Livingston Counties. The study reported back that the project is viable, but placed {{start-up costs}} at $32.4 million, much higher than initial estimates. Most of the outlay would be for infrastructure improvements. After three years of service the line would become eligible for federal transportation funding.|$|E

5000|$|Since a cost {{estimate}} is the approximation {{of the cost}} of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely the estimate is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a <b>project</b> <b>estimate</b> was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the estimate accuracy. Predictions of the estimate accuracy may accompany the estimate. Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality. Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the project. For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.|$|E
5000|$|At the February 1966 {{meeting of}} the Clinton Lions Club, a {{proposal}} was made to build an attractive planter at Elm and Water Streets. This spot was then occupied by a road barrier; when a new Wabash River bridge was built a short distance to the south, the barrier had been erected to prevent drivers from using the old roadway. A first <b>project</b> <b>estimate</b> was set at approximately $300 and a committee named to investigate the possibilities. At about the same time, an area television station asked the Clinton Chamber of Commerce to submit a representative photograph {{that could be used}} on broadcasts to community at a glance. A photographer from Daily Clintonian was asked to provide the image, and because he was {{also a member of the}} Lions Club project committee, he prompted the publication of several newspaper articles citing Clinton's lack of identity and urging cooperation with the Lions' proposed project. Readers responded with a variety of suggestions, which included connections with the city's history of coal mining and its current wealth of Italian restaurants. Members of the Lions' committee considered the various proposals, chose an Italian theme, and decided to abandon the planter idea; to them, the Italian theme seemed natural because a neighborhood in the city's north had been heavily Italian earlier in the city's history. As the Lions began to prepare for the festival, they invited representatives of other local organizations to participate, and approximately thirty groups were represented at the next planning meeting. Amid sketches of suggested fountains, planters, speaker-band platforms, and general Old World scenic settings, the delegates chose the name [...] "Project LIFT"; the latter word was meant to be an acronym for [...] "Little Italy Festival Town" [...] as well as indicating the delegates' hope that the festival would give their community a lift. Soon after this meeting, the group incorporated as [...] "LIFT, Inc." [...] The festival has endured into the 2010s; annual attendance typically varies between sixty thousand and eighty thousand.|$|E
