40|$|Abstract: It {{is obvious}} {{from the study of}} {{literature}} that university-industry (U-I) relationships and their subsequent knowledge transfers are topics of high political, economical, managerial and academic interest. Indeed, technological knowledge is seen as a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> long-term economic growth and its transfer to the firm is critical since it acts as a significant innovation factor. In order to access this knowledge, a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies is available to the firm: knowledge creation through internal RandD departments, knowledge sharing with suppliers or market relationships, and also transfer from knowledge institutions such as public and private research centres. In this paper, we recognISe that University is a central <b>source</b> <b>of</b> knowledge but we question the general belief that knowledge is per se flowing between private and academic sphere through the conduct of University-Industry relationships. As a result, this paper presents our literature analysis concerning this research topic and explores one particular mean of inter-organisational knowledge transfer, namely the University-Industry collaborative research project. We present findings from an exploratory study, which aims at examining knowledge flows and collaborative behaviours at stake in such research projects.

40|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of the international business field, {{the focus of attention}} moved from the country level to the firm level, and interest in location issues declined. More recently, firm-based research has itself become increasingly concerned with the study of firm–location interactions. When examining two-way knowledge flows or spillovers between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and other actors in specific locations, the diversity or heterogeneity of firms matters, as does the diversity of locational environments. The localization <b>of</b> knowledge <b>sources</b> depends on MNE group-level strategies for growth and organizational decentralization, on subsidiary-level evolution towards local competence-creating efforts, and on the development of suitable business networks within locations. MNEs now have a greater potential to benefit from a synergistic locational <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> complementary <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. The locational composition of the international network for knowledge <b>sourcing</b> <b>of</b> a given MNE depends upon the extent of institutional compatibility between the locations in which the MNE is active.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the wider literature on the provision of travel information, and the associated response in travel patterns, by considering the acquisition <b>of</b> information <b>sources</b> as a choice, investigating {{its role in the}} choice of travel, and jointly modelling both behaviours. A novel conceptual framework is developed that considers both information and travel in a joint portfolio choice. An implementation framework is consequently formulated based on important assumptions, and two application contexts are defined. First, the strategic decision of acquiring information is considered {{for the first time as}} a consumption <b>of</b> a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> information <b>sources.</b> Second, in disrupted travel conditions, the tactical decision to access information sources is conditioned in its choice set by alternatives that were strategically chosen. A revealed-preference survey instrument is innovatively developed to collect a rich and unique dataset about how travellers in the London public transport network acquire and use travel information and how they react to disrupted conditions on their usual commute. In the strategic context, results from the empirical study provide insights into individual’s satiation with specific information sources based on the frequency of use, and the effect of cognitive costs. In the tactical context, the results highlight commuters’ preferences for a combination <b>of</b> <b>sources,</b> in respect to the importance of delay amplitude and previous travel experience, the accuracy, and monetary and cognitive costs <b>of</b> <b>sources,</b> as well as the attitudinal motivation for seeking information. Travel responses are not demographic dependent, but are linked to corroboration of the information and the use of specific combinations <b>of</b> <b>sources.</b> Different applications <b>of</b> the models illustrate the impacts of those factors on travel behaviour and information acquisition. They emphasize useful contributions for service providers when envisaging information use, and for public transport operators and planners when predicting traveller response. Open Acces...|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{analysis}} of production system of rural farm {{households in the}} study area shows that substantial inefficiency exists in their allocation of production resources. Labour, including household and hired labour, is over-utilised, while modern inputs like fertilizer, tractor services, etc. are underutilised. The level of the rural farm households’ production efficiency is enhanced by adoption <b>of</b> a diversified <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> income <b>sources</b> vis-à-vis diversification <b>of</b> labour use to include farm and off-farm activities, raising proportion of tree crops on their farms and investment in income yielding assets. It is instructive to note that relative influence of within farm sector diversification (e.g. raising the shares of tree crops and livestock in the farm holdings) is much stronger than the influence of diversification into off-farm labour supply. A plausible explanation for this is the fact that rates of returns to household labour use in most of the available rural non-farm activities is much lower than what obtains from labour supply/investment in tree cropping (mostly cash crops) and livestock production (Shittu, [2011]). Hence, observed diversification into rural non-farm economic activities in the area are largely out of necessity (distress-push) rather than as a response to remunerative wage employment and high return off-farm business opportunities (demand-pull).|$|R
40|$|Water {{supply in}} Australia mainly relies on {{precipitation}} and, therefore, is {{highly dependent on}} climate variability and change. Coupled with reduced rainfall reliability, population and economic growth and increasing competition for water resources augment the concern over the existing water resources and put a strain on future water security. In fact, the upward trend of water demand has already been escalating the pressure on water resources. Clearly, the anticipation of decline in water supply requires the identification of more reliable, rainfall-independent supply alternatives. With this in mind, this paper discusses the role and value of desalination in water grids. For this purpose, we present a modelling framework using System Dynamics approach to incorporate a range of factors into a simulation of future water demand and supply in Queensland, Australia; and examine desalination schemes as long-term water security option in the <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> supply <b>sources.</b> In particular, the model is used to explore the sensitivity of long term planning of water resources with respect to two specific assumptions, the discount rate {{and the degree of}} water security. The proposed approach would help decision makers to develop sustainable water supply and efficient infrastructure strategies, and thus respond to water scarcity in a timely manner.

Therefore, {{there is reason to}} establish a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> alternative alpha <b>sources,</b> and GTAA represents just that, for myriad reasons: the performance differentials between asset classes are frequently substantial, the derivative instruments used in GTAA are, for the most part, highly liquid and transaction costs are low. The volume of assets managed with a focus on relative performance of asset classes is low compared to that focused on finding opportunities within asset classes, and a number of managers with very impressive teams, processes and track records can be identified. Furthermore, the analysis and decision making involved in GTAA is focused on cross-market comparisons which proves to differ from the comparison of securities within given markets. Accordingly, GTAA should be a good diversifier, particularly within an alpha portfolio.|$|R
40|$|Australia is the driest {{inhabited}} continent {{on earth}} and, more importantly, experiences the most variable rainfall {{of all the}} continents on our planet. The vast majority of Australians live in large cities on the coast. Because wastewater treatments plants were all located near the coast, {{it was thought that}} large scale recycling would be problematic given the cost of infrastructure and pumping required to establish recycled water schemes. This all changed when Australia experienced a decade of record low rainfall and water utilities were given aggressive targets to increase the volume of water recycled. This resulted in recycled water being accepted as a legitimate <b>source</b> <b>of</b> water for non-drinking purposes in a diversified <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> water <b>sources</b> to mitigate climate risk. To ensure community support for recycled water, Australia lead the world in developing national guidelines for the various uses of recycled water to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.
