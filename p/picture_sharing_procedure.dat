40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{two systems}} for picture taking with mobile phone cameras. The first system, MMM, is {{a platform for}} generating semantically rich metadata for mobile pictures {{at the time of}} image capture. The second system, MobShare, is a mobile <b>picture</b> <b>sharing</b> and discussing system that takes advantage of the temporal and social information in the camera phone. The paper also discusses combining the two approaches in designing a mobile <b>picture</b> <b>sharing</b> system that both generates and takes advantage of semantically rich metadata. ...|$|R

40|$|Defects {{involving}} specialised {{areas with}} characteristic anatomical features, {{such as the}} nipple, upper eyelid, and lip, benefit greatly {{from the use of}} <b>sharing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The vulva, a complex 3 -dimensional structure, can also be reconstructed through a <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> drawing upon the contralateral vulva. In this report, we present the interesting case of a patient with chronic, massive, localised lymphedema of her left labia majora that was resected in 2011. Five years later, she presented with squamous cell carcinoma over the left vulva region, which is rarely associated with chronic lymphedema. To the best of our knowledge, our management of the radical vulvectomy defect with a labia majora <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> is novel and has not been previously described. The labia major flap presented in this report is a shared flap; that is, a transposition flap based on the dorsal clitoral artery, which has consistent vascular anatomy, making this flap durable and reliable. This procedure epitomises the principle of replacing like with like, does not interfere with leg movement or patient positioning, has minimal donor site morbidity, and preserves other locoregional flap options for future reconstruction. One limitation is the need for a lax contralateral vulva. This labia majora <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> is a viable option in carefully selected patients...|$|R
