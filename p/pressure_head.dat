5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} the falling <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} to invent the armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
50|$|Francis turbine {{converts}} {{energy at}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> {{which are not}} easily available and hence a turbine was required to convert the energy at low <b>pressure</b> <b>heads,</b> given that the quantity of water was large enough. It was easy to convert high <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> to power easily but difficult {{to do so for}} low <b>pressure</b> <b>heads.</b> Therefore, an evolution took place that converted the Francis turbine to Kaplan turbine, which generated power at even low <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the Kaplan {{turbine works}} on low <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> (H) and high flow rates (Q). This {{implies that the}} Specific speed (Ns) on which Kaplan turbine {{functions}} is high as Specific speed (Nsp) is directly proportional to Flow (Q) and inversely proportional to Head (H). On the other hand, Francis turbine works on low Specific speeds i.e., high <b>pressure</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

25|$|If we were {{to divide}} the dynamic {{pressure}} by the product of fluid density and acceleration due to gravity, g, the result is called velocity head, which is used in head equations like the one used for <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> and hydraulic head. In a venturi flow meter, the differential <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> {{can be used to}} calculate the differential velocity head, which are equivalent in the adjacent picture. An alternative to velocity head is dynamic head.|$|E
25|$|Other design {{requirements}} include {{taking into account}} <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> operation, the flow rate, whether the valve operates above or below water, and the regulation of precision and cost.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Head</b> <b>pressure</b> - The <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> of a {{sump pump}} {{describes}} the maximum height that the pump will move water. For instance, a sump pump with a 15 feet (4.6 m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6 m) before it completely loses flow. Technically, <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is defined as}} an expression of a pressure in terms of the height of fluid; P = yρg, where y is the fluid column height, ρ is fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity. Other considerations may be added to overall <b>head</b> <b>pressure,</b> including loss from elbows/bends and friction loss from long horizontal runs.|$|R
50|$|Reseal {{pressure}} — {{the pressure}} at {{which there is}} no indication of flow. Reseal pressure is also known as sealing <b>pressure</b> or seating <b>head</b> (<b>pressure).</b>|$|R
25|$|Differences in {{hydraulic}} head (h) cause water {{to move from}} one place to another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of low h. Hydraulic head is composed of <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> (ψ) and elevation head (z). The head gradient is the change in {{hydraulic head}} per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
500|$|The outflow clepsydra was a {{timekeeping}} device used in China as {{long ago}} as the Shang Dynasty (c.1600–c.1050BC), and certainly by the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256BC). The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China {{since the beginning of the}} Han Dynasty in 202BC and had replaced the outflow type. The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled. Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right. Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours. Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year. Zhang mentioned a [...] "jade dragon's neck", which in later times meant a siphon. He wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows: ...|$|E

We used tensiometers of this type in an experiment to determine the hydraulic properties of evaporating soil samples in the laboratory. Relative errors in the hydraulic conductivity function in the wet part were high due to the relatively low accuracy of the pressure transducers, resulting in a large uncertainty in the hydraulic gradient and therefore in the calculated hydraulic conductivity. In the dry part, the error related to this accuracy was on the same order of magnitude as the error related to balance accuracy. Therefore, the method can be assumed adequate for measuring soil hydraulic properties except under very wet conditions. In our experiments, relative error and bias increased significantly at <b>pressure</b> <b>heads</b> less negative than - 1 m. CAPES-WUR[019 / 06]WUR/the Netherlands[5100184 - 01...|$|R

[...] Rather, it is typically used for low-cost applications such as private houses. [...] The main issue with accuracy is that if the bulb and the stem are at different levels, there is a change in reading due to the change in <b>pressure</b> <b>head.</b> [...] A further problem is that changes in the ambient temperature of the indoor part of the device can cause a change in reading as well as the temperature of the outdoor part of the device. [...] This effect can be minimised by making the bulb large and the capillary a small diameter. [...] This ensures that changes in the outside temperature produce large changes in the column of liquid in the stem and will tend to swamp the smaller changes caused by the changes in the indoor temperature.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Needham {{speculated that}} the {{introduction}} of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from Mesopotamia, occurred {{as far back as the}} 2nd millennium, during the Shang Dynasty, and at the latest by the 1st millennium. By the beginning of the Han Dynasty, in 202, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, Zhang Heng added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor Shen Kuo. Around 610, this design was trumped by two Sui Dynasty inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the steelyard balance. Joseph Needham states that: ...|$|E
500|$|The armillary sphere, a {{three-dimensional}} {{representation of the}} movements in the celestial sphere, was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC. Using a water clock, waterwheel {{and a series of}} gears, the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere. To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the <b>pressure</b> <b>head</b> of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel. Zhang also invented a device he termed an [...] "earthquake weathervane" [...] (houfeng didong yi 候風地動儀), which the British scientist and historian Joseph Needham described as [...] "the ancestor of all seismographs". This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away. It employed an inverted pendulum that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth. [...] The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han (Hou Han shu 後漢書) describes how, on one occasion, one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance. [...] Several days later, a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery (in modern Gansu Province), the direction the device had indicated, which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang's device.|$|E

Its modeling requires many parameters that are generally difficult to measure. The determination of the parameters in these nonequilibrium models from experimental measurements is a challenging task and is usually carried out using parameter optimization methods. In this study, prior to the identification process, an estimability analysis was carried out {{in order to determine the}} set of the most estimable parameters in the dual-porosity model from the available experimental data collected from the field lysimeter (<b>pressure</b> <b>heads,</b> water contents, cumulative percolation, and evaporation).

The five estimable parameters were then identified using the Levenberg-Marquardt method implemented within one-dimensional finite-element model software.
