The <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> also affirmed {{the superiority of the}} French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests, such as the recent abolition of the slave trade.|$|E

50|$|The French {{adopted a}} policy of {{assimilation}} rather than association. The <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> allowed the colonialists to rule through native rulers while upholding their traditional cultures and hierarchy, similar to British rule in Malaya. However, the French ruled out that option and chose to adopt the policy of assimilation. This {{was due to the}} French experience in 1789 French Revolution and Napoleonic era. The Declaration of Rights of Man was based on the principle of egalité, liberté and fraternité for all subjects and citizens of France, and the colonies could not be an exception. French language was to be the language of administration. The whole Indochina would be “Frenchized”. Napoleonic Code was introduced in 1879 into the five provinces, sweeping away the Confucianism that has existed for centuries in Indochina.|$|E

He said [...] "it would be criminal to leave our native subjects in ignorance".On the other hand, education might [...] "create rebels, discontented, déclassé natives ... plant seeds of rancor in the people who prepare to revolt."He recommended a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> rather than assimilation.|$|E

50|$|The history <b>of</b> French colonial <b>policy</b> in Mauritania {{is closely}} tied {{to that of the}} other French {{possessions}} in West Africa, particularly to that of Senegal, on which Mauritania was economically, politically, and administratively dependent until independence. The French <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> assimilation and direct rule, however, was never applied with any vigor in Mauritania, where a system that corresponded more to Britain's colonial <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> and indirect rule developed. Colonial administrators relied extensively on Islamic religious leaders and the traditional warrior groups to maintain their rule and carry out their policies. Moreover, little attempt was made to develop the country's economy.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{on the idea of}} colonial space in Morocco and how the French used space to colonize the people. The focus {{is on the}} early twentieth century but there are back ground pieces that begin as early as the 1500 s. The first section of the paper {{describes}} the idea of space and how physical or public space is the focus of the paper. From there, the thesis describes the colonial policies of the French and how the French did not forcefully assimilate Morocco as it did in Algeria but used a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> which directly impacted how the French used physical space in Morocco. Next the thesis delves into several divisions of space in Morocco including the division between the urban and rural areas, the dual city within urban space, and Jewish space. The final section deconstructs the idea of space showing that even though the French tried to create clean divisions that this was not the reality of the situation. Areas such as the slums, women’s space, and entertainment were perpetually crossing boundaries. This work is important because it shows the larger picture of the divisions in Morocco once the French arrived and how it affected the Moroccan population and continues to affect the population today...|$|E
