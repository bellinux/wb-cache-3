This paper explores data from the General Social Survey (GSS), which in 2006 {{questioned}} a representative sample of more than 1800 U. S. adults about their knowledge and opinions concerning polar regions. The <b>polar</b> <b>survey</b> items were modeled on long-running GSS assessments of general science knowledge and opinions, recently summarized in the U. S. National Science Board 2 ̆ 7 s report Science and Engineering Indicators 2008. Polar knowledge proves to be limited but certainly not absent among survey respondents. Polar knowledge, general science knowledge, and education - together with individual background characteristics (age, sex, income) - predict policy-relevant opinions. Political orientation filters the impacts of education, and also shows consistent, significant effects across all the polar opinion questions. These 2006 GSS polar results will provide a baseline for comparison when the questions are repeated on a 2010 survey, after the International Polar Year concludes...|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} {{is divided into}} three parts. Part I is an overview of early expeditions to the High Arctic, and their political consequences at the time. The focus then shifts to the Geological Survey of Canada s mapping program in the North (Operation Franklin), and to the Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP), a unique organization that resides within the Government of Canada s Department of Natural Resources, and supports mapping projects and science investigations. PCSP is highlighted throughout the presentation so a description of mandate, budgets, and support infrastructure is warranted. In Part II, the presenter describes the planning required in advance of scientific deployments carried out in the Canadian High Arctic from the perspective of government and university investigators. Field operations and challenges encountered while leading arctic field teams in fly camps are also described {{in this part of the}} presentation, with particular emphasis on the 2008 field season. Part III is a summary of preliminary results obtained from a <b>Polar</b> <b>Survey</b> questionnaire sent out to members of the Arctic research community in anticipation of the workshop.

40|$|The angular {{scales on}} which local {{interstellar}} dust is distributed {{are so far}} rather unknown as are the geometrical shapes of the dust features. From the about 5000 color excesses resulting from a north <b>polar</b> <b>survey</b> with 4 to 5 stars per square degree the two-point autocorrelation function is derived for separations ranging from 10 min to 3 deg. For intercloud lines of sight, - 0. 020 is less than E(b - y) is less than - 0. 010 mag, the average cross products (E sub 1 x E sub 2) (sub theta) show no variation with separation theta(1, 2) whereas products of cloud column densities, 0. 030 is less than E(b - y) is less than 0. 040 mag, seem to prefer discrete separations either less than 20 min, around 75 min, or finally at about 150 min. Surprisingly the two point autocorrelation function omega(sub E) = E(sub 1) x E(sub 2) /E squared - 1 equals 0 except for any separation except theta = 0. Omega(sub E) (theta) 's absence of variation is unexpected because omega(sub H) (theta) is known to vary exponentially above b = 40 deg for separations less than 3 deg. Atomic hydrogen and dust may thus not be entirely mixed or the moments (E sub 1 x E sub 2) (sub theta) may not characterize the dust distribution...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} published Bedmap 2 datasets mark {{the culmination of}} several decades of subice and subocean Antarctic topographic surveying by many nations, but maps of the topographic data distribution show that in the global context, the Antarctic bed remains very poorly sampled. Most of the remaining large unmapped areas on Earth lie under Antarctic ice and <b>polar</b> <b>surveying</b> continues to be difficult and expensive, thus {{it is important to}} identify where future efforts should be concentrated. A survey of 75 experts in various aspects of polar science shows that a lack of adequate topographic data is an important constraint in several themes, but the data gaps and the data needs do not tend to coincide. There is strong demand for higher resolution surveying in previously visited areas, particularly in the most dynamic and most rapidly changing regions as identified by glaciologists, oceanographers, hydrologists, biologists and geomorphologists, while geologists and ice core scientists focus on the most important areas for understanding Antarctica over deeper time. The data requirements identified here could be addressed for most areas given sufficient time and funding, but the technology needed to survey the interiors of the large ice shelf cavities has only just been developed. ...|$|R

40|$|The Filchner Outflow System (FOS) in the {{southern}} Weddell Sea {{is one of the}} most important areas for deep water formation. Here the outflow of Ice Shelf Water (ISW) of the Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf interacts with Warm Deep Water (WDW) of the Weddell Gyre circulation, resulting in Weddell Sea Deep and Bottom Water production (WSDW, WSBW). The interaction around the sill of the Filchner Trough is thought to result in a physical oceanography "hotspot" that may also aggregate primary and secondary producers, leading to increased abundance of top predators. However, data on top predator abundance for the FOS are scarce. Two aerial surveys over ice-covered sea were carried out to estimate density gradients and the regional abundance of pack ice seals in the FOS. A digital imaging survey with fixed wing research aircraft Polar 6 in November 2013 preceded a helicopter survey from aboard RV Polarstern during January 2014. The <b>Polar</b> 6 <b>survey</b> comprised 11 transects summing to a survey effort of 1, 148. 44 km. 265 seals were counted on transect lines with a higher encounter rate on transects located further to the west. The helicopter survey allowed seal species to be identified. Twenty-five transects (1, 367. 61 km) were flown in the FOS region and another six transects (425. 54 km) further south within the Filchner Trough. Only two seal species, the crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga) (n = 754) and the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) (n = 217), were observed. Distance sampling analysis suggested that the density of seals differed strongly between the two survey regions, with very few seals encountered on transects located in the more southerly Filchner Trough region. A longitudinal density gradient increasing from east to west within the FOS region during January 2014 supported the results obtained from the <b>Polar</b> 6 <b>survey,</b> but failed to support the idea of a top predator hotspot at the sill of the Filchner Trough at least for seals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the making and}} communicating {{of knowledge about the}} Arctic from a transnational perspective between 1818 and the First International Polar Year in 1882 - 83. By examining both well-known and hitherto neglected narratives from Danish, British, and British-Canadian Arctic explorations, I show that changes in ideas about {{what it meant to be}} an authoritative observer of Arctic phenomena were linked to tensions in imperial ambitions, national identity, and international collaboration. By framing <b>polar</b> <b>surveying</b> in the broadest sense as the ordering and quantifying of nature through travel, I analyse how abstract notions of the Arctic became tangible in the nineteenth century. I am concerned with the practices of writing the Arctic experience, especially the relationship between science, and the strategies for constructing a trustworthy narrative voice. That is, I investigate the ways in which the identities of the explorers and the organizing bodies shaped the expeditions, and by extension the representation of the ventures, the explorers, and the science they produced. In doing so, I argue that the Arctic played a key role in shaping Western science, and understandings of national and imperial identities, and that travel narratives were a significant resource for communicating this knowledge. This thesis is divided into four chapters that each considers three case studies, roughly organized according to chronology. Drawing on major themes within British and Danish imperial history, Canadian studies, studies in travel writing, history of science, transnational and global history, and environmental studies, I show how perceptions of the Arctic as a field-site for the production of scientific knowledge varied according to time and place throughout the nineteenth century, and how this influenced science in the Arctic. In particular, I show the shift from early scientific practices during Arctic explorations, to a more unified Arctic science as part of the International Polar Year. What emerges is a new and interdisciplinary look at how science was produced in the Arctic, how this information was perceived by both a specialist and general reading audiences, and how this process differed depending on national and cultural contexts at different points in the nineteenth century...|$|R

Measurements derive from an automated Fourier-transform spectrograph which operated continuously there over three consecutive winters. During {{that time the}} median through the most transparent portion of the Q window was 460 Jy/square-arcsec, falling below 32 Jy/square-arcsec in N band, and to sub-Jansky levels by M and shortwards; reaching only 36 mJy/square-arcsec within L. Nearly six decades of twice-daily balloonsonde launches from Eureka, together with contemporaneous meteorological data plus a simple model allows characterization of background stability and extrapolation into K band. This suggests the study location has dark skies across the whole thermal infrared spectrum, typically sub- 200 micro-Jy/square-arcsec at 2. 4 microns.

During the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES), data were collected over the Mackenzie Delta in the southern Beaufort Sea where a buoyant river plume exists. Results show that the electromagnetic-laser system can describe the horizontal distribution of the freshwater plume depths that shallow stepwise offshore while the flow of the buoyant plume is restricted by a series of ridge-rubble fields running parallel to the coast. Relative to the 2 m mean ice thickness, the plume layer depth varied from zero under mobile offshore pack ice to 3 m inshore of the third set of ridge-rubble fields.

Ultracold molecules offer capabilities that are otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve in other effective spin systems, such as long-ranged spin-spin interactions with controllable degrees of spatial and spin anisotropy and favorable energy scales. Realizing quantum magnetism with ultracold molecules provides access to rich many-body behaviors, including many exotic phases of matter and interesting excitations and dynamics.

Various exogenic and endogenic sources of this water have been proposed. This paper focuses on endogenic water sources by fumaroles and hot springs in shadowed <b>polar</b> craters.

Release of water and other constituents by defluidization over geological time was intensified in the Hadean Eon (c. a. 4600 to 4000 My). Intensification factors include higher heat flow by now-extinct radionuclides, tidal flexing and higher core temperatures. Lesser gravity would promote deeper bubble nucleation in lunar magmas, slower rise rates of gases and enhanced subsidence of lunar caldera floors. Hadean volcanism would likely have been more intense and regional in nature as opposed to suture-controlled location of calderas in Phanerozoic Benioff-style subduction environments.

The method was tested on the crane rails of Krško Hydroelectric Power Plant and Brestanica Thermal Power Plant, where, after scanning the point cloud, the upper and the lateral internal surface of railheads was derived. Each crane rail was divided into segments, through which the planes were fitted and the characteristic rail lines were determined. Based on the profiles, positional and height rail offsets were determined between the characteristic points on the same profile, as well as the actual span and the height difference between the crane rails. Furthermore, it was verified whether the calculated geometry parameters complied with the rules set by the standard in question.

Horizontal maps across the survey area show that close to Drake Passage, properties are aligned in a southwest to northeast direction. At approximately 35 degreesW, properties become orientated in a north-south direction. A map of geopotential anomaly shows the flow field across the survey area and allows identification of oceanic fronts. In months previous to the survey, the giant icebergs A 22 B and B 10 A crossed the Scotia Sea and closely followed the geopotential field from the CCAMLR 2000 dataset. The SACCF is not the only important front for transporting biological matter from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia; an interaction between the SBACC and the SACCF is also likely to be important...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{compared}} the VLBI and GPS terrestrial reference frames, realized using 5 years of time-series observations of station positions and <b>polar</b> motion, with <b>surveyed</b> co-location tie vectors for 25 sites. The {{goal was to}} assess the overall quality of the ties and to determine whether a subset of co-location sites might be found with VLBI–GPS ties that are self-consistent within a few millimeters. Our procedure was designed to guard against internal distortion of the two space-geodetic networks and takes advantage of the reduction in tie information needed with the time-series combination method by using the very strong contribution due to co-location of the daily pole of rotation. The general quality of the available ties is somewhat discouraging in that most have residuals, compared to the space-geodetic frames, at the level of 1 – 2 cm. However, by a careful selection process, we have identified a subset of nine local VLBI–GPS ties that are consistent {{with each other and with}} space geodesy to better than 4 mm (RMS) in each component. While certainly promising, it is not possible to confidently assess the reliability of this particular subset without new information to verify the absolute accuracy of at least a few of the highest-quality ties. Particular care must be taken to demonstrate that possible systematic errors within the VLBI and GPS systems have been properly accounted for. A minimum of two (preferably three or four) ties must be measured with accuracies of 1 mm or better in each component, including any potential systematic effects. If this can be done, then the VLBI and GPS frames can be globally aligned to less than 1 mm in each Helmer...|$|R
40|$|This map (Fig. 1, in backpocket) {{represents}} a significant ad-vance in bathymetric detail over our previous contouring {{efforts of the}} Georgia Basin area (LaBrecque et al., 1981; LaBrecque, 1986). Recently obtained bathymetric soundings from several new sources, most notably the <b>Polar</b> Duke site <b>survey</b> and the updated plotting sheets of the British and Argentine hydro-graphic offices, have substantially expanded the bathymetric data base for this still relatively underexplored region of the world's oceans (see Fig. 2). In addition, gravity anomalies de-rived from SEAS AT altimetry data (Haxby et al., 1983; Haxby and LaBrecque, 1986) have provided insight into the morphol-ogy of certain bathymetric features that are not as yet fully defined by bathymetric soundings alone (Fig. 3). It should be noted, however, {{that all of the}} features shown on the map are at least partly supported by existing bathymetric data; no features are derived from SEASAT data only. One of the difficulties in compiling a bathymetric map of this area is the advanced age of {{a large part of the}} data base. A great many of the ship tracks in the western South Atlantic are over 20 yr old and thus, predate the routine use of satellite navi-gation. As a result, navigation data from these cruises are fre-quently unreliable. In some cases, the navigation data can be corrected by judiciously correlating track crossings with higher quality navigation from more recent cruises; in places, however, we have discarded whole strings of soundings as too ambiguous for confident manipulation. During the period 1975 - 1978, the ARA Islas Orcadas (Ar-gentine Naval Hydrographic Service) carried out extensive geo-physical surveying in the South Atlantic under a joint progra...|$|R
40|$|The South Pacific Gyre is the world’s largest {{expanse of}} {{oligotrophic}} ocean and supports communities of endemic gadfly petrels Pterodroma spp, yet {{little is known}} about their foraging ecology in this nutrient-poor environment. We tracked Murphy’s petrels Pterodroma ultima with geolocators from Henderson Island, Pitcairn Islands, for two consecutive years (2011 - 2013). During pre-laying exodus, petrels travelled south and southwest of the colony, with males travelling further than females to more productive waters. During incubation, birds foraged at the southern and eastern edges of the Gyre, with some travelling over 4, 800 km from the colony, the greatest recorded foraging range of any breeding seabird. During non-breeding, the petrels migrated to the Subarctic Gyre in the North Pacific to forage in cool, mesotrophic waters. Habitat models revealed that birds do not have clear preferences for oceanographic (such as fronts or eddies) or topographic features (seamounts), generally favouring deep and unproductive waters. Analyses of activity patterns indicated Murphy’s petrels are amongst the most active of all seabirds, particularly during incubation when they spent c. 95 % of their time at sea in flight. The birds did not appear to forage during darkness, but flight activity peaked at dawn, particularly during non-breeding, suggesting they feed on mesopelagic prey that are diel vertical migrants. At-sea protection for such a wide-ranging species would require management at huge spatial scales, and hence in the short term, the principal focus for conservation should be on eliminating the immediate threat from invasive mammals at breeding sites.
