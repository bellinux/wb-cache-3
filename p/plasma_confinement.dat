25|$|Most {{experiments}} on polywells involve low-beta plasma regimes (where β < 1), where the plasma pressure is weak {{compared to the}} magnetic pressure. Several models describe magnetic trapping in polywells. Tests indicated that <b>plasma</b> <b>confinement</b> is enhanced in a magnetic cusp configuration when β (plasma pressure/magnetic field pressure) is of order unity. This enhancement is required for a fusion power reactor based on cusp confinement to be feasible.|$|E
25|$|A {{stellarator}} is {{a device}} used to confine a hot plasma with magnetic fields {{in order to}} sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction. It is the earliest controlled fusion device. In 1951, American astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer recommended that the United States Atomic Energy Commission commence containing and harnessing nuclear fusion of hydrogen at temperatures exceeding those at the Sun's surface. To do this, Spitzer invented a <b>plasma</b> <b>confinement</b> configuration device called the stellarator.|$|E

40|$|Confinement of ripple-trapped {{energetic}} ions is {{studied in}} a low-aspect-ratio helical system using a neutral beam with variable injection angle. The heating efficiency {{was found to}} be very low for the perpendicular injection compared with the tangential one, in the magnetic field configuration which is optimized for the global confinement for the tangential NBI <b>plasmas.</b> <b>Confinement</b> of beam ions was improved by shifting the magnetic axis inward, which was confirmed by the measurement of their energy spectrum. The results are consistent with the calculation of Monte Carlo beam-ion-thermalization code. The poloidal rotation near plasma edge is measured for different injection angles which shows larger value for the perpendicular injection. The fast wave ICRF heating is applied to a low-aspect-ratio helical system. Substantial energy increase is obtained for the NBI taget plasma. High energy ion tail is observed in the limited range of pitch angles. ...|$|R
25|$|The peak {{reaction}} rate of p–11B {{is only one}} third that for D-T, requiring better <b>plasma</b> <b>confinement.</b> Confinement is usually characterized by the time τ the energy must be retained so that the fusion power released exceeds the power required to heat the plasma. Various requirements can be derived, most commonly {{the product of the}} density, nτ, and the product with the pressure nTτ, both of which are called the Lawson criterion. The nτ required for p–11B is 45 times higher than that for D-T. The nTτ required is 500 times higher.B would be a factor of three smaller, as calculated here. (See also neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density.) Since the confinement properties of conventional fusion approaches, such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most aneutronic proposals use radically different confinement concepts.|$|E
