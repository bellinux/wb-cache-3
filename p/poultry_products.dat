25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the <b>poultry</b> <b>products</b> are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Marinades {{containing}} polyphosphates {{have been}} previously {{implicated in the}} enhanced sur-vival of Campylobacter spp. in <b>poultry</b> <b>product</b> exu-dates. The enhanced Campylobacter survival has been attributed primarily {{to the ability of}} some polyphos-phates to change the pH of the exudate to one more amenable to Campylobacter. In this study a ground <b>poultry</b> <b>product</b> contaminated with a 6 strain Campy-lobacter jejuni cocktail was utilized to determine if the efficiency of high-hydrostatic-pressure treatments was negatively impacted by the presence of commonly utilized polyphosphates. Two polyphosphates, hexam-etaphosphate and sodium tripolyphosphate, used at 2 concentrations, 0. 25 and 0. 5 %, failed to demonstrate any significant negative effects on the efficiency of inactivation of C. jejuni by high-pressure treatment. However, storage at 4 ◦C of the ground poultry sam-ples containing C. jejuni after high-pressure treatment appeared to provide a synergistic effect on Campylobac-ter inactivation. High-pressure treatment in conjunc-tion with 7 d of storage at 4 ◦C resulted in a mean reduction in C. jejuni survival that was larger than the sum of the individual reductions caused by high pres-sure or 4 ◦C storage when applied separately...|$|R
