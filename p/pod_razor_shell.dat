Marine Pollution Bulletin, 52 : 739 - 755. Shells of the <b>pod</b> <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> (Ensis siliqua) from 13 locations around the west coast of mainland Britain have been analysed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for a range of trace metals including Zn, Cd, Pb, U, Ba, Sr and Mg. The trace metal record in these shells is a proxy record for changes in seawater chemistry during the 1990 s. Regional variations exist in the median concentrations of the analysed metals. Barium concentrations are related to increased productivity from sewage sludge dumping at sea. Strontium shows a local relationship to salinity, but there is no clear relationship over the study area, instead high Sr is often associated with high Ba, and may reflect ontogenetic factors such as growth rate. Magnesium shows a seasonal variation within individual shells and can be used to calculate sea surface temperatures from groups of shells. Contaminant metals show a clear regional relationship with known sources, thus high Pb and Zn are typically associated with former metal mining areas (e. g. Cardigan Bay, Anglesey), and high Pb, Zn, Cd and U are associated with industrial activity in Liverpool Bay. Anomalies such as the high U in shells from northern Scotland cannot at present be explained. A seasonal variation of Pb is also seen in Cardigan Bay and Liverpool Bay, relating to increased winter fluxes of these metals to the marine environment. The regional distribution of these metals is consistent with known sources of contamination and patterns of seawater migration around the coast of Britain. Peer reviewe...|$|E

50|$|Phaxas pellucidus or the {{transparent}} <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> is {{a species of}} marine bivalve mollusc in the family Pharidae. It is found buried in the seabed in coastal waters of northwest Europe, often in great numbers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> lives {{under the}} sand, using its {{powerful}} foot to dig {{to a safe}} depth. Its digging activity comprises six stages, repeated cyclically. A digging cycle involves integration of the muscular foot (which takes up {{a large part of}} the body) with the opening and closing of the valve and one end. The foot is inflated hydraulically, extending down into the sand and anchoring the animal. Deflation of the foot then draws the <b>shell</b> down. The <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> also squirts water down into the sand, removing loose sand from its path. The foot is thought to exert a pressure of about 196kPa (2 kgf/cm2).|$|R

50|$|The <b>razor</b> <b>shell,</b> Ensis arcuatus, {{also called}} razor clam, razor fish, or spoot (colloquially), is a bivalve {{of the family}} Pharidae. It is found on sandy beaches in Northern Europe (south to Bay of Biscay) and Eastern Canada, such as Prince Edward Island, and in Kuwait's sandy beaches where it is very common.|$|R
50|$|The shells are long, narrow, and parallel-sided. This shape {{resembles a}} closed, old-fashioned {{straight}} razor (a cut-throat razor), or a closed jackknife (pocket knife) and sometimes these clams {{are known as}} <b>razor</b> <b>shells</b> or jackknives. The shells in these species are fragile and can easily be damaged when digging for these clams.|$|R
50|$|<b>Razor</b> <b>shells</b> have {{a fragile}} shell, with open ends. The shell is smooth {{on the outside}} and whitish in color, with {{vertical}} and horizontal reddish-brown or purplish-brown markings separated by a diagonal line. The periostracum is olive-green. The inner surface is white with a purple tinge and the foot is creamy white with brown lines.|$|R
50|$|Phaxas is a genus {{of small}} <b>razor</b> <b>shells</b> {{in the family}} Pharidae. Members of the genus have a pair of {{elongate}} valves and live in soft sediments on the sea bed.

50|$|In January 2013, {{large numbers}} of common starfish were washed up near Cleethorpes Pier {{on the east coast}} of England along with many <b>razor</b> <b>shells.</b> There were {{estimated}} to be four thousand starfish along the stretch of shore. The cause of this mass stranding was unknown but bad weather and storms out at sea coupled with higher than usual tides may have been to blame.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} for its elongated, {{rectangular}} shape, whose similarity to the straight razor gives it its name. The <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> has been known to reach 23 cm in length. The dorsal margin is straight while the ventral margin is curved. It can easily be confused with the slightly shorter 15 cm and more curved E. ensis (in which both front and back are curved in parallel).|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{aspects of}} 75 megabenthic bivalve species {{found on the}} south coast of Portugal (from Vila Real to Sagres) were studied based on the {{information}} provided by seasonal bivalve surveys from 2000 to 2007 (8600 hauls, simultaneously using a <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> dredge and a clam dredge). Of the 75 species identified, 36 occurred less than 30 times, and thus were considered rare in the area. The remaining 39 bivalves were analysed according to their occurrence, bathymetric distribution, geographic preferences, seasonal preferences, burying-depth, beach exposure and river mouth proximity. All species belonging to the Pharidae and Solenidae families (<b>razor</b> <b>shells)</b> and most Tellinidae were significantly more frequent in the <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> dredge (indicating deeper burying in the sediment), whilst the families Cardiidae and Donacidae were significantly more frequent in the clam dredge (indicating that these species are probably closer to the sediment surface). As for the season, most bivalve species occurred similarly in both seasons (19 sp; 49 %), but a large proportion were more abundant during the autumn surveys (17 sp., 44 %), whereas only three species were commoner during the spring surveys. Most species belonging to the families Cardiidae and Mactridae were commoner in the autumn surveys. The spatial distribution differed between species and cluster analysis identified four communities with greater geographic affinity. Species belonging to the family Cardiidae were preferably found in the western part (WB) and the eastern part (S) of the study area, whereas the families Donacidae, Mactridae and Tellinidae occurred mainly in the central area (EB) and the eastern (S) coastal sectors. Overall, shallower species (modal depth at 3 - 6 m) showed greater occurrences and abundances than the deeper ones, and the depth pattern observed did not change between seasons. Donacidae and Mactridae (except Mactra glauca) were represented essentially by shallow species, whereas Cardiidae (except Acanthocardia tuberculata and Cerastoderma edule) included mostly species occurring in deeper waters. Bathymetric sequence of species distribution within some families was observed...|$|R
50|$|Abra alba feeds {{by means}} of a pair of {{separate}} long, extensible siphons, elongations of the mantle. It is mostly a deposit feeder but is also able to feed on suspended particles as does the tellin Tellina fabula, a species with which it is often associated. The inhalant siphon gropes around widely over the surface of the substrate, actively drawing in detritus. In studies of Liverpool Bay, a community that includes A. alba, Phaxas pellucidus (the transparent <b>razor</b> <b>shell)</b> and Lagis koreni (the trumpet worm) is likely associated with more than one habitat.|$|R
40|$|The site of “El Ostrero”, {{which is}} now destroyed, was located in Alto de Maliaño (Camargo, Cantabria), on a hill about 500 m from the Boo Estuary. Excavations in 1984 {{documented}} a tumulus-shaped deposit, 5 m in diameter, formed by a dense accumulation of archaeological remains, including fauna, pottery and metal objects. The faunal remains are restudied here. The number of mammal bones is very small, contrasting with the large quantities of mollusc shells, mainly oysters, clams and <b>razor</b> <b>shells.</b> A radiocarbon determination of an oyster shell dates the deposit’s formation in the Early Iron Age. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5000|$|The trumpet worm is {{sometimes}} {{found at a}} density of a thousand individuals per square metre, but numbers fluctuate greatly. Species associated with the trumpet worm in a community include the white furrow shell (Abra alba), the <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> (Phaxas pellucidus), the bivalve (Mysella bidentata), the brittle star (Ophiura ophiura) and various polychaete worms. It {{has been found in}} studies of Liverpool Bay that in areas where the sediment has been disturbed by dredging and more deposition has occurred, Lagis koreni and Phaxas pellucidus often come to dominate the community. Also in these studies, the community was shown to be associated with different habitats.|$|R
40|$|Management of {{shellfish}} resources {{requires a}} spatial approach where mapping {{is a key}} tool. Acoustic techniques have been rarely used to map infaunal organisms with a patchy distribution. We propose and test the use of split-beam echosounder angular information to assess <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> presence and relative density. Our statistical approach combines textural analysis of angular echograms, standard unsupervised multivariate methods and hierarchical classification through dendrograms to identify groups of locations with similar clam densities. The statistical analyses show that the classification is consistent with groundtruthing data and that results are insensitive to boat motion or seabed granulometry. The method developed here constitutes a promising tool for assessing the relative density of razor clam grounds. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{longline}} 'metier' using small hooks for 'red' sea breams (Pagellus acarne and Pagellus erythrinus) in the Algarve (south of Portugal) was studied. Experimental longlining {{was carried}} out with three sizes of "Mustad" round bend, flatted, spade end Quality 2316 DT hooks (numbers 11, 13 and 15) and two types of bait: <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> (Ensis siliqua) and mud shrimp (Upogebia pusilla). A total of 3 328 fish and at least 36 species were caught with 33 600 hooks fished in 28 longline sets. Five species of sea breams (Sparidae) accounted for 79 % of the catch: Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Diplodus vulgaris, Spondyliosoma cantharus, and Boops boops. High catch rates of 20 - 30 fish per 100 hooks were made {{in a number of}} 1 200 hook longline sets, with total catch weights of 40 to more than 60 kg per set. In general, the smallest hook (number 15) had the highest catch rate. Bait type did not significantly affect the catch size distributions. Although more fish were caught with the <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> bait, higher catch rates of 'red' sea breams were obtained with mud shrimp. Catch rates were also affected by the location of the fishing grounds and the time of the set, with the highest catch rates obtained when the longline was set within two hours before sunrise. A wide size range was caught for each species, with highly overlapped catch size frequency distributions for the three hook sizes used. Except for Spondyliosoma cantharus, few illegal-sized fish were caught, even with the smallest hook. The logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was used to describe hook selectivity for Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, and Spondyliosoma cantharus.

50|$|P. pellucidus is a {{very small}} <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> seldom {{exceeding}} 4 cm in length. The colour is cream or dull white, sometimes with reddish markings. The periostracum is olive-coloured and glossy. The two elongated valves are fragile and equal in size. The dorsal side of each is straight while the ventral side is slightly curved giving a pod-like appearance. The anterior end is rounded while the posterior end is slightly truncate. There are fine sculptured lines parallel to the margins, which are themselves smooth. The ligament joining the valves is external and located close to the beaks which are very close to the anterior end. Pharus legumen is a somewhat similar species but it can be distinguished by its larger size and more cylindrical outline and the differences in the hinge teeth.|$|R
500|$|<b>Razor</b> <b>shells</b> can dig {{themselves}} into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|R

50|$|Shellfish of {{all sorts}} {{are part of the}} diet, and {{shellfish}} of the coastal regions include little neck clams, sea scallops, blue mussels, oysters, soft <b>shell</b> clams and <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> clams. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the clambake. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition. In summer, oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried, often served in a basket with french fries, or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll. Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce, and are often branded on where they were harvested. Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells, and smaller ones often find their way into clam chowder. Other preparations include clams casino, clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like oregano and streaky bacon.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the fishing}} fleet dynamics in the CÃ­es Islands, {{located in a}} National Land-Marine Park of Galicia. By interviewing fishers we identified the fleet fishing {{in the study area}} and obtained temporal data on effort and catch. Then we performed multivariate analyses of the catch profiles to identify the fishing strategies and their temporal dynamics. Our results highlight the complexity of the fishery system, composed of 565 boats that used 19 fishing gears and 33 strategies in an area of 26. 6 km 2. Octopus and velvet crab pots, gillnets targeting hake, trammel nets targeting European spider crab or ballan wrasse, clam rakes, and hand harvesting of gooseneck barnacles and <b>razor</b> <b>shells</b> are the strategies most used. In addition, most of the boats are generalists and use up to seven different fishing strategies throughout the year. This flexibility of the fleet to change the target species generates a wide diversity of annual fishing patterns that increases the complexity of the fisheries and the difficulty of managing them. The implementation of data collection programmes that include fleet dynamics and spatial data are key factors for developing effective management regulations consistent with the complexity of the system...|$|R
