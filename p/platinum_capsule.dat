Los Alamos National Laboratory designed, fabricated, and safety tested the LWRHU. The heat source consists of a hot-pressed {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 } fuel pellet, a Pt- 30 Rh vented capsule, a pyrolytic graphite insulator, and a fineweave-pierced fabric graphite aeroshell assembly. To compare {{the performance of the}} LWRHUs fabricated for the Cassini mission with the performance of those fabricated for the Galileo mission, and to determine a failure threshold, two types of impact tests were conducted. A post-reentry impact test was performed on one of 180 flight-quality units produced for the Cassini mission and a series of sequential impact tests using simulant-fueled LWRHU capsules were conducted respectively. The results showed that deformation and fuel containment of the impacted Cassini LWRHU was similar to that of a previously tested Galileo LWRHU. Both units sustained minimal deformation of the aeroshell and fueled capsule; the fuel was entirely contained by the <b>platinum</b> <b>capsule.</b> Sequential impacting, in both end-on and side-on orientations, resulted in increased damage with each subsequent impact.

40|$|Volatiles are a {{fundamental}} {{component of the}} Magmatic-Hydrothermal model of platinum group element (PGE) ore deposition for PGE deposits in layered mafic intrusions such as Bushveld and Stillwater. Volatiles {{have the potential to}} complex with PGEs in silicate melts and hydrothermal fluids, increasing PGE solubility; in order to assess the models of PGE ore deposition reliable estimates on the solubilities in the various magmatic phases must be known. However, experimental studies on the solubility and partitioning behaviour of PGEs in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal systems under relevant conditions are sparse, and the data that do exist produce conflicting results and new or adapted experimental methods must be applied to investigate these systems. Experimental results are presented here, investigating the effect of volatiles (i. e. H 2 O, Cl and CO 2) on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt and fluid-melt partitioning of Pt between an aqueous fluid and a haplobasaltic melt under magmatic conditions using a sealed-capsule technique. Also included are the details of the development of a novel experimental technique to observe fluid-melt partitioning in mafic systems and application of the method to the fluid-melt partition of Pt. Solubility experiments were conducted to assess the effect of volatiles on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt of dry diopside-anorthite eutectic composition at 1523 K and 0. 2 GPa. Synthetic glass powder of an anhydrous, 1 -atm eutectic, diopside-anorthite (An 42 -Di 58) haplobasalt composition was sealed in a platinum or platinum-iridium alloy capsule and was allowed to equilibrate with the noble metal capsule and a source of volatiles (i. e. H 2 O, H 2 O-Cl or H 2 O-CO 2) at experimental conditions. All experiments were run in an internally-heated pressure vessel equipped with a rapid quench device, with oxygen fugacity controlled by the water activity and intrinsic hydrogen fugacity of the autoclave (MnO-Mn 3 O 4). The resultant crystal- and bubble-free run product glasses were analyzed using a combination of laser ablation ICP-MS and bulk solution isotope-dilution ICP-MS to determine equilibrium solubilities of Pt and Ir and investigate the formation and contribution of micronuggets to overall bulk determined concentrations. In water-bearing experiments, it was determined that water content did not have an intrinsic effect on Pt or Ir solubility for water contents between 0. 9 wt. % and 4. 4 wt. % (saturation). Water content controlled the oxygen fugacity of the experiment and the resulting variations in oxygen fugacity, and the corresponding solubilities of Pt and Ir, indicate that over geologically relevant conditions both Pt and Ir are dissolved primarily in the 2 + valence state. Pt data suggest minor influence of Pt 4 + at higher oxygen fugacities; however, {{there is no evidence of}} higher valence states for Ir. The ability of the sealed capsule technique to produce micronugget-free run product glasses in water-only experiments, allowed the solubility of Pt to be determined in hydrous haplobasalt at lower oxygen fugacities (and concentrations) then was previously observed. Pt and Ir solubility can be represented as a function of oxygen fugacity (bars) by the following equations: [Pt](ppb) = 1389 (fO-sub- 2) + 7531 (fO-sub- 2) ^(1 / 2) [Ir](ppb) = 17140 (fO-sub- 2) ^(1 / 2) In Cl-bearing experiments, experimental products from short run duration (< 96 hrs) experiments contained numerous micronuggets, preventing accurate determination of platinum and iridium solubility. Longer run duration experiments showed decreasing amounts of micronuggets, allowing accurate determination of solubility; results indicate that under the conditions studied chlorine has no discernable effect on Pt solubility in the silicate melt from 0. 6 to 2. 75 wt. % Cl (saturation). Over the same conditions, a systematic increase in Ir solubility is found with increasing Cl content; however, the observed increase is within the analytical variation/error and is therefore not conclusive. If there is an effect of Cl on PGE solubility the effect is minor resulting in increased Ir solubilities of 60 % at chlorine saturation. However, the abundance of micronuggets in short run duration experiments, which decreases in abundance with time and increases with Cl-content, offers compelling evidence that Cl-bearing fluids have the capacity to transport significant amounts of Pt and Ir under magmatic conditions. It is suggested that platinum and iridium dissolved within the Cl-bearing fluid are left behind as the fluid dissolves into the melt during the heating stages of the experiment, leaving small amounts of Pt and Ir along the former particle boundaries. With increasing run duration, the metal migrates back to the capsule walls decreasing the amount of micronuggets contained within the glass. Estimates based on this model, using mass-balance calculations on the excess amount of Pt and Ir in the run product glasses (i. e. above equilibrium solubility) in short duration experiments, indicate estimated Pt and Ir concentrations in the Cl-bearing fluid ranging from tens to a few hundred ppm, versus ppb levels in the melt. Respective apparent (equilibrium has not been established) partition coefficients (D,fluid-melt) of 1 x 10 ^ 3 to 4 x 10 ^ 3 and 300 - 1100 were determined for Pt and Ir in Cl-bearing fluids; suggesting that Cl-bearing fluids can be highly efficient at enriching and transporting PGE in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming systems. Platinum solubility was also determined as a function of CO 2 content in a hydrous haplobasalt at controlled oxygen fugacity. Using the same sealed capsule techniques and melt composition as for H 2 O and Cl, a hydrous haplobasaltic melt was allowed to equilibrate with the <b>platinum</b> <b>capsule</b> and a CO 2 -source (CaCO 3 or silver oxalate) at 1523 K and 0. 2 GPa. Experiments were conducted with a water content of approximately 1 wt. %, fixing the log oxygen fugacity (bars) between - 5. 3 and - 6. 1 (log NNO = - 6. 95 @ 1573 K and 0. 2 GPa). Carbon dioxide contents in the run product glasses ranged from 800 - 2500 ppm; and over these conditions, CO 2 was found to have a negligible effect on Pt solubility in the silicate melt. Analogous to the Cl-bearing experiments, bulk concentrations of Pt in CO 2 -bearing experiments increased with increasing CO 2 content due to micronugget formation. Apparent Pt concentrations in the H 2 O-CO 2 fluid phase, prior to fluid dissolution, were calculated to be 1. 6 to 42 ppm, resulting in apparent partition coefficients(D,fluid-melt) of 1. 5 x 10 ^ 2 to 4. 2 x 10 ^ 3, increasing with increasing mol CO 2 :H 2 O up to approximately 0. 15, after which increasing CO 2 content does not further increase partitioning. As well, a novel technique was developed and applied to assess the partitioning of Pt between an aqueous fluid and a hydrous diopside-anorthite melt under magmatic conditions. Building upon the sealed-capsule technique utilized for solubility studies, a method was developed by adding a seed crystal to the capsule along with a silicate melt and fluid. By generating conditions favourable to crystal growth, and growing the crystal from the fluid, it is possible to entrap fluid inclusions in the growing crystal, allowing direct sampling of the fluid phase at the conditions of the experiment. Using a diopside seed crystal with the diopside-anorthite eutectic melt, it was possible to control diopside crystallization by controlling the temperature, thus allowing control of the crystallization and fluid inclusion entrapment conditions. Subsequent laser ablation ICP-MS analysis of the fluid inclusions allowed fluid–melt partition coefficients of Pt to be determined. Synthetic glass powder of an anhydrous, 1 -atm eutectic, diopside-anorthite (An 42 ¬Di 58) haplobasalt composition (with ppm levels of Ba, Cs, Sr and Rb added as internal standards), water and a diopside seed crystal were sealed in a <b>platinum</b> <b>capsule</b> and were allowed to equilibrate at experimental conditions. Water was added in amounts to maintain a free fluid phase throughout the experiment, and the diopside crystal was separated from the melt. All experiments were run in an internally heated pressure vessel equipped with a rapid-quench device, with oxygen fugacity controlled by the water activity and intrinsic hydrogen fugacity of the autoclave (MnO-Mn 3 O 4). Experiments were allowed to equilibrate (6 - 48 hrs) at experimental conditions (i. e. 1498 K, 0. 2 GPa, fluid+melt+diopside stable) before temperature was dropped (i. e. to 1483 K) to induce crystallization. Crystals were allowed to grow for a period of 18 - 61 hours, prior to rapid isobaric quenching to 293 K at the conclusion of the experiment. Experimental run products were a crystal- and bubble-free glass and the diopside seed crystal with a fluid-inclusion-bearing overgrowth. Analysis of fluid inclusions provides initial solubility estimates of Pt in a H 2 O fluid phase at 1488 K and 0. 2 GPa at or near ppm levels and fluid melt partition coefficients ranging from 2 – 48. This indicates substantial metal enrichment in the fluid phase in the absence of major ligands such as carbonate or chlorine. The results of this study indicate that the volatiles studied (i. e. H 2 O, CO 2, and Cl) do not have a significant effect on Pt and Ir solubility in a haplobasaltic melt at magmatic conditions. These results suggest that complexing of Pt and Ir by OH, Cl, and carbonate species in a haplobasaltic melt is insignificant and the presence of these volatiles will not result in significantly increased PGE contents over their dry counterparts, as has been suggested. Preliminary evidence of minor Cl-complexing of Ir is presented; however, resulting in only a slight increase (< 100 %) in Ir solubility at Cl-saturation. Significant partitioning of Pt and Ir into a fluid phase at magmatic conditions has been demonstrated; with estimates of fluid-haplobasaltic melt partition coefficients increasing from 1 x 10 ^ 1 for pure water to up to an apparent 4 x 10 ^ 3 with the addition of Cl or CO 2 to the system. This result indicates complexing of Pt and Ir with OH< HxCOy≤ Cl. Using these estimates, Cl- or CO 2 -bearing magmatic fluids can be highly efficient at enriching and transporting platinum group elements (PGEs) in mafic magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming systems...|$|E

The solidus changes slope at about 13. 5 kbar; the amphibole maximum-stability curve changes slope in the interval 12. 5 - 15 kbar {{to such an extent that}} the amphibole stability field is more restricted at high pressures than anticipated from previous studies. With free water, eclogite is Stable only at depths greater than about 70 km, and amphibolite is Stable in the deep crust. Amphibolite crust thickened in the depth range 40 - 60 km with aqueous pore fluid melts, forming a liquid enriched in silica and albitic plagioclase; this is a potential source of water-undersaturated liquids for batholiths. The upper boundary of the mantle low-velocity zone could be the boundary between rocks with interstitial amphibole and those with interstitial hydrous silicate liquid. In oceanic crust forming the upper part of a subducted lithosphere slab, it appears that most hydrous minerals dehydrate or melt before they reach 100 km depth. If so, dehydration of subducted oceanic crust does not supply water for andesitic magmatism beyond the arc-trench gap, nor contribute to the chemical variations recorded in andesites across arc complexes (K_ 2 O, K/Rb) ...|$|R
40|$|Crystalline brown-hornblende mylonite, with a {{composition}} similar to some basanites and nephelin-ites, was crushed and reacted with excess water {{and with no}} water added (about 2 % water present) in sealed <b>platinum</b> <b>capsules</b> in a piston-cylinder apparatus from 10 - 30 kb. The solidus with excess water, and liquidus curves for excess water and for 2 % water, are presented, together with stability limits (within 50 °C brackets) in the melting intervals for amphibole, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, garnet, olivine, rutile, nepheline, and zoisite. With increasing water content and consequent decreasing liquidus temperature on the water-undersaturated liquidus surface, the number of liquidus and near-liquidus minerals increases, the field of olivine extends to higher pressures, and garnet becomes stabilized at pressures above 20 kb. Orthopyroxene was not found. Amphibole is stable at the liquidus between 10 and 21 kb with excess water at 1, 075 °C, and between 10 and 16 kb with 2 % water at 1, 175 °C. These results combined with previous interpretations {{are consistent with the}} following tentative petrogenetic history for St. Paul's Rocks. A water-undersaturated olivine-basanite magma rose from a depth of about 100 km at a temperature of 1, 200 - 1, 300 °C, and differentiated until it reached a depth somewhere between 45 - 70 km, where the magma had reached the composition of brown-hornblende mylonite. At a temperature between 1, 050 °C and 1, 000 °C amphibole was the dominant mineral being precipitated. Exsolution of water from the magma became fixed in the mantle peridotite as amphibole, and locally may have caused incipient melting of the peridotite. This process may have initiated upward movement of the heterogeneous assemblage of peridotite and largely crystallized basanite magma, which rose as a near-solid diapiric intrusion with temperature possibly remaining as high as 1, 000 °C up to 7 km deep, where intense mylonitization began during the final ascent and shallow emplacement...|$|R

Samples were pyrope composition with variable H_ 2 O, and other compositions with 7. 5 wt % H_ 2 O. Highly aluminous metastable orthopyroxenes nucleated from and persisted in mixtures with compositions near pyrope. There is no univariant fusion curve for pyrope-H_ 2 O. Pyrope dissolves incongruently in H_ 2 O subsolidus, and {{a trace of}} liquid is produced near 1000 °C. A univariant reaction: pyrope + forsterite + vapor = spinel + liquid was located at 1150 ± 20 ° C. The liquidus for pyrope with excess H_ 2 O is at 1310 °C. Orthopyroxenes coexisting with SiO_ 2 -rich liquids contain 0. 8 - 5. 7 % excess SiO_ 2 compared with MgSiO_ 3 -Al_ 2 O_ 3. Liquidus diagrams dry, with 7. 5 % H_ 2 O, and with excess H_ 2 O illustrate the effect of H_ 2 O on the liquidus relationships. With increasing H_ 2 O: the liquidus volume for Opx expands greatly {{at the expense of}} that for Qz, and slightly at the expense of Py; the volume for Fo expands significantly at the expense of that for Opx, and slightly at the expense of Py; liquid coexisting with Fo + Opx + Py is enriched in SiO_ 2 and Al_ 2 O_ 3; liquid coexisting with Opx + Py + Qz is enriched greatly in SiO_ 2 and slightly in Al_ 2 O_ 3; the range of liquid compositions coexisting with Opx + Py is greatly increased toward enrichment in SiO_ 2. These results provide boundaries for corresponding phase relationships in CaO-MgO-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -SiO_ 2 -H_ 2 O with applications to the effect of H_ 2 O on partial fusion of subducted oceanic crust (quartz eclogite) and mantle peridotite...|$|R

Reactions (1) and (2) represent the curves {{for the beginning}} of melting of granite and syenite, respectively. A review of previous results provides our best estimates for melting curves from 1 to 20 kbar (or higher) in these systems and additional systems Or-Qz-H_ 2 O and CaAl_ 2 Si_ 2 O_ 8 (An) -Qz-H_ 2 O and rock-H_ 2 O systems. Curves {{for the beginning of}} melting of major rock types in the presence of excess water have recently been extended to mantle pressures, and the influence of feldspar and quartz in granite, tonalite, syenite, and gabbro melting is evident to about 15 kbar, from comparison of the rock-H_ 2 O curves with the feldspar-quartz-H_ 2 O curves. The melting pattern changes above the pressure where plagioclase feldspar breaks down, and the slope (dP/dT) of the melting curves then becomes positive and roughly parallel with curves for dry systems.

The results were {{combined with the}} results from previously published experiments to provide comprehensive phase relationships for an I-type granite: a P-T diagram with excess H_ 2 O; isobaric T-X_(H_ 2 O) diagrams at 25, 30, and 35 kbar showing H_ 2 O-undersaturated relations; the H_ 2 O-undersaturated liquidus surface mapped with contours for constant H_ 2 O contents and fields for near-liquidus minerals; and the solubility of H_ 2 O in granite liquids to 35 kbar. Results and their implications show: (1) The solidus temperature decreases from 680 °C at 2 kbar to 620 °C at 10 kbar, then increases to 700 °C at 35 kbar because of changes from less dense to more dense subsolidus mineral assemblages. (2) The melting interval with excess H_ 2 O, which is only 35 °C at 2 kbar, increases to 105 °C at 10 kbar and 150 °C at 35 kbar because the liquidus minimum in the complex rock system departs from granite composition with increasing pressure. (3) The solubility Of H_ 2 O in granite liquid is 27 ± 2. 5 weight percent at 35 kbar and 850 °C, indicating that a miscibility gap persists between H_ 2 O-saturated silicate magmas and aqueous vapor phase, at least to pressures corresponding to 120 -km depth in the mantle. Dissolution of alkali feldspar (20 % of rock) in the subsolidus aqueous vapor phase indicates that deep-seated aqueous fluids are concentrated solutions. (4) Quartz and coesite are the liquidus minerals at mantle pressures for all H_ 2 O contents, indicating that granites and rhyolites cannot be primary magmas from mantle peridotite or subducted oceanic gabbroic crust. (5) The liquidus surface at crustal pressures, with plagioclase and quartz as primary minerals, indicates that primary liquids of granite composition with moderate H_ 2 O contents can be generated in the crust at reasonable temperatures; these liquids could rise to near surface levels without vesiculation. Granite liquid together with residual crustal minerals could constitute plutonic magmas of intermediate composition...|$|R

Experiments were performed in graphite-lined <b>platinum</b> <b>capsules</b> at pressures and temperatures ranging from 1. 1 to 2. 3 GPa and 1300 – 1400 C using a synthetic Ti-enriched Apollo ‘black glass’ composition in the CaO–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –TiO 2 –SiO 2 system. Ilmenite–melt and armalcolite–melt partition coefficients (D) show highly incompatible values for the rare earth elements (REE) with the light REE more incompatible compared to the heavy REE (DIlm–melt La 0. 0020 ± 0. 0010 to DIlm–melt Lu 0. 069 ± 0. 010 for ilmenite; DArm–melt La 0. 0048 ± 0. 0023 to DArm–melt Lu 0. 041 ± 0. 008 for armalcolite). D values for the high field strength elements vary from highly incompatible for Th, U and to a lesser extent W (for ilmenite: DIlm–melt Th 0. 0013 ± 0. 0008, DIlm–melt U 0. 0035 ± 0. 0015 and DIlm–melt W 0. 039 ± 0. 005, and for armalcolite DArm–melt Th 0. 008 ± 0. 003, DArm–melt U 0. 0048 ± 0. 0022 and DArm–melt W 0. 062 ± 0. 03), to mildly incompatible for Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf (e. g. DIlm–melt Hf 0. 28 ± 0. 05 and : DArm–melt Hf 0. 76 ± 0. 07). Both minerals fractionate the high field strength elements with DTa/DNb and DHf/DZr between 1. 3 and 1. 6 for ilmenite and 1. 3 and 1. 4 for armalcolite. Armalcolite is slightly more efficient at fractionating Hf from W during lunar magma ocean crystallisation, with DHf/DW = 12 – 13 compared to 6. 7 – 7. 5 for ilmenite. The transition metals vary from mildly incompatible to compatible, with the highest compatibilities for Cr in ilmenite (D 7. 5) and V in armalcolite (D 8. 1). D values show no clear variation with pressure in the small range covered. Crystal lattice strain modelling of D values for di-, tri- and tetravalent trace elements shows that in ilmenite, divalent elements prefer to substitute for Fe while armalcolite data suggest REE replacing Mg. Tetravalent cations appear to preferentially substitute for Ti in both minerals, with the exception of Th and U that likely substitute for the larger Fe or Mg cations. Crystal lattice strain modelling is also used to identify and correct for very small (0. 3 wt. ...|$|R

Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a pseudocereal with {{an important role}} in food diets around the world, especially in Asia and Eastern Europe. They gained increasing attention of scientific community, specially due to their high nutritional value and health benefits. Mineral concentrations in cereals and pseudocereals can differ with genotype, type of soil, fertilizer application, region’s mineral composition and treatments applied, that can even cause the loss of some minerals. Analytical values must be obtained by applying high quality criteria, such as criteria on sample handling, appropriate sample preparation and subsequent analytical method and, an effective internal and external quality control program. Inductively Couple Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry – ICP-OES is a high specific technique which allows a rapid and simultaneous multi-elemental analysis of several elements, in a numerous and wide scale of sample matrices, with good detection limits. A previous sample decomposition through its dissolution is required which can be undertaken by different methods, namely microwave digestion, dry-ashing, wet digestion. The destruction of organic matter is a slow step of overall analytical process largely dependent on the content of major components. The purpose of this work was to compare the performances of microwave and dry-ashing digestion procedures, including the optimization of microwave conditions to assist ICP-OES analysis. The optimized digestion method was applied on determination, of copper, manganese, iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium contents in purple corn, quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat and rice. Samples were dry ashed within <b>platinum</b> <b>capsules</b> in a furnace at 470 ºC during 40 h and microwave digested using a closed-vessel system digestion with a mixture of concentrated acid nitric, hydrogen peroxide and deionised water. The accuracy of analytical procedure was verified by analyzing a NIST 1548 a reference material. Mineral profiles of purple corn, pseudocereals and rice were compared. Copper ranged from 0. 07 mg/ 100 g (rice) to 0. 59 mg/ 100 g (quinoa), manganese ranged from 0. 64 mg/ 100 g (purple corn) to 1. 73 mg/ 100 g (quinoa), iron ranged from 0. 2 mg/ 100 g (rice) to 8. 8 mg/ 100 g (amaranth), zinc ranged from 1 mg/ 100 g (rice) to 5. 1 mg/ 100 g (amaranth), magnesium ranged from 27 mg/ 100 g (rice) to 211 mg/ 100 g (amaranth), calcium ranged from 0. 05).
