50|$|During the First World War the Steiger firm {{repaired}} aeroplanes and aeroplane engines. In 1917 {{the owner}} and his engineer, Paul Henze, began to work on motorized vehicles. Plans for the manufacture of tractors were abandoned in favour {{of the development of}} automobiles. Their first model, the Steiger 10/50 PS, was produced in 1920. This touring model with a 2.6 litre four cylinder engine (50 hp / 37 kW) became Steiger’s most significant product, and was still in production when the firm collapsed in 1926. Its modern OHC engine was distinctive because of an overhead camshaft driven by spiral-toothed bevel gear wheels. These cars, with ‘u’ shaped pressed steel frames, two axles with leaf spring suspension and a <b>pointed</b> <b>radiator,</b> were considered to be the most significant technical innovation of the early 1920s and the most progressive German serially-produced cars of their time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{deterministic}} Maxwellian framework, {{we investigate}} {{the ability of}} each of the dual fields (electric and magnetic) in carrying independent information in a multi-polarization MIMO system. We quantify the performance by using a well-defined power independent dimensionality (PID) metric. We present numerical results for 3 deterministic scenarios: a canonical free-space (near and far field exact solution), a canonical PEC corridor (using rigorous modal analysis) and a lossy-wall corridor (using image ray tracing). The deterministic results show that in a multi-path rich environment, the hexapole system (collocated polarized electric and magnetic <b>point</b> <b>radiators)</b> is almost guaranteed to provide more than 3 DOF. However, in the simulated scenarios, the maximum 6 DOF are never attained due to the inevitable coupling between the electric and magnetic fields. On the other hand, for a tripole system, the upper-limit of 3 DOF is achievable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an adaptive technique {{to extract the}} signal of interest (SOI) arriving from a known direction {{in the presence of}} strong interferers using a single snapshot of data. The antenna elements in this method can be nonuniformly spaced and there can be mutual coupling between them. In addition, near-field scatterers can also be present. First, the voltages induced in the antenna elements of the array due to interferers, mutual coupling between the elements, and near-field scatterers is preprocessed by applying a transformation matrix to these voltages through a rigorous electromagnetic analysis tool. This electromagnetic preprocessing technique transforms the voltages that are induced in a nonuniformly spaced array containing real antenna elements to a set of voltages that will be produced in a uniform linear virtual array (ULVA) containing omnidirectional isotropic <b>point</b> <b>radiators.</b> In the transformation matrix we would like to include various electromagnetic effects like mutual coupling between the antenna elements, presence of near-field scatterers and the platform effects on which the antenna array is mounted. This transformation matrix when applied to the actual measured voltages yields an equivalent set of voltages that will be induced in the ULVA. A direct data domain least squares adaptive algorithm is then applied to the processed voltages to extract the SOI in the presence of interferers. Limited numerical examples are presented to illustrate the novelty of the proposed method. Index Terms—Adaptive signal processing, antenna array mutual coupling, nonuniformly spaced arrays. I...|$|R

Arranging them in parallel matches the half-wave resonance to 50 W. By carefully selecting the angle to ground plane and using mutual coupling, the quarter-wave resonance is also matched to 50 W.

50|$|Underneath the curvaceous bodywork, {{the chassis}} was a riveted, {{aluminium}} monocoque, with steel bulkheads onto which the suspension components were mounted. The DFV engine {{was supported in}} an aluminium cradle behind the driver. Unlike the Lotus 49 for which the DFV had been designed, the engine was not used as a structural chassis member. In contrast, the suspension layout was almost a direct copy of contemporary F1 practice. Contemporary observers commented on the oversized front hub components, potentially allowing the car to be converted to four-wheel drive at some <b>point.</b> The <b>radiator</b> was mounted in the nose, although later enhancements to cooling resulted in a wider opening being incorporated from mid-season. Fuel was stored in two deformable cells, one in each sill.|$|R

50|$|Afterwards, TsAGI had Mikhail Gromov, {{assisted}} by mechanic Yevgeny Radzevich, visit important European capitals in an ANT-3. He started his expedition from Moscow at 3 a.m. on August 30, and headed west. After about 120 km (75 mi) were covered, an expansion tank with {{water for the}} Napier Lion engine experienced three fatigue cracks. Water sprayed around the cockpit. Fortunately for him, Gromov did the sensible thing and returned home. Newspapers stated that he and Radzevich turned back due to poor weather. The incident caused Tupolev to recommend that the tank have a convex base, which was adopted. Gromov resumed his expedition. Yet another problem arose. The ANT-3 landed at present day Kaliningrad, by which <b>point</b> the <b>radiator</b> was leaking. Gromov proceeded to Berlin. There, the mechanics {{were not able to}} fix the radiator. Moving on, he went to Paris, where a mechanic found that some putty sealant had separated. To solve the problem, he took another aircraft's radiator, and adapted it to fit in the ANT-3. When the mechanic was finished with the problem, Gromov flew off to Rome.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the concept}} of a perfect point source object is so central to the idea of PSF, it's worth {{spending}} some time on that before proceeding further. First of all, {{there is no such thing}} in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is nothing more than a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens-Fresnel principle). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We also note that a perfect <b>point</b> source <b>radiator</b> will not only radiate a uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of exponentially decaying (evanescent) waves as well, and it is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength (see Fourier optics). This follows from the following Fourier transform expression for a 2D impulse function, ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide thermal {{radiation}} environments that result in adequate beat rejection, the single-phase, liquid ammonia (NH 3) heat rejection system on the International Space Station (ISS) requires that its two thermal radiator wings be dynamically rotated as the ISS travels through its orbit. This paper discusses the closed-loop, thermal <b>radiator</b> <b>pointing</b> system that is used on ISS to ensure adequate heat rejection by the radiators, while preventing freezing of the ammonia under low heat loads and cold-environmental conditions. Although initial designs used an open-loop approach for <b>radiator</b> <b>pointing,</b> concerns about performance robustness, algorithm complexity, memory requirements, and sustaining support drove {{the development of a}} more robust, simpler, closed-loop system. Hence, the challenge of the closed-loop system was to utilize existing sensors, actuators and computers to fit into the existing hardware and software architecture of the ISS. Using a proportional-integral (PI) control architecture with limited output and an anti-windup integrator, the temperature of the ammonia coming out of the radiator is measured and controlled by adjusting the radiator wing orientation. The radiator wing orientation for the local minimum environment is fed forward to the control system, and the closed-loop controller is used to generate a bias off of that local minimum environment in order to heat up the ammonia when necessary to avoid freezing. In the earth's shadow, the controller is suspended and the radiator wing is oriented to face the earth, the local maximum thermal environment which further prevents freezing of the ammonia. This control architecture is shown to provide adequate heat rejection and avoid freezing of the ammonia, even though the physical system consists of large transport delays and time-varying dynamics which change dramatically due to orbit motion and variable heat loads...|$|R

40|$|The “Phase Center” is an {{essential}} quantity for characterizing antennas in precise navigation applications such as geodetics or avionics. Signal processing algorithms generally assume the radiated wave-front from the antenna is spherical at the target position. The position of the phase center defines the position of an ideal <b>point</b> source <b>radiator</b> {{for the purpose of}} system design. Therefore, accurate determination of the phase center is crucial for system design purposes. In practice, the phase center is an estimate of the true antenna phase front. It generally depends on the angular position of the target, the polarization and the range of solid angles of interest. Because this concept is critical for proper system design, it is essential that an unambiguous self-consistent technique be implemented to determine the phase center. The phase center of complex, highly directional antennas may be very difficult and costly to measure. Other factors such as antenna mounting, feed structure or measurement uncertainty can lead to additional errors. An efficient alternative to measurement is the application of mathematical methods that take advantage of 3 D electromagnetic field simulation. These approaches save time and reduce uncertainty when compared with measurement, since the antenna environment may easily be varied and measurement uncertainty is eliminated. The method used to determine the antenna PC position will be presented in this talk. This approach is currently used by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to investigate phase centre variations (PCV) caused by digital beamforming. The far-field data obtained from HFSS are used to analyze PCV for different incident signal directions of arrival under realistic antenna conditions, accounting for mutual coupling and output impedance mismatch. Several methods for phase center calculation will be presented and their advantages and disadvantages will be discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) is a CCD based X-ray {{telescope}} {{designed for}} localization, spectroscopy {{and long term}} light curve monitoring of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their X-ray afterglows. Shortly after launch there was {{a failure of the}} thermo-electric cooler on the XRT CCD. Due to this the Swift XRT Team had the unexpected challenge of ensuring that the CCD temperature stayed below- 50 C utilizing only passive cooling through a radiator mounted {{on the side of the}} Swift. Here we show that the temperature of the XRT CCD is correlated with the average elevation of the Earth above the XRT radiator, which is in turn related to the targets that Swift observes in an orbit. In order to maximize passive cooling of the XRT CCD, the XRT team devised several novel methods for ensuring that the XRT radiator’s exposure to the Earth was minimized to ensure efficient cooling. These methods include: picking targets on the sky for Swift to point at which are known to put the spacecraft into a good orientation for maximizing XRT cooling; biasing the spacecraft roll angle to <b>point</b> the XRT <b>radiator</b> away from the Earth as much as possible; utilizing time in the SAA, in which all of the instruments on-board Swift are non-operational, to point at “cold targets”; and restricting observing time on "warm " targets to only the periods at which the spacecraft is in a favorable orientation for cooling.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{its success}} in the SLD CRID at the SLAC Linear Collider, {{ultrasonic}} measurement of Cherenkov radiator refractive index has been less fully exploited in more recent Cherenkov detectors employing gaseous radiators. This is surprising, since it is ideally suited to monitoring hydrostatic variations in refractive index {{as well as its}} evolution during the replacement of a light radiator passivation gas (e. g. N 2) with a heavier fluorocarbon (e. g. C 4 F 10 [CF 4]; mol. Weight 188 [88]). The technique exploits the dependence of sound velocity on the molar concentrations of the two components at known temperature and pressure. The SLD barrel CRID used an 87 %C 5 F 12 / 13 %N 2 blend, mixed before injection into the: blend control based on ultrasonic mixture analysis maintained the = 1 Cherenkov ring angle to long term variation better than ± 0. 3 %, monitored ultrasonically at multiple <b>points</b> in the <b>radiator</b> vessel. Recent advances using microcontroller-based electronics have led to ultrasonic instruments capable of simultaneously measuring gas flow and binary mixture composition in the fluorocarbon evaporative cooling systems of the ATLAS Inner Detector. Sound transit times are measured in opposite directions in flowing gas for simultaneous measurement of flow rate and sound velocity. Gas composition is evaluated in real-time by comparison with a sound velocity/composition database.

40|$|This thesis will {{evaluate}} a passively cooled cylindrical spectrometer array in lunar orbit characterizing the thermal response {{in order to}} provide context for decision-making to scientists and engineers. To provide perspective on thermal issues and controls of space science instruments, a background search of historical lunar missions is provided. Next, a trial science mission is designed and analyzed which brings together the elements of the background search, lunar orbit environment and passive cooling. Finally, the trial science mission analysis results are provided along with the conclusions drawn. Scintillators are materials that when struck by particle radiation, absorb the particle energy which is then reemitted as light in or near the visible range. Nuclear astrophysics utilizes scintillating materials for observation of high-energy photons which are generated by sources such as solar flares, supernovae and neutron stars. SPMs are paired with inorganic scintillators to detect the light emitted which is converted into electronic signals. The signals are captured and analyzed in order to map the number and location of the high-energy sources. The SPM is utilized as it has single photon sensitivity, low voltage requirements and a fast response. SPMs are also compact, relatively inexpensive and allow the usage of lower-cost scintillating materials within the spectrometer. These characteristics permit large-area arrays while lowering cost and power requirements. The ability of a spectrometer to record and identify the interaction of high-energy photons for scientific return is not a trivial matter. Background noise is generated when particles that have not originated from the desired distant source impact the spectrometer. Additionally, thermally induced electrical signals are randomly generated within the SPM {{even in the absence of}} light which is referred to as dark current. Overcoming these obstacles requires greater light emittance and energy resolution with reduced dark current. Strong scintillation photon emittance ensures that low energy impacts will produce enough visible photons to be detected by the SPM. Higher energy resolution will ensure that single photon impacts can be distinguished from others of similar wavelength and energy; reduced dark current decreases the generation of random signals not associated with a photon impact. Increasing efficiency in each of these properties in a spectrometer comprised of inorganic scintillators and SPMs requires low temperatures. Low temperature maintenance in a lunar environment presents many unique challenges of its own. Even with the accumulated successes of past missions, the lunar environment remains a thermal challenge for engineers. The lunar orbit thermal environment is driven by radiation from three sources, direct solar radiation, reflected solar radiation from the lunar surface (albedo) and lunar radiation (Clawson 2002). Direct solar radiation values are consistent with those seen in Earth orbit (1325 W/m 2) (Clawson 2002). The percentage of solar radiation reflected from the moon is consistently very low with the moon's dark regolith covered surface absorbing nearly 90 % of the incident light (Clawson 2002). Yet, it is this absorption that gives the lunar orbit environment one of its most difficult thermal attributes as the absorbed solar radiation is released from the lunar surface as infrared radiation (IR). IR is of a wavelength that is readily absorbed by surfaces designed to function as radiation emitters. It is practical to therefore "choose radiator locations and spacecraft attitude to minimize radiator views to the lunar surface, when possible [...] . <b>pointing</b> the <b>radiator</b> towards the sun to some extent, to minimize its view to the lunar surface, is frequently preferable. (Clawson 2002) " Additionally, the amount of direct solar radiation, lunar IR and albedo an orbiting satellite receives varies from one side of the moon to the other as the moon blocks the sun from view. This environment produces large temperature variations in a satellite's instrumentation, control electronics and propulsion systems which must be understood to characterize operating temperature envelopes...|$|R
