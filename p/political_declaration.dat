5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a <b>political</b> <b>declaration</b> or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

25|$|Lithuania {{declared}} {{independence from}} the former Russian Empire on February 16, 1918. In March the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and renounced any claims to the Baltic states, including Lithuania. Ober Ost, the German occupying authority, did not allow Lithuania to establish government institutions, organize military or police forces, or attempt to define its borders. Lithuanian independence remained a largely unrealized <b>political</b> <b>declaration.</b> That changed when Germany surrendered in November 1918. Lithuanians hurriedly adopted a provisional constitution, formed a government, and started organizing an army.|$|E
500|$|Kościuszko {{gathered}} {{an army of}} some 6,000, including 4,000 {{regular soldiers}} and 2,000 recruits, and marched on Warsaw. The Russians succeeded in organizing an army to oppose him more quickly than he had expected, but he scored a victory at Racławice on April 4, 1794, where he turned the tide by personally leading an infantry charge of peasant volunteers (kosynierzy, scythemen). Nonetheless, this Russian defeat was not strategically significant, and the Russian forces quickly forced Kościuszko to retreat toward Kraków. Near Połaniec he received reinforcements and met with other Uprising leaders (Kołłątaj, Potocki); at Połaniec he issued a major <b>political</b> <b>declaration</b> of the Uprising, the Proclamation of Połaniec. The declaration stated that serfs were entitled to civil rights and reduced their work obligations (corvée). [...] Meanwhile, the Russians set a bounty for Kościuszko's capture, [...] "dead or alive".|$|E

The key to this success story is Koizumi’s {{relentless}} focus on structural reform, with two objectives: breaking the structural trap of political constituencies defending old and unproductive economic sectors; and adopting a two-pronged macro-micro approach to make reform unavoidable. This paper argues that Europe should follow a similar strategy whereby financial market integration, and not the EU bureaucracy and grandiose <b>political</b> <b>declarations,</b> should be the main driving force of national economic reforms, pressuring liberalisation in goods and services markets and making labour market reforms unavoidable...|$|R

Political discourse is characterized by rich figurative language which is distinguished for its stylistic power and informal register. Focusing on the use of similes, metaphors, and informal language, this paper shows how certain aspects of communication are affected by translation and their interpretation to the public by the political parties based on their political interests...|$|R

50|$|The East German {{leadership}} quickly {{developed a}} two-pronged approach {{which became a}} permanent feature of the regime’s Kirchenpolitik. On the one hand, they made use of the repressive and surveillance tactics to induce obedience and compliance with their unilateral decrees. On the other hand, they also practised a policy of conciliation, attempting to lure the churches, and particularly their leaders, into affirming their loyalty to the regime or making public <b>political</b> <b>declarations</b> which could serve the regime’s search for legitimacy {{both at home and}} abroad. But the main aim remained to marginalize the churches and finally to hasten their decline.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} two-step {{approach}} of assessing whether major donors {{of foreign aid}} have met recent demands for less proliferated and better coordinated aid efforts. First, we calculate Theil indices revealing the concentration of each donor’s aid on recipient countries and specific aid sectors. Second, we map overlaps of aid from different donors and over time to analyze the degree of coordination. Our results point to a wide and persistent gap between the rhetoric of <b>political</b> <b>declarations</b> and the donors’ actual aid allocation during the period 1995 - 2006. Few donors have specialized on a limited set of recipients and aid sectors, and coordination has remained elusive...|$|R
