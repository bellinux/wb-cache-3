5|$|Each {{submarine}} is {{fitted with}} a CK043 search periscope and CH093 attack periscope. The <b>periscopes</b> were manufactured by Pilkington Optronics (now Thales Optronics), and experienced several problems early in the submarines' service lives.|$|E
5|$|The <b>periscopes</b> {{also had}} {{problems}} with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The <b>periscopes</b> were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E
5|$|The <b>periscopes</b> had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and {{turbulence}} to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine <b>periscopes</b> included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and <b>periscopes</b> from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1918, the new {{commander}} of the Austrian fleet, Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy decided to conduct another attack on the Otranto Barrage, similar to the Otranto Raid from December 1916, to allow more German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats to safely get through the heavily defended strait of Otranto. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen. Tegetthoff and her sister ship , along with one destroyer and six torpedo boats departed Pola on 9 June. At about 3:15 {{on the morning of}} 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the Austrian fleet steaming south. The MAS platoon was commanded by Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo while the individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed the battleship. Despite missing Tegetthoff, the other boat, MAS 15, managed to hit Tegetthoffs sister ship Szent István with her torpedoes at about 3:25am. Both boats were then chased away from the scene by Austrian escort vessels. Immediately following the attack, Tegetthoff thought that the torpedoes were fired by submarines instead of MAS boats and pulled out of the formation of battleships and destroyers and began to zigzag to throw off any more possible submarine attacks. She continually fired on suspected submarine <b>periscopes</b> until she rejoined Szent István at 4:45.|$|E

50|$|The Gundlach <b>Periscope,</b> usually known {{under its}} British {{designation}} as Vickers Tank <b>Periscope</b> MK.IV, was a revolutionary invention by Polish engineer Rudolf Gundlach, manufactured for Polish 7TP tanks since end of 1935 and patented in 1936 as Gundlach Peryskop obrotowy. It {{was the first}} device to allow the tank commander to have a 360-degree view from his turret with a single <b>periscope.</b> By rotating the <b>periscope</b> and allowing the tank commander to look backwards through the second eyepiece, {{he no longer had}} to change position to look behind the turret. Early tanks had small turrets and fixed seating, without an independently rotating cupola, and so the commander wasn't easily able to move himself to another rear-facing <b>periscope.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} earlier optical <b>periscopes</b> {{required}} them to penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control room to be located directly below the sail/fin. Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.|$|E
25|$|Germany, {{which was}} {{provided}} 27 months to finish delivery of its goods, procrastinated {{as long as}} possible on deliveries.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the Oberons in Canadian service had become {{obsolete}} {{and were in}} need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979. In an effort to take the subs from anti-submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, <b>periscopes,</b> communications and fire-control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mark 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.|$|E
25|$|The new turret seats the gunner on {{the left}} hand side of the main gun. On top of the turret there's one single piece {{circular}} hatch opening to the front.

Another gunner's sight is located {{on the left}} hand side of the main gun and moves in vertical planes along with it. It is a high angle of fire sight used when the gunner is aiming at air targets. The vehicle also has additional <b>periscopes</b> that provide it with vision on the sides. A white searchlight is mounted in front of the turret.|$|E
25|$|Following U-175s {{arrival at}} Lorient, the crew {{received}} three weeks leave. In {{order to maintain}} a skeleton crew remaining behind, this was taken in shifts. During this time the boat was in the dry dock within the Scorff Shelter submarine pen. She stayed there for two days while her equipment was tested, then transferred to the Keroman shelter where the more extensive work was undertaken. This involved the removal and replacement {{of one of the}} <b>periscopes,</b> rebuilding the compressors, and overhauling the electric motors. The boat also received a Metox radar detector. By the end of November, the boat conducted short sea trials and was declared ready to undertake its next patrol.|$|E
50|$|A {{photonics}} mast (or optronics mast) is {{a sensor}} on a submarine which functions similarly to a <b>periscope</b> without requiring a <b>periscope</b> tube, thus freeing design space during construction and limiting risks of water leakage {{in the event}} of damage.
