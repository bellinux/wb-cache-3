500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, <b>putting</b> <b>things</b> in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. [...] On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is legendary}} that the university's Senate, {{accepting}} {{that it could}} not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of [...] "Moral and Political Philosophy" [...] to which Alan Stout was appointed. This purpose was not achieved, as Anderson continued to lecture on ethics and politics. Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who [...] "brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for <b>putting</b> <b>things</b> simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'.|$|E
