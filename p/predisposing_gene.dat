40|$|Background Multiple meningiomas {{occur in}} < 10 % of meningioma patients. Their {{development}} {{may be caused}} by the presence of a predisposing germline mutation in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2) gene. The <b>predisposing</b> <b>gene</b> in patients with non-NF 2 associated multiple meningiomas remains to be identified. Recently, SMARCB 1 was reported to be a potential <b>predisposing</b> <b>gene</b> for multiple meningiomas in a family with schwannomatosis and multiple meningiomas. However, involvement of this gene {{in the development of the}} meningiomas was not demonstrated. Results Five affected members of a large family with multiple meningiomas were investigated for the presence of mutations in SMARCB 1 and NF 2. A missense mutation was identified in exon 2 of SMARCB 1 as the causative germline mutation predisposing to multiple meningiomas; furthermore, it was demonstrated that, in accordance with the two-hit hypothesis for tumourigenesis, the mutant allele was retained and the wild-type allele lost in all four investigated meningiomas. In addition, independent somatically acquired NF 2 mutations were identified in two meningiomas of one patient with concomitant losses of the wild-type NF 2 allele. Conclusion It is concluded that, analogous to the genetic events in a subset of schwannomatosis associated schwannomas, a four-hit mechanism of tumour suppressor gene inactivation, involving SMARCB 1 and NF 2, might be operative in familial multiple meningiomas associated meningioma...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, several new genes {{have been found}} to be {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, particularly genes encoding the subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx <b>genes).</b> Currently, 10 <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified and the proportion of patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma harbouring a mutation in one of these genes is about 20 to 30 %. The identification of mutations in these <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> is of interest, as well for the family (genetic counselling) as for the patient him/herself (for instance, SDHB mutations are associated with an increased risk of recurrence and malignity). Genetic screening is clearly indicated in case of early diagnosis (before 45 years old), positive family history, suspicion of a syndromic form, or extra-adrenal, multifocal or malignant presentation. Due to the loose genotype-phenotype correlation and, on the other hand, the prognostic implication of the identification of a mutation in one of the known <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes,</b> many experts recommend performing genetic screening in every patient diagnosed with pheochromocytoma. In the near future, immunohistochemistry of SDHx genes, search for somatic mutations within the tumour and identification of specific gene expression profiles (microarrays) are likely to play an increasing role in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of pheochromocytoma...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether whole-exome sequencing {{may serve as}} an efficient method to identify known or novel colorectal cancer (CRC) <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> in early-onset or familial CRC cases. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 23 Chinese patients from 21 families with non-polyposis CRC diagnosed at </= 40 years of age, or from multiple affected CRC families with at least 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC at </= 55 years of age. Genomic DNA from blood was enriched for exome sequences using the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit, version 2 (Agilent Technologies) and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Data were processed through an analytical pipeline to search for rare germline variants in known or novel CRC <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes.</b> RESULTS: In total, 32 germline variants in 23 genes were identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In 6 of the 21 families (29 %), we identified 7 mutations in 3 known CRC <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> including MLH 1 (5 patients), MSH 2 (1 patient), and MUTYH (biallelic, 1 patient), five of which were reported as pathogenic. In the remaining 15 families, we identified 20 rare and novel potentially deleterious variants in 19 genes, six of which were truncating mutations. One previously unreported variant identified in a conserved region of EIF 2 AK 4 (p. Glu 738 _Asp 739 insArgArg) was found to represent a local Chinese variant, which was significantly enriched in our early-onset CRC patient cohort compared to a control cohort of 100 healthy Chinese individuals scored negative by colonoscopy (33. 3 % vs 7 %, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Whole-exome sequencing of early-onset or familial CRC cases serves as an efficient method to identify known and potential pathogenic variants in established and novel candidate CRC <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β (TGFβ) is {{important}} in maintaining self-tolerance and inhibits T cell reactivity. We show that CD 8 ⁺ T cells that lack the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn 22, a major <b>predisposing</b> <b>gene</b> for autoimmune disease, are resistant to the suppressive effects of TGFβ. Resistance to TGFβ suppression, while disadvantageous in autoimmunity, helps Ptpn 22 ‾/‾ T cells to be intrinsically superior at clearing established tumors that secrete TGFβ. Mechanistically, loss of Ptpn 22 increases the capacity of T cells to produce IL- 2, which overcomes TGFβ-mediated suppression. These data suggest that a viable strategy to improve anti-tumor adoptive cell therapy may be to engineer tumor-restricted T cells with mutations identified as risk factors for autoimmunity...|$|E

In this review, we propose an overlook of major lessons learned from 15 years of research in the field of genetics and obesity. We comment on the existence of the genetic continuum between monogenic and polygenic forms of obesity that pinpoints the role of genes involved in the central regulation of food intake and genetic predisposition to obesity. We explain how the identification of novel obesity <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> has clarified unsuspected biological pathways involved in the control of energy balance that have helped to understand past human history and to explore causality in epidemiology.

40|$|Major discoveries {{have been}} {{obtained}} within the last decade {{in the field of}} hereditary predisposition to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Among them, the identification of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR 2) as the major <b>predisposing</b> <b>gene</b> and activin A receptor type II-like kinase- 1 (ACVRL 1, also known as ALK 1) as the major gene when PAH is associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The mutation detection rate for the known genes is approximately 75 % in familial PAH, but the mutation shortfall remains unexplained even after careful molecular investigation of these genes. To identify additional genetic variants predisposing to PAH, investigators harnessed the power of next-generation sequencing to successfully identify additional genes that will be described in this report. Furthermore, common genetic predisposing factors for PAH can be identified by genome-wide association studies and are detailed in this paper. The careful study of families and routine genetic diagnosis facilitated natural history studies based on large registries of PAH patients to be set up in different countries. These longitudinal or cross-sectional studies permitted the clinical characterization of PAH in mutation carriers to be accurately described. The availability of molecular genetic diagnosis has opened up a new field for patient care, including genetic counseling for a severe disease, taking into account that the major <b>predisposing</b> <b>gene</b> has a highly variable penetrance between families. Molecular information can be drawn from the genomic study of affected tissues in PAH, in particular, pulmonary vascular tissues and cells, to gain insight into the mechanisms leading {{to the development of the}} disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a {{cumulative}} term {{applied to a}} clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neoplasms {{that occur in the}} bowel. Based on twin studies, up to 45 % of the CRC cases may involve a heritable component. Yet, only in 5 - 10 % of these cases high-penetrant germline mutations are found (e. g. mutations in APC and DNA mismatch repair genes) that result in a familial aggregation and/or an early onset of the disease. Genome-wide association studies have revealed that another ~ 5 % of the CRC cases may be explained by {{a cumulative}} effect of low-penetrant risk factors. Recent attempts to identify novel genetic factors using whole exome and whole genome sequencing has proven to be difficult since the remaining, yet to be discovered, high penetrant CRC <b>predisposing</b> <b>genes</b> appear to be rare.
