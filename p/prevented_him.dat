5|$|Though {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} goalkeepers of his era, he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's {{legislative}} districts chose an elector, {{and these}} electors voted {{to choose the}} governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector cast his vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from voting for himself, but his political acumen <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists {{that this was the}} case, however.|$|E

5|$|However, Balfour's need {{to liaise}} with the 2nd Duke of Westminster, {{who had just}} {{inherited}} the Grosvenor Estate, <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from joining his force when they travelled to South Africa {{at the end of}} 1899. He remained in command of the London Scottish until 1900, when he resigned in protest at financial controls that prevented payments to volunteers if there was an insufficient number of raised troops.|$|E

Bohemond sought assistance from Amalric of Jerusalem, and their united army defeated Mleh, also {{forcing him to}} restore the towns of the Cilician plains to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond's relationship with Armenian Cilicia remained tense, which <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> from pursuing an active foreign policy until Mleh was dethroned in 1175.|$|E

5|$|William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796â€“ January 28, 1859) was an American {{historian}} and Hispanist, who is widely recognized by historiographers {{to have been}} the first American scientific historian.

Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and <b>prevented</b> <b>him.</b> Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
