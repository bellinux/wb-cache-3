The poll {{is the first}} to specifically target developing countries and ask a comprehensive set of questions regarding climate policy. The poll aims to a) provide the public in developing countries with an avenue to make their voices heard in a debate often dominated by developed countries‘ views, and b) provide decision makers with a tool to assess the state of public views on climate change in their countries. Various World Bank departments contributed to the design of the poll. 1 The polling was conducted among 15, 518 respondents in 16 nations— Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, Senegal, Turkey, the United States, and Vietnam. The surveys were carried out by WorldPublicOpinion. org, a collaborative project involving research centers from around the world, managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland. The margins of error for each country range from +/- 3 to 4 percentage points. The surveys were conducted across the different nations between September and December 2009.

Objective From July to August 2014, Epilepsia {{conducted}} an online survey seeking opinions that explained {{the discrepancy between}} the incidence and prevalence of epilepsy in lower income countries. Data on cumulative incidence suggest a higher rate of active epilepsy than reported in lifetime prevalence surveys. This study reports the findings of that <b>poll</b> <b>addressing</b> the proposal in our Controversy in Epilepsy series that it could be from increased death rates. Methods The survey consisted of a question addressing possible reasons to explain {{the discrepancy between the}} incidence and prevalence of epilepsy. Another four questions addressed demographic information. Results There were 34 responders who completed the survey. Half (50 %) of the responders felt that the discrepancy between cumulative incidence and lifetime prevalence was due to lack of uniform definitions and misclassification of patients in study design, 23. 5 % said the discrepancy was due to a higher mortality from diseases and conditions such as trauma and infections associated with epilepsy, 23. 5 % indicated that the stigma of epilepsy prevented people from acknowledging their disease in prevalence surveys, and 2. 9 % felt it was from poor access to qualified medical personal and utilization of medical treatments that increased death rates directly related to epilepsy. Significance Within the limitations of sample size, the results of this survey support that the discrepancy between the incidence and prevalence of epilepsy in lower income regions of the world is due to problems in acquiring the data and stigma rather than higher mortality from diseases associated with epilepsy and repeated seizures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{cadastral}} map and the Key-register Large Scale Topography (BGT) of the Netherlands. The two maps are different because of its history, its purpose and its registry holders. Yet, the BGT is often used {{as a tool for}} referencing the cadastral boundaries with the surrounded topography. If the maps are used together there is change that dissimilarities occur where lines are expected to coincide. In the past there was a large scale fine tuning of both maps called project ‘kaartverbetering’. But over time the amount of differences increases, due to unmatched workflows. A <b>poll</b> <b>addressed</b> to the BGT registry holders indicates {{that they are willing to}} cooperate with Kadaster to create more consistency between both maps. They can offer local knowledge of cadastral map and the BGT, but they can also supply test areas of which they know the hard topography has a high geometric accuracy. If the same area in the cadastral map is of lower quality it can be used to for an update. The other poll send to the users of the cadastral map, indicated that dissimilarities between the two maps ensures annoyances. Furthermore, between the different user groups is a varied demand for geometric accuracy. Eventually there is a clear need for more clarity around the cadastral map and this can be offered after a necessary internal check-up at Kadaster. If the (measuring) details and quality features of the map are clear, cooperation can be sought with the BGT registry holders for enduring cooperation for pursuing consistency between the both maps. Thereby attention should be paid for the image Kadaster has through its acts in history...|$|R

In the political domain people learn about prevailing public opinion via ubiquitous polls, which may produce a bandwagon effect.

Consequently, polls can become self-fulfilling prophecies whereby majorities, whether in support of candidates or policies, grow in a cascading manner. Despite increased attention to whether the measurement of public opinion can itself affect public opinion, the existing empirical literature is surprisingly limited on the bandwagon effects of <b>polls.</b> To <b>address</b> this gap, we conducted an experiment on a diverse national sample in which we randomly assigned people to receive information about different levels of support for three public policies.
