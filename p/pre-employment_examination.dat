40|$|Background Many {{employers}} and other stakeholders believe that health examinations of job applicants prevent occupational diseases and sickness absence. This is an update {{of the original}} Cochrane review (Mahmud 2010). Objectives To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} pre-employment examinations of job applicants in preventing occupational injury, disease and sick leave compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PEDro (up to 31 March 2015). We did not impose any restrictions on date, language or publication type. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time-series (ITS) studies of health examinations to prevent occupational diseases and injuries in job applicants in comparison to no intervention or alternative interventions. Data collection and analysis All five review authors independently selected studies from the updated search for inclusion. We retrieved two new studies with the updated search from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2015, resulting in a total of eleven studies. Main results We included two RCTs, seven CBA studies and two ITS studies. Nine studies with 7820 participants evaluated the screening process of pre-employment examinations as a whole, and two studies with 2164 participants evaluated the measures to mitigate the risks found following the screening process. The studies were too heterogeneous for statistical pooling of results. We rated the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as very low quality. The two new CBA studies both used historical controls and both had a high risk of bias. Of those studies that evaluated the screening process, there is very low quality evidence based on one RCT that a general examination for light duty work may not reduce the risk for sick leave (mean difference (MD) - 0. 09, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 47 to 0. 29). For army recruits, there is very low quality evidence based on one CBA study that there is a positive effect on fitness for duty after 12 months follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0. 40, 95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 85). We found inconsistent evidence of an effect of job-focused pre-employment examinations on the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in comparison with general or no <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> based on one RCT with high risk of bias, and four CBA studies. There is very low quality evidence based on one ITS study that incorporation of a bronchial challenge test may decrease occupational asthma (trend change - 2. 6, 95 % CI - 3. 6 to - 1. 5) compared to a general <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> with lung function tests. Pre-employment examinations may also result in a rejection of the applicant for the new job. In six studies, the rates of rejecting job applicants increased because of the studied examinations, on average, from 2 % to 35 %, but not in one study. There is very low quality evidence based on two CBA studies that risk mitigation among applicants considered not fit for work at the <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> may result in a similar risk of work-related musculoskeletal injury during follow-up compared to workers considered fit for work at the health examination. Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence that a general examination for light duty work may not reduce the risk for sick leave, but may {{have a positive effect on}} fitness for duty for army recruits after 12 months follow-up. There is inconsistent evidence of an effect of job-focused pre-employment examinations on the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in comparison with general or no <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination.</b> There is very low quality evidence that incorporation of a bronchial challenge test may decrease occupational asthma compared to a general <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> with lung function tests. Pre-employment examinations may result in an increase of rejecting job applicants in six out of seven studies. Risk mitigation based on the result of pre-employment examinations may be effective in reducing an increased risk for occupational injuries based on very low quality evidence. This evidence supports the current policy to restrict pre-employment examinations to only job-specific examinations. Better quality evaluation studies on pre-employment examinations are necessary, including the evaluation of the benefits of risk mitigation, given the effect on health and on the financial situation for those employees who do not pass the <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination...</b>|$|E

Data collection and analysis Four review authors (NM, ML, JV, ES) independently selected studies, extracted data, and determined study quality. The studies were too heterogeneous for statistical pooling of results. Main results We included two RCTs, five CBA studies and two ITS. Seven studies with 5872 participants evaluated the screening process of <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examinations</b> and two studies with 2164 participants evaluated the measures to mitigate the risks found following the screening process. Of those studies that evaluated the screening process, one study found that a general examination did not reduce sick leave (Mean Difference - 0. 1 95 % CI - 0. 5 to 0. 3) but another study found that a more task focused examination did (MD - 36 95 % CI - 68. 3 to - 3. 8). One study found that incorporation of a bronchial challenge test decreased occupational asthma (trend change - 2. 6 95 % CI - 3. 6 to - 1. 5). Three studies that included functional capacity evaluation found contradictory effects on injury rates and number of medical visits. The rates of rejecting job applicants varied from 2 % to 35 %. Neither of the two studies that evaluated risk mitigation found an increased injury rate after training or work accommodations had been implemented. We rated the evidence for all outcomes as very low quality.

40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} cause of sickness absence and disability in the working population, and the <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> should insure that worker's state of health is compatible with the requirements of proposed job. This paper summarizes the main recommendations of the good practice guidelines of the French Society of Occupational Medicine for <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> in workers exposed to manual handling of loads apart from pre-employment test. METHODS: The recommendations were developed according to the Clinical Practice Guidelines proposed by the French National Health Authority and based on a systematic search of the literature 1990 - 2012 in several databases. The guidelines were written and reviewed by two multidisciplinary committees. On the basis of the level of evidence in the literature, the proposed guidelines are classified as grade A, B, C or expert consensus. RESULTS: The main recommendations of these guidelines are as follows: (1) medical contraindications alone should not exclude employment in a job associated with a low back risk {{on the basis of a}} history of "simple" nonspecific LBP; (2) the relevance of examining a previous history of LBP, which is the best predictor of future LBP due to the recurrent nature of LBP. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines correspond to a constant concern with prevention of occupational risk. Primarily intended for occupational physicians, they are also intended for general practitioners who carry out pre-employment examinations in many countries and are likely to be increasingly faced with this type of situation because of the combination of increasing work constraints with ageing of the workforce. </p...|$|E

40|$|I {{read with}} great {{interest}} the paper of Mclouglin and Jenkins [1]. They address a vital issue in clinical aviation medicine, and conclude that {{the current system of}} <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examination</b> is of limited value. I would like to add some remarks from my personal point of view. The Royal Air Force is in a privileged position if they can obtain a general practitioner report for applicants prior to training to confirm the medical history. For legal reasons, this is impossible in Germany, possibly leading to a devaluation of the initial examination. For future changes in the content and frequency of aircrew periodic medical examinations, two points of view should be considered: the aero medical community should establish a consensus (like the 1 % rule) for the amount of medical risk that can be accepted for aviation safety. If the magnitude of the acceptable risk is known and clear, <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations</b> can be tailored to detect that risk. A second important issue would be a consensus on the acceptable amount of false-positive findings obtained in the <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations.</b> Since the prevalence of any disorder in the flying community is presumed to be low, the positive predictive value of any test will be low. In the normal care-giving medical situation, the a priori probability for the target disorder can be determined by history and physical examination. As the authors have outlined, withholding of information cannot be ruled out in the aircrew examination, thus necessitating the use of screening tests in the pre-employment medical exam-ination without clinical indication...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> is {{considered}} to be an important practice and is commonly performed in several countries within the European Union. The benefits of medical surveillance programmes are not generally accepted and their structure is often inconsistent. The aim of this review was to evaluate, {{on the basis of the}} available literature, the usefulness of medical screening and surveillance. MEDLINE was searched from its inception up to March 2010. Retrieved literature was evaluated in a peer-review process and relevant data was collected following a systematic extraction schema. Pre-placement screening identifies subjects who are at an increased risk for developing work-related allergic disease, but pre-employment screening is too low to be used as exclusion criteria. Medical surveillance programmes can identify workers who have, or who are developing, work-related asthma. These programmes can also be used to avoid worsening of symptoms by implementing preventive measures. A combination of different tools within the surveillance programme, adjusted for the risk of the individual worker, improves the predictive value. Medical surveillance programmes provide medical as well as socioeconomic benefits. However, pre-employment screening cannot be used to exclude workers. They may act as a starting point for surveillance strategies. A stratified approach can increase the effectiveness and reduce the costs for such programmes...|$|E

40|$|Aim. As pre-employment {{screening}} and selection is a main {{function in the}} protection of susceptible applicants from developing an occupational disease, we need insight into {{the effectiveness of this}} intervention under different exposure conditions. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of three indicators {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examinations.</b> Method. We used a pre-employment medical evaluation table to gather the data needed for the indicators for effectiveness. The first indicator chosen is the predictive value of a positive test result (PPV) corresponding to the percentage of applicants who will develop an occupational disease after a positive test result. The second indicator is the number of <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations</b> needed to reduce the number of new cases of an occupational disease by one (number needed to test, NNT). The third is the number of rejections for the job, as the consequence of a positive test result, needed to reduce the number of new cases of an occupational disease by one (number needed to reject, NNR). To illustrate feasibility and usefulness, we used the example of potroom asthma in the primary-aluminium industry. We used data on personal risk factors and on the incidence of potroom asthma from a nested case-control study in the Netherlands. Results. The three indicators for effectiveness could be applied. For high incidence rates, defined as 0. 04 (40 cases/ 1, 000 employees per year), the PPV values for personal risk indicators varied from 5 % to 27 %. The NNT varied from 116 to 667. Finally, the NNR varied from 4 to 20. For low incidence rates, defined as 0. 005 (5 cases/ 1, 000 employees per year), the PPV values were low (0. 6 % to 5 %). The NNT were high (1, 111 to 5, 000). The NNR varied from 23 to 155. Conclusion. The three indicators for effectiveness are applicable under the condition of the availability of relevant empirical data. The indicators provided useful information for the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific tests, which might be added as selection criteria. The personal risk factors studied were far from effective as selection instruments, especially in situations where a low incidence of potroom asthma exists. Personal risk factors at the pre-employment stage should not be added to the standard procedure to select susceptible applicants. Under conditions, they may be taken into account in a workers' health surveillance programme. As a contribution to evidence-based occupational medicine, we recommend the use of the pre-employment medical evaluation table and the three chosen indicators for effectiveness as a standard tool to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examination...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Mandatory medical reports {{can be used}} to {{evaluate}} the scope of activity of occupational health services (OHS), including the number and kind of services. Material and Methods: The analysis comprised data for the period 1997 â 2014, derived from mandatory reports MZ- 35 A submitted by OHS units. Results: During the analyzed period the number of occupational medicine physicians decreased from 8507 to 6741, while the number of OHS units â responsible for prophylactic care â increased from 4967 to 6261. In the years under report 3, 961 million mandatory health check-ups were performed, of which 99. 3 % resulted in issuing fitness for work certificates. <b>Pre-employment</b> <b>examinations</b> made 38. 8 %, while periodical ones â 52. 8 % and control ones â 6. 7 % of all check-ups.

We have formulated five specific questions in this thesis:. Which risk indicators can be identified in aluminium potroom workers who developed asthma? Did preventive measures such as exposure reduction and the introduction of the histamine provocation test as a pre-employment selection instrument result in lower incidence of potroom asthma or a longer latency time between starting employment and the occurrence of potroom asthma?

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} nature and extent of {{evaluation}} research in occupational health services (OHSs). METHODS: Literature review of evaluation research in OHSs. On the basis of a conceptual model of OHS evaluation, empirical studies are categorised into aspects of input, process, output, outcome, and OHS core activities. RESULTS: Many methods to evaluate OHSs or OHS activities exist, depending on the objective and object of evaluation. The amount of empirical studies on evaluation of OHSs or OHS activities that met the non-restrictive inclusion criteria, was remarkably limited. Most of the 52 studies were more descriptive than evaluative. The methodological quality of most studies was not high. A differentiated picture of the evidence of effectiveness of OHSs arises. Occupational health consultations and occupational rehabilitation are hardly studied despite much time spent on the consultation by occupational physicians in most countries. The lack of effectiveness and efficiency of the <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examination</b> should lead to its abandonment as a means of selection of personnel by OHSs. Periodic health monitoring or surveillance, and education on occupational health hazards can be carried out with reasonable process quality. Identification and evaluation of occupational health hazards by a workplace survey can be done with a high output quality, which, however, does not guarantee a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Although rigorous study designs are not always applicable or feasible in daily practice, much more effort should be directed at the scientific evaluation of OHSs and OHS instruments. To develop evidence-based occupational health care the quality of evaluation studies should be improved. In particular, process and outcome of consultation and rehabilitation activities of occupational physicians need to be studied more...|$|E

With reference to the political discussion about prognostic medical research, the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection has on assignment investigated what kind of questions and types of medical-diagnostic tests are being used during <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examinations,</b> life-insurance examinations and disability insurance examinations at this moment and in the near future. Furthermore, the prognostic value of the questions/tests {{with respect to the}} purpose of the examinations is reviewed and conclusions are drawn about which questions/tests can, from a scientific point of view, be used meaningful in these examinations. The study is done by means of literature-search and consultation of experts. In the examinations, a multitude of questions and tests is being used, of which a selection has been discussed. A distinction has been made between the validity/predictive value of a question/test and the prognostic value of information about a risk factor/disease towards the purpose of the examinations. The prognostic value of questions and tests, used in the examinations, is strongly dependent on the predicted endpoint; suitability for a job, risk of industrial disability or mortality-risk. The prognostic value is therefore depending on both the specific question or test and the type of examination. In the last chapter of this report, conclusions have been drawn separately for each type of examination. Subsequently, some draw-backs of the study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{occupational health}} service {{in this country}} was that established in a cotton spinning factory at Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire. The mill was built in 1784 by Samuel Greg and his partners. They employed local labour and also some parish apprentices. Happily, Samuel Greg was a good christian and, having created a modern factory and a model village with a church and a school, he was equally concerned for the physical welfare of his employees. Accordingly, he appointed a doctor to make <b>pre-employment</b> <b>examinations</b> of the apprentices and to visit regularly {{to deal with the}} health problems of a community of some 400 people. The man he chose was Peter Holland of Sandlebridge, who had served his medical apprenticeship under Dr Charles White of Manchester. The first record of the employment of a doctor was in 1796, but from 1804 to 1845 (doubtless in response to the early factory legislation) each visit of the doctor was entered in a day book with either an indication of fitness to work or details of the treatment required. The complete record consists of two hardback foolscap notebooks that provide a fascinating insight into the medical practice of the times when the industrial revolution was just getting under way. One of the more interesting features is the preservation of medical secrecy. Dr Holland made his comments on the case in shorthand and his instructions in longhand. By a fortunate coincidence the key to the shorthand was discovered and this has now been largely transcribed. Although much of the content of the diaries is the day by day practice of medicine at the time, there are many illuminating glimpses of the early practice of occupational medicine...|$|R

If the patients do not discontinue work on pounding-up machines the vasoneurosis has a tendency to progress. I observed no spontaneous remissions. Patients who discontinued work can be divided into two groups: into reversible and irreversible cases. The first ones are, as a rule, likely to improve and become free of symptoms. Irreversible cases usually retain the objective and subjective symptoms of the disease. 1 never met with severe lesions. X-ray pictures of the joints of upper extremities yielded no. sure information on occupational lesions of joints. The capacity for work was not impaired. As the best method for preventing the vasoneuroses caused by pounding-up machines, l recommend, in addition to technical measures, the appropriate selection of workers (<b>pre-employment</b> <b>examinations,</b> periodical examinations). The duration of work should be limited to five years...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{concerned}} with obtaining evidence to explore {{the proposition that the}} provision of occupational health services as arranged at the present time represents a misallocation of resources. The research has been undertaken within the occupational health service of a large Midlands food factory. As the research progressed it became evident that questions were being raised about the nature and scope of occupational health as well as the contribution, in combating danger at work, that occupational health services can make to the health and safety team. These questions have been scrutinized in depth, as they are clearly important, and a resolution of the problem of the definition of occupational health has been proposed. I have taken the approach of attempting to identify specific objectives or benefits of occupational health activities so {{that it is possible to}} assess how far these objectives are being achieved. I have looked at three aspects of occupational health; audiometry, physiotherapy and <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations</b> as these activities embody crucial concepts which are common to all activities in an occupational health programme. A three category classification of occupational health activities is proposed such that the three activities provide examples within each category. These are called personnel therapy, personnel input screening and personnel throughput screening. I conclude that I have not shown audiometry to be cost-effective. My observations of the physiotherapy service lead me to support the suggestion that there is a decline in sickness absence rates due to physiotherapy in industry. With <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations</b> I have shown that the service is product safety oriented and that benefits are extremely difficult to identify. In regard to the three services studied, in the one factory investigated, and because of the immeasurability of certain activities, I find support for the proposition that the mix of occupational health services as provided at the present time represents a misallocation of resources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taiwan {{initiated}} a nationwide program in 1986 {{to have all}} 15 -year-old schoolgirls vaccinated against rubella and another program in 1992 to encourage all {{women of childbearing age}} to receive rubella vaccination. To assess the immunity among women after the implementation of these programs, we conduct a serosurvey. We recruited women who were 15 â 44 years old and received <b>pre-employment</b> health <b>examinations</b> at the clinic of an industrial park from January 1 to June 30, 2000. Antiârubella antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays. All 1, 087 women who fit the selection criteria agreed to participate, and the overall susceptible (seronegative) rate was 5. 7 %. The susceptible rate was much lower among women who were covered by both programs than women who were not (4 % versus 23 %, P < 0. 001). The nationwide vaccination programs were effective, but a substantial proportion of childbear-ing-age women were still susceptible and need booster vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Definition of {{back pain}} {{is one of}} the main {{problems}} associated with epidemiological studies of back pain which is generally acknowledged to be a disabling but not fatal condition. Certainly the sickness absence attributable to it is substantial though one can argue inter-minably about the exact number of days lost per thousand men at work, principally because of poor certification and lack of agreement on definition. Some personal characteristics such as age, weight, and structural defects of the spinal column do seem to predispose to back pain. Apart from the rather blunt instrument of secondary prevention either by <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examination</b> or by routine screen-ing during employment (particularly of those doing heavy work) it is doubtful if any preventive measures can be undertaken in relation to these factors. This doubt is accentuated because past experience has shown that specificity of screening tests in relation to them is of a very low order (Kosiak et al., 1966; 1968) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that <b>pre-employment</b> radiographic <b>examination</b> provides information which permits identification of individuals who are likely to develop symptoms of lumbar pain under the stress of physical labour, the study reported was undertaken. Two groups of male labourers of minimum age 35 years were matched for important variables, and differentiated by the circumstance that one group alone had the additional characteristic of a positive history of lumbar disability. Study of the radiographs of these subjects allowed tabulation of all deviations from normal, both minor and major. A computerized comparative analysis was performed on the data. It was found that there is no developmental or degenerative change or combination of such changes which has predictive value when applied to the individual. Therefore, since this examination provides no legitimate criteria for prognostication, the hypothesis as stated is invalid, and the worth of the policy of pre-employment assessment is open to serious question...|$|R

40|$|The law {{including}} legislation {{such as the}} Occupational Health 2 Ì 6 Safety Act 1983 imposes stringent obligations on {{employers to}} ensure {{the health and safety}} of their employees. The use of <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examinations</b> is one tool that employers can use to assess the suitability of a job applicant for a particular position and protect themselves from prosecution or claims for compensation or damages. At the same time, however, legislation such as The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Commonwealth) (2 Ì 2 DDA 2 Ì 2) and The Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (New South Wales) (2 Ì 2 ADA 2 Ì 2) affords protection to individuals against discrimination.

40|$|Background- Danish {{seafarers}} have {{an excess}} of life style related diseases where obesity may be a factor. Obesity may in itself be a safety issue at sea. Objectives â The purpose was to study overweight among male seafarers and determine the consequences if a maximum Body Mass Index (BMI) for seafarers is decided. Methods- As part of the mandatory <b>pre-employment</b> health <b>examination,</b> height and weight of the seafarers are recorded and BMI calculated. From a register comprising all seafarers, basic information on each individual seafarer {{was obtained from the}} last employment period before the health examination. In this study, normal weight is defined as a BMI from 20 and up to 25, moderate overweight from 25 up to 30 and obesity from 30 and above. Results â The study comprised 1 257 male seafarers. There were statistically significant more overweight seafarers in all age groups compared to a reference group ashore. Among those between 45 and 66 years of age 0. 7 % had a weight below normal...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{provide a}} {{polygraph}} primer for police psychologists involved {{in law enforcement}} personnel selection. Law-enforcement <b>pre-employment</b> polygraph <b>examinations</b> are a decision-support tool intended to add incremental validity to the personnel selection process. Problems stemming {{from the use of}} the polygraph may be related to misunderstanding of the polygraph test and to field practices surrounding the use of polygraphy in the police selection process. Potential problems can result from ineffective selection of test issues, poorly constructed test questions and misguided policies surrounding the use of the polygraph. The authors review the history of polygraph screening, research, and field practices, and suggest that using polygraph results alone to disqualify a candidate from employment is a misguided field practice. Suggestions are offered for maximizing the decision-support value of the polygraph. Polygraph examination targets are discussed, with emphasis on selecting actuarially derived predictors associated with increased success in law enforcement training and job performance. The authors provide recommendations for field practice, and propose that police psychologists may be most suited to effectively integrate the polygraph results and information into the hiring recommendation process...|$|R
40|$|In a {{questionnaire}} survey {{the prevalence of}} back pain in 163 helicopter pilots was compared {{to that in a}} control group of 297 non-flying air force officers who underwent the same <b>pre-employment</b> medical <b>examination.</b> Since pilots document their hours of flight in a personal flight log, an accurate estimate of the duration of exposure could be made. In addition, vibration levels of the helicopters were measured and an accumulative vibration dose was calculated for each pilot. 'Transient' back pain of a short duration was more frequent amongst the pilots compared to the control group, and the prevalence of 'chronic' back pain of a persistent nature was also higher amongst the helicopter pilots. Transient back pain seemed to be most strongly related to the average hours of flight per day, whereas chronic back pain was more closely related to total hours of flight or the accumulative vibration dose. A significant higher prevalence of this chronic back pain was observed only after 2000 hours of flight or a vibration dose of 400 m 2 h/s 4. The observed health effects may be due to vibration or constrained posture but are most likely due to concomitant exposure to both factor...|$|R
