40|$|Compares the {{approach}} to disclosure-based regulation of securities markets in Bangladesh with that of India and Malaysia. Describes the present administration of the disclosure regime in Bangladesh, which is split between the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies (RJSC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); this mirrors {{the two sets of}} laws involved, company law and securities law respectively. Outlines the basic regulatory functions of securities law enforcement: the ability of investors to seek remedies against the infringements of disclosure requirements and the efficiency of the SEC in dispensing justice, and finds that both are weak in Bangladesh. Suggests that more effective regulation in Bangladesh is necessary and that the SEC should be free from government and other interference. Argues that preventive measures should for this reason be the preferred policy; these include investor education and regulatory verification before <b>prospectus</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{detecting}} {{hot and cold}} IPO cycles in the Chinese A-share market using a Markov regime switching model. We introduce a set of observations to measure IPO activities, which include numbers of IPOs issued, levels of underpricing, market conditions and duration time from prospectus and listing, and thus establish a model to estimate these activities' average performance in hot and cold periods respectively. It is found that a hot period is related with an abundant supply of IPOs, high levels of underpricing, positive market conditions and short waiting time to listing after <b>prospectus</b> <b>issue.</b> Further, this paper depicts the turning points of hot and cold periods across the period from 1994 to 2005 for each observation. The cycles detected {{by the number of}} IPOs per month are the benchmark and then these cycles' robustness is tested by the other observations.

One in 10 surveyed sections—scattered throughout the settlement—would be reserved for Māori who had been displaced, and the rest would be sold to raise ₤99,999, of which the company would retain 25 percent to cover its expenses.

5000|$|The tracts {{were still}} selling well by December 1795 but there {{continued}} to be distribution problems particularly in {{those parts of the}} United Kingdom more remote from London (notably Scotland and the north of England). Hannah More also began to realise that the cost of producing simultaneous editions at two different centres in England was not sustainable in the long term, and she was hearing complaints about the low level of discounts offered to the hawkers who were expected to distribute many of the copies. At the same time she was receiving requests from the wealthier supporters of the scheme for an edition printed on better quality paper in the more compact duodecimo format which might be bound into annual collected volumes. As a result the publication scheme was re-organised in January 1796, and a new <b>prospectus</b> <b>issued.</b>|$|R

Some copies of the <b>prospectus</b> <b>issued</b> in Europe, having found their way out East, were passed from hand to hand. We greatly admired the map which accompanied them for the edification of the shareholders. On it Samburan was represented as the central spot of the Eastern Hemisphere with its name engraved in enormous capitals. Heavy lines radiated from it in all directions through the tropics, figuring a mysterious and effective star--lines of influence or lines of distance, or something of that sort. Company promoters have an imagination of their own. There's no more romantic temperament on earth than the temperament of a company promoter. Engineers came out, coolies were imported, bungalows were put up on Samburan, a gallery driven into the hillside, and actually some coal got out.|$|R

They were at first intended to be accompanied by photographic reductions of the principal plates in the larger volumes; but this design has been modified by the Author's increasing desire to gather his past and present writings into a consistent body, illustrated by one series of plates, purchasable in separate parts, and numbered consecutively. Of other prefatory matter, once intended,--apologetic mostly,--the reader shall be spared the cumber: and a clear <b>prospectus</b> <b>issued</b> by the publisher of the new series of plates, as soon as they are in a state of forwardness.|$|R

50|$|Carden, later {{editor of}} the Penny Magazine, was {{apparently}} inspired by a visit to Paris's Père-Lachaise Cemetery in 1821, and saw an opportunity to replace overcrowded, insanitary church graveyards with appealing suburban cemeteries catering for the affluent middle and upper classes. His first <b>prospectus,</b> <b>issued</b> in 1825, failed, but a new committee established in February 1830, including Andrew Spottiswoode, MP for Saltash, sculptor Robert William Sievier, banker Sir John Dean Paul, Charles Broughton Bowman (first committee secretary), and architects Thomas Willson (who had previously proposed an ambitious Metropolitan Sepulchre project) and Augustus Charles Pugin, gained more financial, political and public support to fund the 'General Cemetery Company'. Public meetings were held in June and July 1830 at the Freemasons' Tavern, and Carden was elected treasurer. On 11 July 1832, the Act of Parliament establishing a 'General Cemetery Company for the interment of the Dead in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis' gained Royal Assent.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of the new <b>issue</b> <b>prospectus</b> on the London Stock Exchange from the advent of limited {{liability}} to World War II.
