5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue <b>parking</b> <b>tickets</b> directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E

Schools in Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also remained closed through January26. Side streets around the D.C. area were unplowed through January26. Through January27, Washington, D.C. police issued $1,078,000 worth of <b>parking</b> <b>tickets</b> and $65,600 in fines for vehicles parked or abandoned on snow emergency routes.

On game days, the transit {{operator}} set up special buses which {{connected with the}} SkyTrain at Renfrew Station and 29th Avenue Station. Hastings Park {{is located on the}} Trans-Canada Highway. There are 1,300 parking spaces within a ten-minute walk from the stadium site. Several of these lots are offered with season <b>parking</b> <b>tickets,</b> which for 2010 cost $300. The stadium provided a free bicycle valet service. Compared to BC Place, which is located Downtown, Empire Field offered poor public transport service.|$|E
25|$|Expired vehicle {{registrations}} may {{attract the}} attention of law enforcement, because indicators of an expired plate, such as an old or invalid sticker, give officers probable cause to lawfully initiate a traffic stop. A delinquent registration tag is often an indicator that the vehicle may be stolen, that the vehicle's owner has failed to comply with the applicable law regarding emission inspection or insurance, or that the vehicle's owner has unpaid traffic or <b>parking</b> <b>tickets.</b> Most states historically required all license plates to be replaced every few years; that practice is being abandoned by many states because of the expense of continually producing large numbers of plates. Washington stopped the practice of mandatory replacement in 2015. Maryland previously mandated that all license plates be replaced every five years (except for apportioned trailers, which were registered on an eight-year schedule), but has not done so since 1986.|$|E

While waiting for a parking officer to come remove the clamp, Homer drinks an {{excessive}} amount of crab juice from a food vendor and needs to urinate, but is afraid to leave his car behind. After several hours of holding it in, he finally goes to the restroom at the South Tower's indoor observation deck, but discovers that {{it is out of}} order and must use the one {{at the top of the}} North Tower. While he is doing that, the officer arrives at the car and, finding no one present, issues another ticket and leaves; Homer's subsequent [...] "D'oh!" [...] echoes across the city. Meanwhile, the rest of the family tours the Statue of Liberty, Little Italy, Chinatown, and the Empire State Building. Bart leaves the group to visit the offices of Mad magazine, and is in awe when he sees Alfred E. Neuman. The family attends a Broadway musical about the Betty Ford Clinic, and then takes a carriage through Central Park to where they are planning to meet Homer.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton remarked, [...] "Before , gadgets {{were not}} really a part of Bond's world." [...] Production {{designer}} Ken Adam chose the DB5 {{because it was the}} latest version of the Aston Martin (in the novel Bond drove a DB Mark III, which he considered England's most sophisticated car). The company was initially reluctant, but was finally convinced to make a product placement deal. In the script, the car was armed only with a smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving licence plate because he had been getting lots of <b>parking</b> <b>tickets,</b> while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he saw on television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, {{can be seen in the}} trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by Ben-Hurs scythed chariots, were entirely made in-studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sitting atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for Thunderball.|$|E

[...] He was formally accused of boorish and violent actions. [...] National sports media coverage of this increased already-mounting public pressure on the university to terminate Mangino's employment. [...] After a prolonged period of negotiations, the university and Mangino's attorneys agreed on the buy-out amount that was large enough to secure his quiet resignation in December 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Berry was {{a founder}} of the , which began in Camden in 2003 and became a {{national}} campaign demanding measures to stop 4×4s (or sport utility vehicles) [...] "taking over our cities". The campaign is known for its [...] "theatrical demonstrations" [...] and mock <b>parking</b> <b>tickets,</b> credited to Berry (although now adapted by numerous local groups), some 150,000 of which have been placed on 4×4 vehicles by campaigners. The group was successful in getting the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, to adopt one of its founding principles when he introduced a higher congestion charge for vehicles with high emissions. The Alliance campaigns further for greater taxes and stricter controls on advertisements for 4×4s. An international '4×4 Network' has now been founded.|$|E

In October 2003, Price appeared in an advertising campaign for the supermarket chain Kwik Save. To publicise the chain's promotion to cut the prices of their leading lines in half, Price was sawn in half by magician Peter McCahon.|$|E
