Although Fama and French (1997) conclude that COE estimates are “woefully” and “unavoidably” imprecise, the Reserve Banks require such an estimate every year. We examine several COE estimates based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and compare them using econometric and materiality criteria.

40|$|During Portuguese {{colonial rule}} biased service {{provision}} throughout the 20 th century {{resulted in a}} city that today has spatially segregated water services distinguishable along racial lines. In 1975, a newly independent Mozambique lacked the financial and human resources necessary to extend its utility network to peri-urban residents.

Donor agencies and policymakers gave {{a great deal of attention}} to large scale-private sector participation but it was unable to overcome Maputo's infrastructure challenges. Today, less than 40 percent of Maputo residents have access to the utility network. Maputo's 'other private sector' - small, informal <b>private-sector</b> <b>providers</b> (SPSP) - serve over 150, 000 residents with reliable standpipes and private connections and have contributed significantly to coverage goals. Sector planners knew less, however, about how they could contribute to future sector goals. This study aims to answer that question through a detailed analysis of their cost and price structures, investment profiles, and operating environment. (cont.) We find that Maputo's SPSPs already contribute significantly to the sector's coverage, service, and financial sustainability goals. They should be viewed as an integral part of Maputo's water delivery system and not 'a problem' like much of the literature brands them. Their operations can be made more efficient, affordable, and environmentally sustainable with the appropriate policy and business interventions. We recommend actively promoting larger SPSPs, universal metering, improved electricity supply, reducing costs associated with water pumps, and taxation and regulatory measures so ISNOs can contribute to all sector goals as planning moves forward. by Jigar D.

In assessing the role of private-sector pensions, it is common to concentrate exclusively on the issue of whether early retirement penalties or late retirement benefits are actuarially fair. We argue that this focus is unbalanced since private-sector pension arrangements have significant implications for governments' finances. When private pensions encourage early retirement, they reduce the number of people paying taxes and increase the number of people supplementing their private pensions through various forms of public support. To induce <b>private-sector</b> pension <b>providers</b> to internalize this externality, we examine two policy responses: taxing private pension receipts of early retirees, and issuing ?early retirement rights. ?

The rollout of one such diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being considered, but if Xpert is used mainly for people with HIV or high risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) {{in the public sector}}, population-level impact may be limited. We developed a model of TB transmission, care-seeking behavior, and diagnostic/treatment practices in India and explored the impact of six different rollout strategies. Providing Xpert to 40 % of public-sector patients with HIV or prior TB treatment (similar to current national strategy) reduced TB incidence by 0. 2 % (95 % uncertainty range [UR]: - 1. 4 %, 1. 7 %) and MDR-TB incidence by 2. 4 % (95 % UR: - 5. 2 %, 9. 1 %) relative to existing practice but required 2, 500 additional MDR-TB treatments and 60 four-module GeneXpert systems at maximum capacity. Further including 20 % of unselected symptomatic individuals in the public sector required 700 systems and reduced incidence by 2. 1 % (95 % UR: 0. 5 %, 3. 9 %); a similar approach involving qualified private providers (providers who have received at least some training in allopathic or non-allopathic medicine) reduced incidence by 6. 0 % (95 % UR: 3. 9 %, 7. 9 %) with similar resource outlay, but only if high treatment success was assured. Engaging 20 % of all <b>private-sector</b> <b>providers</b> (qualified and informal [providers with no formal medical training]) had the greatest impact (14. 1 % reduction, 95 % UR: 10. 6 %, 16. 9 %), but required > 2, 200 systems and reliable treatment referral. Improving referrals from informal providers for smear-based diagnosis in the public sector (without Xpert rollout) had substantially greater impact (6. 3 % reduction) than Xpert scale-up within the public sector. These findings are subject to substantial uncertainty regarding private-sector treatment patterns, patient care-seeking behavior, symptoms, and infectiousness over time; these uncertainties should be addressed by future research. The impact of new diagnostics for TB control in India depends on implementation within the complex, fragmented health-care system. Transformative strategies will require private/informal-sector engagement, adequate referral systems, improved treatment quality, and substantial resources.

40|$|The {{lack of an}} {{appropriate}} regulatory environment is a principal factor behind inadequate water and sanitation services {{in many parts of}} Latin America. Many governments recognize the need to improve cost recovery and accountability in services - and increasingly see private sector participation as a tool for improving efficiency and attracting commercial sources of investment finance. Consultants interviewed representatives of private companies that recently contended for contracts to provide water and sanitation services in four Latin American cities (Buenos Aires, Caracas, Mexico City, and Santiago). These private operators identify the regulatory conditions they look for deciding whether to participate in a bid. On the basis of the interviews, the authors identified nine conditions. (1) Specify key terms and conditions of regulation in the contract, leaving little discretionary power to the regulating authority. In particular, specify the key aspects of regulation (such as price, quantity, and quality) in the contract. (2) Spell out credible procedures for the fair resolution of disagreements about contractual or regulatory matters. (3) Carefully specify credible technical objectives which the contractor will be expected to achieve under the contract. (4) See that government tariff policies support the principle of cost recovery for water services - and that tariff adjustment formulas adequately reflect changes in costs, inflation, and the exchange rate. (5) If historical collection rates do not indicate consumers'willingness to pay for services such as tariffs that reflect the cost of service, allow an adequate period of time to phase in higher tariffs - and give the operator adequate protection from nonpayers (either the right to cut off service or recourse to another source of payment). (6) Review public works law, contract law, and accounting practices and, if necessary, amend them in advance to ensure that they accommodate and protect any long-term investments foreseen under build-own-transfer or concession-type arrangements. (7) Eliminate unnecessary and bureaucratic administrative requirements that make bidding expensive. (8) Make a contract and expected profits big enough to warrant the high fixed cost of bidding. (9) Provide the education and outreach needed to inform consumers and secure the support of labor interests. In addition, the firms interviewed said that host countries would be better able to attract <b>private-sector</b> <b>providers</b> if they: (a) used reputable outside technical, legal, and financial advisors; (b) allowed local and foreign banks that finance investments to review and comment on proposed contracts and participate in negotiations; and (c) reduced the cost of bidding for small contracts.

Methods This study estimates logistic regressions using 2, 387 client exit interviews to assess the impact of microfinance loans on perceived quality and the viability and sustainability of small, private clinics. Results The study finds perceived quality improved with loan recipients' clients being more likely to choose clinics on the basis of drug availability, fair charges, cleanliness, and confidentiality. In addition, the assessment found evidence of increased client flows, but the changes produced mixed results for sustainability with respondents being only half as likely to "always" visit a particular clinic.

40|$|Inspired by {{the best-selling}} "Reinventing Government", governments {{at all levels}} have {{decentralized}} programs and services and introduced market-based competition into operations. The goal of decentralization and privatization is to enhance civic participation and harness the market efficiencies that competition can offer. Decentralization and competition have certainly led to efficiencies and innovation. However, as Mildred Warner argues in her chapter in "Challenges for Rural America in the Twenty-First Century", many rural communities with limited resources have been overwhelmed by this new focus on market competition and decentralization. These two forces have reduced small local governments' ability to produce and deliver services, administer municipal functions, and plan and execute strategies for further development. The pressures risk exacerbating inequality between rural and urban areas as rural governments with limited means fall even farther behind wealthier communities that can compete more successfully for development, tax base, and contracts with <b>private-sector</b> service <b>providers.</b> This issue brief is a joint product of the Rural Sociological Society and the National Coalition for Rural Entrepreneurship, a collaboration of four Regional Rural Development Centers: The Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development, the Southern Rural Development Center, the North Central Regional Center for Rural Development, and the Western Rural Development Center.

40|$|The {{economic}} and political environment in which providers of health care will operate during the 1980 s {{will continue to be}} increasingly restrictive. Any private-sector organization's long-run survival depends directly on the quality of its investment decisions, broadly defined. This decision making will require three major innovations if private sector health care providers are to survive: 1) traditional biases about the economics of not-for-profit entities must be abandoned; 2) standard data, procedures, and personnel from the accounting discipline must be supplemented with information, methodologies, and people from the discipline of corporate finance; and 3) {{economic and}} fiscal risk must be measured and incorporated into both investment decisions and interactions with external regulators. Practitioners can begin to implement these innovations immediately. Although substantial literature exists developing all these concepts generally and applying them to for-profit settings, the literature purporting to treat investment decision making for <b>private-sector</b> health care <b>providers</b> is, on average, replete with conceptual error, simplistic thinking, erroneous applications, and out-of-date methodologies.

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) {{indicates}} that vulnerable industries should {{adapt to the}} increasing likelihood of extreme weather events along with slowly shifting mean annual temperatures and precipitation patterns, to prevent major damages or periods of inoperability in the future. Most articles {{in the literature on}} business management frame organizational adaptation to climate change as a private action. This makes adaptation the sole responsibility of a company, for its sole benefit, and overlooks the fact that some companies provide critical goods and services such a food, water, electricity, and medical care, that are so vital to society that even a short-term setback in operations could put public security at risk. This raises the following questions: (1) Who is responsible for climate change adaptation by private-sector suppliers of critical infrastructure? (2) How can those who are identified to be responsible, actually be held to assume their responsibility for adapting to climate change? These questions will be addressed through a comprehensive review of the literature on business management, complemented by a review of specialized literature on public management. This review leads to several conclusions. Even though tasks that formerly belonged to the state have been taken over by private companies, the state still holds ultimate responsibility in the event of failure of private-sector owned utilities, insofar as they are "critical infrastructure. " Therefore, it remains the state's responsibility to foster adaptation to climate change with appropriate action. In theory, effective ways of assuming this responsibility, while enabling critical infrastructure providers the flexibility adapt to climate change, would be to delegate adaptation to an agency, or to conduct negotiations with stakeholders. In view of this theory, Germany will be used as a case study to demonstrate how <b>private-sector</b> critical infrastructure <b>providers</b> can plan and implement climate change adaptation in practice, through the regulatory modes of "negotiations" and "enforced self-regulation. ...|$|R

To develop these guidelines, CDC used an evidence-based approach advocated by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and public health practice guidelines. The recommendations are based on evidence from all available scientific sources; where evidence is lacking, opinion of "best practices" by specialists in the field has been used. This revision was prompted by scientific and programmatic advances in HIV CTR, as well as advances in prevention and the treatment and care of HIV-infected persons. These advances include a) demonstrated efficacy of HIV prevention counseling models aimed at behavioral risk reduction; b) effective treatments for HIV infection and opportunistic infections; c) effective treatment regimens for preventing perinatal transmission; and d) new test technologies. Although the new guidelines include {{many aspects of the}} previous ones (e. g., encouragement of confidential and anonymous voluntary HIV testing, need for informed consent, and provision of HIV prevention counseling that focuses on the client's own risk), the new guidelines differ in several respects, including: giving guidance to all providers of voluntary HIV CTR in the public and private sectors; using an evidence-based approach to provide specific recommendations for CTR; underscoring the importance of early knowledge of HIV status and making testing more accessible and available; acknowledging providers' need for flexibility in implementing the guidelines, given their particular client base, setting HIV prevalence level, and available resources; recommending that CTR be targeted efficiently through risk screening and other strategies; and addressing ways to improve the quality and provision of HIV CTR.
