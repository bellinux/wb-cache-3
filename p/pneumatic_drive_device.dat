40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> linear <b>drives</b> {{are widely}} used in manufacturing, mainly for {{handling}} tasks. Due to rising interest in environmental matters and increasing energy costs, energy efficiency {{has become a major}} issue in industrial applications. There is a growing competition between <b>pneumatic</b> and electromechanical <b>drives.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>drives</b> are said to have a lower efficiency while the initial costs of electromechanical drives are higher. The operating costs of electromechanical as well as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drives</b> are induced by their exergy efficiency. The efficiency of the drives depends on parameters like cycle time, load applied to the cylinder and its acceleration and velocity.

40|$|A kind {{of hybrid}} pneumatic-piezoelectric {{flexible}} manipulator {{system has been}} presented in the paper. A hybrid driving scheme is achieved by combining of a pneumatic proportional valve based <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> and a piezoelectric actuator bonded to the flexible beam. The system dynamics models are obtained based on system identification approaches, using the established experimental system. For system identification of the flexible piezoelectric manipulator subsystem, parametric estimation methods are utilized. For the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>driven</b> system, a single global linear model is not accurate enough to describe its dynamics, due to the high nonlinearity of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>driven</b> system. Therefore, a self-organizing map (SOM) based multi-model system identification approach is used to get multiple local linear models. Then, a SOM based multi-model inverse controller and a variable damping pole-placement controller are applied to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> and piezoelectric actuator, respectively. Experiments on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>driven</b> vibration control, piezoelectric vibration control and hybrid vibration control are conducted, utilized proportional and derivative (PD) control, SOM based multi-model inverse controller, and the variable damping pole-placement controller. Experimental results demonstrate that the investigated control algorithms can improve the vibration control performance of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>driven</b> flexible piezoelectric manipulator system.

Computer integrated Manufacturing Engineering, including laser processing were applied. The workflows in the innovative drives elements, including characteristics of flow in gaps of a hinges, ferromagnetic fluid flowing and processes in pneumatic devices were researched.

40|$|Vibration {{suppression}} of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> flexible manipulator using adaptive phase adjusting controller Zhi-cheng Qiu and Zhi-li Zhao Generally, a low damping system {{has a small}} phase margin. One should {{deal with the problems}} of long time delay and unmodeled dynamics for active vibration control of a low damping system sometimes. For a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> flexible manipulator system, time delay or phase lag and unmodeled nonlinear dynamics problems have raised the level of concern. It is vital but difficult to regulate the phase of vibration controller, to compensate for the time-varying phase lag or time delay due to the gas compression and parametric uncertainty of the pneumatic control system.

A control strategy named adaptive phase adjusting control is designed and applied. The adaptive phase adjusting controller is implemented by using the phase angles as explicit parameters.

40|$|Servo {{pneumatic}} and / or hydraulic drives {{are widely}} used in modern engineering and process control. The efficiency of using <b>pneumatic</b> / hydraulic <b>drives</b> depends on their parameters and characteristics. To select the optimal drive parameters, various methods are used, based on finding the minimum of the target (target or criteria) function. The objective {{of this paper was}} to apply one crucial criterion (target function) that provides determination of optimal parameters of the <b>pneumatic</b> / hydraulic <b>drive</b> with the translational motion of the end-effector as well as its use in the synthesis of the servo pneumatic cylinder. The article shows the form of the target function representing a set of drive parameters that do not have direct relationships with each other in a dimensionless form for the <b>pneumatic</b> / hydraulic <b>drive</b> with the translational motion of the end-effector. To calculate the parameters of the servo drive close to the optimal ones, a two-criteria LPτ search was used. As criteria, were used the decisive criterion - the proposed target function, and the power developed by the actuator of the <b>pneumatic</b> / hydraulic <b>drive,</b> which were presented in a dimensionless form. It is shown that the criterion for solution optimality is the minimum distance of the selected point in the space of the normalized criteria from the origin. This point was determined. In addition to the proposed criteria, non-formalised requirements were taken into account: actual and mass-produced components of drive, in terms of which its parameters close to the optimal ones were determined, and the maximum relative error of the obtained useful power value of the servo <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> was estimated. The paper presents design features of two types of the servo <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> created, taking into account the proposed target function, implemented according to the schemes "hidden" and "spaced apart".
