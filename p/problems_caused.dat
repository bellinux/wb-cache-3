5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze <b>problems</b> <b>caused</b> by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E
5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with <b>problems</b> <b>caused</b> by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.

Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the <b>problems</b> <b>caused</b> by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She {{was one of}} the {{original}} six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy's capital ships. Chesapeake was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate but construction delays, material shortages, and budget <b>problems</b> <b>caused</b> builder Josiah Fox to alter her design to 38guns. Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2December 1799, Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi-War with France and saw service in the First Barbary War.|$|E

5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} that Britain had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply <b>problems</b> <b>caused</b> the Spanish to call off the siege at the end of June.|$|E

While construction of the Liparus set continued, the second unit headed by John Glen departed for Mount Asgard, where in July 1976 they staged the film's pre-credits sequence. Bond film veteran Willy Bogner captured the action, staged by stuntman Rick Sylvester, who earned $30,000 for the stunt. This stunt cost $500,000 – the most expensive single movie stunt at that time. Additional scenes for the pre-credits sequence were filmed in the Bernina Range in the Swiss alps.|$|E

The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. <b>Problems</b> <b>caused</b> by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
