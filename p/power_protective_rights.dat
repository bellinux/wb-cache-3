30|$|In summation, {{the model}} of the German Ethics Council first and foremost, in fact, cannot and will not set any moral impulses, which {{propagate}} a certain vision of good (or the promotion of genome-based research for the purpose of improving public health); instead, its strength however is the concentration upon the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> of the citizens, by spelling out the legal and organizational overlapping consensus and by strengthening trust in the participating institutions (Dabrock et al. 2011). By means of this procedural manner, research freedom will be strengthened in reality so that individual and public health can also benefit from it. Moreover, it enables an increased degree of <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> and control possibilities, which reduce donor inhibitions and thereby convince more people to donate specimens and to ease previous restrictions for their usage or to dispense with them completely. Simultaneously not only the interests of the collective will be kept in focus, but rather the protective requirement of each individual will be strengthened as well as an elevate transparency, an improved data security and a more frequent involvement of the ethics commissions. Moreover, there remains, of course, much scope for a plural society, to develop effective concepts of good, which include the participation in genome research without too much pressure of moral obligations.|$|R

40|$|This model {{grants to}} legislatures {{ultimate}} {{responsibility for the}} resolution of controversial rights issues {{while at the same}} time seeking to improve the rights sensitivity of the legislative process and increasing the <b>rights</b> <b>protective</b> <b>powers</b> of courts as compared with the traditional institutional form of parliamentary supremacy. Summary As an academic comparative constitutional lawyer, I come to the recent Constitutional Advisory Panel report and the issue of whether and how the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) should be reformed from a particular – perhaps idiosyncratic – perspective. This is viewing the NZBORA as an influential version of a new general model of constitutionalism. This model grants to legislatures ultimate responsibility for the resolution of controversial rights issues {{while at the same time}} seeking to improve the rights sensitivity of the legislative process and increasing the <b>rights</b> <b>protective</b> <b>powers</b> of courts as compared with the traditional institutional form of parliamentary supremacy. At least in theory and aspiration, this general model provides an alternative to both the latter, venerable form of constitutional arrangement and its conventional rival, the model of constitutional supremacy, involving a fully constitutionalised regime of supreme, entrenched law enforced by the power of one or more courts to invalidate inconsistent statutes. As an experiment, this new model seeks to create greater balance between courts and legislatures on the resolution of contested rights issues than the traditional alternatives, whilst also providing an effective regime of rights protection.  ...|$|R

In 1877 the Afghan Amir refused to accept a British Resident and in 1878 agreed a treaty with Russia granting it <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> in Afghanistan. In response, a British-led force entered the country and advanced on Kabul. After defeats at Ali Musjid and Peiwar Kotal, the Afghans sued for peace and accepted a British Resident in Kabul. After the Resident was murdered in September 1879, the war recommenced. A British-led force occupied Kabul, defeating the Afghans en route at Charasia. Fighting continued and after defeat at Maiwand, a British force were besieged in Kandahar.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to assess the role, status and scope of {{workplace}} HIV/AIDS committees as a means of effective workplace governance of the HIV/AIDS impact, and their role in extending social <b>protective</b> HIV/AIDS-related <b>rights</b> to employees. In-depth qualitative case studies were conducted in five South African small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that were actively implementing HIV/AIDS policies and programmes. Companies commonly implemented HIV/AIDS policies and programmes through a workplace committee dedicated to HIV/AIDS or a generic committee dealing with issues other than HIV/ AIDS. Management, through the human resources department and the occupational health practitioner often drove initial policy formulation, and had virtually sole control of the HIV/AIDS budget. Employee members of committees were mostly volunteers, and were often production or blue collar employees, while there was a notable lack of participation by white-collar employees, line management and trade unions. While the powers of workplace committees were largely consultative, employee committee members often managed in an indirect manner to secure and extend social <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> on HIV/AIDS to employees, and monitor their effective implementation in practice. In the interim, workplace committees represented one of the best means to facilitate more effective workplace HIV/AIDS governance. However, the increased demands on collective bargaining as a result of an anticipated rises in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality might prove to be beyond the scope of such voluntary committees in the longer term...|$|R

Yet there has been no critical examination of the effects it will have on motor vehicle insurance law. The statute governing much of the law (the Road Traffic Act 1988), along with the extra-statutory agreements providing protection for the third party victims of negligent uninsured drivers and untraced vehicles, are each profoundly influenced by EU directives. Given the Brexit decision and the resolution of the government to facilitate the UK’s exit of the Union, we argue that the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> for such victims of motor accidents are likely to be reduced.

40|$|This paper poses {{questions}} regarding the ethical prioritisation in qualitative research studies on assessing a person’s or a group’s fitness to provide informed consent, arguing that this may have unwanted as well as desirable consequences, particularly in relation to rights of citizenship for socially marginalised populations {{who tend to be}} labelled vulnerable. Drawing on three theoretical perspectives (Arendt, Honneth and Bourdieu), it is suggested that the emphasis placed on a research participant’s capacity to provide informed consent cannot be regarded solely as a protective measure for ‘vulnerable’ groups, but is also bound up with their social positioning as socially ‘deficient’ according to liberal (classical and neo-liberal) models of citizenship. Participation in a qualitative study {{can be seen as a}} dimension of the civil and human right to freedom of expression, and this can be particularly important for those labelled vulnerable as freedom of expression is a precondition for recognition and parity of status. Nevertheless, the importance of informed consent is not rejected; instead, it is posited that the <b>protective</b> <b>rights</b> accorded to vulnerable groups in qualitative research need to be considered alongside other human goods, such as the promotion of voice, agency and active citizenship...|$|R

Most of these appliances are low-power and unlicensed devices, whose uses have increased over time. The unlicensed devices share the frequency or spectrum commons authorized by the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in each country, which has established rules in order to manage the spectrum. The rules allow the user to use a device without prior authorization, but with no <b>protective</b> <b>rights.</b> Users must accept the interference generated from other users. However, these uses of devices should not cause harmful interference to licensed users. Thus, the unlicensed devices must comply with the standard before they are marketed or imported. This paper provides a chronological account of how the spectrum commons developed in the USA. A survey of the literature provides the rationale for spectrum commons and why this concept is so important. Furthermore, the debate on each spectrum assignment approach and the trend of the use of spectrum commons are described...|$|R
