40|$|Introduction. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis {{is a rare}} {{pulmonary}} disease characterized by excessive alveolar accumulation of surfactant due to defective alveolar clearance by macrophages. There {{are only a few}} published case reports of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis occurring in association with solid cancers. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously reported cases of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis associated with breast cancer. Case presentation. A 48 -year-old Asian woman, a nonsmoker, presented to our institution with a right breast mass. Biopsy examination of the lesion revealed scirrhous carcinoma. A chest computed tomography scan for metastases showed abnormal shadows in both upper lung fields. As a result of flexible fiberscopic bronchoscopy, this patient was diagnosed as having <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis. This case was categorized as autoimmune <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis due to the positive anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antibody. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis decreased gradually after mastectomy. Conclusions: The present case involved the coincident occurrence of autoimmune <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis with breast cancer; breast cancer may be a factor during <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis development...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the pathological features of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) occurring at moderate altitude in Japan, we performed routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining in lung materials from HAPE autopsied cases. We also undertook advanced immunohistochemical staining for observation of type II pneumocytes, pulmonary surfactant (PS), and mast cells in the lung of HAPE cases to examine the biological changes within the lung parenchyma. The pathological findings of HAPE were characterized by alveolar edema, congestion of <b>pulmonary</b> vessels, <b>alveolar</b> hyaline <b>membranes,</b> <b>alveolar</b> hemorrhage, and multithrombi and fibrin clots, but maintained alveolar structure. The immunostaining {{results showed that the}} type II pneumocytes were cellular fusion, deformity, and exfoliation from the walls of alveoli; the PS not only lined the alveolar surface, but was also patchily distributed within alveoli; and the number of mast cells were increased (9. 0 +/- 0. 9 cells/mm(2)) compared to that in controls (1. 1 +/- 0. 4 cells/mm(2)) (p < 0. 01). We conclude that the pathological features of HAPE at moderate altitude in Japan are similar to others reported worldwide, and that the type II pneumocytes, PS, and mast cells may contribute to some extent to pathophysiological parts in the development and progression of HAPE. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: For the {{diagnosis}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens it is normally necessary to make an ultrastructural examination. However, this {{is thought to be}} impractical for bronchoalveolar lavage specimens that have been routinely fixed in ethanol. In the present study, bronchoalveolar lavage cytology smears on slide glasses were examined directly ultrastructurally to make a diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage smears from three <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis patients were stained with Papanicolaou and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for identification of amorphous globular structures. Subsequently, they were refixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and examined ultrastructurally. RESULTS: Papanicolaou stained specimens from <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis patients contained scattered amorphous or granular globules, 20 - 50 microns in diameter, which were PAS positive. Ultrastructural examination of the globules revealed multilamellated structures, characteristic of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis, in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: In general, it is thought that the morphological diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens requires both cytological and ultrastructural examination. However, the amorphous globules evident on cytology smears proved to contain multilamellated structures so that they can themselves be used as diagnostic evidence...|$|R

40|$|To the Editor: Idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis is a {{rare disease}} in which {{surfactant}} lipids and proteins accumulate in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> macrophages and alveoli, resulting in respiratory insufficiency and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. 1 Granulocyte 9 ̆ 6 macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies occur in these patients 2 and may mediate the pathogenesis of this disease, {{but they are also}} present in healthy persons and in immune globulin prepared from plasma obtained from healthy persons. Since GM-CSF is required for surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages in mice, we hypothesized that high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies (i. e., levels sufficient to eliminate endogenous GM-CSF priming of myeloid cells) could cause idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis by impairing surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. 3 We previously found that high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies are specifically associated with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis 4 and can be isolated in pure form from these patients. 5 We administered highly purified GM-CSF autoantibodies derived from a patient with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis to healthy nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis). These autoantibodies were administered intravenously, and serum levels of 40 5 g per milliliter or more were maintained for 10 months.

We report a case of severe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis and discuss a safe and effective strategy for the anaesthetic management of patients undergoing this complex procedure. Case presentation A 34 -year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with severe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis. He developed severe respiratory failure and subsequently underwent serial whole-lung lavage. Our anaesthetic technique included the use of pre-oxygenation, complete lung separation with a left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube, one-lung ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure, appropriate ventilatory monitoring, cautious use of positional manoeuvres and single-lumen endotracheal tube exchange for short-term postoperative ventilation.

We have described a safe and effective strategy for anaesthesia for whole-lung lavage. We recommend our anaesthetic technique for patients undergoing this complex and uncommon procedure. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis is an {{extremely}} rare lung disease in animals and humans. It {{is characterized by the}} deposition of a large amount of phospholipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli. There are several possible etiologies, both congenital and acquired. Alveolar macrophages {{play an important role in}} the clearance of surfactant. This is the first report of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis in the feline species. Case presentation: <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis was diagnosed in an 8 -month-old cat with chronic tachypnea, failure to thrive and finally respiratory distress. The diagnosis was based on the milky appearance of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken under general anesthesia after bronchoscopy. Because of the worsening respiratory distress and development of anorexia the kitten was euthanized. Histopathology of the lungs showed alveoli and bronchi filled with eosinophilic material. Electron microscopy revealed lamellated intra-alveolar bodies. As the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was elevated in the serum and no autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were detected, a primary hereditary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis was suspected. The underlying cause was thought to be a dysfunction of the receptor of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, however, a mutation in the genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of this receptor has not been found. Conclusion: This is the first description of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> protienosis in a cat. This kitten is thought to have a primary hereditary <b>pulmonary</b> <b>alveolar</b> proteinosis with a possible defect in the signalling pathway of the receptor of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
