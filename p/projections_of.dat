5|$|Tuataras superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus.

The teeth are merely <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down.

5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E

5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with more emphasis on melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had less of an impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it {{was not the first time}} he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used <b>projections</b> <b>of</b> light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced the Frenchman to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Students were {{enrolled}} {{from throughout the}} city. Often the school was used to reassign students {{who could not be}} enrolled into other high schools.
