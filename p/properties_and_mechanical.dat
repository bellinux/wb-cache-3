40|$|The ultra-high {{temperature}} structural intermetallic Mo 5 Si 3 {{has been studied}} for alloy processing, physical <b>properties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mechanical</b> behavior. High purity single crystals of Mo 5 Si 3 have been synthesized by both optical floating zone and Czochralski methods. Structural, thermal, and elastic properties of Mo 5 Si 3 single crystals were measured by X-ray powder diraction, thermal mechanical analysis, and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, respectively. Results show that the thermal expansion of Mo 5 Si 3, a tetragonal structure with I 4 /mcm symmetry, is strongly anisotropic along the a and c directions with c/a= 2. 2. Single crystal elastic moduli of Mo 5 Si 3 indicate that it has less elastic anisotropy and lower shear modulus than most transition metal disilicides. The impacts of these physical properties on alloy processing and mechanical behavior are discussed.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of initial rheological <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> <b>mechanical</b> and enzymatic structure breakdown in determining selected sensory texture attributes of custards was studied. The so-called structure breakdown cell {{was used to}} characterize saliva-induced breakdown, i. e., by monitoring digestion of starch by amylase from saliva. Based on rheological parameters, some attributes could be predicted well, while others more poorly or were not predicted. Predictable attributes were primarily determined by bulk properties; poorly and nonpredictable attributes originated from properties of the outer low-viscosity surface layers or were not related to rheological properties. Both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown were important for creaminess, thickness and melting. Enzymatic breakdown was the dominant mechanism involved {{in the perception of}} fattiness, roughness and stickiness but not heterogeneity. Creaminess was the only attribute that was also determined by initial rheological <b>properties</b> <b>and</b> <b>mechanical</b> and enzymatic breakdown. Custards displaying high creaminess ratings had high initial stiffness, the structure broke down at low stress and enzymatic breakdown was slow. Microstructural organization of starch plays a dominating role in defining rheological and breakdown behavior of custards and in this way determines creaminess to a high extent. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{composition}} on the ternary (NbCr 2 –TiCr 2) C 15 phase properties has been investigated, focusing upon the defect structure, elastic <b>properties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mechanical</b> behavior. The C 15 phase field is continuous between NbCr 2 –TiCr 2, {{with a maximum}} phase field width of at least 7 at. % solubility. The defect mechanism is governed by anti-site constitutional defects for all alloys. Mechanically, the alloys display a maximum in hardness {{in the center of}} the ternary phase field (and a minimum of toughness). The ternary phase field has features that are characteristic of solid-solution strengthening mechanisms. Finally, the elastic properties indicate that the alloys become stiffer in the middle of the ternary phase field. The best compromise of properties occurs furthest from stoichiometry in the ternary phase field at the nominal composition of Nb 19 Ti 19 Cr 62. The relationships between the defect structure, elastic <b>properties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mechanical</b> response for the C 15 phases are discussed using a combination of atomic size arguments and electronic structure analyses.
