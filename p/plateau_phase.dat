5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> is {{the period}} of sexual {{excitement}} prior to orgasm. The phase is characterised by an increased circulation and heart rate in both sexes, increased sexual pleasure with increased stimulation, and further increased muscle tension. Also, respiration continues at an elevated level. Both men and women may also begin to vocalize involuntarily at this stage. Prolonged time in the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> without progression to the orgasmic phase may result in frustration if continued for too long (see orgasm control).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new mechanism {{leading to the}} formation of rational magnetization <b>plateau</b> <b>phases,</b> which is mainly due to the anharmonic spin-phonon coupling. This anharmonicity produces plateaux in the magnetization curve at unexpected values of the magnetization without explicit magnetic frustration in the Hamiltonian and without an explicit breaking of the translational symmetry. These <b>plateau</b> <b>phases</b> are accompanied by magneto-elastic deformations which are not present in the harmonic case. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{newly formed}} magnetar has been {{proposed}} as the central engine of short GRBs to explain on-going energy injection giving observed <b>plateau</b> <b>phases</b> in the X-ray lightcurves.

25|$|Orgasm is the {{conclusion}} of the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> of the sexual response cycle and is experienced by both males and females. It is accompanied by quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs. Women also experience uterine and vaginal contractions. Orgasms are often associated with other involuntary actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms {{in other areas of the}} body, and a generally euphoric sensation. Heart rate is increased even further.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Masters and Johnson {{published}} their book, several scholars criticized {{their model}} of the human sexual response cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors {{need to be taken}} into consideration. As a result, she proposed her {{model of the}} sexual response cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> begins.|$|E

500|$|The light curves for TypeII supernovae are characterised by a {{much slower}} decline than TypeI, {{on the order}} of 0.05magnitudes per day, {{excluding}} the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase.</b> The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star. [...] In the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised. [...] The majority of TypeII supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent. [...] This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in TypeI supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.|$|E
500|$|Core {{collapse}} supernovae are {{on average}} visually fainter than Type Ia supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher. In {{the case of}} supernovae, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core, initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons, followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core. [...] Around 1% of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting catastrophe, but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models. [...] Kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than Type Ia supernovae, hence the lower visual luminosity of supernovae, but energy from the de-ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> seen {{in the majority of}} core collapse supernovae.|$|E
500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and optical trap assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In optical trap experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] Optical trap experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the optical trap by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E

Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first one, some sources state that {{both men and women}} experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.|$|E
2500|$|Reducing {{the force}} of {{contraction}} of the myocardium {{is known as the}} negative inotropic effect of calcium channel blockers. Slowing down the conduction of electrical activity within the heart, by blocking the calcium channel during the <b>plateau</b> <b>phase</b> of the action potential of the heart (see: cardiac action potential), results in a negative chronotropic effect, or a lowering of heart rate. [...] This can increase the potential for heart block. [...] The negative chronotropic effects of CCBs make them a commonly used class of agents in individuals with atrial fibrillation or flutter in whom control of the heart rate is generally a goal. [...] Negative chronotropy can be beneficial when treating a variety of disease processes because [...] lower heart rates represent lower cardiac oxygen requirements.

The thermodynamic properties of the three <b>plateau</b> <b>phases</b> are probed by exploring the temperature-dependence of magnetization, specific heat, susceptibility and spin-spin correlations. No phase transitions are observed in this model. In the absence of a magnetic field, the unusual temperature dependence of the spin correlation length is obtained with 0 ≤J_b/J_a< 1, and an interesting crossover behavior between different phases at J_b/J_a= 1 is unveiled, whose dynamics can be described by the J_b/J_a-dependence of the specific heat, susceptibility and spin correlation functions. The exotic spin-spin correlation patterns that share the same special rotational symmetry as that of the Sierpiński gasket are obtained in both the 1 / 3 <b>plateau</b> disordered <b>phase</b> and the 5 / 9 plateau partially ordered ferrimagnetic phase.
