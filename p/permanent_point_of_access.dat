50|$|As {{smartphones}} are a <b>permanent</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to {{the internet}} (mostly on), they can be compromised as easily as computers with malware. A malware is a computer program that aims to harm the system in which it resides. Trojans, worms and viruses are all considered malware. A Trojan is a program {{that is on the}} smartphone and allows external users to connect discreetly. A worm is a program that reproduces on multiple computers across a network. A virus is malicious software designed to spread to other computers by inserting itself into legitimate programs and running programs in parallel. However, it must be said that the malware are far less numerous and important to smartphones as they are to computers.|$|E

40|$|Background: Integrated working between {{health and}} social care {{services}} within England has been encouraged by Government policy in the last decade, and has been argued to provide a seamless, joined up experience for service users (Department of Health 2011). One way of integrating care is through the use <b>of</b> a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to {{health and social}} care services. A single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to services has been trialled in mental health and learning disability services to improve access, and following on from policy (e. g. Department of Health 2007) and support from literature (Rogers, Entwistle & Pencheon 1998; Lovell & Richards 2000; Raine, Carter, Sensky & Black 2005) a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to health and social care for older adults has been implemented {{in parts of the}} UK. This thesis examines the implementation of one such single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access.</b> Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> and whether it had any impact upon integrated working within a county in England, UK. Methods: An ethnographic approach was taken, using a combination of methods including interviews, focus groups and observations. This was complemented by a grounded theory approach to analysis. Findings: The single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> had an adverse effect upon integration. The poor management of change and lack of communication led to issues within the single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> such as failure of IT systems and duplication. Staff became frustrated and disengaged from the process, and consequently reported feeling disempowered, retreating back to their professional 'tribes'. Conclusion: Firm conclusions about the efficacy <b>of</b> a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> with regard to its effect upon integrated working could not be reached. However, the findings suggest that clear communication, continued change management and recognition of professional culture are decisive factors when attempting to integrate health and social care. Further research into the impact <b>of</b> a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> upon integration as well as outcomes for service users is recommended...|$|R
