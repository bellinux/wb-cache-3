2500|$|The {{original}} wrestling masks {{were often}} masks {{attached to a}} top that snapped in the groin making it very uncomfortable for the people wearing it. If the masks were not attached to the top, then they were made from uncomfortable material such as brushed <b>pig</b> skin, <b>leather</b> or suede. It wasn't until a Mexican shoe maker called Antonio Martinez created a mask on request from Charro Aguayo that would become the standard for wrestling masks created since then. The basic design has not changed much over the years, consisting of four pieces of fabric sewn together to create the basic shape that covers the entire head. The mask has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth with colorful trim around the open features, this trim is known as [...] "Antifaz" [...] in Spanish. The back of the mask is open with a [...] "tongue" [...] of fabric under laces to keep it tight enough to not come off accidentally during a match. The first variation in style came when the jaw and mouth area {{was removed from the}} mask to expose the skin. [...] Other masks have solid material over the mouth, nose, eyes or all three, in the case of fabric covering the eyes a stretched fabric that is see through up-close is used.|$|R

50|$|The {{beautiful}} art {{of paint}} and the first brush speckles he made, were in the restoration of The Blue Mosque and other churches in Istanbul. There he had contacts and a very profitable experience from many professional explorers of paint art and contemporaries in the world. New viewpoints were opened to him after the visits he paid to the art galleries of Istanbul, Vienna, Belgrade and Athens. From there he brought the oil technique, oil colors, and his first creations together with his impressions. We find paintings of this artist painted on plywood, tin, silk and <b>pig</b> <b>leather.</b> He also knew the technique of murals. He also did wood models (ships) and tapestries.From where he took the basics of form and color? From our evidences {{it is clear that}} he took them from three methods: models and photography, iconography and nature. He did not study about iconography but he left proof of 15 icons in the Art Museum, Korça.|$|E
