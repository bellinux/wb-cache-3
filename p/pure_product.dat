25|$|NaHCO3 {{is mainly}} {{prepared}} by the Solvay process, which is the reaction of sodium chloride, ammonia, and carbon dioxide in water. Calcium carbonate is used {{as the source of}} CO2 and the resultant calcium oxide is used to recover the ammonia from the ammonium chloride. The product shows a low purity (75%). <b>Pure</b> <b>product</b> is obtained from sodium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide as reported in one of the following reactions. It is produced on the scale of about 100,000 tonnes/year (as of 2001).|$|E
25|$|Because {{natural gas}} is not a <b>pure</b> <b>product,</b> as the {{reservoir}} pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method {{to deal with this}} problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.|$|E
500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{wrote in}} his review that #1's was {{formatted}} the same was as other music scores and anthologies packed for the holiday shopping season. He further commented that its title should have been different and concluded, [...] "the disc reaffirms that Destiny's Child released {{some of the biggest}} R singles of the late '90s and early 2000s." [...] Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's title as only four of the singles reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. However, he praised Destiny's Child's [...] "impressive output, which includes some of the most recognizable R hits of the past bling/celly/status-obsessed five years". BBC Online's writer James Blake called the album [...] "more than decent" [...] and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, as it was released only eleven months before #1's. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell felt that it was a [...] "smart" [...] move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it [...] "has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined". Harvell finished the review by writing, [...] "you can take #1's as <b>pure</b> <b>product</b> and not feel wrong for doing so". Despite classifying its title as [...] "misleading" [...] and criticizing the new material, Houston Chronicles editor Michael D. Clark wrote the album was [...] "dolled up as beautiful and immaculate as" [...] the members of the group and included their best singles from their four studio albums.|$|E

60|$|When I was in Detroit I had the {{pleasure}} of meeting Mr. Ford, and it really was a pleasure. He is a man quite capable of views which I think silly to the point of insanity; but he is not the vulgar benevolent boss. It must be admitted that he is a millionaire; but he cannot really be convicted of being a philanthropist. He is not a man who merely wants to run people; it is rather his views that run him, and perhaps run away with him. He has a distinguished and sensitive face; he really invented things himself, unlike most men who profit by inventions; he is something of an artist and not a little of a fighter. A man of that type is always capable of being wildly wrong, especially in the sectarian atmosphere of America; and Mr. Ford has been wrong before and may be wrong now. He is chiefly known in England for a project which I think very preposterous; that of the Peace Ship, which came to Europe during the war. But he is not known in England at all in connection with a much more important campaign, which he has conducted much more recently and with much more success; a campaign against the Jews like one of the Anti-Semitic campaigns of the Continent. Now any one who knows anything of America knows exactly what the Peace Ship would be like. It was a national combination of imagination and ignorance, which has {{at least some of the}} beauty of innocence. Men living in those huge, hedgeless inland plains know nothing about frontiers or the tragedy of a fight for freedom; they know nothing of alarum and armaments or the peril of a high civilisation poised like a precious statue within reach of a mailed fist. They are accustomed to a cosmopolitan citizenship, in which men of all bloods mingle and in which men of all creeds are counted equal. Their highest moral boast is humanitarianism; their highest mental boast is enlightenment. In a word, they are the very last men in the world who would seem likely to pride themselves on a prejudice against the Jews. They have no religion in particular, except a sincere sentiment which they would call 'true Christianity,' and which specially forbids an attack on the Jews. They have a patriotism which prides itself on assimilating all types, including the Jews. Mr. Ford is a <b>pure</b> <b>product</b> of this pacific world, as was sufficiently proved by his pacifism. If a man of that sort has discovered that there is a Jewish problem, it is because there is a Jewish problem. It is certainly not because there is an Anti-Jewish prejudice. For if there had been any amount of such racial and religious prejudice, he would have been about the very last sort of man to have it. His particular part of the world would have been the very last place to produce it. We may well laugh at the Peace Ship, and its wild course and inevitable shipwreck; but remember that its very wildness was an attempt to sail as far as possible from the castle of Front-de-Boeuf. Everything that made him Anti-War should have prevented him from being Anti-Semite. We may mock him for being mad on peace; but we cannot say that he was so mad on peace that he made war on Israel.|$|E

40|$|A 360 -d {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effects of environmental conditions on storage stability of exogenous phytases. Coated and uncoated products from 3 phytase sources (Ronozyme P, OptiPhos, and Phyzyme) were stored as pure forms, in a vitamin premix, or in a vitamin and trace mineral (VTM) premix. <b>Pure</b> <b>products</b> were stored at 0, 41, 73, and 99 ºF (75 % humidity). Premixes were stored at 73 and 99 ºF. Sampling was performed on d 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, and 360. Sampling of the <b>pure</b> <b>products</b> stored at 0 and 41 ºF was discontinued after d 120 due to mold growth in the 41 ºF samples. Stability was measured as the residual phytase activity (% of initial) at each sampling point. For {{the stability of the}} pure forms, all interactive and main effects of phytase product, coating, time, and temperature of storage were significant (P < 0. 01), except for time × coating interaction. When stored at 73 ºF or less, pure phytases retained at least 91, 85, 78, and 71 % of initial phytase activity at 30, 60, 90, and 120 d of storage, respectively. However, storing <b>pure</b> <b>products</b> at 99 ºF reduced (P < 0. 01) phytase stability, with OptiPhos retaining the most (P < 0. 01) activity. Coating mitigated (P < 0. 01) the negative effects of high storage temperature for Ronozyme and OptiPhos (from d 90 onward) but not for Phyzyme. For the stability of phytase in different forms of storage, all interactive and main effects of phytase product, form, coating, time, and temperature of storage were significant (P < 0. 01). When stored at room temperature (73 ºF), retained phytase activities for a majority of the phytase sources were more than 85, 73, and 60 % of initial activity up to 180 d when stored as <b>pure</b> <b>products,</b> vitamin premixes, or VTM premixes, respectively. When stored at 99 ºF, <b>pure</b> phytase <b>products</b> had greater (P < 0. 01) retention of initial phytase activity than when phytases were mixed with the vitamin or VTM premixes. Coated phytases stored in any form had greater (P < 0. 01) activity retention than the uncoated phytases at all sampling periods. In conclusion, storage stability of commercially available phytases is affected by duration of storage, temperature, product form, coating, and phytase source. <b>Pure</b> <b>products</b> held at 73 ºF or less were the most stable. In premixes, longer storage time and higher temperature reduced phytase activity, but coating mitigated some of these negative effects...|$|R
