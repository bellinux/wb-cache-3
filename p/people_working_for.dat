5|$|During the Great Depression, {{unemployment}} exceeded 25% statewide. Southern Indiana {{was hard}} hit, and unemployment topped 50% during the worst years. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) began operations in Indiana in July 1935. By October of that year, {{the agency had}} put 74,708 Hoosiers to work. In 1940, there were still 64,700 <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> agency. The majority of these workers were employed to improve the state's infrastructure: roads, bridges, flood control projects, and water treatment plants. Some helped index collections of libraries, and artists were employed to create murals for post offices and libraries. Nearly every community had a project to work on.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{granting}} of U.S. Constitutional rights to freedmen after the American Civil War was resisted by many white Southerners. Some blamed the freedmen {{for their own}} wartime hardships, post-war economic losses, and loss {{of social and political}} privilege. During Reconstruction, freedmen and white <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> civil rights were attacked and sometimes lynched. Black voting was suppressed by violence. White Democrats regained control of state legislatures in 1876, and a national compromise resulted in the removal of federal troops from the South in 1877. In later decades, violence continued around elections until blacks were disfranchised by the states across the South from 1890 to 1908.|$|E
25|$|The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) {{has had the}} {{opportunity}} to rule in recent years on several cases involving the legitimacy of firing a person from their job due to adultery. These cases dealt with <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> religious organizations and raised the question of the balancing of the right of a person to respect for their private life (recognized in the EU) and the right of religious communities to be protected against undue interference by the State (recognized also in the EU). These situations must be analyzed with regard to their specific circumstances, in each case. The ECtHR had ruled both in favor of the religious organization (in the case of Obst) and in favor of the fired person (in the case of Schüth).|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg View {{columnist}} William Pesek said: [...] "Japan's {{corporate culture}} of denial, of ignoring problems {{and letting them}} fester, keeps running up against a globalized world that values agility, innovation and transparency. Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{a matter}} of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her {{knowledge}} or permission, and before she had a chance to formally publish the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA—so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report, and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created in order to [...] "establish contact between the different groups of <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the Council". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC.|$|E

2500|$|The new Articles 2 and 3, {{added to}} the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly {{acknowledge}} that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within {{the rest of the}} United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called [...] "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent. The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government within Northern Ireland, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the British Government in 2002 after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) allegations of spying by <b>people</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Sinn Féin at the Assembly (Stormontgate).
