40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of individual difference (ID) factors on changing pragmatic abilities among L 2 learners of English. Participants were 48 Japanese EFL students in an English-medium university in Japan. They completed a pragmatic speaking test (k= 12) that assessed their ability to produce two speech acts: requests and opinions, in high- and low-imposition situations. The measure was given three times during one academic year. Speech acts were evaluated for appropriateness and fluency. Three ID factors (proficiency, orientation towards English study, and lexical access skill) were measured, and their effects on changes in appropriateness and fluency of speech act production were assessed. Results revealed significant effects of individual factors on <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change,</b> but the effects appeared differently between appropriateness and fluency...|$|E

Having the postulates of grammaticalization as a theoretical base, we prove, through contextual analyses that explain the emerging of the adversative conjunctional use of the item, the trajectory of the change adverb > conjunction. For the analysis, we use written data of different texts from the XIII to the XX century as corpora. Moreover, we will briefly discuss the juntive “todavia” based on the studies of Sweetser (1990) about the Italian adversative tuttavia and the English anyway, showing the similarities of the Portuguese adversative with these adversatives and the importance of the metaphor to explain the process of change...|$|E

50|$|Similar to Domain Analysis, Concept Theory aims {{to create}} a theory of {{concepts}} which may be applied to Knowledge Organization systems by analyzing conceptual semantic relationships. Different theories of concepts, i.e., how users interact with information, shape interaction with information in three specific aspects: bibliometrics, information literacy, and Knowledge Organization. This theory indicates that concepts are definitions of the world created according to one’s inclinations and ideas; they cannot exist in isolation from the interests that created them. Hjørland argues that the theory is best understood through historicists and pragmatic interpretations, i.e., cultural (historical) influences on concepts best describe their meaning as well as <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> to concepts to allow humans to adapt and change certain concepts. Thus, concepts evolve with human practices.|$|R

The aim of the present article is to analyse a particular emerging use of the 2 sg pronoun tu from a corpus-based perspective. In the light of Grammaticalisation Theory, it is argued that whereas in some contexts this pronoun maintains all or part of its referential function (e. g. as subject or as a vocative, respectively), in other contexts its use is very similar to that of an emphatic pragmatic marker. Data drawn from three spoken corpora suggest that the pronoun has consolidated this new use.

40|$|CT is a {{strategy}} for traditional populations to lead their own lifestyles, independently of their degree of deculturalization {{in the face of}} the industrial urban societies hegemony and, therefore, it consists in an alternative to the consumer-materialistic lifestyle. Based on Latin American experiences, the objective of this article is to refine, or, even better, to justify the concept CT. Populations involved in these experiences, especially traditional ones, have a context of historical disadvantages. These experiences are not resumed to a new heterodox tourism alternative although they allow one to think about a new economy, the ecosocioeconomy, through a new rationality, which has been happening in domiciles, productive groups and communities, where problems and solutions occur and rarely are properly qualified. It is concluded that CT is a theory conceived from the experiences, the everyday complexities, the contradictions inherent to the <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change</b> pursued {{in the face of the}} economic utilitarianism limitations, although its implementation, many times, does not happen at the desired pace. The challenge is to preserve the communitarian logic of these experiences, without, at the same time, losing the communities' own dynamics as these get inserted into the market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} Wallage (2013) to {{demonstrate}} that pragmatic activation {{plays a role in}} two processes of grammaticalisation in early English – not only in the grammaticalisation of the negative marker not during Middle English (c. 1100 - 1500 AD), but also in the grammaticalisation of do as a tense marker in Early Modern English negative clauses (c. 1500 - 1700 AD). While competing variants are semantically equivalent, different variants are used to mark different pragmatic functions. Innovative forms tend to appear in pragmatically activated (discourse- given) propositions and older forms in inactivated (discourse-new) propositions. Logistic regression analyses of diachronic data provide a way to identify pragmatic changes in progress, and hence to ascertain what role the loss of functional constraints on a form plays in its grammaticalisation. Van der Auwera (2009), Hansen (2009) and Hansen and Visconti (2009) argue that <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change</b> precedes the grammaticalisation of the French negative marker pas. They argue this accounts for its increased use over time. However, the overall frequencies of not and do increase despite pragmatic constraints on their use remaining consistent over time. Instead, pragmatic constraints on not and do are lost at the point when the forms are grammaticalised – that is, when the competitors to not and do are lost...|$|E
40|$|While the {{political}} debate rages over whether casemix brings economic benefits for Australian health care, managers are observing a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change</b> to their business and some are using casemix to understand and manage their business better. Casemix is a useful tool in this environment of increasing management accountability and process re-engineering. This article reviews casemix from a process innovation perspective; comments on its real use for strategic health care management; and suggests a simple matrix used by St John of God hospitals throughout Australia to implement and measure progress towards quality casemix-managed hospitals. The management motivation for this matrix was to promote hospital resourcing decisions supplemented by casemix information. Casemix and the innovation ‘fanatics’ Many writers making a living from business strategy have talked about the fundamental link between innovation ‘fanatics ’ and the eventual success of product and process innovation. They are often described as ‘possessed ’ or ‘obsessed’, working towards their objectives to the exclusion even of f amily or per sonal relat ionships [...] . And their commitment allows them to persevere despite the frustrations, ambiguities and setbacks that always accompany major innovations (Quinn 1985, p 74). Why has casemix captured so many ‘converts ’ and yet taken so long to really affect Australian health care management? The process of change has been established at some larger teaching hospitals for over four years. Frontini and Richardson (1984, p 41) discuss organisational characteristics that encourage or inhibit strategic innovations. Hierarchical...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten to fifteen years, {{interest}} in diachronic linguistics and (mechanisms of) language change has been mounting. This can be seen, for instance, from the growing appeal (and attendance) of conferences on historical linguistics, or from the recent launching of two new diachronic journals, the Journal of Historical Linguistics and Language Dynamics and Change (adding to the existing ones Diachronica and Folia Linguistica Historica). It is no surprise, then, that studies {{on the history of}} English, probably the most widely studied and best documented language, have abounded as well. What may have contributed to this renewed interest in (English) diachronic linguistics is the increasing popularity of grammaticalization as a topic of research (possibly because grammaticalization offers a comprehensive perspective on language change allowing linguists to capture phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic, and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> under one rubric; cf. Hopper and Traugott 2003).

5000|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} the lexical distinction between the Mudaliyar and the Iyengar groups of the Tamil-speaking caste in India. The Iyengar group is part of the Brahmin caste which is scholarly and higher in the caste hierarchy than the non-Brahmin, or Mudaliyar, caste. The Mudaliyars use many of the same words for things that are differentiated within the Iyengars' speech. For example, as you can see below, the difference between drinking water, water in general, and non-potable water is used by one word in the non-Brahmin caste and three separate words in the Brahmin caste. Furthermore, Agha references how the use of different speech reflects a [...] "departure from a group-internal norm". For example, if the non-Brahmin caste uses Brahmin terms in their mode of speech it is seen as self-raising, where as if people within the Brahmin caste use non-Brahmin speech it is seen as pejoratives. Therefore, depending on which castes use certain words the <b>pragmatics</b> <b>change.</b> Hence, this speech system is determined by socioeconomic class and social context.|$|R

Leadership speaks to a ubiquitous, identifiable set of human activities that support and assist, par-ticularly in relation to change. Currently, changes in many things, including technology, “constitutes [sic] the most consequential set of changes in society since the late nineteenth century, when the nation went from a largely domestic, rural, agrarian mode of living to an industrial, international, and urban economy ” (Keller, 2008, Preface xi). For education “this set of circumstances is going to force all academic enterprises to rethink their place and purpose not just in philosophical terms but in very pragmatic ways as well ” (Beaudoin, 2003, p. 520). These philosophical and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> also affect leadership practice and the role of leader. Pervasive technology and notable socioeconomic restructuring have changed our society.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to surveying the present situation {{and the spread of}} the new Russian politeness phenomenon (NRP), and its evaluation and assessment by Russian native speakers in respect to the inter-cultural aspects of new Russian politeness. In terms of <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change,</b> the question is whether NRP is a short-lived linguistic fad or whether it is a thorough change in Russian pragmatic behaviour we are dealing with. The following paper is intended to show some empirical results of this survey of observations and responses relating to the spread and acceptance of politeness phenomena. Furthermore, the focus is on emotional evaluation, rational interpretation, and the spread of these phenomena into non-commercial communication domains. The informants' assessments prove remarkably heterogeneous and offer a variety of reactions, ranging from rejection and pejorative evaluation as communicative ballast to enthusiastic acceptance. The rational evaluations can be subsumed under westernisation and commercialisation of discourse - two aspects of globalisation which is seen as the implementation of forms of the free market economy. On the other hand, we also find a semantic interpretation as an expression of individualisation of discourse. It can finally be observed that while some respondents even diagnosed a decrease in politeness since its climax in the late 1990 s, a possible mixture of genuinely Russian politeness (characterised by warmth, openness, spontaneity, taking an interest in others, etc.; positive politeness, Brown & Levinson 1987) with Western non-intrusive politeness (negative politeness, Brown & Levinson 1987) was also predicted, which I regard as the most optimistic future scenario.

40|$|Charles Fowler, eminent {{advocate}} for arts education, devoted {{his career to}} the idea that music was critical to the development of young people and could positively impact schooling and society. During his 45 -year career, he served in many roles: as teacher, supervisor, professor, scholar, author, editor, consultant, and advocate. Although his contributions are prolific, this research represents the first full-scale study that considers his work as an entire body. The purpose of this dissertation is to introduce Fowler as a significant figure in the field of music education, codify the major periods of his career, identify important writings, contextualize them within their times, and review them according to his vision for music education. Utilizing historical method and content analysis, several thousand documents were examined from the Charles Fowler Papers archived at the University of Maryland, College Park. Following an introduction to Fowler and his work, four periods of his career are presented, with the two middle periods, 1964 to 1973 and 1974 to 1989 serving as the focus of the study. Selected works were chosen based on their relevance to important events in Fowler's life and their relationship to his philosophy and viewpoint. The works were analyzed and contextualized by using primary source documents, foundational texts in music education, Fowler's own commentary, and interviews with established scholars and colleagues who knew him and respected his work. Finally, these writings traced the development of Fowler's vision which advocated music education can serve as an agent of social change. Findings reveal that Fowler's initial vision was based on the seven reconstructionist objectives he outlined in his 1964 dissertation. Based on these objectives, fifteen broad themes emerged in his writings during the period of 1964 to 1989. The themes elaborate on Fowler's vision for music education and its value to society, and relate to core concepts of reform, democracy, creativity, advocacy, and social change. It is hoped that this study will serve as a catalyst to encourage others to continue research into the life and career of Charles Fowler, along with further writing about reform and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change</b> within the music education profession...|$|E
40|$|Em um {{panorama}} histórico de ensino de línguas estrangeiras (LE) podemos observar, a partir dos anos 70, uma mudança paradigmática, em que os aspectos emocionais e afetivos dos aprendizes assumem posição relevante. Ocorre tanto um deslocamento do papel do professor, que passa de centralizador, detentor e transmissor de saberes, a facilitador do processo, quanto um deslocamento do papel do aluno, que passa a ser considerado como inserido em um contexto mais amplo de ensino e que ganha a possibilidade de participação ativa no processo de aprendizagem. Nesse contexto, o sistema de crenças é então percebido como fenômeno inerente aos fatores afetivos dos professores e/ou dos aprendizes e que vai exercer influência no processo de ensino e aprendizagem sendo, portanto, de caráter relevante. Nesta pesquisa, de natureza qualitativa e base etnográfica, buscamos investigar e caracterizar as crenças de aprendizes de alemão quanto à língua e cultura-alvo, avaliar suas possíveis origens e verificar como elas podem ser compreendidas pelo professor no processo de ensino/aprendizagem de LE. Para alcançar tais objetivos, buscamos respaldo teórico nos estudos das crenças (Barcelos, 2004; Vieira-Abrahão e Barcelos, 2006; Almeida Filho, 1999; Horwitz, 1999 e outros), nos pressupostos da interculturalidade no ensino de línguas estrangeiras e da compreensão do que é estranho (fremd) (Wierlacher, 1998, Weinrich, 1998, Kramsch, 1993 e outros), focalizando principalmente o conceito de competência intercultural (Volkmann, 2002, Weier, 2002, Byram, 2000 e outros), entendendo-o como caminho capaz de fornecer subsídios teóricos para a compreensão de nossas questões. Pretendemos contribuir com esta pesquisa para um melhor entendimento desse construto (crenças), o qual vem sendo intensamente pesquisado no campo de estudo do ensino de línguas. Além disso, buscaremos fornecer a professores de alemão como LE, subsídios para reflexão acerca da prática com foco nos aprendizes e no ensino intercultural de LE. In {{a historical}} overview of foreign language (FL) teaching, a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>change</b> {{can be observed}} starting in the 1970 s, in which the emotional and affective aspects of the learners take on a relevant position. This change involves a shift {{not only in the}} teachers role, which passes from that of centralizer, retainer and transmitter of knowledge to facilitator of the process, but also in that of the student, who is now seen to be inserted into a broader learning context and who has now gained the possibility of participating actively in the learning process. In this context, the belief system is perceived as a phenomenon inherent to the affective processes of teachers and/or students, which influences the teaching and learning process and is therefore a relevant factor. In this research of a qualitative nature and ethnographic basis, we sought to investigate and characterize the beliefs of German language students concerning the language and target culture, evaluating their possible origins and how they could be understood by the teacher in the FL teaching/learning process. To achieve these objectives, we sought theoretical backing in belief studies (Barcelos, 2004; Vieira-Abrahão & Barcelos, 2006; Almeida Filho, 1999; Horwitz, 1999 and others) and in assumptions of the interculturality of foreign language teaching and of the understanding of what is foreign (fremd) (Wierlacher, 1998; Weinrich, 1998; Kramsch, 1993; and others). We focused primarily on the concept of intercultural competence (Volkmann, 2002; Weier, 2002; Byram, 2000; and others), seeing {{it as a way to}} provide theoretical underpinnings to understand these issues. With this research, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of this construct (beliefs), which has been intensively investigated in the field of language teaching studies. In addition, we aim to provide teachers of German as a FL with critical reflections focusing on learners and on FL teaching as an intercultural practice...|$|E
40|$|The 74 th Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA) {{enacted in}} 1993 gave urban local governments consti-tutional status and aimed to {{strengthen}} municipal governance.

In drawing up these recommendations, the paper analyses two broad sources, namely the policy environments for local government in post-Apartheid South Africa and post-democracy Brazil.

Additionally, they are widely recognized as having innovated in many aspects of the policy framework for local government and service delivery.

40|$|Banking on {{intrinsic}} generative {{assumptions of}} cognitive semantics, {{this paper is}} a humble attempt that specifically sheds light on some major aspects of overtly intricate yet covertly systematic interaction that steers our conceptual processing of inherent semantic and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes.</b> The basic premises of such cognitive operations stem from yet may exceed the limitations of Elizabeth Traugott’s and Eve Sweetser’s historical pragmatic approach that elaborately envisages such lexical changes as meaning relations with their metaphorically polysemous progress in light of relevant epistemic constraints that can help us decode ambiguous components of some functional and lexical categories. Therefore, this paper examines in principle how schematic lexical meaning can be cross-linguistically and cross-culturally traced, handled and perceived in order to cater for an optimal matrix and some rule-governed clues and rules that may explain the internal universal design and flow of semanticity and pragmaticity in charge of such linguistic behavior. The data this study exploits and explores draw on some English and Arabic representative examples that can satisfactorily exhibit an interesting well-established cognitive mechanism that can reveal the role of Homo sapiens’ encyclopedic and collective faculty vis-à-vis such word processing; the data primarily encompass the English words silly, simple, innocent and naïve {{as well as their}} Arabic counterparts...|$|R

These proposals are mostly formed as simulation models. Unfortunately, however, they do not always provide an explanation of formation changes. A wide variety of simulation tools have become available, e. g.

Mathematics has developed the concept of differentiation. Economics has developed the concept of marginality. Technical-economic design has yet to develop an equivalent methodology. This paper discusses an,alternative approach that uses the phenomenon of change, and provides a way from professional knowledge, which {{can be seen as a}} purer kind of information, to a more dynamic computing model (a simulation model that interprets changes as method). The validation of changes, as a result for use in managerial decision making, and condition for managerial decision making, can thus be improved...|$|R

Comparing each of the cooperative maxims with the communicative parameters of the present-day discourse the author discovers in it frequent violations of the Cooperation principles suggested by P.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{similarities and differences}} {{in the evolution of}} both standard clause negation and n-word negation in French and Italian. The two languages differ saliently in the extent to which standard negation features postverbal markers. We suggest that a convergence of phonetic, prosodic, morphosyntactic, and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> in the evolution of French may explain why the grammaticalization of the postverbal marker is significantly more advanced in that language. Two types of n-word negation must be considered: (i) those where the n-word occurs postverbally, and (ii) those where an n-word is positioned preverbally. In the former type, French allows deletion of the preverbal marker, whereas Italian does so to a much lesser extent. In the second type, French allows (indeed, normatively demands) insertion of a second preverbal negative marker, whereas Italian does not. We suggest that this is attributable to the respective positive vs negative etymologies of the n-words. In type (i) constructions, this etymological difference appears to make Italian a negative-concord language from the outset. In contrast, negative concord in Modern French has, to a large extent, developed gradually out of what was originally a reinforcement of standard negation by positive items with scalar properties. Our analysis suggests that the pace and form of grammaticalization cannot be attributed to any single cause, but is rather the result of a confluence of formal and functional factors...|$|R

Given the need for operational, structural and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> in the Brazilian Federal Higher Education Institutions (IFES – Instituições Federais de Ensino Superior in Portuguese) to deal with the internationalization demands, and the significant number of executive secretariat professionals who, over the last decade, have worked in university management, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate if the executive secretary has competencies that enable him/her to contribute to the internationalization management in the IFES. We developed a bibliographical and documentary research, of which first stage consisted in surveying the necessary competencies for the internationalization management, while the second was based on the identification of the executive secretariat professional competencies, especially those related to the university management context. We organized a comparative conceptual framework of these two dimensions, which allowed to visualize a theoretical relation between them.

Formatted syntactically as or-alternatives, these can perform the actions both of warning and threatening. But they make a 'bad' course of action contiguous to the child's turn. We argue that adults choose this format because the interactional preference for contiguity makes the negative alternative the more salient one. This implies that adults attribute to children the ability to appreciate the flouting of preference organisation for deontic effect...|$|R

Twitter offers companies an influential environment in which to enhance their reputation and build rapport with existing and potential clients. One important aspect of the emerging customer care discourse is the apologies made by companies via Twitter in response to customer complaints. The analysis focuses on 1183 apologies, and considers their distinctive components (the Illocutionary Force Indicating Device, Explanations, Offers of Repair (Blum-Kulka et al., 1989)) and their rapport building potential (as indicated through opening and closing moves, such as greetings, nominations, discourse markers and emoticons) as a form of image repair (Benoit, 1995) shaped by the media affordances of Twitter (Hutchby, 2001). Corporate apologies are distinctive for their relatively infrequent use of Explanations (as a form of mitigation) and their comparatively greater use of Offers of Repair (as a type of corrective action), which are typically combined with follow up moves such as imperatives and questions. They are also distinctive in their repeated, somewhat formulaic use of greetings and signatures which did not appear in the apologies posted by ordinary Twitter members. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|This is an ethnographic case-study of {{research}} and development practices taking place in an interdisciplinary project between education and computer sciences. The Ensemble-project, part of the Technology Enhanced Learning programme (2008 - 12), has studied case-based learning in a number of diverse settings in Higher Education, working to develop semantic technologies for supporting that learning. Focussing on one of the six research settings, the discipline of archaeology, the current study has had three purposes. By opening up to scrutiny the practices {{of research}} and development, it has firstly sought to understand how a shared research question is answered in practice when divergent research approaches are brought to bear upon it. Secondly, the study has followed the emergence of a piece of semantic technology through these practices. The third aim has been to assess {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in studying unfolding, open-ended processes in real time. Through critical ethnographic participation, multiple ethnographic research methods, and by drawing on ANT as theoretical practice, the study has shown the precarious and unpredictable nature {{of research and}} development work, the political nature of research methods and how multiple realities can be produced using them, and the need for technology development to flexibly respond to changing circumstances. We have also seen the mutual adoption and extension of practices by the two strands of the project into each others’ domains, and how interdisciplinary tensions resolved, while they did not disappear, through <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> within the project. The study contributes to the interdisciplinary fields of Science and Technology Studies (STS) where studies on the ‘soft sciences’, such as education, are few, and a new field of Studies in Social Science and Humanities (SSH) which is emerging alongside and from within the STS. Interdisciplinary endeavours between fields pertaining largely to the natural and the social sciences respectively have not been studied commonly within either field...|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{exposition}} of Elementary <b>Pragmatic</b> Model about <b>changes</b> in dyadic interactions, {{the validity and}} clinical usefulness of the model was evaluated with a newly created test, called SISCI-Sentences. This test is composed of 90 Sentences with strong psychological impact. Administration of this test to non-clinical and clinical participants produced {{statistically significant differences between}} the choices of participants in the two groups. Implications of these results for the use of these Sentences in the course of psychotherapy are discussed...|$|R

On 16 August 1910, {{he was sent}} to study agriculture at Cornell University in the U.S. In 1912 he changed his major to philosophy and literature. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he went to study philosophy at Columbia University, where he was greatly influenced by his professor, John Dewey. Hu became Dewey's translator and a lifelong advocate of <b>pragmatic</b> evolutionary <b>change,</b> helping Dewey in his 1919-1921 lectures series in China. He returned to lecture in Peking University. During his tenure there, he received support from Chen Duxiu, editor of the influential journal New Youth, quickly gaining much attention and influence. Hu soon became one of the leading and influential intellectuals during the May Fourth Movement and later the New Culture Movement.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{freedom of}} {{religion}} is important for faith leaders in Australia and also in Europe, the United States {{and other parts of}} the world. My study aims to explore how the church and state relationship in contemporary Australia has been influenced by constitutional, legal and historical arrangements. My focus is on the spheres of education, the law and legal system as these are the most common areas of church-state contention. I argue that <b>pragmatic</b> <b>changes</b> to the church and state relationship are increasingly recognising the value of religious freedom but not always protecting it as an existing human right. My data comprise a sample of nineteenth and twentieth century newspaper articles, interviews with Australian faith leaders, public submissions received from two national consultations and six court cases, all from Australia. My study is a contribution to existing scholarship on the church and state relationship in contemporary Australia. My study found that from European settlement to the twenty-first century the church and state relationship has been characterised by four different arrangements: establishment, plural establishment, liberal separationism, and pragmatic pluralism. Australia has no overriding legal or policy principle to guide state limitations on {{freedom of religion}}. State neutrality as an aspirational goal is not fully realised in contemporary Australia, as state neutrality can be used as a vehicle to discriminate against some or all faith groups. Against a backdrop of increasing religious diversity, the aspirational goal towards state neutrality is not just an academic question but an every-day reality that has consequences for Australia and Australians. Two recommendations are made. First, that a range of stakeholders from faith leaders to policy makers and academics convene a national forum with a view to reaching agreement on an overarching church-state framework that can accommodate the growth of religious diversity in contemporary Australia. Second, that as part of these national discussions, the government considers the need to reconceptualise the principles and institutions of liberal democracy that are important for accommodating religious diversity...|$|R
