40|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) is {{a useful}} method for quantification of protein aggregates because of its high throughput capacity and highly quantitative performance. One {{of the problems in}} this method concerns polysorbates, which are well-known additives for protein-containing products to prevent protein aggregation, but frequently interfere with the photometric detection of protein aggregates. We developed a new SEC method that can separate polysorbates from protein sample solutions in an on-line mode with a <b>precolumn</b> with size exclusion and reversed-phase mixed modes. The <b>precolumn</b> can effectively trap polysorbates in aqueous mobile phase, and the trapped polysorbates are easily eluted with acetonitrile-containing aqueous mobile phase to clean the <b>precolumn.</b> Small parts of protein aggregates may be also trapped on the <b>precolumn</b> depending on temperature and proteins. Setting appropriate column temperature can minimize such inconvenient trapping of aggregates...|$|E

An automatic column switching method is used for on-line micropreconcentration and microLC-MS-MS (mass spectrometry) analysis of bradykinin and its metabolites in plasma. Both preconcentration (PC) and analytical columns were filled with C 18 reversed phase due to the failure of anion exchange <b>precolumns</b> to retain bradykinins. The detection limit for bradykinin in water was 10 pmol/L (2 fmols on column) and a good linearity was found in the range 5 - 2000 fmols. In plasma, detection limit was 50 pmol/L (25 μL injected) with a linear response in the 100 - 2000 pmol/L range. Important rules for stable work were: (1) Cleaning the PC column after every run with pure acetonitrile (ACN) to eliminate organic matrix components; (2) to trap the more apolar organic matrix components on the analytical column to prevent their elution to the MS entrance; and (3) to set the electrospray needle to an off-axis position to prevent accumulation of contaminants in the MS entrance. By using this setup, other procedures to reduce the organic load to the MS entrance such as the heart-cutting of the peaks eluting from the LC column were not required. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Sample volumes up to 1. 0 mL were focused on the <b>precolumn,</b> prior to column switching and temperature programming. The low back pressure of the <b>precolumn</b> allowed a sample loading flow rate of 250 µL/min. The mass limit of detection of the method was on average 1. 3 ng.

40|$|Maximizing {{performance}} {{when using}} real-world samples and small volume, high sensitivity columns which degrade the native chromatographic separation is a challenge. Loss in column performance {{is due to}} <b>precolumn</b> dispersion and volume overload. In this work a series of methods based on novel instrumentation and sound theory is presented to improve a chromatographic result for such samples in both isocratic and gradient elution modes. An approach called temperature-assisted solute focusing (TASF) was developed to improve sample focusing or preconcentration. TASF is designed to address <b>precolumn</b> dispersion in capillary scale LC. Volume overload is a common form of <b>precolumn</b> dispersion and degrades LC performance. TASF works by relying on the temperature dependence of solute retention and high power thermoelectric or Peltier elements (TECs) to actively heat/cool a short segment of the column near its inlet during sample loading. Cooling {{the head of the}} column transiently increases retention for solutes during injection, improving focusing and solving the volume overload problem. Following focusing rapid heating decreases retention releasing the compressed injection band to the downstream portion of the column. The TASF approach was assessed using a series of three instruments with well characterized solutes developing it into a robust platform capable of routine, unattended use. Three models for solvent-based on-column focusing in isocratic elution were experimentally investigated. Solvent-based on-column focusing is a well-known method to increase concentration sensitivity and combat <b>precolumn</b> dispersion by injecting samples made in weak elution solvents. Additionally, solvent-based focusing occurs naturally as a consequence of increased solute retention in the sample solvent and a step gradient generated by the difference between sample and mobile phase composition. Finally, a simple graphical method for rapid chromatographic optimization was developed. This plot was designed specifically to assist practitioners to determine experimental conditions to achieve a desired column efficiency or peak capacity in a defined time in both isocratic and gradient elution modes...|$|E

The residue is reconstituted by adding 500 pL of a mixture of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 2. 2) and acetonitrile (70 : 30, v/v). The sample is then directly introduced into the column-switching column. The <b>precolumn</b> is first washed with phosphate buffer at pH 7. 2. Compounds retained on the <b>precolumn</b> are then eluted in the back-flush mode and separated on a C 8 semi-microcolumn (Lichrospher select B, 125 × 3 mm). The BZD studied are determined by a diode-array detector at 254 nm. The method shows excellent linearity between 25 and 1000 ng/mL for clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and midazolam and between 25 and 5000 ng/mt for diazepam and oxazepam. The recoveries are around 80 % for clonazepam and oxazepam and around 90 % for the three others. Coefficients of variation for between-day and within-day assays are < 15 % for low concentrations close to the limit of quantitation and < 5 % for high concentration...|$|E

On-line trace enrichment of 100 ml of sample on a PLRP-S <b>precolumn</b> allows the {{determination of}} most pesticides at levels between 0. 2 and 5 μg...|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for the on-line extraction of a digested protein in a gel spot. The extract obtained was on-line {{transferred to a}} <b>precolumn,</b> used to desalinate and preconcentrate the sample. The <b>precolumn</b> was switched in-line with an LC-ESI-MS system to separate the digest products prior to detection. By using this approach sample losses were minimized and the sample was quantitatively transferred. The benefits of the system were shown for the in-gel tryptic digest of several model proteins. Using this system, the sensitivity was 13 -fold increased compared to the off-line extraction of in-gel digest products leading to a higher sequence coverage and thus a better identification potential. Also, the within day repeatability was a factor 2. 5 improvement using the on-line procedure compared to the off-line extraction procedure. © 2005 Friedr. Vieweg & Sohn/GWV Fachverlage GmbH...|$|E
40|$|An on-line {{dialysis}} solid-phase extraction gas chromatographic (GC) {{approach has}} been developed for the determination of drugs in plasma, using some benzodiazepines as model compounds. Clean-up is based on performing the dialysis of 100 μl samples for 7 min using water as acceptor phase and trapping the diffused analytes on a PLRP-S copolymer <b>precolumn.</b> After drying of the <b>precolumn</b> with nitrogen for 15 min, the analytes are desorbed with ethyl acetate (275 μl) and injected on-line into the GC system via a loop- type interface. The system provides a very efficient clean-up, and offers the possibility of adding chemical agents which can help to reduce drug protein binding and, thus, increase sensitivity. To demonstrate {{the potential of the}} described approach, the determination of benzodiazepines in plasma at their therapeutical levels is used as an example with flame ionization, thermionic and mass-selective detection...|$|E

40|$|A {{system is}} {{presented}} that allows direct introduction of large vols. of CH 2 Cl 2 in capillary gas chromatog. (GC) using the electron capture detector (ECD). The system {{is based on}} a 2 -dimensional (1 -oven) GC instrument equipped with a programmed temp. injector. During sample introduction, the solvent is eliminated via the split line. Residual traces of CH 2 Cl 2 that enter the <b>precolumn</b> are eliminated via a column-switching device located between the <b>precolumn</b> and the anal. column. The system is used for the anal. for pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in CH 2 Cl 2 at ultra low concns. The introduction of large sample vols. significantly improved the detection limits. Using the system described here, the solvent exchange step, normally necessary when the ECD is used to analyze samples contg. CH 2 Cl 2 as the solvent, is no longer require...|$|E
40|$|A simple method, {{based on}} the {{technique}} of capillary column switching-back flushing, has been developed for the detailed analysis of aromatic compounds in gasoline. The sample was first separated on a 30 -m long OV- 2330 polar <b>precolumn</b> and then backflushed onto a nonpolar analytical column. The early eluting components from the <b>precolumn</b> and the components of interest (aromatic compounds plus heavier compounds) eluting from the analytical column are all directed to the same flame ionization detection system through a T piece, which permits the quantitative analysis of aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline by a normalization method using correcting factors. The switching time window of the method is +/- 5 s, resulting in easier operation and higher reliability. The reproducibility of the quantitative analysis was {{less than or equal}} to 3 % RSD for real gasoline samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} direct {{determination}} of DL-tetrahydropalmatine (DL-THP) in Corydalis yanhusuo, a traditional Chinese herb, by L-THP imprinted monolithic <b>precolumn</b> on-line/off-line coupling with reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was developed. The L-THP imprinted monolithic column has been prepared by in situ polymerization using methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) as functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively. With the optimization of chromatographic conditions, such as mobile phase composition, flow rate, column temperature and sample loading, for {{the separation of}} enantiomer, DL-THP was base-line separated on the MIP. The imprinted monolithic column {{was used as a}} <b>precolumn</b> for fractionation of the C. yanhusuo extract. Both the non-retained and retained fractions were separated by RP-HPLC. Meanwhile, the D-THP and L-THP can be detected in the non-retained and retained fractions, respectively. Additionally, direct determination of L-THP using molecularly imprinted monolith on-line coupling with a reversed-phase column was acquired. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
