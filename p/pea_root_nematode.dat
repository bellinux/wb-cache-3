Low populations of the northern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) were also present. Tylenchorhynchus spp. and Paratylenchus spp. were recovered frequently from soil in the root zone, and Helicotylenchus spp. were also frequent, but in low numbers.

Root rot was rated as severe in all fields and was positively and significantly correlated (P ≤ 0. 05) with densities of Tylenchorhynchus spp. in soil and with incidence of F. solani in pea tissue.

40|$|During nodule {{development}} on <b>pea</b> <b>roots,</b> apoplast undergoes changes in activity of plant cell wall proteins such as expansins (EXPs). Because {{the accumulation of}} EXP protein has been correlated {{with the growth of}} various plant organs, we investigated using Western Blot and immunolocalization studies with antibody against PsEXP 1, whether this protein was accumulated in the expanding cells of nodule.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in <b>pea</b> <b>roots</b> grown {{in a medium}} with a low oxygen concentration was compared with that in nitrogen-fixing <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules induced by Rhizobium bacteria. The results show that during microaerobiosis the expression of eight genes is increased. None of these belong {{to the group of}} genes earlier identified as nodulin genes. On the other hand, no enhanced transcription of microaerobic genes can be detected during nodule development and hybridizations of Northern blots, containing nodule RNA and RNA isolated from oxygen-stressed roots, show that the alcohol dehydrogenase genes are not expressed at a higher level in <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules whereas a higher expression is observed during microaerobiosis. From these observations it can be concluded that it is unlikely that a low concentration of free oxygen induces the expression of nodulin genes. Furthermore, genes that are activated as a result of oxygen deficiency are not expressed in <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules, indicating that if the concentration of free oxygen is low the nodule cells do not suffer under microaerobic conditions.

This form of attachment, designated as cap formation, was dependent on the incubation pH and growth phase, with optimal attachment at pH 7. 5 and with bacteria in the early stationary phase of growth. Addition of glucose to the growth medium delayed the initiation of the stationary phase and cap formation, suggesting a correlation between cap formation and carbon limitation. Attachment of R. leguminosarum was not inhibited by pea lectin haptens which makes it unlikely that lectins are involved under the tested conditions. Moreover, heterologous fast-growing rhizobia adhered equally well to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips.

There {{was no significant difference between}} the EM treatments, water or water + molasses. There was a highly significant difference in infection levels between the three zoospore inoculum levels. Previous trials with composts have indicated that the presence of Acremonium spp., Fusarium spp., and Paecilomyces spp. improved disease suppression in the composts while Penicillium spp. increased disease development. This may have a bearing on the failure of EM to control <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> rot. Control of damping off in organic production systems is difficult, due to the prohibition of synthetic fungicides. A successful biological control agent would be of considerable benefit for organic agriculture. A trial was set up to evaluate the potential of EM for control of damping off in lettuce. Soil, with a history of high levels of damping off, from the Biological Husbandry Unit at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand, and a control of commercial seed raising mix was placed into 7. 5 cm pots and planted with ten lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa, cv.

The peat based seed raising compost received a water treatment and EM treatment.

Under all conditions tested, a positive correlation was observed between the percentage of fibrillated cells and the ability of these bacteria to form caps and to adhere to glass, suggesting that fibrils {{play a role in the}} attachment of Rhizobium leguminosarum to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips and to glass (G. Smit, J. W. Kijne, and B. J. J. Lugtenberg, J. Bacteriol. 168 : 821 - 827, 1986). In the present paper the chemical and functional characterization of the fibrils of R. leguminosarum is described. Characterization of purified fibrils by infrared spectroscopy and cellulase treatment followed by thin-layer chromatography showed that the fibrils are composed of cellulose. Purified cellulose fibrils, as well as commercial cellulose, inhibited cap formation when present during the attachment assay. Incubation of the bacteria with purified cellulase just before the attachment assay strongly inhibited cap formation, indicating that the fibrils are directly involved in the attachment process. Tn 5 -induced fibril-overproducing mutants showed a greatly increased ability to form caps, whereas Tn 5 -induced fibril-negative mutants lost this ability. None of these Tn 5 insertions appeared to be located on the Sym plasmid. Both types of mutants showed normal nodulation properties, indicating that cellulose fibrils are not a prerequisite for successful nodulation under the conditions used. The ability of the fibril-negative mutants to attach to glass was not affected by the mutations, indicating that attachment to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips and attachment to glass are (partly) based on different mechanisms. However, growth of the rhizobia under low Ca 2 + conditions strongly reduced attachment to glass and also prevented cap formation, although it had no negative effect on fibril synthesis.

The yield of the second rice crop grown after the cropping of #S. rostrata$ in both fields and the yield of the third rice crop grown after a carbofuran treatment were correlated with the nematode population observed after the previous rice crop. The increase in rice yield, therefore, could be attributed {{not only to the}} fertilizer effect brought about by growing of #S. rostrata$ or green manure application but also to the control of the rice <b>root</b> <b>nematode.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Expression of an {{inducible}} gene with sequences common to genes encoding pectin methylesterase (PME) {{was found to}} be tightly correlated, both spatially and temporally, with border cell separation in <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> caps. Partial inhibition of the gene's expression by antisense mRNA in transgenic <b>pea</b> hairy <b>roots</b> prevented the normal separation of root border cells from the root tip into the external environment. This phenotype was correlated with an increase in extracellular pH, reduced root elongation, and altered cellular morphology. The translation product of the gene exhibited PME activity in vitro. These results are consistent with the long-standing hypothesis that the demethylation of pectin by PME {{plays a key role in}} cell wall metabolism...|$|R
