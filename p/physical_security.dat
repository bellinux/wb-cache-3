The important difference compared to Shannon’s theory is that the eavesdropper can observe information transmitted by the sender through another channel. <b>Physical</b> layer <b>security</b> guarantees security analytically, based on information theory, regardless of the eavesdropper’s computational power. Therefore, there is no elevation of risk due to the advancement of high speed computing.|$|R
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and <b>physical</b> <b>security</b> elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E

30|$|The {{issues of}} privacy and {{security}} in wireless communication networks have taken on an increasingly important role as these networks continue to flourish worldwide. Traditionally, security is viewed as an independent feature addressed above the physical layer, and all widely used cryptographic protocols are designed and implemented assuming the physical layer has already been established and provides an error-free link. However, {{with the emergence of}} ad-hoc and decentralized networks, higher-layer techniques, such as encryption, are complex and difficult to implement. Therefore, there has been a considerable recent attention on studying the fundamental ability of the physical layer to provide secure wireless communications. This paradigm is called Wireless <b>Physical</b> Layer <b>Security.</b> <b>Physical</b> layer <b>security</b> is an emerging research area that explores the possibility of achieving perfect-secrecy data transmission among intended network nodes, while possibly malicious nodes that eavesdrop upon the transmission obtain zero information. The breakthrough concept behind wireless <b>physical</b> layer <b>security</b> is to exploit the characteristics of the wireless channel, such as fading or noise, to provide secrecy for wireless transmissions. While these characteristics have traditionally been seen as impairments, <b>physical</b> layer <b>security</b> takes advantage of these characteristics for improving the security and reliability of wireless communication systems and networks.|$|R

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern wireless communication technology and network, especially the global 4 G, {{and even the}} 5 G mobile network development, communication security is an important problem to be solved urgently. Because of the openness of the wireless communication media, the transmission of information is easily stolen, tampered, or attacked. In order to solve this problem, a new solution is proposed, which is the <b>physical</b> layer <b>security</b> technology. The <b>physical</b> layer <b>security</b> technology is not dependent on the encryption and encapsulation of data, but it has the characteristics of absolute security of information transmission [1, 2], which has the advantage that the encryption processing of the upper layer of the protocol stack can not be compared.
