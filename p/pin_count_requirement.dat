40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{collision}} detection algorithm and partition it into {{hardware and software}} parts to enhance {{the performance of the}} system and achieve the real time goal (25 frames/sec). We explore the design space to identify various feasible implementations on on software, hardware, firmware and mixed platforms. The platforms considered are the Intel's processors and Sun ULTRA 1 for software, MOTOROLA DSP 56002 for firmware XILINX FPGAs for hardware. The mixed implementations include combinations of the above. A number of implementations discussed establish that factors such as time constraint, <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> and interface <b>requirements</b> strongly influence the design options. 2 Introduction and Motivation This paper is based on an real time implementation of collision detection system based on Vision. This means that the system detects imminent collision and takes necessary action to avoid the collision. Collision detection system is the first step towards building applications in ma [...] ...|$|R

40|$|As IC {{technology}} advances, {{the package}} size keeps shrinking while the <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> of a package keeps increasing. A modern IC package {{can have a}} <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> of thousands. As a result, a complex printed circuit board (PCB) can host more than ten thousand signal nets. Such a huge <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> and net count make manual design of packages and PCBs an extremely time-consuming and error-prone task. On the other hand, increasing clock frequency imposes vari-ous physical constraints on PCB routing. These constraints make traditional IC and PCB routers not applicable to modern PCB routing. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no mature commercial or academic automated router that handles these constraints well. Therefore, automated PCB routers that are tuned to handle such constraints become a necessity in modern design. In this dissertation, we propose novel algorithms for three major aspects of PCB routing: escape routing, area routing and layer assignment.

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve optimal place and routing for {{partitioned}} designs, the engineer must focus on FPGA <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> and inter-FPGA signals. After partitioning the design into separate FPGAs, the number of inter-FPGA signals must not to exceed the <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> on the FPGA. This {{is very difficult to}} avoid when circuit designs are immense, thus signals must utilize strategies such as time-division-multiplexing (TDM) which multiple signals can be transferred over a single line. These multiple signals, called sub-channels, take turns being transferred over the line over a time slot. When the TDM ratio is high, the bus clock frequency has to be reduced to accommodate time slots for each sub-channel. By reducing the clock frequency the throughput of the system is hindered.|$|R

The HPC connector provides 160 user-defined, single-ended signals (or 80 user-defined, differential pairs), 10 serial transceiver pairs, and additional clocks. The HPC and LPC connectors use the same mechanical connector. The only difference is which signals are actually populated. Thus, cards with LPC connectors can be plugged into HPC sites, and if properly designed, HPC cards can offer a subset of functionality when plugged into an LPC site." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The ever {{growing demand}} for {{on-board}} space craft processing combined with the exponential advance in chip development and high <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> devices is resulting in an increased complexity in high reliability interconnect technology. When the thermal management, control of ground bounce, and power distribution issues are considered, achieving the required reliability levels for space applications with traditional interconnect technologies is becoming more of a concern. As an alternative solution, an ultrawideband (UWB) based high speed wireless method for chip to chip as well as off-board communications can be considered. Such approach would reduce the high <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> connectors and interconnects between complex components. UWB with its simple transceiver architecture, low power consumption, and high data rate within short ranges is shown {{to be the best}} candidat...|$|R
