40|$|Lysophosphatidylcholine induces <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} in a cultured human glomerular mesangial cell lineBackgroundOxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) {{has been considered}} important in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is a major phospholipid component of oxLDL. On the other hand, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has also been implicated in proliferative disease of the kidney. This study investigated {{the difference in the}} potential of PC and lysoPC to induce DNA synthesis and PDGF gene {{expression in}} a human glomerular mesangial cell line (HMCL). MethodsDNA synthesis in HMCL was measured by [3 H] thymidine incorporation. The mRNA expression levels of the PDGF A chain and B chain genes were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsLysoPC treatment up-regulated the [3 H] thymidine incorporation level in a dose-dependent fashion. The [3 H] thymidine incorporation level in HMCL coincubated with lysoPC started to increase after 4 hours of treatment, peaked at 24 hours, and decreased thereafter. The level in HMCL incubated with 100 μ M of lysoPC (palmitoyl or stearoyl) increased to 7 - or 10 -fold of the control at peak time, respectively. However, PC treatment did not increase [3 H] thymidine incorporation in HMCL. PC treatment did not induce mRNA expression of either PDGF A or B chain genes. LysoPC did not induce PDGF A chain mRNA expression either. The only B chain mRNA expression was induced by lysoPC. The mRNA expression level in HMCL treated with 50 μ M lysoPC for two hours increased to 1. 6 -fold that of the control. ConclusionLysoPC may induce DNA synthesis in a mesangial cell through the induction of PDGF BB as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{resources}} {{developed for}} domesticated species provide powerful tools {{for studying the}} evolutionary history of their wild relatives. Here we use 61 K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly spaced throughout the canine nuclear genome to analyse evolutionary relationships among the three largest European populations of grey wolves in comparison with other populations worldwide, and investigate genome-wide effects of demographic bottlenecks and signatures of selection. European wolves have a discontinuous range, with large and connected populations in Eastern Europe and relatively smaller, isolated populations in Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. Our results suggest a continuous decline in wolf numbers in Europe since the Late Pleistocene, and long-term isolation and bottlenecks in the Italian and Iberian populations following their divergence from the Eastern European population. The Italian and Iberian populations have low genetic variability and high linkage disequilibrium, but relatively few autozygous segments across the genome. This last characteristic clearly distinguishes them from populations that underwent recent drastic demographic declines or founder events, and implies long-term bottlenecks in these two populations. Although genetic drift due to spatial isolation and bottlenecks {{seems to be a}} major evolutionary force diversifying the European populations, we detected 35 loci that are putatively under diversifying selection. Two of these loci flank the canine <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>gene,</b> which affects bone growth and may influence differences in body size between wolf populations. This study demonstrates the power of population genomics for identifying genetic signals of demographic bottlenecks and detecting signatures of directional selection in bottlenecked populations, despite their low background variability.

To determine the relevance of humoral factors in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia, we introduced expression vectors into Wistar rats via the trachea to locally overexpress humoral factors in the lungs.

Human tumor cell lines that express elevated levels of c-sis (e. g. epidermoid carcinoma, A- 431) are also TNF resistant, whereas those that express no significant levels of this gene (e. g. breast adenocarcinoma, MCF- 7) are TNF sensitive. Transfection of cells with the c-sis gene leads to down-modulation of TNF receptors and also a decrease in intracellular glutathione levels. Thus, our results demonstrate that over-expression of PDGF-B/c-sis by certain tumor cells can lead to their protection from the anticellular effects of TNF...|$|R

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology now provide the opportunity to survey mutational changes in cancer in a high-throughput and comprehensive manner. Here we report on the sequence analysis of members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene family in the genomes of glioblastoma brain tumors. Previous studies have identified a number of molecular alterations in glioblastoma, including amplification of the RTK epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor.

40|$|Testicular {{germ cell}} tumors {{are the most}} common form of cancer in young adult males. They result from a derangement of {{primordial}} germ cells, and they grow out from a noninvasive carcinoma-in-situ precursor. Since carcinoma in situ can readily be cured by low-dose irradiation, there is a great incentive for non- or minimally invasive methods for detection of carcinoma in situ. We have recently shown that human Tera- 2 embryonal carcinoma cells, obtained from a nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumor, show alternative splicing and alternative promoter use of the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> alpha-receptor <b>gene,</b> giving rise to a unique 1. 5 -kb transcript. In this study we have set up a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction strategy for characterization of the various transcripts for this receptor. Using this technique, we show that a panel of 18 seminomas and II nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors all express the 1. 5 -kb transcript. In addition, a panel of 27 samples of testis parenchyma with established carcinoma in situ were all found to be positive for the 1. 5 -kb transcript, while parenchyma lacking carcinoma in situ, placenta, and control semen were all negative. These data show that the 1. 5 -kb <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> alpha-receptor transcript can be used as a highly selective marker for detection of early stages of human testicular germ cell tumors...|$|R

Minor alterations in specific hematological and blood chemistries were seen; however, most parameters were within the normal range for all groups. Bioluminescence analysis revealed vector distribution at the axillary lymph nodes during the first 2 weeks with subsequent return to baseline levels. AdPDGF-B was well contained within the localized osseous defect area without viremia or distant organ involvement.

40|$|Expression of the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> A-chain <b>gene</b> (Pdgfa) occurs {{widely in}} the {{developing}} mouse, where it is mainly localized to various epithelial and neuronal structures. Until now, in situ mRNA hybridization (ISH) {{has been the only}} reliable method to identify Pdgfa expression in tissue sections or whole mount preparations. Validated protocols for in situ detection of PDGF-A protein by immunohistochemistry is lacking. In particular, this has hampered understanding of Pdgfa expression pattern in adult tissues, where ISH is technically challenging. Here, we report a gene targeted mouse Pdgfa allele, Pdgfa(ex 4 COIN), which is a combined conditional knockout and reporter allele. Cre-mediated inversion of the COIN cassette inactivates Pdgfa coding while simultaneously activating a beta-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter under endogenous Pdgfa transcription control. The generated Pdgfa(ex 4 COIN-INV-lacZ) allele can next be used to identify cells carrying a Pdgfa null allele, as well as to map endogenous Pdgfa expression. We evaluated the Pdgfa(ex 4 COIN-INV-lacZ) allele as a reporter for endogenous Pdgfa expression patterns in mouse embryos and adults. We conclude that the expression pattern of Pdgfa(ex 4 COIN-INV-lacZ) recapitulates known expression patterns of Pdgfa. We also report on novel embryonic and adult Pdgfa expression patterns in the mouse and discuss their implications for Pdgfa physiology...|$|R

These disorders have eluded a unique molecular explanation, and therapy has primarily been oriented toward palliation of symptoms related to organ involvement. Recent reports indicate that HES and CEL are imatinib-responsive malignancies, with rapid and complete hematologic remissions observed at lower doses than used in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These BCR-ABL-negative cases lack activating mutations or abnormal fusions involving other known target genes of imatinib, implicating a novel tyrosine kinase in their pathogenesis.

40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that thrombin induces {{expression of the}} <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> in endothelial cells (EC) through activation of the Y-box binding protein DNA-binding protein B (dbpB). We now present evidence that dbpB is activated by a novel mechanism: proteolytic cleavage leading to release from mRNA, nuclear translocation, and induction of thrombin-responsive genes. Cytosolic, full-length dbpB (50 kDa) was rapidly cleaved to a 30 -kDa species upon thrombin stimulation of EC. This truncated, “active” dbpB exhibited nuclear localization and binding affinity for the thrombin response element sequence, which is distinct from the Y-box sequence. Oligo(dT) affinity chromatography revealed that cytosolic dbpB from control EC, but not active dbpB from thrombin-treated EC, was bound to mRNA. Latent dbpB immunoprecipitated from cytosolic extracts of control EC was activated by ribonuclease treatment. Furthermore, when EC cytosolic extracts were subjected to Nycodenz gradient centrifugation, latent dbpB fractionated with mRNA, whereas active dbpB fractionated with free proteins. The cytosolic retention domain of dbpB, which we localized to the region 247 – 267, was proteolytically cleaved during its activation. In contrast to full-length dbpB, truncated dbpB stimulated <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> B-chain and tissue factor promoter activity by over 5 -fold when transiently cotransfected with reporter constructs. These results suggest a novel mode of transcription factor activation in which an agonist causes release from mRNA of a latent transcription factor leading to its transport to the nucleus and its regulation of target gene expression...|$|R

Evidence that the normal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> coding sequence was unaltered derived from RNase protection studies and immunoprecipitation analysis.

40|$|Abstract. Extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs) are {{relatively}} rare soft tissue neoplasms {{arising from the}} extra gastrointestinal tract. The current study presents a case of primary EGIST of the prostate observed in a 55 -year-old male. Imaging studies showed a 10 x 10. 5 x 9. 5 -cm prostate mass. On histological observation, the mass was separated from the rectum serosa and exhibited a high mitotic count (8 / 50 high‑power fields). The results of immunohistochem-ical staining showed positive immunoreactivity for cluster of differentiation (CD) 117 (c-kit), CD 34 and DOG 1 in the tumor. On mutation analysis, loss of heterozygosity of the c-kit gene was observed in the prostatic EGIST; however, the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor-α (PDGFRA) <b>gene</b> {{was considered to be}} normal.

40|$|The c-Myc {{transcription}} factor represses the mRNA {{expression of the}} <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor beta <b>gene</b> (PDGFRB). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that c-Myc binds to the proximal promoter of the PDGFRB gene in proliferating rat fibroblasts. Interestingly, mutant c-Myc proteins that are unable to repress PDGFRB gene expression, c-Myc dBR and c-Myc d 106 - 143, are still able to bind to the promoter in vivo. Hence, promoterbinding and repression of PDGFRB by c-Myc are separable activities. We also show that Myc repression of PDGFRB is not dependent on previously described or known transactivator-binding regions, suggesting Myc may be recruited to the promoter by multiple or yet unidentified {{transcription factor}}s. In the presence of intact promoter-binding by Myc, trichostatin A (TSA) can block Myc repression of PDGFRB in vivo, again demonstrating that promoter-binding and repression are separable. Taken together, we hypothesize that Myc repression of PDGFRB expression occurs by a multi-step mechanism in which repression is initiated after Myc is recruited to the promoter...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{rearrangement}} in {{the form}} of an intragenic deletion is the primary mechanism of oncogenic mutation of the epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor (EGFR) <b>gene</b> in gliomas. However, the incidence of <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor-α (PDGFRA) <b>gene</b> rearrangement in these tumors is unknown. We investigated the PDGFRA locus in PDGFRA-amplified gliomas and identified two rearrangements, including the first case of a gene fusion between kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) (VEGFRII) and the PDGFRA gene, and six cases of PDGFRAΔ 8, 9, an intragenic deletion rearrangement. The PDGFRAΔ 8, 9 mutant was common, being present in 40 % of the glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs) with PDGFRA amplification. Tumors with these two types of PDGFRA rearrangement displayed histologic features of oligodendroglioma, and the gene products of both rearrangements showed constitutively elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transforming potential that was reversed by PDGFR blockade. These results suggest the possibility that these PDGFRA mutants behave as oncogenes in this subset of gliomas, and that the prevalence of such rearrangements may have been considerably underestimated...|$|R
40|$|Human {{malignant}} {{epithelial cell}} lines were analyzed for expression of <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) <b>genes.</b> Of the 12 cell lines tested, 9, derived from breast, lung, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas, {{were found to}} express both PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 genes. The levels of both PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 transcripts were superinduced when these cells were treated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. These cells also released an activity that in studies with BALB-c/ 3 T 3 cells, inhibited binding of 125 I-labeled PDGF and stimulated incorporation of [3 H]thymidine. This stimulating activity was inhibited after reduction of the conditioned media by mercaptoethanol or after preincubation with antibodies to PDGF. Moreover, this activity was not affected by heat treatment. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that breast, lung, and gastric carcinoma cells produced PDGF-like proteins that migrated as 30 - and 32 -kD species under nonreducing conditions and as 15 - and 16 -kD species under reducing conditions. In contrast, malignant cells of ovarian origin produced 14 - 16 -kD PDGF-like proteins that were unchanged in mobility after reduction. As PDGF receptors were not detected on these malignant epithelial cells, the production of PDGF-like proteins may affect other cells in the microenvironment by paracrine mechanisms and may contribute to excessive cell proliferation, inflammatory reactions, and connective tissue remodeling seen in certain carcinomas.

Although reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillation {{has been suggested}} to {{be a result of}} reduced parvalbumin-immunoreactive (putatively, GABAergic) neurons, no direct correlations between these have been established in these disorders. In the present study, we investigated such relationships during pharmacological treatment with a newly synthesized drug, T- 817 MA, which displays neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. In this study, we used <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor-β <b>gene</b> knockout (PDGFR-β KO) mice as an animal model of schizophrenia and autism. These mutant mice display a reduction in social behaviors; deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI); reduced levels of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the medical prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and superior colliculus; and a deficit in of auditory phase-locked gamma oscillations. We found that oral administration of T- 817 MA ameliorated all these symptoms in the PDGFR-β KO mice. Furthermore, phase-locked gamma oscillations were significantly correlated with the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons, which was, in turn, correlated with PPI and behavioral parameters. These findings suggest that recovery of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons by pharmacological intervention relieved the reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillations and, consequently, ameliorated PPI and social behavioral deficits. Thus, our findings suggest that phase-locked gamma oscillations could be a useful physiological biomarker for abnormality of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons that may induce cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and autism, as well as of effective pharmacological interventions in both humans and experimental animals...|$|R
40|$|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) {{is a rare}} {{superficial}} sarcoma usually {{affecting the}} trunk, with significant risk of local recurrence. It {{is characterized by the}} presence of ring chromosomes or chromosomal translocations fusing the promoter of the collagen gene COL 1 A 1 to the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> beta-chain <b>gene</b> PDGFB, increasing the production of PDGF locally and promoting autocrine or paracrine tumor growth. Fewer than 5 % of patients with DFSP develop metastatic sarcoma, with a poor subsequent prognosis. Imatinib (STI- 571) was developed as an inhibitor of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase and has proven clinical activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia (expressing bcr-abl) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (expressing c-kit). We describe 2 patients with metastatic and unresectable metastases from DFSP treated with imatinib. After confirmation of negative CD 117 status of 2 sarcomas arising from DFSP, patients were given imatinib 400 mg po qd and assessed at regular intervals for their tolerance and response to therapy. One patient had a transient response, then progressed rapidly and died of disease. Another patient showed a partial response to therapy after 2 months, with resolution of superior vena cava syndrome and shrinking of metastatic lung lesions. His response is ongoing after 6 months of therapy. These clinical data confirm findings from models of DFSP and support the use of imatinib in the rare setting of metastatic DFSP. Imatinib may be useful for patients with locally advanced DFSP, when other options for local therapy are limited...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene in clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC) {{leads to}} {{overexpression}} of hypoxia inducible factor, a transcription factor regulating vascular endothelial <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (VEGF) and <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) <b>gene</b> expression. Pazopanib, an angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGF receptor, PDGF receptor, and c-KIT, was evaluated {{in patients with}} RCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase II study {{was designed as a}} randomized discontinuation study but was revised to an open-label study on the recommendation of the data monitoring committee (based on week 12 response rate [RR] of 38 % in the first 60 patients). The primary end point was changed from progressive disease rate at 16 weeks postrandomization to RR. Pazopanib 800 mg was administered orally once daily. Pazopanib 800 mg was administered orally once daily. RESULTS: The study enrolled 225 patients with metastatic RCC; 155 patients (69 %) were treatment naïve, and 70 patients (31 %) had received one prior cytokine- or bevacizumab-containing regimen. Overall RR was 35 %; median duration of response was 68 weeks. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 52 weeks. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 and time from diagnosis to treatment of more than 1 year were correlated with prolonged PFS. Pazopanib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and hair depigmentation. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated AST and ALT. CONCLUSION: Pazopanib demonstrated durable activity in patients with advanced RCC and was generally well tolerated in this population. These findings support the further development of pazopanib in advanced RCC...|$|R
40|$|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and its {{juvenile}} form, giant-cell fibroblastoma (GCF), are uncommon infiltrative {{tumors of the}} dermis, which present unique cytogenetic features, such as {{the reciprocal}} translocation t(17; 22) or, more commonly, supernumerary ring chromosomes containing sequences from chromosomes 17 and 22. We have recently shown that these aberrations are cytogenetic manifestations of gene fusions between the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> (PDGFB), the cellular equivalent of the v-sis oncogene, and the collagen type 1 alpha 1 gene (COL 1 A 1), the major protein constituent of the extracellular matrix in connective tissue of skin. We now report characterization of COL 1 A 1 /PDGFB chimeric genes at the RNA and DNA sequence levels {{in a series of}} DFSPs and GCFs. All 16 tumors studied contained the COL 1 A 1 /PDGFB gene. The location of breakpoints within COL 1 A 1 varied greatly, but was always limited to the region encoding the alpha-helical domain. The PDGFB segment of the chimeric transcript always starts with exon 2, placing PDGFB {{under the control of the}} COL 1 A 1 promoter and removing all known elements negatively controlling PDGFB transcription and translation. Production of these aberrant transcripts in fibroblasts, the suspected cell of origin of DFSP/GCF, likely causes autocrine stimulation and cell proliferation. No specific function has yet been assigned to exon 2 of PDGFB, and this exon does not encode for the mature <b>growth</b> <b>factor.</b> Its retention in all chimeric COL 1 A 1 /PDGFB genes suggests that it is important for the normal processing of the PDGFB polypeptide. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{features}} of v-kit, the oncogene of HZ 4 feline sarcoma virus, {{suggested that this}} gene arose by transduction and truncation of cellular sequences. Complementary DNA cloning of the human proto-oncogene coding for a receptor tyrosine kinase confirmed this possibility: c-kit encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that is structurally related to the receptor for macrophage <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (CSF- 1) and the receptor for <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor.</b> The c-kit <b>gene</b> is widely expressed as a single, 5 -kb transcript, and it is localized to human chromosome 4 and to mouse chromosome 5. A c-kit peptide antibody permitted the identification of a 145, 000 dalton c-kit gene product that is inserted in the cellular plasma membrane and is capable of self-phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in both human glioblastoma cells and transfected mouse fibroblasts. Our results suggest that p 145 c-kit functions as a cell surface receptor for an as yet unidentified ligand. Furthermore, carboxy- and amino-terminal truncations {{that occurred during the}} viral transduction process are likely to have generated the transformation potential of v-kit...|$|R
40|$|Mouse models {{show that}} {{congenital}} neural tube defects (NTDs) can {{occur as a}} result of mutations in the <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor-alpha <b>gene</b> (PDGFRalpha). Mice heterozygous for the PDGFRalpha-mutation Patch, {{and at the same time}} homozygous for the undulated mutation in the Pax 1 gene, exhibit a high incidence of lumbar spina bifida occulta, suggesting a functional relation between PDGFRalpha and Pax 1. Using the human PDGFRalpha promoter linked to a luciferase reporter, we show in the present paper that Pax 1 acts as a transcriptional activator of the PDGFRalpha gene in differentiated Tera- 2 human embryonal carcinoma cells. Two mutant Pax 1 proteins carrying either the undulated-mutation or the Gln [...] > His mutation previously identified by us in the PAX 1 gene of a patient with spina bifida, were not or less effective, respectively. Surprisingly, Pax 1 mutant proteins appear to have opposing transcriptional activities in undifferentiated Tera- 2 cells as well as in the U- 2 OS osteosarcoma cell line. In these cells, the mutant Pax 1 proteins enhance PDGFRalpha-promoter activity whereas the wild-type protein does not. The apparent up-regulation of PDGFRalpha expression in these cells clearly demonstrates a gain-of-function phenomenon associated with mutations in Pax genes. The altered transcriptional activation properties correlate with altered protein-DNA interaction in band-shift assays. Our data provide additional evidence that mutations in Pax 1 can act as a risk factor for NTDs and suggest that the PDGFRalpha gene is a direct target of Pax 1. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that deregulated PDGFRalpha expression may be causally related to NTD...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Mutated KIT and <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> alpha <b>gene</b> (PDGFRA) drive GI stromal tumor (GIST) oncogenesis, but the {{clinical}} significance of their single mutations is known incompletely. Patients and Methods: We identified 11 population-based series {{of patients with}} GIST through a literature search and pooled individual data from 3, 067 patients treated with macroscopically complete tumor excision. Mutation analysis was done from 1, 505 tumors. We analyzed associations between KIT and PDGFRA mutations and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the subsets in which patients were treated with surgery alone. Results: We identified 301 different single mutations in KIT and 33 in PDGFRA. Patients with PDGFRA mutations had more favorable RFS than those with KIT mutations (hazard ratio, 0. 34; P =. 004). Only one of the 35 GISTs with KIT exon 11 duplication mutations recurred. Patients with deletions of only one codon of KIT exon 11 had better RFS than those with another deletion type, and some KIT exon 11 substitution mutations (Trp 557 Arg, Val 559 Ala, and Leu 576 Pro) were also associated with favorable RFS. Patients with an identical mutation had greatly variable outcomes depending on the standard prognostic factors, notably, mitotic count. Commonly used risk stratification schemes tended to overestimate the risk for recurrence in subgroups with prognostically favorable mutations. Conclusion: GISTs with an identical KIT or PDGFRA mutation may have widely varying risks for recurrence. Most of the patients with PDGFRA mutations and those with KIT exon 11 duplication mutation or deletion of one codon have favorable RFS with surgery alone and are usually not candidates for adjuvant therapy...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported that the}} <b>platelet-derived</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) A-chain <b>gene</b> is highly expressed in neurons of embryonic and adult mouse central nervous system and suggested that its secretion by neurons may support development and maintenance of glia. We have now analyzed the levels and sites of expression of the cognate PDGF alpha-receptor gene in brain and spinal cord of embryonic and adult mice by in situ hybridization. The predominant cell populations in both gray and white matter expressing transcripts of the PDGF alpha-receptor gene are glial cells or their precursors. Transcripts consistently were not detected in neurons. Expression of the PDGF alpha-receptor gene was first observed at embryonic day 15, increased through postnatal day 14, and fell to lower levels in adults. Expression of the alpha-receptor gene corresponds in temporal sequence to the developmental period of glial migration and proliferation and to the expression of PDGF A by neurons. The results indicate that glia but not neurons {{have the potential to}} respond to PDGF A and suggest that neurons influence glial cell development through paracrine regulation...|$|R
