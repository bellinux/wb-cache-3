To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> according to U.N.

In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Nuckolls {{and several other}} weapons {{designers}} had developed {{the outlines of the}} ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

40|$|The {{greatest}} challenge for transplantation is the sig-nificant disparity {{in the number}} of organs available relative to the demand. African Americans in particu-lar are disproportionately represented on the national transplantwaiting list for amyriad of reasons. Although accounting for merely 13 % of the national population (1), African Americans comprise 30 % of the 123, 000 waitlist candidates (2). The need among African Amer-icans is considerably high because the incidence rate of ESRD is 3. 4 times greater than that among Caucasians (3). This disparity is exacerbated by the disproportion-ate effect of certain health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and hepatitis, which in-crease the necessity for a transplant.

5000|$|In {{traditional}} Weatherby fashion, a Weatherby cartridge would outclass similar-caliber cartridges {{with regard}} to the performance of the cartridge. To accomplish this task Weatherby relied on one of the largest commercial sporting cartridge cases available. The [...]416 Weatherby Magnum uses the same case as the [...]378 Weatherby Magnum and the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum. The case design was inspired by the [...]416 Rigby cartridge and features a belt and Weatherby’s signature double-radius venturi shoulder. Unlike the [...]416 Ruger and the [...]416 Remington, the [...]416 Weatherby Magnum requires an extra-large bolt face and large magnum action to contain the cartridge due to its oversized dimensions. <b>Putting</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> the [...]416 Weatherby Magnum has a case capacity of 140 gr. of water (9.09 cm3), an increase of 31% over that of the [...]416 Remington Magnum case.|$|R
2500|$|To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> {{infinite}} sets arise as filtered co{{limits of}} finite sets, infinite CABAs as filtered limits of finite power set algebras, and infinite Stone spaces as filtered limits of finite sets. Thus if one {{starts with the}} finite sets and asks how these generalize to infinite objects, there are two ways: [...] "adding" [...] them gives ordinary or inductive sets while [...] "multiplying" [...] them gives Stone spaces or profinite sets. The same choice exists for finite power set algebras as the duals of finite sets: addition yields Boolean algebras as inductive objects while multiplication yields CABAs or power set algebras as profinite objects.|$|E
2500|$|To {{balance the}} mass of carbon and produce the {{observed}} [...] value, at least 1,500 gigatons of carbon would have to degas from the mantle via volcanoes {{over the course of}} the two, 1,000 year, steps. To <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> this is about 200 times the background rate of degassing for the rest of the Paleocene. There is no indication that such a burst of volcanic activity has occurred at any point in Earth's history. However, substantial volcanism had been active in East Greenland for around the preceding million years or so, but this struggles to explain the rapidity of the PETM. Even if the bulk of the 1,500 gigatons of carbon was released in a single pulse, further feedbacks would be necessary to produce the observed isotopic excursion.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1918 the U.S. First Army {{had been}} formed, first under Pershing's direct command {{and then by}} Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett, when the U.S. Second Army under Lieutenant General Robert Bullard was created. After a quick victory at Saint-Mihiel, east of Verdun, {{some of the more}} bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to Metz, but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Foch, for three {{simultaneous}} offensives into the [...] "bulge" [...] of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by Plumer's Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at Meuse-Argonne. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> around half the German divisions were engaged on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sector at the time.|$|E
