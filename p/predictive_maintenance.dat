40|$|International audienceMaintenance is an {{important}} activity in industry. It is performed either to revive a machine/component or {{to prevent it from}} breaking down. Different strategies have evolved through time, bringing maintenance to its current state: condition-based and <b>predictive</b> <b>maintenances.</b> This evolution was due to the increasing demand of reliability in industry. The key process of condition-based and <b>predictive</b> <b>maintenances</b> is prognostics and health management, and it is a tool to predict the remaining useful life of engineering assets. Nowadays, plants are required to avoid shutdowns while offering safety and reliability. Nevertheless, planning a maintenance activity requires accurate information about the system/component health state. Such information is usually gathered by means of independent sensor nodes. In this study, we consider the case where the nodes are interconnected and form a wireless sensor network. As far as we know, no research work has considered such a case of study for prognostics. Regarding the importance of data accuracy, a good prognostics requires reliable sources of information. This is why, in this paper, we will first discuss the dependability of wireless sensor networks, and then present a state of the art in prognostic and health management activities...|$|R

In particular, an innovative approach to <b>predictive</b> railway <b>maintenance</b> scheduling is applied to track maintenance, also {{taking into account the}} risk assessment, according to the ISO 55000 guidelines, and the real-time track conditions. The novelty of this approach consists of the introduction of the concept of risk in railway maintenance scheduling, thus implying that the maintenance activity priorities are based on asset criticalities, such as track degradation conditions and repair costs, and the users' unmet demand due to traffic disturbances caused by asset faults. In the paper, after a general framework description, the relevant literature is analyzed.

40|$|The Life Cycle Costs (LCC) {{for high}} performance, {{centrifugal}} and axial flow turbomachinery such as gas turbines, compressors and pumps is very {{strongly influenced by}} fuel (energy) consumption and by maintenance costs. Additionally, the penalty costs associated with non-availability and catastrophic failure can be of the utmost severity especially when these units are in critical service. Consequently, any system which can help in increasing the thermodynamic efficiency, reducing maintenance costs and minimizing the probability of catastrophic failure would have a very significant impact on LCC. This paper discusses the concept of combined mechanical (vibration) and aero thermal (process flows, pressures, temperatures, speeds) monitoring which would provide a means of fuel optimization, incipient failure detection, and the prognosis and diagnosis of operating problems.

40|$|Gears are {{important}} mechanical components for power transmissions. Tooth wear {{is one of}} the most common failure modes, which can present throughout a gear’s lifetime. It is significant to accurately monitor gear wear progression in order to take timely <b>predictive</b> <b>maintenances.</b> Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is an effective and non-intrusive approach which is able to monitor faults from both electrical and mechanical systems. However, little research has been reported in monitoring the gear wear and estimating its severity based on MCSA. This paper presents a novel gear wear monitoring method through a modulation signal bispectrum based motor current signal analysis (MSB-MCSA). For a steady gear transmission, it is inevitable to exist load and speed oscillations due to various errors including wears. These oscillations can induce small modulations in the current signals of the driving motor. MSB is particularly effective in characterising such small modulation signals. Based on these understandings, the monitoring process was implemented based on the current signals from a run-to-failure test of an industrial two stages helical gearbox under a moderate accelerated fatigue process. At the initial operation of the test, MSB analysis results showed that the peak values at the bifrequencies of gear rotations and the power supply can be effective monitoring features for identifying faulty gears and wear severity as they exhibit agreeable changes with gear loads. A monotonically increasing trend established by these features allows a clear indication of the gear wear progression. The dismantle inspection at 477 hours of operation, made when one of the monitored features is about 123 % higher than its baseline, has found that there are severe scuffing wear marks on a number of tooth surfaces on the driving gear, showing that the gear endures a gradual wear process during its long test operation. Therefore, it is affirmed that the MSB-MSCA approach proposed is reliable and accurate for monitoring gear wear deterioration...|$|R
