5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century Scottish {{scientists}} James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included Thomas Annan (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record. His son James Craig Annan (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill & Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable <b>photogravure</b> process. Other important figures included Thomas Keith (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers, George Washington Wilson (1823–93), who pioneered instant photography and Clementina Hawarden (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.|$|E

Definitive stamps of high and medium face values are printed using the recess method as are special stamps. However, a time frame of 10 to 12months has to be given for its production. Special stamps which involve a large variety of colours are printed using the <b>photogravure</b> method. Simpler designed stamps, both commemorative and definitive are printed using lithography.|$|E

25|$|Stieglitz was a perfectionist, and {{it showed}} {{in every aspect of}} Camera Work. He {{advanced}} the art of <b>photogravure</b> printing by demanding unprecedentedly high standards for the prints in Camera Work. The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the early}} Kaloma images seen to date are photogravures, a type of {{high-quality}} reproduction that has been produced since the 1850s, with a surge in popularity between 1890 and 1920. A <b>photogravure</b> is made from an engraving plate on a printing press, making them much less costly than actual photographs. Photogravures were often printed with title and publication data below the image and were commonly used to create many copies of high quality illustrations for books, postcards and art magazines.|$|E

Sindelar, a student of Alphonse Mucha. Two other cover designs later appeared, in 1905 and 1906. There were numerous halftone reproduction of photos in each issue, but what made the journal stand out were the hand-pulled <b>photogravures.</b> At least two {{and as many as}} four meticulously printed <b>photogravures</b> were included in each issue. In addition there were commentaries, criticism and reviews by important photographers and critics of the time. In an average issue, about half of the articles dealt with individual photographers and aesthetic issues, and the rest covering technical matters and notices and reviews of international exhibitions. As Stieglitz biographer Katherine Hoffman points out, [...] "Each issue of Camera Notes was an art object itself, with is finely printed <b>photogravures,</b> well-designed layout and range of articles and text." ...|$|R
25|$|William Henry Fox Talbot (11 February 180017 September 1877) was a British scientist, {{inventor}} {{and photography}} pioneer {{who invented the}} salted paper and calotype processes, precursors to photographic processes of the later 19th and 20th centuries. His work in the 1840s on photomechanical reproduction {{led to the creation}} of the photoglyphic engraving process, the precursor to <b>photogravure.</b> He was the holder of a controversial patent which affected the early development of commercial photography in Britain. He was also a noted photographer who contributed to the development of photography as an artistic medium. He published The Pencil of Nature (1844–46), which was illustrated with original salted paper prints from his calotype negatives, and made some important early photographs of Oxford, Paris, Reading, and York.|$|E
500|$|Some were {{beginning}} {{to see it as}} embodying sentimentality and bad taste, but Hope continued to remain popular with the English public. In 1905 The Strand Magazine noted that it was the most popular picture in the Tate Gallery, and remarked that [...] "there are few print-sellers who fail to exhibit it in their windows." [...] After Watts's death the Autotype Company purchased from Mary Seton Watts the rights to make carbon print copies of Hope, making reproductions of the image affordable for poorer households, and in 1908 engraver Emery Walker began to sell full-colour <b>photogravure</b> prints of Hope, the first publicly available high-quality colour reproductions of the image.|$|E

George Washington Wilson (1823–93) pioneered instant photography and landscape photography, becoming [...] "photographer to the Queen" [...] and his Aberdeen company was the largest producer of topographical prints by 1880. Clementina Hawarden (1822–65) produced posed portraits that were among the first in a tradition of female photography. In the 1850s amateur photographer Mary Jane Matherson took her camera outside to create compositions that can be described as genre art, including A Picnic in the Glen and An Angler at Rest.|$|E
