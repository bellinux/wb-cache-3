5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of the <b>prevailing</b> wind. Knowledge of the <b>prevailing</b> wind allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the <b>prevailing</b> wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the <b>prevailing</b> wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. <b>Prevailing</b> winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. <b>Prevailing</b> winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the <b>Prevailing</b> Westerlies are the <b>prevailing</b> winds in {{the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These <b>prevailing</b> winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical {{cyclones}} in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prevailing</b> lowland forest {{ecosystem}} was transformed from forest to grassland; {{some of this}} change {{was caused by the}} use of fire, but the <b>prevailing</b> cause of {{forest ecosystem}} collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} <b>prevailing</b> wind which lasts for several months, ushering in a region's rainy season. Regions within North America, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and East Asia are monsoon regimes.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} earlier, <b>prevailing</b> {{and local}} winds are not spread evenly across the earth, {{which means that}} wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>prevailing</b> {{winds and}} currents, the best route from Veracruz to Havana {{ran along the}} shore of what became Texas and Louisiana. The four vessels took this route.|$|E
5|$|Keys {{was found}} by the Opies to be the <b>prevailing</b> term in western Scotland and in a strip running through north-west England in an {{otherwise}} predominantly barley area.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Coatbridge {{experiences}} a temperate maritime climate with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The <b>prevailing</b> wind is from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Originally tefillin {{were worn}} all day, but not during the night. Nowadays the <b>prevailing</b> custom is {{to wear them}} only during the weekday morning service, {{although}} some individuals wear them at other times during the day as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prevailing</b> winds in the {{interior}} are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area <b>prevailing</b> winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as bura or less frequently as sirocco. The sunniest {{parts of the country}} are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
5|$|Royalties {{are paid}} above the <b>prevailing</b> rate, as {{announced}} at DGM's launch. In return, DGM artists {{are responsible for}} promoting their albums through concert tours and interviews.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold <b>prevailing</b> winds that blow from the {{high-pressure}} areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these <b>prevailing</b> winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prevailing</b> winds in the {{interior}} are light to moderate northeast or southwest; in the coastal area, the <b>prevailing</b> winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as buras or less frequently as siroccos. The sunniest {{parts of the country}} are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2,700hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2,000hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} awarded the best TV comedy at the 2006 {{ceremony}} of the Martín Fierro Awards, <b>prevailing</b> over Casados con hijos and ¿Quién es el Jefe?. Facundo Arana received the award for best lead actor in comedy, <b>prevailing</b> over Guillermo Francella, Humberto Tortonese, and Nicolás Vázquez. Natalia Oreiro won the award for the best lead actress in comedy, <b>prevailing</b> over Florencia Peña, Nancy Duplaá, Carmen Barbieri, and Andrea Bonelli. Alejandro Awada, Marcelo Mazzarello, and Carlos Belloso received nominations for supporting comedy actor awards, which was won by Belloso. Similarly, three of five nominations for supporting comedy actress went to Carla Peterson, Mónica Ayos and Claudia Fontán, but the award went to Érika Rivas of Casados con hijos. The program was unsuccessfully nominated for best theme song and best guest appearance for Leticia Brédice.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the <b>prevailing</b> wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the <b>prevailing</b> wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the reign}} of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, the Amber Road was {{straightened}} and paved according to the <b>prevailing</b> urban standards. Roman towns began to appear along the road, initially founded {{near the site of}} Celtic oppida.|$|E
5|$|While stalled {{over the}} South China Sea, Chanchu's large {{circulation}} caused {{an increase in}} rainfall over Malaysia. The typhoon brought {{the onset of the}} summer monsoon in the South China Sea after shifting the <b>prevailing</b> winds over the region.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the <b>prevailing</b> theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|As part of Sabah area, Kota Kinabalu {{features}} a typical equatorial climate with constant temperature, {{considerable amount of}} rain and high humidity. Two <b>prevailing</b> monsoons characterise the climate {{of this part of}} Sabah are the Northeast Monsoon and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon occurs between November and March, while the Southwest Monsoon occurs between May and September. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes <b>prevailing</b> in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the {{political}} aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated to Laura, {{daughter}} of the composer Isaac Albéniz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set {{can be viewed as}} another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the <b>prevailing</b> austerity of Fauré's later style.|$|E
5|$|Field {{said she}} avoided <b>prevailing</b> fashion trends for Miranda during {{production}} {{in favor of}} a more timeless look based on Donna Karan archives and pieces by Michaele Vollbracht for Bill Blass. She did not want people to easily recognize what Miranda was wearing.|$|E
5|$|Following its trip to Iowa, Michigan {{played on}} the road for the second {{consecutive}} week against the Illinois Fighting Illini. In 2010, the Wolverines and Illini had played in the highest combined scoring game in Michigan Stadium history, with Michigan <b>prevailing</b> 67–65 in triple overtime.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the <b>prevailing</b> view {{still was}} that the Universe {{consisted}} entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 64 BCE, the {{military}} expedition of the Roman general Pompey {{put an end}} to the anarchy <b>prevailing</b> in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued to disrupt the region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana extended over the area. The pax romana favored international trade, and local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1966, {{university}} students {{under the banner}} of KAMI, begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection with the army, with Suharto often engaging in coordination meetings with student leaders. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students <b>prevailing</b> due to army protection.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the <b>prevailing</b> theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the <b>prevailing</b> {{view was that}} the genes in a {{chromosome}} acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the wiping policy officially {{came to an}} end in 1978, {{when the}} means to further exploit {{programmes}} by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to become apparent. The <b>prevailing</b> view had also begun to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons.|$|E
5|$|Lucas and Leonard Rapping {{laid out}} the first new {{classical}} approach to aggregate supply in 1969. Under their model, changes in employment are based on worker preferences for leisure time. Lucas and Rapping modeled decreases in employment as voluntary choices of workers to reduce their work effort {{in response to the}} <b>prevailing</b> wage.|$|E
5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of <b>prevailing</b> winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the <b>prevailing</b> wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|One <b>prevailing</b> {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a {{spectrum}} from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prevailing</b> on Elagabalus, she {{arranged}} that he appoint his cousin Alexander as his heir {{and that the}} boy be given the title of Caesar. Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year. However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement {{when he began to}} suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the <b>prevailing</b> view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the <b>prevailing</b> conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
