5000|$|Hoffmannseggia glauca is a dicot {{found in}} the legume family, Fabaceae. Its common names include Indian rushpea, hog potato, and <b>pig</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|The drier valley slopes have grazed acidic {{grassland}} {{characterized by}} tormentil (Potentilla erecta), wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), <b>pig</b> <b>nut</b> (Conopodium majus), and mosses (Polytrichum spp.). Distinctive wet flushes descend these dry slopes and, {{where there is}} a deeper accumulation of soil, bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is dominant, interspersed with grass-heath areas and willow and hawthorn scrub. These ffridd areas are of importance for birds, particularly nesting whinchat, tree pipit, yellowhammer, linnet, curlew, and grasshopper warbler. Red kites, buzzards, sparrow hawks, kestrels, and goshawks are a common sight in the valley.|$|E

50|$|As {{with many}} Fagaceae, the nuts of many Castanopsis species are edible. The trees may be grown for their nuts, {{but more often}} they are used as {{forestry}} or ornamental trees and the nuts are collected opportunistically. Among many animals, such as tits, corvids, rodents, deer and <b>pigs,</b> the <b>nuts</b> are popular as food too.|$|R

40|$|There are {{at least}} 2, 000 silver nitrate negatives in the Horace Poolaw collection, and as many stories {{to go along with}} them. If you begin to talk about one image, it leads from that story to the next, and the next, and pretty soon two or three hours have gone by. Rather than {{discussing}} in detail the images in the Horace Poolaw collection, I would like to discuss Horace Poolaw the man-a complex yet loving individual who was much more than just a photographer. It is still difficult for me to talk about a person whose influence helped shape my life. Our family referred to Horace Poolaw simply as 2 ̆ 2 Granpa. 2 ̆ 2 Part of my research on Granpa was gifted to me as a child and teenager: I learned about my grandfather by sitting on his lap watching the Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday nights, by riding with him on his tractor at sundown to check on his cattle (a necessary ritual before he settled in for the night), by following his footsteps through the early morning frost on our way to feed his pigs. That handful of pigs had it made. Granpa would get up {{early in the morning and}} warm some water on the stove in a big stew pot. Outside he had a bucket filled with sweet feed that he mixed with the water. We 2 ̆ 7 d carry the feed seventy-five yards to the pig pen and he would pour the feed into the trough with steam rising. Those <b>pigs</b> would go <b>nuts...</b>|$|R
