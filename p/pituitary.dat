5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of <b>pituitary</b> {{apoplexy}} arise from a <b>pituitary</b> adenoma, a benign tumor of the <b>pituitary</b> gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of <b>pituitary</b> tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of <b>pituitary</b> tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found <b>pituitary</b> tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low <b>pituitary</b> hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the <b>pituitary</b> hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the <b>pituitary</b> is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy. <b>Pituitary</b> apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the <b>pituitary</b> undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{afternoon}} (PM) but not morning {{injections of}} melatonin (MEL) induced signcant reductions in testicular and seminal vesicle weights {{as well as}} attenuating serum prolactin (PRL) and lweinizing hormone (Li-f) levels. Although there were no treatment-induced effects on hemipituitary weights, PM-Mel injections led to signzjlcant reductions in in vitro PRL secretion and tended to increase the ability of dopamine to inhibit PRL release. It was also shown that LII-releasing hormone (LHRR) could inhibit in vitro PRL release from hamster <b>pituitaries.</b> Basal or IJJRH-stimulated LII secretion from incubated <b>pituitaries</b> was not affected by Mel in vivo. From these results we conclude that properly timed Mel injections do not reduce the <b>pituitary’s</b> ability to secrete LII but severely attenuate PRL secretion. These findings {{are similar to those}} observed in <b>pituitaries</b> from hamsters housed in short-photoperiod conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA Sox (SRY-type HMG box) gene, {{designated}} SoxP 1, {{was isolated}} from a cDNA library made from <b>pituitaries</b> of immature rainbow trout. Sequence {{analysis indicated that}} the cDNA had an open reading frame encoding 467 amino acid residues containing a DNA binding motif, known as the high mobility group (HMG) box. Northern blot analysis showed trout SoxP 1 mRNA was detected in <b>pituitaries</b> and gonadal tissues, but not in liver, spleen, and heart. In <b>pituitaries,</b> trout SoxP 1 mRNA was more abundant in immature fish than in mature fish. Gel shift retardation analysis indicated that the recombinant HMG box protein of SoxP 1 produced in E. coli had a DNA binding property for an AACAAT or AACAAAG sequence. These {{findings suggest that the}} trout SoxP 1 protein may play certain roles in growth or maturation in <b>pituitaries</b> as a transcription factor...|$|R
40|$|TSH {{has been}} {{measured}} by bioassay in 22 <b>pituitaries</b> {{of patients with}} asymptomatic thyroiditis matched for age, sex and concomitant diseases with 18 <b>pituitaries</b> of control subjects. The mean TSH concentration was significantly increased in the thyroiditis <b>pituitaries.</b> Accordingly, the thyrotropes were increased in number and size, partially degranulated, with a dilated Golgi area and a large nucleolus. In a double-blind study performed on 8 cases, such morphologic evidence of thyrotropic activity was well correlated with a high TSH concentration. These observations provide evidence of hypertrophy of the thyrotropes along with increased TSH concentration in the hypophyses of asymptomatic thyroiditis cases. © 1972 by The Endocrine Society.

5|$|<b>Pituitary</b> {{apoplexy}} is rare. Even {{in people}} with a known <b>pituitary</b> tumor, only 0.6–10% experience apoplexy; the risk is higher in larger tumors. Based on extrapolations from existing data, one would expect 18 cases of <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy per one million people every year; the actual figure is probably lower.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pituitary</b> {{apoplexy}} or <b>pituitary</b> tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired {{blood supply}} of the <b>pituitary</b> gland {{at the base of}} the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the <b>pituitary,</b> although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pituitary</b> failure {{results in}} many {{changes in the}} skin, hair and nails {{as a result of}} the absence of <b>pituitary</b> hormone action on these sites.|$|E
40|$|BR 6 female mice {{treated with}} a mixture of hormones, {{developed}} mammary tumours earlier than untreated virgin animals. Implantation of ectopic <b>pituitaries</b> also increased tumour incidence and reduced the age at which tumours first appeared. This effect was obtained {{even in the absence of}} ovaries. Neither hormone treatment nor ectopic <b>pituitaries</b> succeeded in producing tumours as early as they appear in breeding females...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) {{was used}} to {{determine}} whether the PMA-induced extracellular Ca 2 +-independent release of LH was dependent on sex, estradiol and de novo protein synthesis. Infusions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or PMA in a perifusion system stimulated a partial secretion of LH from diestrous II and ovariectomized + estradiol-treated female <b>pituitaries</b> (responses inhibited by cycloheximide). In contrast, PMA was ineffective in stimulating PRL secretion from these <b>pituitaries,</b> as well as LH secretion from male or ovariectomized female <b>pituitaries.</b> These results indicate that the PMA-stimulated extracellular Ca 2 +-independent secretion of LH is a specific process which is dependent on sex, estradiol and de novo protein synthesis, and mimics the characteristics of the GnRH-stimulated responses...|$|R
40|$|Lactotroph {{cell death}} is {{increased}} in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. To determine the mechanism involved, cell death proteins were accessed in <b>pituitaries</b> of diabetic (streptozotocin at 65 mg/kg, 2 months evolution) and control male rats by Western blot analysis and double immunohistochemistry. The intact and cleaved forms of caspase 9 were increased in diabetic rat <b>pituitaries</b> compared with controls. Although the proforms of caspases 3, 6, and 7 were increased in diabetic rat <b>pituitaries,</b> their activated forms were either unchanged or decreased.

5|$|The {{first case}} {{description}} of <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy has {{been attributed to}} the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898. This was followed in 1905 by a further report from the German physician Bleibtreu. Surgery for <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy was described in 1925. Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy approximated 50%.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pituitary</b> gland {{is located}} {{at the base of the}} brain, and intimately {{connected}} with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior <b>pituitary,</b> which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior <b>pituitary,</b> which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior <b>pituitary</b> secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of all {{anterior}} <b>pituitary</b> hormones is {{more common}} than individual hormone deficiency.|$|E
40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{for salmon}} prolactin (PRL) is described. This assay {{which is based}} on the sodium-retaining action of PRL in the hypophysectomized killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, has proved to be rapid, sensitive (250 pg PRL per gram of fish), and specific. The procedure has been used to characterize the biological activity of a highly purified PRL from the <b>pituitaries</b> of the chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha, and a similar PRL isolated (by acid buffer polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis) from <b>pituitaries</b> of coho salmon (O. kisutch) (MW ca. 22, 000; isoelectric point greater than 9...|$|R
40|$|A fluorometric {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} assay of vasopressin and oxytocin in individual rat <b>pituitaries</b> has been developed. Acid extracts of <b>pituitaries</b> are freed of amino acids and polyamines by passage over a copper-Sephadex column, and the peptides fraction is then labeled by reaction with fluorescamine. The resulting peptide fluorophors {{are separated by}} chromatography on a reverse-phase bonded column. Specificity of the procedure was ascertained by several criteria, including bioassay and amino-acid analysis of the eluted peptide fluorophors. The procedure serves as a model system for the assay of tissue peptides in the picomole range...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{analyses}} {{have previously}} detected sulfate {{linked to the}} oligosaccharides of lutropin isolated from bovine and human <b>pituitaries.</b> To determine whether lutropin could be metabolically labeled with sulfate, isolated bovine and rat <b>pituitaries</b> were incubated with [35 S]sulfate. In both species, two major labeled products were immunoprecipitated with antisera specific to lutropin subunits. Incorporation into the subunits occurred posttranslationally since it was not blocked by cycloheximide, which did, however, block the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine. Metabolic labeling with [35 S]sulfate provides a valuable approach for examining the biosynthetic processing of lutropin and the physiological role of sulfate in this hormone...|$|R
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the <b>pituitary</b> gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the <b>pituitary</b> gland, although it is less reliable. Many <b>pituitary</b> tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pituitary</b> tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve <b>pituitary</b> function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the <b>pituitary</b> hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany <b>pituitary</b> tumors, as well as <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a <b>pituitary</b> tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the <b>pituitary).</b> Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
50|$|An earlier {{name for}} the same protein was FSH-suppressing protein (FSP). At {{the time of its}} initial {{isolation}} from follicular fluid, it was found to inhibit the anterior <b>pituitary's</b> secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological SciencesHuman FSH {{exists as}} two major glycoforms, tetra-glycosylated and di-glycosylated hFSH. Tetra-glycosylated FSH {{possesses}} both α and β subunit carbohydrates while di-glycosylated hFSH possesses only α subunit carbohydrates. Western blotting differentiated the glycosylated, 24 kDa hFSHβ band from the non-glycosylated 21 kDa FSHβ band. As {{part of the}} laboratory-wide effort to define glycoform abundance in individual humans, FSH was isolated from <b>pituitaries.</b> The findings from this assay were combined with previous data from individual human <b>pituitaries</b> showing the highest abundance of di-glycosylated hFSH in the youngest individuals, intermediate variation in perimenopausal individuals, and low abundance in post menopausal women...|$|R
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the <b>pituitary</b> gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior <b>pituitary</b> gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the <b>pituitary</b> gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a <b>pituitary</b> apoplexy develop <b>pituitary</b> hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the <b>pituitary,</b> traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the <b>pituitary</b> enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the <b>pituitary</b> have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (<b>pituitary</b> adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
40|$|Vitellogenesis in Pseudopleuronectes americanus Walbaum {{involves}} {{a transfer of}} yolk material synthesised by the liver into the oocytes in the gonad. The hormones controlling these processes were studied. Hormones which can induce maturation and/or ovulation of oocytes were identified. [...] The gonadal lipid accumulation during winter starvation is not {{accounted for by the}} decrease in the concentration of liver lipid. Vitellogenesis must consist of three phases; mobilization of lipid and other energy reserves into the circulation, synthesis of yolk proteins by the liver, and uptake of yolk into oocytes. [...] Hypophysectomy suppressed both liver synthesis and oocyte uptake of yolk protein. Injection of estradiol-benzoate restores the liver synthesis of yolk, resulting in accumulation of yolk proteins in serum because none is incorporated by the gonad. A glycoprotein fraction from Hippoglossoides platessoides Fabricius <b>pituitaries,</b> which is capable of stimulating ovulation, did not promote uptake into the gonads of the estradiol induced serum yolk but a non-glycoprotein fraction from these <b>pituitaries</b> with a molecular weight of 25000 to 35000 stimulated yolk incorporation. [...] 17 α-Hydroxy progesterone and 20 β-dihydro- 17 α-Hydroxy progesterone were identified in plasma samples which had induced oocyte maturation in vitro bioassay, using a double isotope derivative assay. Cortisol, cortisone, deoxycorticosterone, 11 -ketotestosterone and progesterone were identified in various plasma samples but not correlated to oocyte maturation. [...] Cortisone, deoxycorticosterone, 17 α-hydroxy progesterone or 20 β dihydro- 17 α-hydroxy progesterone induced maturation of oocytes incubated in plasma from male fish but appeared to have no conclusive effect upon oocytes incubated in artificial media. Injection of these steroids, estradiol-benzoate or testosterone into hypophysectomized fish did not induce oocyte maturation or ovulation. [...] A salmon gonadotropic preparation (SG-G 100) or extracts of P. americanus <b>pituitaries</b> induced some oocyte maturation in vitro. Both a glycoprotein preparation from H. platessoides <b>pituitaries</b> and SG-G 100 induced oocyte maturation and ovulation when injected into hypophysectomized fish...|$|R
40|$|Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and somatolactin (SL) {{are both}} {{peptides}} {{that have been}} located in PAS+ve pars intermedia (PI) cells of teleost fishes. In mammals and the chick PTHrP is a hypercalcaemic factor causing lysis of bone calcified matrix and inhibiting phosphate excretion via the kidney.

40|$|Hamsters exposed {{for eight}} weeks to short {{photoperiod}} (LD 10 : 14) or treated with melatonin {{in the late afternoon}} under long photoperiod (LD 14 : 10) had significantly higher number of cytosolic androgen receptors in the <b>pituitaries,</b> hypothalami and harderian glands, as compared to the long photoperiod (LD 14 : 10) exposed controls. The numerical value of the apparent Kd was two to three times lower in the hypothalami and <b>pituitaries,</b> but not in the harderian glands of the animals from these groups. These results indicate that alterations in receptor numbers and affinity constants may be responsible for the dramatic changes in the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to the negative feedback actions of the gonadal steroids, observed under inhibitory photoperiods and that this effect could be duplicated by late afternoon melatonin treatment...|$|R
5|$|The <b>pituitary</b> {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various {{theories}} were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to <b>pituitary</b> tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The <b>pituitary</b> gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior <b>pituitary.</b> The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
5|$|Unless the <b>pituitary</b> {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a {{particular}} hormone, it {{is the lack of}} <b>pituitary</b> hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the <b>pituitary</b> stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of <b>pituitary</b> disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of <b>pituitary</b> surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the <b>pituitary,</b> which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the <b>pituitary,</b> and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E
