50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} underlying theological concepts for dispensationalists is progressive revelation. While some nondispensationalists start with progressive revelation in the New Testament and refer this revelation back into the Old Testament, dispensationalists begin with progressive revelation in the Old Testament and read forward in a historical sense. Therefore, there is an <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> discontinuity as seen in Scripture. Biblical covenants are intricately tied to the dispensations. When these Biblical covenants are compared and contrasted, the result is a historical ordering of different dispensations. Also with regard to the different Biblical covenant promises, dispensationalists <b>place</b> more <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> whom these promises were written, the original recipients. This has led to certain fundamental dispensational beliefs, such as a distinction between Israel and the church.|$|R

50|$|Deontological ethics, {{sometimes}} referred to as duty ethics, <b>places</b> the <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> adhering <b>to</b> ethical principles or duties. How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics. One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the Divine Command Theory. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical realism, in that it postulates the existence of moral absolutes that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances. For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of Immanuel Kant.|$|R

In doing so, the Special Issue makes a threefold contribution: it analyses how key themes with world politics are reproduced and narrated; it demonstrates the need to go beyond ‘methodological elitism’ in understanding narratives, legitimacy, and world politics; and it highlights some of the methodological and practical issues in researching everyday narratives. In this introductory article, we situate the Special Issue within a critique of constructivist methodology broadly conceived, conceptualise everyday sites of politics, and finally, provide an overview of the articles in the issue...|$|R

Dose-response studies on gastroprotection in stress and indomethacin- induced ulcer and inhibition of pylorus ligation-induced acid secretion indicate that omeprazole significantly blocks gastric lesions at lower dose (2. 5 mg/kg) without inhibiting acid secretion, suggesting an independent mechanism for its antiulcer effect. Time course studies on gastroprotection and acid reduction also indicate that omeprazole almost completely blocks lesions at 1 h when acid inhibition is partial. The severity of lesions correlates well with the increased level of endogenous hydroxyl radical (_OH), which when scavenged by dimethyl sulfoxide causes around 90...|$|R
