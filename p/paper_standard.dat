500|$|The BBC officially {{announced}} that Minogue was to feature as Astrid in the episode [...] "Voyage of the Damned" [...] on 3 July 2007. The official announcement followed rumours regarding Minogue's casting having already circulated in the press, although the episode's writer Russell T Davies had denied these rumours in in-house BBC publication Ariel {{in an attempt}} to keep the news secret for longer. Furthermore, Minogue herself had confirmed that she would be appearing in the episode in InStyle magazine, whilst the London <b>paper</b> <b>Standard</b> Lite published a photograph of Minogue's creative director Will Baker carrying a 'to do list' with a note about a Doctor Who script on it, thus indicating that Minogue would be in the episode. Minogue had also been sighted filming for Doctor Who by members of the public before the official announcement of her casting. Baker, a long-term Doctor Who fan, was largely responsible for Minogue's casting by setting up a meeting between her, Davies and Julie Gardner. Davies has claimed that Minogue was keen to appear on Doctor Who to relaunch her acting career.|$|E

50|$|Cappiello’s {{career as}} a poster artist began in earnest in 1900 when he began a {{contract}} with the printer Pierre Vercasson. In this period, the printers would act as an agent for artists and commission work to them. Vercasson had a print house, and his goal was to bring vibrant and colour to the streets of Paris, he wanted the posters that he produced to stand out from the rest and attract lucrative new advertisers to his agency. Of course living in Paris, he was aware of the current art scene, and had seen many examples of Cappiello’s work, including a small number of posters already produced and in particular those for Le Frou-Frou. He knew that Cappiello had the potential to be exactly what he was looking for. The relationship commenced with the arrangement that Vercasson would find the clients and brief Cappiello on the product. It was then up to Cappiello to produce a sketch for the client for which he would receive the fee of 500 francs, a good amount at the time. Once the design had been approved by the client a full size design would be produced for the poster at a size of 1x1.4m, an old French <b>paper</b> <b>standard</b> known as the Double Grand Aigle. Cappiello would also be responsible for ensuring the successful transfer of the design onto lithographic stone ready for printing.|$|E

The focus in this comparison is conserva-tiveness. The concept of conservativeness is based on the relationship between the in-control ARL and the false alarm probability function by regarding the Cusum statistic as a Markov process. The comparison shows that standard Cusum charts are conservative in contrast to FIR Cusum charts. Moreover, the concept of false alarm probability function provides an easy probabilistic interpretation of the in-control ARL. ...|$|E
