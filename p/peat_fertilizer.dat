40|$|Carbon {{stock on}} peatlands {{are large and}} will be easily emitted if the land is opened or drained, {{therefore}} the measurements of carbon stocks and ash content are important to know the amount of emissions and agricultural sustainability in peatlands. This study aimed to determine carbon stock and ash content on peatlands in the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF) located in South Kalimantan on the geographic position S. 03 ° 25 ’ 52 " and E. 114 ° 47 ’ 6. 5 ". The experiment consisted of six treatments of ameliorant materials namely; mineral soil, <b>peat</b> <b>fertilizer</b> A, <b>peat</b> <b>fertilizer</b> T, manure, ash, and control. The {{results showed that the}} variation of peat soil properties was very high at this location. Peat thickness ranged from 36 - 338 cm, and this led to high variations in carbon stocks ranged between 161. 8 – 1142. 2 Mg ha- 1. Besides ash contents of the soil were also highly varied ranged from 3. 4 – 28. 5 %. This natural variation greatly affected the ICCTF study design. Mineral soil treatment had a mean carbon stock (961. 3 ± 61. 5 Mg ha- 1) which was higher and different from other treatments. High ash content was obtained in the ash treatment (18. 6 ± 2. 5 %) and manure (15. 7 ± 3. 6 %). It is recommended that the analysis of plant responses and greenhouse gas emissions using a single regression analysis and multiple regression with ash content as one of the independent variables are needed...|$|E

The research aimed {{to study the}} effect of peatland amelioration on oil palm and rubber carbon stock improvement. Research was conducted from August 2013 until June 2014.   The researches on oil palm were done in Arang-arang Village, Kumpeh Subdistrict, Muaro Jambi District, and in Lubuk Ogong Village, Bandar Seikijang Sub-district, Pelalawan District. Both  sites are in Jambi and Riau Province. The research on rubber was done in Jabiren Village, Jabiren Raya Subdistrict, Pulang Pisau District, Central Kalimantan Province. The study used a Randomized Completely Block Design (RCBD), in four treatments and four replications. The treatments were pugam (<b>peat</b> <b>fertilizer</b> enriched by polyvalent cation), manure; empty fruit bunch compost, and control (no application). The measurement of C stock was performed 10 months after application using nondestructive methods. The results showed that peatland amelioration treatments  had no significant effect to improve C stock on oil palm in 6 years old and 7 years old of rubber. After 10 months of amelioration application, the treatments increased C - stock of oil palm and rubber were 2. 1 - 2. 4 Mg ha- 1 and 5 - 11 Mg ha- 1, respectively.

40|$|Scirpus grossus L. is a {{principal}} rhizomatous weed in the rice fields, drainage and irrigation canals, river banks, abandoned rice fields and wasteland in Malaysia. This study describes the modular dynamics, spatio-temporal growth patterns of aerial plant and sub-terranean rhizome populations of this scourge on fertilized and unfertilized peat and paddy soils. The NPK fertilizer application at 100 : 30 : 30 ha- 1 resulted in more robust aerial plant growth with ca. 253. 5 ramets m- 2 (mean dry aerial biomass of 23. 2 g plant- 1) compared with 235. 6 ramets m- 2 (16. 3 g plant- 1) in unfertilized peat soils 24 weeks after planting of the mother plant. The parallel figures for plants growing on paddy soils of the Jawa series were ca. 97. 08 ramets m- 1 (12. 19 g plant- 1) (fertilized paddy soils) and 83. 67 ramets m- 1 (10. 89 g plant- 1) (unfertilized paddy soils) 24 weeks after planting of the mother plant. Mean ramets mortality was significantly higher in unfertilized paddy soils at 121. 3 ramets m- 2, while in the fertilized paddy soils this was only 34. 7 ramets m- 2, resulting respective net populations of ca. 218. 8 ramets m - 2 and 114. 3 ramets m - 2 in fertilized and unfertilized plots. In paddy soils mean ramets mortality in unfertilized paddy soils was ca. 8. 58 ramets m- 2, while this was only ca. 5. 67 ramets m- 2, leading to the respective resultant net populations of 91. 41 m- 2 and 75. 09 ramets m- 2. Flowering set in earlier among ramets in fertilized peat soils with 103. 2 ramets m- 2 vis-a-vis 77. 5 ramets m- 2, 24 weeks after transplanting of the mother plant in unfertilized soil. Flowering set in earlier among ramets in fertilized paddy soils with 49. 56 ramets m- 2 vis-a-vis the unfertilized soil registering ca. 47. 79 ramets m- 2, 24 weeks after transplanting of the mother plant. Fertilizer applications to either peat or paddy soils did not register any significant difference in mean plant height, chlorophyll contents, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements vis-a-vis those plants devoid of fertilizer application. No measurable differences were registered in rhizome lengths over time of S. grossus plants devoid of fertilizer application compared with those growing in fertilized peat soils. Similarly patterns were observed among S. grossus populations in both fertilized and unfertilized paddy soils. The time- and space-mediated clonal growth of S. grossus did not register any significant preferential directionality and dispersion of aerial plants and their sub-terranean rhizomes irrespective of fertilizer application or soil types, but rather displaying opportunistic resource capture by aerial and sub-terranean modules. ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests, response surface, fractal dimension and fractal topography analysis under fertilizer application factor and differences soils (peat soils - paddy soils) {{were used in the}} study from the first week to the 24 th week. Dispersion analyses of rhizomes was also employed. In circular statistics r (concentration), s (angular deviation), Rayleigh’s R and Rayleigh’s z were computed on the emerged ramets of S. grossus. Results of Rayleigh’s z test showed significant mean direction of ramets emergence for all replicates in the fertilized plots (p > 0. 01). Significant mean direction was obtained only for replicate R 1 for the unfertilized plots. No significant mean direction for replicates R 2 and R 3 of the unfertilized plots means that ramets emergence is distributed uniformly around the circle, that is originating from the mother plant. They occur when s, the dispersion given by the angular deviation is near the maximum (where 0 < s < 83. 01). Dispersion analysis of ramets by circular statistics on S. grossus generated no special preferences in the direction of modules or emerged ramets as explained by the Rayleigh’s r, Rayleigh’s z, and mean angle of dispersion in pest and paddy soils. However, there were heavier concentrations of ramets in the eastern sector of the plot, presumably due to phototropic effect of sunlight. In response surface analyses in peat soils results showed the stationary points obtained for the unfertilized plots is at x-distance = 0. 03 m, y-distance = - 0. 06 m and time (t) = 9. 8 months. This function predicted a maximum density of 178 plants m- 2 to occur at the location and time. For the fertilized plot, the stationary point is at x-distance = 0. 20 m, y-distance = - 0. 82 m and t = 11. 31 months. The predicted density obtained was 291. 02 plants m- 2. While in paddy soils the best location and time in unfertilized soil was between x- distance 0. 00 m and y- distance - 0. 14 m at t = 8. 16 month, while in fertilized soil the location was between x- distance - 0. 13 m and y- distance 0. 20 m and the best time at t = 8. 48 month. In fractal topography analysis results showed value fractal dimension from gl= 0 – gl= 100 between area-covering and ranched network (1 2). The area-covering concentrated at gl= 0 and gl= 40 in both peat and paddy soils (fertilized and unfertilized). While after gl= 100 – gl= 255 sporadic distribution (D- 0) in <b>peat</b> (<b>fertilizer</b> and unfertilized) and unfertilized paddy soils. While for fertilized paddy soil, gl= 100 – gl= 255. The fractal dimension analysis method allows the structural complexity of such associations to be compared between plant communities, with regard to their potential for soil resource acquisition and utilization. In peat soil, distinct and partly not significant differences are found (fractal dimension between 1. 52 ± 0. 53 and 1. 50 ± 0. 59) in unfertilized and fertilized plots. In paddy soil, fractal dimension between 1. 53 ± 0. 55 and 1. 52 ± 0. 49) in unfertilized and fertilized plots. We found distinct and partly not significant differences between plant in peat and paddy soils, when analysing many small units of a complex root system association. In larger plant communities, a broad variety of below-ground structures are recorded in its entirety, integrating the specific features of single sub-structures. In that way, extreme fractal dimensions are lost and the diversity decreases. Therefore, the analysis of larger units of root system associations provides a general knowledge of the complexity of root system structures for heterogeneous plant communities. Under the prevailing experimental conditions in the studies, the following conclusions can be drawn, viz: (i) The optimal period of clonal growth for Scirpus grossus, in general was between 10 - 18 weeks after planting; (ii) Augmentation with different NPK fertilizer concentrations and at different water depths had the following effects on S. grossus growth in both fertilized and unfertilized peat and paddy soils, (a) Increased rate of natality and the population number of ramets, fortified by enhanced proliferation of subterranean rhizomes; (b) Decreased rates of ramets mortality; (c) Increased rate and production of inflorescence of the weed; and (d) Enhanced production of biomass vis-a-vis the control of various plant components. However, the NPK fertilizer treatment did not {{have a significant impact on}} the plant height; chlorophyll content; and chlorophyll fluorescence, registering non-significant difference in both fertilizer and control plants; (iii) Fertilizer concentration with water depth did have a significant impact on the following parameters; namely (a) plant height; and (b) inflorescence number; (iv) Aerial modular growth, dispersion, response surface, plant topography-fractal analyses on emerged ramets, and fractal dimension boxing analyses of subterranean rhizome modules confirmed that the fertilizer treatment (at NPK 100 : 30 : 30) did not have a significant and prevalent impact on the growth patterns of S. grossus...|$|E

The HSs have interesting properties {{for use as a}} fertilizer since they improve the physical and chemical structure of the soil and provide a source of organic carbon which is readily absorbable by the plants, whereas potassium is a primary nutrient for plants. It was found that highly decomposed peats containing a small inorganic fraction are more favorable for the extraction of HSs. Using these <b>peats,</b> organic-mineral <b>fertilizers</b> that meet the Brazilian legislation have been obtained for a peat-extractant mixture containing 2. 57 wt% total organic content (TOC), a K 2 O/TOC ratio of 1 wt% and an extraction time of 12 hours...|$|R
40|$|Transformation {{of organic}} {{amendments}} in soil greatly affects its physical, chemical, and biological properties. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate changes of soil quality attributes in field plots after 3 - 5 years of annual paddy-upland crop rotation with various fertilizations since 1995. Other than the amendments of green manure, compost, and <b>peat,</b> chemical <b>fertilizer</b> N in the amounts of 33 % and 67 % of established N rate were complemented. Spring rice (Oryza sativa L.) and autumn maize (Zea mays L.) were planted each year. After the harvests of three to five maize and rice crops from 1998 through 2000, surface soil samples were collected from the plots of each treatment. Applications of organic materials to the plots prevented soil pH from decreasing, and increased the amounts of soluble salts. After rice harvest, the soil water contents at 0. 033 MPa tension were significantly greater in soils amended with peat and/or compost than that with chemical fertilizer and the check. The bulk density of surface soils of the field plots amended with organic materials was significantly lower than that of the check. After maize harvest, the differences in bulk density of the surface soils among the seven treatments were not significant. The percentages of water stable aggregate in 1 - 2 and 0. 5 - 1 mm. particle size fractions of the soils, amended with peat and compost, were significantly higher than those amended with chemical fertilizer and the check. Although chemical fertilizer played a significant role in governing the maize and rice yields, it did not significantly contribute to the improvement of some soil quality attributes.

So, how can growers deal with high energy {{costs in the}} greenhouse? The problem can be addressed in several different ways. Growers can conserve energy in the greenhouse, evaluate alternative or additional fuel sources or heating systems, evaluate growing temperatures and other production practices, consolidate operations into less space, critically evaluate when to bring the next greenhouse into production, and streamline operations. Regardless of what a grower does to reduce his energy use, he still has to examine {{how to pay for}} increased costs related to higher fuel prices.

This study reports the potential for natural and assisted revegetation by the dominant graminoids of the former plant communities at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba in the absence of goose foraging. Natural recolonization by P. phryganodes was observed within five years where edaphic conditions were suitable. Transplants of P. phryganodes established readily in an intertidal marsh, and growth was enhanced by amelioration treatments of <b>peat</b> mulch and <b>fertilizer</b> to the soil surface.

40|$|Abstract—Due {{to the low}} {{heavy metal}} concentrations, the bottom ash from a 32 MW {{municipal}} district heating plant {{was determined to be}} a potential forest fertilizer as such. However, additional Ca would be needed, because its Ca concentration of 1. 9 -% (d. w.) was lower than the statutory Finnish minimum limit value of 6. 0 - % (d. w.) for Ca in forest fertilizer. Due to the elevated As concentration (53. 0 mg/kg; d. w.) in the fly ash from the 32 MW municipal district heating plant, and Cr concentration (620 mg/kg; d. w.) in the ash fraction (i. e. mixture of the bottom ash and fly ash) from the 6 MW municipal district heating plant, which exceed the limit values of 30 mg/kg (d. w.) and 300 mg/kg (d. w.) for As and Cr, respectively, these residues are not suitable as forest fertilizers. Although these ash fractions cannot be used as a forest fertilizer as such, they can be used for the landscaping of landfills or in industrial and other areas that are closed to the public.

The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation <b>peat,</b> organic <b>fertilizers</b> and various loads in  forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the trailer wheels. Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate  distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and trailer wheels is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a clutch coupling is switched-on.

40|$|Organic soils in peatlands store a great {{proportion}} of the global soil carbon pool and can lose carbon via the atmosphere due to degradation. In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are attributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an extensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of δ 13 C, δ 15 N, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, δ 13 C depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper horizons. Depth profiles of δ 15 N differed significantly between sites with increasing δ 15 N values in the top soil layers paralleling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in <b>peat</b> decomposition and <b>fertilizer</b> application. At both grassland sites, the ash content peaked within the first centimetres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10 – 60 cm depth. The ash profiles, {{not only at the}} managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peatland was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW < GE < GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of younger peat material. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification...|$|R
40|$|Peat {{soil was}} {{renowned for its}} low {{nutrient}} availability which limits its potential for extensive agriculture use. Continuous shifting of aerobic and anaerobic condition due to fluctuating water table could lead to biogeochemical changes of the soil that could affect the cycling of nutrients in the peat system. Understanding such changes on the nutrient dynamics will help in the management and the agronomic practices of pineapple plantation on peat soil. This study assess the dynamics of N, P and K in peat soil under fluctuating water table using laboratory simulation and nutrient balance estimation approach. The effect of rainfall, fate of applied fertilizer and lime {{and the nature of}} peat were studied in relation to changes in N, P and K. In the study, Nitrogen continue to decrease together with available P and the exchangeable bases (K, Ca, Mg and Na) in pineapple-cultivated peat compared to undisturbed peat despite the application of fertilizer. This could indicate that the nutrients are heavily leached by the alternating water table or they are readily taken up by the growing pineapple crops or they are readily fixed by the acidic <b>peat</b> soil. <b>Fertilizer</b> requirement in this system is therefore high in order to cope with leaching, potential fixation and uptake activity. Very little NO 3 -N was detected in the NPK fertilized aerobic peat while the application of urea resulted in significant amount of NH 4 +-N found in both aerobic and anaerobic peat soil. The fluctuating water table in the peat profile which was significantly related with the amount of precipitation could have speed up the leaching of NO 3 "-N as it was highly soluble and unlikely to be adsorbed by the peat. The NH/- N ions is better retained by the peat due to its positively charged nature and those that are leached can still be trapped by the underlying mineral. The ability of the mineral soil to adsorb and release nutrient ions in particular the cations could allow for nutrient recharging of the upper layers of peat when water table is high. The simulation study in the laboratory using a designated soil column showed that the concentration of total N and mineral-N (NCV-N and NH/-N) was maximized when the water table was maintained at 40 cm. When the water table was fluctuated between 0 - 40 cm depth (representing the water table during wet season), soil available P reached its highest concentration in the soil. The fluctuation of water table between 40 - 80 cm depth (representing the water table during dry season) allows the gradual release of exchangeable K, Ca, Mg and Na. Without crops uptake, all of the treatments display a positive soil nutrient balance. In the presence of uptake by pineapple, a negative nutrient balance was observed for all treatments where the treatment with fluctuating water table between 0 - 40 cm recorded the highest nutrient deficiency. The study indicated that the fluctuating water table affects the different nutrients differently. Wet season tend to increase available P in peat soil while dry season encourage more decomposition and reduce leaching of major cations. Intermediate season tend to improve nitrate and ammonium availability in the peat system. Thus agronomic practices especially fertilizer application may have to take the rainfall factors into consideration...|$|R
40|$|Western Europe, {{approximately}} 25 % of the 200 {{million tons}} of municipal solid waste that is generated each year is of organic origin and therefore compostable. Presently 35 % of this organic waste is composted, resulting in 9 {{million tons of}} compost, and used mainly in agriculture, horticulture or hobby gardens. Increasing the opportunities to use compost in horticulture and agriculture as a (potting) soil amendment and nutrient source for plants and the soil microbial community would contribute to the recycling of waste and reduce the use of non-renewable <b>peat</b> and artificial <b>fertilizers.</b> This thesis is concerned with disease suppressive properties and phytosanitary aspects of compost. A major result of this thesis is that a compost cannot be simply assigned the label 'disease suppressive'. Its disease suppressive properties depend on both the plant species and pathogen species involved. Some composts {{were found to be}} highly disease suppressive for one or   a few pathosystems, but not for others. The same was the case if disease suppression was tested for one pathogen, Pythium ultimum, on multiple hosts. Although variation in disease suppression was found as function of compost, host species and pathogen species, stimulation of disease as an effect of compost application was the exception (3 % of the cases), and significant disease suppression (54 %) or no effect (43 %) the rule in a large experiment where 18 composts were tested with 7 pathosystems. Indications were obtained that the microbial change as affected by mixing compost with peat, both in the bulk mix {{as well as in the}} rhizosphere of the plants, is a parameter that correlates positively with disease suppression. Prediction of disease based on biotic and abiotic characteristics of compost was quite weak as compared to that based on the peat/compost mixes. The results indicate that there is scope for development of specialty products, designed for certain pathosystems. Different compost batches sampled at different times at the same composting facility showed rather similar levels of disease suppression. For assessing the phytosanitary risks associated with the application of compost it is necessary to include all risk factors and not only those occurring during composting. It seems safe to use composts produced from Vegetable, Fruit and Garden (VFG) compost although the conditions required for inactivation of some pathogens are still unknown. With respect to the assessment of the phytosanitary risks associated with composting itself, the determination of the degree of inactivation as function of temperature likely overestimates the temperature needed during composting, since other factors such as temporary anoxia, which brings about the formation of a range of toxic compounds, also contributes to inactivation of pathogens, as was shown here for Polymyxa betae, a pathogen of sugar beet...|$|R

Up to 2002, the experiment has been conducting for seven years. The site of experimental field is located in Taiwan Agriculture Research Institute and rice and maize are rotated to plant in the field annually. Fertilization of the field includes check, chemical fertilizer, swine compost, green manure, and <b>peat.</b> Organic <b>fertilizers</b> also added the amounts of 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of chemical fertilizer N. Surface soils of the plots were collected and their physical and chemical properties were analyzed after the harvests of crops. In addition, the development and contents of maize roots were observed by using minirhizotron observation system before the harvest of maize in January 2002. The results showed that the applications of swine compost and peat prevent pH values of the plot soils from decrease. Moreover, the applications of organic fertilizers to plot soils increase the amounts of soluble salts, the contents of surface soil organic C with particle-size of compost > green manure. The content of organic C with particle-size of 0. 25 - 1 mm was the highest and that of particle-size of compost > green manure plots and that was more prominent in paddy field than in upland. The treatments of organic fertilizers decrease bulk density and increase field capacity and pore percentages of paddy and upland field. The development and contents of maize roots in peat and compost+ 2 / 3 N plots were higher than other plots and the correlation coefficients of the contents of maize root with bulk density and pore percentages were 0. 76 and 0. 82, respectively. To sum up, the applications of organic <b>fertilizers</b> and especially <b>peat</b> and swine compost improve soil physical and chemical properties of the plots, and promote the growth of maize roots. Furthermore, the efficiency of treatment was more prominent in paddy field than in upland. 水旱輪作為台灣較特殊之耕作制度，且針對台灣農地土壤有機質含量普遍低落而言，施用有機質肥料以增加土壤有機質來改善土壤物理、化學及生物性質是極為重要的。本研究目的在探討水旱輪作及不同施肥處理對土壤理化性質及玉米根系生長的影響。試驗至 2002 年為第七年，地點位於台灣省農業試驗所之試驗田，採取水稻和玉米輪作，施肥包括對照、化肥、豬糞堆肥、綠肥和泥炭，有機肥並補充不同的化學氮肥量，其用量為化肥處理氮量的 1 / 3 或 2 / 3 。作物收穫後採集表土分析其理化性質。並在 2002 年 1 月玉米收穫前以根系觀察系統觀察玉米根系的量。結果顯示，施用豬糞堆肥及泥炭能避免土壤pH值下降；施用有機質肥料增加可溶性鹽類含量；增加粒徑 堆肥>綠肥試區，而有機碳含量分布以 0. 25 -
