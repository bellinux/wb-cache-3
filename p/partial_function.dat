The task of the theoretical part is to define the notions of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> deficits and to explain their relationship to specific learning disabilities. It describes the characteristics of preschool age and options of development of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> in its course. It includes basic information about school maturity, pedagogical- psychological diagnostics of children in kindergartens. It mentions also the child's enrollment in the first grade of primary school and school attendance delay. The aim of practical part is to map the access of kindergarten teachers to options of development of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> in Karlovy Vary Region and Prague, comparing the survey results obtained in these two regions and supplement obtained data with the information gathered from the interview. Key words: <b>Partial</b> <b>functions,</b> deficits of <b>partial</b> <b>functions,</b> specific learning disabilities, preschool age, options of development of <b>partial</b> <b>functions,</b> school maturity, pedagogical- psychological diagnostics, compulsory education, [...] ...|$|R

Lenka Felcmanová ABSTRACT: Development of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> in preschool and early school age {{is an important}} part of school maturity and preparedness when entering the compulsory education. The goal of my dissertation was pointing out specific <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> and their substance and importance. Pointing out the diagnostic methods which discover potential deficit of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> in preschool and early school age. Introducing the stimulus programmes on individual deficits in weakened <b>partial</b> <b>functions.</b> As a method of the research was used quantitative and qualitative research. Analysis and interpretation of the research results were implemented as well. The research was implemeted in Preparatory class of Elementary school in Prague 10. Children from the preparatory class were divided in two groups. One group was consisted of children using the stimulus programme for development of <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> and the other group was without using the stimulus programme. The goal of my research part was to determine the development level of specific <b>partial</b> <b>functions</b> in case of children with the postponement of compulsory education in preparatory class at [...] ...|$|R
25|$|In a {{programming}} language where function parameters are statically typed, a function may {{be defined as a}} <b>partial</b> <b>function</b> because the language's type system cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the true domain.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{the natural}} {{logarithm}} function mapping the real numbers to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real {{is not a}} real number, so the natural logarithm function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, {{but it is a}} <b>partial</b> <b>function.</b> If the domain is restricted to only include the positive reals (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a total function.|$|E
25|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia like {{disorder}} (ATLD) is {{an extremely}} rare condition, caused by mutation in the hMre11 gene, {{that could be considered}} in the differential diagnosis of A-T. Patients with ATLD are very similar to those with A-T in showing a progressive cerebellar ataxia, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and genomic instability. Those rare individuals with ATLD who are well described differ from those with A-T by the absence of telangiectasia, normal immunoglobulin levels, a later onset, and a slower progression of the symptoms. Because of its rarity, it is not yet known whether or not ATLD carries an increased risk to develop cancer. Because those mutations of Mre11 that severely impair the MRE11 protein are incompatible with life, individuals with ATLD all have some <b>partial</b> <b>function</b> of the Mre11 protein, and hence likely all have their own levels of disease severity.|$|E

For example, [...] "halts or fails to halt on input 0" [...] is clearly true of all partial functions, {{so it is a}} trivial property, and can be decided by an algorithm that simply reports [...] "true." [...] Also, note that this theorem holds only for properties of the <b>partial</b> <b>function</b> implemented by the program; Rice's Theorem does not apply to properties of the program itself.

These complications depend on the choice of consequence relation and non-monotonic operators. In computer science applications such complications are undesirable, because they affect (semi-) mechanical reasoning methods, and make manual reasoning difficult for computer scientists who are not logicians.
