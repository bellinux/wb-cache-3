Hydrothermal heating, which may be expected in a radioactive waste repository, altered the clay minerals and shales {{and led to a}} decrease in their cation-exchange ca-pacity. Cesium sorption greatly decreased in micaceous vermiculite and in well-crystallized illites con-taining vermiculite upon hydrothermal treatment a 400 ~ and 300 bars pressure due to complete layer collapse. However, <b>poorly</b> <b>crystallized</b> illites heated as above showed either a small increase or only a slight decrease in Cs sorption because of partial ayer collapse. These studies how that he decrease in Cs sorption is greater in well-crysallized illites than in <b>poorly</b> <b>crystallized</b> illites when treated similarly under hydrothermal conditions. Hydrothermal heating of Cs-sorbed and Cs-saturated samples increased the amount of Cs fixation in all minerals and shales as a result of collapse of the layers. For example, asample of the Conasauga shale fixed only 18 % of sorbed Cs before treatment but fixed 47 % after hydrothermal treatment a 200 ~ and 300 bars pressure. Thus, hydrothermal conditions in a shale repository may be beneficial after leaked radioactive Cs ions are taken up by clay minerals in shales...|$|R

This work was carried out on soils developed on recent (94 % of sand) and exhibit a bleached E horizon that overlies a yellowish brown B horizon. The process responsible for their formation is podzolization promoted by the high permeability of the material and complexing organic matter produced by coniferous vegetation. Initial mineralogy of C horizons is homogenous and constituted of chlorite, illite, illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals, and kaolinite, quartz, calcite (≈ 8 % related to shell fragments), and feldspars. The initial clay-mineral assemblage of the E horizons is dominated by illite (well-crystallized WCI and <b>poorly</b> <b>crystallized</b> PCI) and chlorite. With progressive podzolization, <b>poorly</b> <b>crystallized</b> illite is first transformed to illite/ smectite mixed-layer minerals and in a further step into smectite. In addition, transformation of well-crystallized illite leads to formation of ordered illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals in the E horizons, which is not commonly described in soils. In the B horizons, illite/smectite mixed-layer minerals are present with traces of smectite, as well as Al and Fe oxi-hydroxides as revealed by DCB and oxalate chemical extractions.

The formation of the diphormic lay should depend only {{on the value of}} the [Na+]/[H § ratio, for the various temperatures u ed in the process. In a number of experiments, a few minerals of various types were subjected to this alteration process, carried out under a wide variety of conditions; namely, duration of the alteration treatment, clay and acid concentrations and value of the [Na+]/[H +] ratio. Formation of kaolinite, was not found but instead either an amorphous gel, or a well-crystallized boehmite, or else no dissolution at all of the initial mineral. We have already shown that a feldspar, when subjected to an alteration under similar conditions, never produces kaolinite, but forms a <b>poorly</b> <b>crystallized</b> boehmite instead.
