40|$|A physics based {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} random transit maritime traffic through the Strait of Istanbul. Based on the geographical characteristics of the Strait and random distributions of surface currents, arrival of transit vessels, vessel sizes and <b>pilotage</b> <b>error</b> in the Strait, the model computes probability distributions of northbound and southbound vessel positions within the Strait. When the <b>pilotage</b> <b>error</b> is zero, {{the perception of the}} surface currents and the handling of the ship is perfect. Deviating from this condition, the autopilot fails to handle the ship and perceive the surface currents perfectly. Hence, the deflection of ships from their original routes cause a distribution of vessel positions along established checklines. The results indicate that the effect of pilotage on the casualty risk depends on the vessel size and the position in the waterway. Using the geographical characteristics of the Strait, the model estimated the probability distribution of vessel casualties. Risk maps showing the expected number of accidents in different sections of the Strait are generated for different vessel sizes and casualty types including collion, ramming and grounding...|$|E
