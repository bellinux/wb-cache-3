5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two <b>people,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> court of law, and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice. In a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth criminal division of the court of justice in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E
