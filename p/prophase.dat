5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the <b>prophase</b> of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in <b>prophase</b> and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
25|$|High-resolution banding {{involves}} the staining of chromosomes during <b>prophase</b> or early metaphase (prometaphase), {{before they reach}} maximal condensation. Because <b>prophase</b> and prometaphase chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, the number of bands observable for all chromosomes increases from about 300 to 450 {{to as many as}} 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.|$|E
40|$|Fusing human HeLa {{metaphase}} {{cells with}} HeLa interphase cells resulted within 30 min {{in either of}} two phenomena in the resultant binucleate cell: either <b>prophasing</b> of the interphase nucleus or formation of a normal-appearing nuclear envelope around the metaphase chromosomes. The frequency of either occurrence was strongly dependent on environmental pH. At pH's of 6. 6 8. 0, <b>prophasing</b> predominated; at pH 8. 5 nuclear envelope formation predominated. Additionally, the frequencies of the two events in multinucleate cells depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. When the ratio was 0. 33 nuclear envelope formation predominated; when it was 2. 0 <b>prophasing</b> predominated. In their general features, the results with fused HeLa cells resembled those reported earlier with fused Chinese hamster Don cells. However, the results provided an indication that between pH 6. 6 and 8. 0 the HeLa metaphase cells possessed a much greater capacity than the Don metaphase cells to induce <b>prophasing.</b> Fusion of Don metaphase cells with HeLa interphase cells or of Don interphase cells with HeLa metaphase cells at pH 8. 0 resulted in nuclear envelope formation or <b>prophasing</b> in each kind of heterokaryon. As in the homokaryons, the frequencies of the two events in the heterokaryons depended on the metaphase/interphase ratio. The statistics of <b>prophasing</b> and nuclear envelope formation in the homo- and heterokaryon populations {{were consistent with the}} notion that disruption or formation of the nuclear envelope depends on the balance attained between disruptive and formative processes...|$|R

'Elegantissima' (TbE), containing paclitaxel (81. 6 µg/g fresh mass), on mitotic activity and DNA content in meristematic ` cells of Allium cepn adventitious root tips. During 24 hours of incubation we obtained different level of inhibition of mitotic activity: ranging from slight changes (dilution 1 : 32), through complete inhibition reversible in postincubation (dilution 1 : 8), to whole inhibition irreversible in postincubation (dilution 1 : 4). Inhibition of mitotic activity was connected with an increase of <b>prophases</b> and metaphases and changes in morphology of chromosomes (thick chromosomes of <b>prophases</b> with diluted karyolymph and c-metaphases). During the experiment, the number of aberrations and micronuclei didn't increase {{but the number of}} cells with replicated DNA (4 C) blocked in G 2 phase was higher. This study was done by a flow cytometry method. The optimal concentration of the TbE extract, which inhibited mitotic activity, did not damage the genetic material (chromosomes) visibly...|$|R
25|$|Proteins whose levels remain stable from <b>prophase</b> {{until late}} {{anaphase}} include constitutive {{components of the}} inner plate and the stable components of the outer kinetocore, such as the Ndc80 complex, KNL/KBP proteins (kinetochore-null/KNL-binding protein), MIS proteins and CENP-F.

25|$|Shugoshin (Sgo1, MEI-S332 in Drosophila melanogaster) are centromeric {{proteins}} {{which are}} essential to maintain cohesin bound to centromeres until anaphase. The human homolog, hsSgo1, associates with centromeres during <b>prophase</b> and disappears when anaphase starts. When Shugoshin levels are reduced by RNAi in HeLa cells, cohesin cannot remain on the centromeres during mitosis, and consequently sister chromatids separate synchronically before anaphase initiates, which triggers a long mitotic arrest.|$|E

Expression of four key DNA repair genes {{that are necessary}} for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes.

40|$|In Chinese hamster Don cells, {{fusion of}} an {{interphase}} cell with a metaphase cell resulted either in <b>prophasing</b> of the interphase nucleus, including {{loss of the}} nuclear envelope (NE), or {{in the formation of}} a double membrane around the metaphase chromosomes. Only one of these phenomena occurred in a given interphase-metaphase (I–M) binucleate cell. At pH 7. 4, there was about an equal probability that either event could occur amongst the population of I–M cells. The effect of pH changes in the medium containing the fused cells was examined. At pH 6. 6, <b>prophasing</b> was the predominant event; at pH 8. 0, membrane formation predominated. It was found that the rate of progression of a mononucleate cell from G 2 to metaphase was appreciably faster at pH 6. 6 than at pH 8. 0. Conversely, the progression from metaphase to G 1 was faster at pH 8. 0 than at pH 6. 6. These results with the mononucleate cells strengthen the hypothesis that structural changes in I–M cells are reflections of normal mitotic phenomena. Additional evidence for this hypothesis was produced by electron microscope examination after direct fixation in chrom-osmium. The double membrane around the chromosomes of the I–M cell was indistinguishable from the normal NE. The results obtained by varying the pH of the medium containing the fused cells provide an indication that disruption or formation of the NE of Don cells depends on the balance reached between disruptive and formative processes...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is complex and}} highly regulated.

These stages are <b>prophase,</b> prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.

500|$|In most {{eukaryotic}} cells, Kinesin-5 {{is thought}} to form cross-bridges between pairs of oppositely oriented microtubules in <b>prophase</b> and prometaphase and drives apart duplicated centrosomes during {{the formation of the}} mitotic spindle.

500|$|In 1995, Kinesin-5 was {{determined}} to be post-translationally phosphorylated within its C-terminal tail.

But the signals are much more intense on chromosome 9 than on chromosome 10 in metaphase. Pachytene chromosome has rDNA signal arrays on chromosome 9. Different phases are described and discussed. These results indicate that the activity of rDNA at individual loci may also vary through the cell cycle in rice. On extended DNA fibers, 45 S rDNA signals appear as strings of numerous red spots, but some signals are missed in some regions, probably result from weak signals or intergenic spacers...|$|R
40|$|Males from {{bilateral}} crosses between Triatoma sórdida and Triatoma pseudomaculata {{were unable}} to give offspring, as shown by subsequent backcrosses (BC) between hybrid males and parental females.

Addicional proof that sterility induced in hybrid males is at the sperm level has been afforded by the spermatogenesis herein studied. The anomalous processes like; 1) <b>prophases</b> of spermatogonia with the chromosomes scattered in the cytoplasm, 2) first metaphases with unpaired tetrades, 3) spermatids differing in size and 4) spermatozoa of abnormal shape and generdlly of giant size, can be taken as an indicator of the degree of departure from the normal course of spermatogenesis...|$|R

The majority (79 %) of leaf and calli (75 %) cells showed normal mitosis, however, cells with mitotic abnormalities were also found in both tissues. These included: polyploids, aneuploids, sticky chromosomes, double <b>prophases</b> and lagging chromosomes. Additionally, interphase cells with micronuclei or binucleated were also observed. The frequencies of these abnormalities were statistically different in calli and leaves. Calli showed a few other abnormalities such as c-mitosis, chained chromosomes, multipolar metaphases and chromosome bridges.

40|$|In a {{previous}} publication we demonstrated that in cells of Vicia faba micronuclei derived from whole lagging chromosomes or chromatids may perform DNA synthesis and mitotic condensation in synchrony with main nuclei and be regained by main nuclei {{at the next}} mitosis, giving rise to trisomic cells together with diploids. This process was called 'mitotic indirect non-disjunction' (MIND). In the present work the occurrence of MIND was studied in human lymphocytes cultivated in vitro. Human lymphocytes were treated with low colcemid concentrations until fixation; BrUdR was supplied together with colcemid to distinguish the number of mitoses performed by the cells (M 1, M 2 and M 3 cells). The frequencies of M 1 ana-telophases with single lagging chromosomes/chromatids and of M 2 + <b>prophases</b> with single micronuclei in synchronous motitic condensation with main nuclei were evaluated.

2500|$|Cyclin D is {{the first}} cyclin {{produced}} in the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. growth factors).

The hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the E2F responsive genes, effectively [...] "blocking" [...] them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to CDK2, forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G1 to S phase (G1/S, which initiates the G2/M transition). Cyclin B-cdk1 complex activation causes breakdown of nuclear envelope and initiation of <b>prophase,</b> and subsequently, its deactivation causes the cell to exit mitosis.|$|E

Therefore, a series of methoxylated analogues of RSV were prepared with the aim of increasing antitumour and proapoptotic activity. In a previous article, we studied two methoxy-derivatives, pterostilbene (PTERO) and trimethoxystilbene (TRIMETHOXY), in which the first was formed by the substitution of two hydroxyl groups with two methoxy groups (trans- 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 '-hydroxystilbene) and the second was formed by the replacement of all three OH groups with methoxy groups (trans- 3, 5, 4 '-trimethoxystilbene).

In the present article, we focused on the analysis of the ability of RSV and its two methoxylated derivatives to protect proliferating non-tumoural cells from the damage induced by ionising radiation (IR). First we showed that the methoxy derivatives, contrary to their parental compound, are unable to affect topoisomerase enzyme and consequently are not clastogenic per se. Second we showed that both PTERO and TRIMETHOXY more efficiently reduce the chromosome damage induced by IR.

In contrast concentrations higher than 60  ppm for 48  h were caused an inhibition effect for both plant. The root growth initiation was concentration and/or time dependent. The applied concentrations of BA showed a promotor effect on cell division in root tips of both plants and caused an increase in their mitotic index values (MI). The elevation in MI values in root tips of Nigella sativa L. was more evident than that of Allium cepa L.

All the applied concentrations of BA significantly induced a number of chromosomal aberrations in root tip cells of Nigella sativa L. and Allium cepa L. The total percentages of abnormalities in Nigella sativa L. root tip cells were more than that in Allium cepa L. with all concentrations of BA. The most dominant types of observed abnormalities were stickiness, bridges, and C-mitosis. BA treatments produced a number of mitotic abnormalities in dividing cells in root tips of both plants resulting from its action on the spindle apparatus such as C-mitosis, lagging chromosomes and multipolar at ana-telophases.

Specific studies were performed {{in the early seventies}} on animals stained in toto with acetic lactic orcein and squashed (Figs. 3 - 4; Bertolani 1971, 1975, 1982). Besides the definition of the chromosome number of several species (often n = 5 or n = 6), the main results were the identification of the polyploidy (triploidy and tetraploidy) and the definition of the cytology in the oocyte maturation of the parthenogenetic animals. Chromosomes always appeared small, without an evident centromere and similar {{to each other in the}} same plate and among the species. Oocyte chromosomes were clearly larger than those of the spermatocytes and of the mitotic divisions. More recently, Giemsa staining was applied to the eutardigrade Xerobiotus pseudohufelandi, in which diploid, triploid and tetraploid cytotypes were identified (Rebecchi, 1991). Triploidy and tetraploidy in tardigrades had been confirmed on the basis of the DNA content (Bertolani et al. 1987, 1994). Giemsa staining provides good details of the chromosome shape and confirms that M. richtersi is characterized by a chromosome set made up of very similar elements. Sex chromosomes are not recognizable. The kind of chromosome arrangement along the spindle fibers and the presence of a heterochromatic region on a telomere, evidenced by C-banding, allow us to conclude that all chromosomes of M. richtersi are acrocentric. There is only one NOR, localized on one extremity of one chromosome pair. It is evident in the oocyte <b>prophases.</b> In the oocyte metaphases the NOR could correspond to the most intense terminal dots that often characterize one of the six bivalents. As in other animals, the NOR coincides or is just adjacent the C-band site. The silver-positive regions located on one of the telomeres of all the other chromosomes of M. richtersi should correspond to the kynetochore, whereas the fainter regions located on the other telomere of all five bivalents resemble the “telochore” evidenced in the grasshoppers (Suja and Rufas 1994) ...|$|R
