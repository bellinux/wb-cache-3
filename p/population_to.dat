Using data on individually marked young and adult female reed buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) from 21 local populations studied over six years in northeastern Switzerland, we examined the source—sink status of small and large local populations with recently developed metrics. We hypothesized that including emigration <b>to</b> the <b>population</b> network (the C r metric) would classify more local populations as sources than when only focusing on the ability of local <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> maintain themselves (the Rr metric). We further tested the hypothesis that the relative contribution of small and large local <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> the <b>population</b> network does not differ.

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River.

5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants from returning. Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus.

The absence of the traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban <b>population</b> <b>to</b> be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to request from the government that Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E

40|$|Allozyme {{analysis}} was used to address the question of the source of the Australian populations of the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus (L.). The study had three major aims: (1) To compare the levels of diversity of Australian and Hawaiian populations with potential source <b>populations.</b> (2) <b>To</b> determine whether eastern and western North American populations were sufficiently divergent for the Australian <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> be aligned tea source <b>population.</b> (3) <b>To</b> compare the differentiation among regions in Australia and North America to test the prediction of greater genetic structure in Australia, as a consequence of reduced migratory behaviour. The reverse was found, with FST values an order of magnitude lower in Australia than in North America. Predictably, Australian and Hawaiian populations had lower allelic diversity, but unexpected higher heterozygosity values than North American populations. It was not possible to assign the Australian <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> a definitive source, although the high levels of similarity of Australian <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> each other suggest a single colonization event.
