In most developed countries, 220 V, 230 V, or 240 V sockets with earthed contacts were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120 V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally {{did not include a}} ground (earth) pin. In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. [...] For a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground. Normal imbalances in a split <b>phase</b> <b>distribution</b> system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages. Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice. For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.|$|E

While, as mentioned, the {{position}} of one contact is varied on the QD surface, the Fano parameter will only change sign if the ‘mobile’ contact crossed a nodal line (i.e., reached a zone with an opposite sign of the respective eigenmode). Therefore, one can map the sign (<b>phase)</b> <b>distributions</b> of the eigenmodes. The phase mapping of the eigenmodes on a 2 D surface {{was considered to be}} possible only for isospectral shapes, as proposed by Moon et al.[28] (see also[29, 30]). In pairs of isospectral shapes, the wave functions can be expressed in terms of each other, which brings a supplementary information, allowing to extract the <b>phase</b> <b>distributions,</b> if the amplitude distributions are known. Our proposed scheme makes use of the Fano effect and it is not necessary for the shape (for which the <b>phase</b> <b>distributions</b> are extracted) to be isospectral.

Although frontal-posterior global theta synchronization appears in modality-specific WM, local theta synchronization in frontal regions has been found in modality-independent WM. How frontal theta oscillations separately synchronize with task-relevant sensory brain areas remains an open question. Here, we focused on theta-alpha phase relationships in frontal areas using EEG, and then verified their functional roles with mathematical models. EEG data showed that the relationship between theta (6 [*]Hz) and alpha (12 [*]Hz) phases in the frontal areas was about 1 : 2 during both auditory and visual WM, and that the <b>phase</b> <b>distributions</b> between auditory and visual WM were different. Next, we used the differences in <b>phase</b> <b>distributions</b> to construct FitzHugh-Nagumo type mathematical models.
