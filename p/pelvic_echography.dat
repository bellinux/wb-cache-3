30|$|A {{total of}} 170 {{patients}} consecutively attending the Endometriosis Clinic of the Teaching Hospital of the School of Medicine, University of SÃ£o Paulo between February 2004 and October 2008 with an indication for videolaparoscopy based on clinical history, physical examination, <b>pelvic</b> <b>echography,</b> and MRI were evaluated {{according to the}} protocol used in cases of patients with a clinical suspicion of endometriosis.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{illustrate}} a particular clinical presentation of premature ovarian failure, we report {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old girl, who presented with primary amenorrhea. Physical examination discovered central obesity and an extent acanthosis nigricans in the neck and in the axillae. Pubertal stage was quoted S 3 P 3 and external genitalia were normal. Oral glucose test revealed glucose intolerance and hormonal investigation discovered hyperinsulinemia and elevated level of FSH. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>echography</b> found infantile internal genitalia and genetic analysis discovered a deletion in the long arm of one of X chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the Authors have {{obtained}} an ovulatory response using intravenous Gn-RH treatment in four patients with hypothalamic hypogonadotropic amenorrhea. The Gn-RH was administered in a pulsatile manner {{with a small}} portable autoinfusion pump (Autosyringe, Inc., Hooksett). The ovarian follicular maturation, as it appears from the <b>pelvic</b> <b>echography,</b> was perfectly similar to that observed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle. Endocrine picture by serial determination of gonadotropin; prolactin, estradiol and progesterone concentrations showed hormone values {{to be in the}} normal range. During the therapy no complications were observed; at the present time no pregnancy has occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is {{a disease}} connected with the inactivation of AR due to a mutation that inactivate male sexual differentiation, and causes a spectrum of phenotypic anomalies having as a common aspect the loss of reproductive characteristics. In this paper the clinical, endocrinological and molecular features of three patients are reported. The first case concerns a 17 years old patient, the second an infant suffering from inguinal hernia that has been surgically corrected when he was 3 months old and finally the third case concerns a 57 years old woman. All the subjects had a common primary amenorrhea and a following <b>pelvic</b> <b>echography</b> highlighted the absence of internal genital organs {{and the presence of}} a dead-end vagina. All the patients are characterized by a normal male karyotype and present on the short arm of the Y chromosome the SRY gene. Moreover, FISH revealed the presence of androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome and the SRY gene on the Y one. The automatic sequencing of the genes for the androgen receptor (AR) shows that each subject has a mutation in the gene for the androgen receptor (AR). These mutations are associated with complete androgen insensivity syndrome (CAIS). All the cases of study exhibited a negative family history for CAIS. This study confirms the need to perform a pelvic examination by means of echography in pre-pubertal and pubertal age to highlight the normality of the internal genitalia (uterus and ovaries). If a primary amenorrhea is checked, the karyotyping is compulsory. If a Morris's syndrome is suspected, it is of critical importance to find the rudimentary male gonads (by means of MRI, <b>pelvic</b> <b>echography,</b> laparoscopy) and surgically remove them to prevent the onset of malignancies (teratoblastoma, gonadoblastoma). Once the considered disease has been identified, a continuous psychological help can be considered useful for the patient and the family...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of central isosexual precocity, a condition {{much more common}} in girls than in boys, is currently viewed as a spectrum of disorders between isolated premature thelarche and borderline early puberty. In some countries, a trend may be seen toward onset of puberty at earlier ages. Integration of the clinical findings with bone age, <b>pelvic</b> <b>echography,</b> and hormonal data as well as follow-up ascertainment of progression of development is critical to define which patients should be proposed for therapy. The use of long-acting forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may not be indicated in slowly progressive variants or borderline early puberty {{because they do not}} affect final height. Preservation of height potential is particularly obvious in precocious puberty starting at young ages. In some selected patients, associated growth hormone therapy may increase adult height but further studies are warranted. The psychosocial and behavioral correlates of precocious puberty are an important and under investigated area. Peer reviewe...|$|E
