40|$|Mycobacterial disease, and {{particularly}} tuberculosis (TB), is an escalating problem in developing countries, fuelled by the parallel {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) pandemic. In TB endemic countries children carry a very high burden of disease, which may be unrecognised due to the difficulty in making a diagnosis based on clinical, radiological or laboratory methods. One of the main hurdles is the difficulty of obtaining adequate specimens for bacteriological confirmation of disease in children. TB lymphadenitis {{is the most common}} extrapulmonary manifestation of TB, and up to 22 % of children with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy and no local cause may have tuberculous adenitis. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), a simple and safe out-patient procedure that can be performed by nurses in resource-limited settings, and that provides material for direct microscopy as well as culture and susceptibility testing, provides an excellent opportunity to obtain bacteriological confirmation. However, it remains a greatly underutilised specimen collection modality.

40|$|Purpose: With growing {{interest}} in early imaging, the aim of our study was to define the most <b>practical</b> <b>modality</b> for routine clinical use for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN). We compared the sensitivity of enhanced computerized tomography (CT), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, and Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) by using clinical findings as the standard of reference. Materials and Methods: A total of 207 APN patients (191 women, 16 men; mean age, 49. 4 years; range, 17 - 88 years) were enrolled in this study. All the patients underwent imaging modalities during hospitalization. SPECT images were obtained 4 hours after injection of 99 m Tc-DMSA. Transverse and coronary CT images were obtained before and after injection of the contrast agent. DUS was performed in the longitudinal, transverse, and coronal planes. All the images were read independently by a single radiologist and a nuclear medicine specialist. The sensitivity of each modality for detecting APN was compared. Results: CT showed significantly superior sensitivity {{compared with that of}} DUS (81. 0 % vs. 33. 3 %, respectively, n= 147). DMSA scintigraphy also showed significantly superior sensitivity compared with that of DUS (74. 7 % vs. 33. 3 %, respectively, n= 150). Compared with DMSA scintigraphy, CT showed superior sensitivity, but the difference was not statistically significant (81. 0 % vs. 74. 8 %, respectively, n= 147, p= 0. 163). Conclusions: For cases of clinically suspected APN, CT and DMSA scintigraphy appear to be equally sensitive and reliable for detecting APN, although CT is more practical in various fields.

The poor image quality can be explained as a result of the substantial thickness and rather high density of the calcite mineral composing the examined canopic jars (mean 2215 HU, SD 160 HU), compared with the literature results for other minerals and non-metallic materials [7, 15]. Surprisingly, this did not much affect the CT scans, and — apart from slight beam hardening and cupping artefacts — no other masking effects could be found. Streaking artefacts were less of an issue due to the canopic jars’ cylindrical shape with a nearly symmetrical distribution of high-density areas along the z-axis.|$|R
40|$|Although {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{has been described}} as a potent angiogenic stimulus, its application in therapy remains difficult: blood vessels formed by exposure to VEGF tend to be malformed and leaky. In nature, the principal form of VEGF possesses a binding site for ECM components that maintain it in the immobilized state until released by local cellular enzymatic activity. In this study, we present an engineered variant form of VEGF, alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121, that mimics this concept of matrix-binding and cell-mediated release by local cell-associated enzymatic activity, working in the surgically-relevant biological matrix fibrin. We show that matrix-conjugated alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121 is protected from clearance, contrary to native VEGF 121 mixed into fibrin, which was completely released as a passive diffusive burst. Grafting studies on the embryonic chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in adult mice were performed to assess and compare the quantity and quality of neovasculature induced in response to fibrin implants formulated with matrix-bound alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121 or native diffusible VEGF 121. Our CAM measurements demonstrated that cell-demanded release of alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121 increases the formation of new arterial and venous branches, whereas exposure to passively released wild-type VEGF 121 primarily induced chaotic changes within the capillary plexus. Specifically, our analyses at several levels, from endothelial cell morphology and endothelial interactions with periendothelial cells, to vessel branching and network organization, revealed that alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121 induces vessel formation more potently than native VEGF 121 and that those vessels possess more normal morphologies at the light microscopic and ultrastructural level. Permeability studies in mice validated that vessels induced by alpha 2 PI 1 - 8 -VEGF 121 do not leak. In conclusion, cell-demanded release of engineered VEGF 121 from fibrin implants may present a therapeutically safe and <b>practical</b> <b>modality</b> to induce local angiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{the growth}} of new blood vessels from {{existing}} ones {{and it is a}} perquisite for the growth, invasion and metastasis of solid tumors. This complex process involves multiple steps and pathways dependent on the local balance between positive and negative regulatory factors, as well as interactions among the tumor, its vasculature and the surrounding extracellular tissue matrix. Tumors lay dormant yet viable, unable to grow beyond 2 - 3 mm 3 in size without angiogenesis. "nWith the development of novel therapies for treat-ment of several diseases, directed noninvasive imaging strategies will be critical for defining the pathophysiology of angiogenesis. Imaging modalities used to detect angiogenesis include PET, SPECT, MRI, CT, US and near-infrared optical imaging. For these modalities, methods have been developed to measure blood volume, blood flow and several other semi quantitative and quantitative kinetic hemodynamic parameters such as vascular permeability. Characteristic molecular makers of angiogenesis may be visualized with the aid of molecular imaging agents such as VEGFs or the &alpha; v&szlig; 3 integrin. "nMRI is a <b>practical</b> <b>modality</b> for assessing angiogenesis over time because it is already widely used clinically to assess tumor growth and for response evaluation. Anatomical information can be co registered with functional and molecular information within a single imaging method. Moreover, MRI does not involve ionizing radiation and the commonly used contrast agent has low toxicity.
