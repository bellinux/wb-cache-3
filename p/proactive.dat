5|$|On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the Best Free Software {{award from}} PC Advisor. In December the same year, it secured the Bronze award from AV-Comparatives for <b>proactive</b> {{detection}} of 55percent of new or unknown malware, the Silver award for low false-positives (six occurrences) and the Bronze award for overall performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} goal in locust control {{is the use}} of preventive and <b>proactive</b> methods that disrupt the environment to the least possible extent. This would make agricultural production easier and more secure in the many regions where growing crops is of vital importance to the survival of the local people.|$|E
5|$|These {{strategies}} are <b>proactive</b> and continuous for higher consequence, reactive and periodic for lower consequence. The {{strategies are}} reviewing for taxpayers {{more likely to}} break the law, and only monitoring for those less likely.|$|E
5|$|Women's rights – The ACLU {{works to}} {{eliminate}} {{discrimination against women}} in all realms. The ACLU encourages government to be <b>proactive</b> in stopping violence against women. These efforts are led by the ACLU's Women's Rights project.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both <b>proactive</b> {{government}} repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was <b>proactive</b> in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated {{but did not}} approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of the}} Fort Mohave group.|$|E
5|$|GTRI is {{the primary}} {{contractor}} of the Homeland Open Security Technology program, which aims to promote the creation and use of open security and open-source software in the United States government and military, especially in areas pertaining to computer security.

5|$|Guthy-Renker had a {{media budget}} of $200 million for <b>Proactive</b> as of 2010, {{much of it}} spent on air-time, and was {{spending}} another $12–15 {{million a year on}} celebrity endorsements. Justin Bieber for example, was paid $3 million over two years. Its infomercials have featured celebrities who have themselves suffered from acne problems; the list includes Kelly Clarkson, P. Diddy, Avril Lavigne, Lindsay Lohan, Alyssa Milano, Katy Perry, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears and Vanessa Williams.|$|E
5|$|Paranhos {{began to}} write {{articles}} in support of Brazil's <b>proactive</b> foreign policy, which brought him close to the ruling Conservative party. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulino Soares de Sousa (later the Viscount of Uruguai), appointed the Conservative Party's main leader, Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), as a special plenipotentiary diplomat for the Platine region. Unexpectedly, Carneiro Leão decided to take Paranhos as his secretary, passing over the more experienced members of Brazil's diplomatic corps. On 23 October 1851, both departed for Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{has been}} outspoken {{in support of}} the city {{settling}} the Jon Burge torture case, rather than continuing to spend money in the litigation process. Preckwinkle has also been <b>proactive</b> in the effort to pursue compensation for victims of police brutality in the Jon Burge cases and sought hearings on the initial special prosecutor's report. She has been a critic of the decades-long delay in settling the case, and she was a proponent of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was <b>proactive</b> in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more <b>proactive</b> anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately <b>proactive).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more <b>proactive</b> recruitment of students.|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate <b>proactive</b> investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's <b>proactive</b> role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2009, Mills {{opened a}} vegan {{restaurant}} called VBites at Hove Lagoon, Hove, Sussex. Mills {{is quoted as}} saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very <b>proactive</b> in the building stages and now that it was open, would give as much time to it as she could – working it around her charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E
5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more <b>proactive</b> in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 was {{the last}} of three {{particularly}} devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan, the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835. While very destructive, the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction. In 1815, city officials had banned new construction of wood-frame structures in the densest areas of the city. The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions, as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as stone, masonry, and iron roofs and shutters. In spite of general improvements, the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more <b>proactive</b> stance in fire prevention and firefighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was <b>proactive</b> in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Army {{management}} of Yellowstone {{was so successful}} that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia, Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy. <b>Proactive</b> actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to {{the passing of the}} Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.|$|E

25|$|Roman {{military}} engineering took both routine and extraordinary forms, the former a <b>proactive</b> part of standard military procedure, {{and the latter}} of an extraordinary or reactionary nature. <b>Proactive</b> {{military engineering}} {{took the form of}} the regular construction of fortified camps, in road-building, and in the construction of siege engines. The knowledge and experience learned through such routine engineering lent itself readily to any extraordinary engineering projects required by the army, such as the circumvallations constructed at Alesia and the earthen ramp constructed at Masada.|$|E
