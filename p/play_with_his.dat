5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.|$|E
5|$|As quarterback, Georgia Tech's Josh Nesbitt {{was the top}} performer. In {{addition}} to his rushing performance, Nesbitt completed 9 of 16 pass attempts for 136 yards and one touchdown. On {{the opposite side of}} the field, Clemson's Kyle Parker was successful on 10 of his 17 pass attempts for 91 yards, but also had two interceptions, the game's only turnovers. Nesbitt set an ACC Championship Game record for longest pass <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> 70-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas in the third quarter. The two teams also set records for total offense: Georgia Tech's 469 total yards and Clemson's 414 total yards each broke the previous record for total offense, as did each team's rushing total break the previous team rushing record.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, {{but when he was}} in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> children.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff {{of the second}} half, Derrick Henry forced a Keon Hatcher fumble that was {{recovered}} by Eddie Jackson for the Crimson Tide. Three plays later, Alabama led 35–0 after McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to O. J. Howard. On their next offensive drive, T. J. Yeldon scored on a 24-yard touchdown run that extended the Crimson Tide lead to 42–0. The Alabama defense then had their second Allen interception of the evening on the Razorbacks possession that ensued with Cyrus Jones' play at the 47-yard line. With the offensive reserves in the game, Blake Sims led the team to a 45–0 lead after Cade Foster connected on a 48-yard field goal. Henry then made the final score 52–0 {{in the final minute}} of <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> 80-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks 14–8 (17–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E

5|$|Unsigned by the Kings {{two years}} after his NHL draft, he became a free agent in the 2004 off-season. On June 7, 2004, he was signed by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He began his {{professional}} career with Anaheim's minor league affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2004–05. During that season, he had a second opportunity to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother, Reagan Rome, as the latter was called up from Cincinnati's ECHL affiliate, the Reading Royals, for two games. Playing 74 games in his rookie AHL season, he scored 2 goals and 16 points. He helped Cincinnati to {{the second round of}} the 2005 playoffs, adding 3 goals and 6 points over 12 post-season games.|$|E

25|$|The tenth book {{is by far}} the lengthiest, {{taking up}} almost one quarter of the entire Bhagavata. While the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita show Krishna in various roles as teacher and diplomat, book 10 shows Krishna simply {{engaging}} in lila, or divine and intimate <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> devotees. It presents this intimate relationship with God as the highest goal of human existence.|$|E
25|$|Charles Laughton (1 July 1899– 15 December 1962) was an English {{stage and}} film actor, director, {{producer}} and screenwriter. Laughton was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and first appeared professionally {{on the stage}} in 1926. In 1927, he was cast in a <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> future wife Elsa Lanchester, with whom he lived and worked until his death; they had no children.|$|E
25|$|Fritz {{was a quiet}} child, {{with few}} friends his own age or gender and who seldom socialized with any {{children}} other than his siblings outside of school. From an early age, Haarmann's behavior was noticeably effeminate: {{he was known to}} shun boys' activities and instead <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sisters' dolls and dress in their clothes.

25|$|On 24 June 1806, while {{attending}} a theater <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family, the viceroy received news that British ships have been sighted along the coast.

Sobremonte left the play early going to Buenos Aires Fort, where he wrote an order to organize the defense. The next morning, the enemy's ships were sighted again on the Buenos Aires coast and cannon was shot from the fort with no effect.|$|E
25|$|Again {{produced}} by Alkam films, Starewitch made Nose to Wind, which tells {{the adventures of}} Patapouf, a bear who escapes from school to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friends the rabbit and the fox. That year, his wife Anna died. Due to the success from the previous film, Winter Carousel was made, starring the bear Patapouf and the rabbit going through seasons. This was his last completed film. All his family co-labored on it, as remembers his granddaughter Léona Béatrice, whose hands {{can be seen in}} animation tests from Like Dog and Cat, Starewitch's unfinished film.|$|E
25|$|Another European {{adaptation}} came in 1637, when Dutch dramatist Jan Vos wrote {{a version}} of the play entitled Aran en Titus, which was published in 1641, and republished in 1642, 1644, 1648 and 1649, illustrating its popularity. The play may have been based on a 1621 work, now lost, by Adriaen Van den Bergh, which may itself have been a composite of the English Titus and the German Tito Andronico. Vos' play focuses on Aaron, who, in the final scene, is burned alive on stage, beginning a tradition amongst adaptations of foregrounding the Moor and ending the <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> death.|$|E

25|$|Thanos {{was born}} on Saturn's moon Titan, and is the child of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such shares the {{physical}} appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother attempted to kill him. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist and would only <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually {{falling in love with}} the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death. As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers mystically and artificially. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by starting a family. He is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his family.|$|E
25|$|The New England Revolution and FC Dallas {{began the}} year as the league's {{dominant}} teams, especially when Dallas acquired Carlos Ruiz in a trade after Landon Donovan returned from a disappointing stint with Bayer Leverkusen and wanted to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hometown Los Angeles Galaxy. Injuries and inconsistent play slowed FC Dallas down as the season wore on, and the 2001 and 2003 MLS Cup champion San Jose Earthquakes eventually won the regular-season Supporters' Shield with the third-best record in the league's 10-year history. FC Dallas opened its new stadium, Pizza Hut Park, in August, although it did not operate at full capacity until November. As he did at the Home Depot Center, Ruiz scored the first two goals in the new stadium in a 2-2 tie against the MetroStars.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2005, {{free agent}} defenseman Scott Niedermayer {{signed with the}} Mighty Ducks to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost {{immediately}} named team captain. On August 22, Teemu Selanne returned to Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006. The 2005–06 season also saw the emergence of rookies Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Chris Kunitz (Kunitz also played for the Ducks in 2003–04, but immediately returned to the Mighty Ducks' AHL affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks). On November 15, 2005, Anaheim traded Sergei Fedorov and a fifth-round draft pick to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for defenseman Francois Beauchemin and forward Tyler Wright.|$|E
