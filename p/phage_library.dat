Development of a simple method to access greater library diversities could expedite and expand the technique. This paper reports progress toward harnessing the naturally occurring diversity generating retroelement used by Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteriophage to alter its tail-fiber protein.

In this report a VH fusion <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> containing VH domains unassociated with VL domains was compared with a scFv fusion <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> as a source of melanoma-specific clones; both libraries contained the same VH domains from the vaccinated melanoma patient. The results demonstrate that the clones can be isolated from both libraries, and that both libraries should be used to optimize the chance of isolating clones binding to different epitopes. Although this strategy has been tested only for melanoma, it is also applicable to other cancers. Because of their small size, human origin and specificity for cell surface tumor antigens, the VH and scFv molecules have significant advantages as tumor-targeting molecules for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and can also serve as probes for identifying the cognate tumor antigens...|$|E

40|$|AbstractImproper {{protein folding}} or {{aggregation}} can frequently {{be responsible for}} low expression and poor functional activity of antibody fragments secreted into the Escherichia coli periplasm. Expression issues also can affect selection of antibody candidates from <b>phage</b> <b>libraries,</b> since antibody fragments displayed on phage also are secreted into the E. coli periplasm. To improve secretion of properly folded antibody fragments into the periplasm, we have developed a novel approach that involves co-expressing the antibody fragments with the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase, FkpA, lacking its signal sequence (cytFkpA) which consequently is expressed in the E. coli cytosol. Cytoplasmic expression of cytFkpA improved secretion of functional Fab fragments into the periplasm, exceeding even the benefits from co-expressing Fab fragments with native, FkpA localized in the periplasm. In addition, panning and subsequent screening of large Fab and scFv naïve <b>phage</b> <b>libraries</b> {{in the presence of}} cytFkpA significantly increased the number of unique clones selected, as well as their functional expression levels and diversity...|$|R
40|$|In {{search of}} methods to {{identify}} bio-active ligands specific for G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane spanning regions, {{we have developed}} a filamentous phage-based selection and functional screening method. First, methods for panning peptide phage on cells were established, using the hormone somatostatin as a model. Somatostatin was displayed {{on the surface of}} filamentous phage by cloning into phage(mid) vectors and fusion to either pIII or pVIII viral coat proteins. Peptide displaying phage bound to a polyclonal anti-somatostatin serum, and, more importantly, to several somatostatin receptor subtypes (Sst) expressed on transfected CHO-K 1 cells, in a pattern which was dependent on the used display method. Binding was competed with somatostatin, with an IC 50 in the nanomolar range. The phage were specifically enriched by panning on cells, establishing conditions for cell selections of <b>phage</b> <b>libraries.</b> Binding of somatostatin displaying phage to sst 2 on a reporter cell line, in which binding of natural ligand reduces secretion of alkaline phosphatase (via a cyclic AMP responsive element sensitive promoter), proved that the phage particles act as receptor-specific agonists. Less than 100 phage particles per cell were required for this activity, which is approximately 1000 [*]fold less than soluble somatostatin, suggesting that phage binding interferes with normal receptor desensitization and/or recycling. The combination of biopanning of <b>phage</b> <b>libraries</b> on cells with functional screening of phage particles for receptor triggering activity, may be used to select novel, bio-active ligands from <b>phage</b> <b>libraries</b> of random peptides, antibody fragments, or libraries based on the natural receptor ligand...|$|R

To further define the N-terminal MoAb epitope, sequencing of N-terminal MoAbs reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using M 13 gene VIII 5 C 4 C 4 phage Iibrary and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane and in capture ELISA. revealed a motif of S-T-P which does not correspond to 4 - 17 aa of GAD- 65 and does not overlap with the previous motif of the N-terminal MoAb. i. c. P-G-S-G-F-W-S-F (4 - 10 aa) of GAD- 65. Therefore, the M 13 pVIlI 5 C 4 C 4 worked with N-terminal MoAb by expressing a relevant sequence for the N-terminal MoAb but which is unlike its epitope in GAD- 65. To further define the N-terminal MoAb epitope sequencing of N-terminal MoAb reactive peptides, which were obtained from the successful biopanning using T 7 gene X linear 9 -mers <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane revealed a motif of P-X-X-G which may correspond to 4 - 7 aa of GAD- 65 (P-G-S-G) which overlaps with the previous motif P-G-S-G-F-W-S-F (4 - 10 aa). Sequencing of GAD- 6 MoAb reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using T 7 gene X C 9 C <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane and in ELISA, revealed two different motifs of R/K-L/ A/I-x-K and M-x-x-A which showed conservative substitutions and may correspond to the position 525 - 52 X and of GAD- 65 (R-L-S-K) and to the position 523 - 526 aa of GAD- 65 (M-S-R-L) respectively, which overlap with each other. To further define the GAD- 6 epitope sequencing of GAD- 6 reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using T 7 gene X linear 9 -mers <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane revealed a motif of R-x-x-K, which may correspond to 525 - 528 aa of GAD- 65 (R-L-S-K) and overlaps with the previous motif of the GAD- 6 selected from T 7 gene X C 9 C <b>phage</b> <b>library.</b> To further define the GAD- 6 epitope sequencing of GAD- 6 reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using M 13 gene VIII 5 C 4 C 4 <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane and in capture ELISA revealed a motif or M-x-x-A which may correspond to 523 - 526 aa of GAD- 65 (M-S-R-L), and overlaps with the previous motif selected from T 7 gene X C 9 C <b>phage</b> <b>library.</b> Thus, the overall motif or GAD- 6 may correspond to 523 - 528 aa of GAD- 65 (M-S-R-L-S-K). To further define the GAD- 6 epitope, sequencing or GAD- 6 reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using MI 3 gene III C 7 C and linear 12 -mers phage libraries, did not show a clear motif and did not show reactivity with GAD- 6 by capture ELISA. A possible explanation for this is that the peptides which are specific to GAD- 6 are not present in these M 13 pIII phage libraries. Sequencing of b 96. 11 huAb reactive peptides, which were obtained from the successful biopanning using M 13 gene III linear 12 -mers <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by moderate affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane revealed two different motifs of IV-T/S-A/G/L-T/S-AŁ and S-T/S-G/A/L/I which showed conservative substitutions and may correspond to the position 332 - 336 aa of GAD- 65 (V-S-A-T-A) and to the position 338 - 340 aa of GAD- 65 (T-T-V). respectively. Thus the overall motif of b 96. 11 might correspond to 332 - 340 aa of GAD- 65. In a capture ELISA system for the detection of GAD- 65 specific antibodies, b 78 huAb bound slightly better with GAD- 6 (rather than N-terminal MoAb) as the capture MoAb but b 96. 11 bound much better with GAD- 6 as the capture MoAb. This might suggest that GAD- 6 does interfere with b 78 huAb binding to GAD- 65 more than it does with b 96. 11 huAb. However it must also suggest that the GAD- 6 and b 78 huAb epitopes are not directly overlapping. Sequencing of SMS sera reactive peptides which were obtained from the successful biopanning using M 13 gene III linear 12 -mers <b>phage</b> <b>library</b> and were selected by moderate affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane revealed two different motifs of L/A-A-x-T/S-R/H/K and of T/S-T-V-I/L-F-E-L/G/I/V/A-H/K-L/G-x-K/R which showed conservative substitutions and may correspond to the position 371 - 375 aa of GAD- 65 (L-L-M-S-R) and to the position 463 - 472 aa of GAD- 65 (T-T-G-F-E-A-H-V-D-K). respectively. as public epitopes of SMS patients' sera. Sequencing of 76 B and 76 F MoAbs reactive peptides, which were obtained from the successful biopanning using T 7 gene X C 9 C and M 13 gene III linear 12 -mers phage libraries and were selected by high affinity binding in immnuo-blotting assay using nitro-cellulose membrane and in ELISA, revealed that the most significant motif recognised was D-x-K-P-L-S and F-x-Y-Q, respectively which may correspond to the position 477 - 482 aa of IA- 2 (D-Q-K-P-L-S) and to the position 626 - 629 aa of IA- 2 (F-E-Y-Q) respectively. The studies described in this thesis have shown that the epitope mapping of different antibodies on GAD- 65 and IA- 2 may help to understand the relationship between antigenicity and structure in these autoantigens which are targets in type I DM and related disorders (e. g.

In this work we varied in a combinatorial fashion the ring sizes of bicyclic peptides in <b>phage</b> <b>libraries,</b> expecting {{that they would}} yield binders with higher affinities and/or more diverse binding motifs that could be affinity matured. 14 new <b>phage</b> peptide <b>libraries</b> of the format Cys-(Xaa) m-Cys-(Xaa) n-Cys (Xaa are random amino acids, m and n = 3, 4, 5 or 6) were generated and cyclized with tris-(bromomethyl) benzene. Affinity selections against the tumor-associated serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator yielded bicyclic peptide inhibitors with a large variety of consensus sequences. Several of the identified consensus sequences were exclusively found in bicyclic peptides having defined ring size combinations. Some of these peptides may bind in orientations that allow affinity maturation of non-conserved regions, while others do not. Having available multiple leads isolated from such bicyclic peptide libraries with variable ring sizes could therefore be a great asset for the generation of high affinity binders...|$|R
