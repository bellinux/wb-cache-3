40|$|Supports {{for deep}} mine roadways located in soft {{surrounding}} rock face several problems: difficulty in applying pre-tightening force, low bearing capacity, and poor initial support. To solve these problems, this study proposes a high-pressure pre-tightening resin anchor with a compressed grouting body {{for use in}} soft and fractured rock surrounding a deep roadway. Using model experiments, we analyzed the anchorage performance of the proposed anchor and a conventional tensile-type anchor for three different values of the elastic modulus of the surrounding rock. The results showed that regardless of the surrounding rock type, the peak micro-strain (642 - 541) and displacement (6. 09 - 6. 5 mm) at the <b>pull-out</b> <b>end</b> of the proposed anchor were always smaller than the peak micro-strain (1433 - 1105) and displacement (8. 77 - 9. 2 mm) at the <b>pull-out</b> <b>end</b> of the conventional anchor. Furthermore, as the anchor's pre-tightening force increased from 20 kN to 120 kN, the anchor's strain remained concentrated over a length of 0. 4 m from the bearing end. Compared with conventional tensile-type anchors, the proposed high-pressure pre-tightening resin anchor with a compressed grouting body has a higher ultimate bearing capacity, allows the grouting length to be decreased to 0. 4 m, and provides initial support resistance...|$|E
