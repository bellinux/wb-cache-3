The goal {{was to develop a}} system capable of generating spatially and temporally stable concentration gradients of a chemotactic molecule while providing a viable environment for the cell. Numerical models were generated to investigate fluid flow in microchannels for given geometries. Through computational modeling and experimentally-driven iteration of the design, features of the chamber were determined and geometry was established. Prototypes of the system were fabricated using soft lithography and multi-layer soft lithography techniques. Three fluid delivery methods for establishing gradients in the system have been studied: gravity feed system, dual-syringe <b>pump</b> <b>feed</b> system, and integrated individually-controlled peristaltic <b>pump</b> <b>feed</b> system. We were able to create spatially and temporally stable gradients using the dual-syringe feed setup. Two syringes were used to pump a chemokine and a buffer in parallel channels that are connected by a cross-channel and terminated to a single output.

40|$|A new double-null, slotted {{divertor}} configuration will {{be installed}} for the DIII-D Radiative Divertor Program at General Atomics in late 1996. Four cryocondensation pumps, three new and one existing, {{will be part}} of this new divertor. The purpose of the pumps is to provide plasma density control and to limit the impurities entering the plasma core by providing pumping at each divertor strike point. The three new pumps are based on the design of the existing pump, installed in 1992 as part of the Advanced Divertor Program. The new pumps require geometry modifications to the original design. Therefore, extensive modal and dynamic analyses were performed to determine the behavior of these pumps and their helium and nitrogen feed lines during disruption events. Thermal and fluid analyses were also performed to characterize the helium two-phase flow regime in the pumps and their feedlines.

The study focuses on producing fruits and fiber powder as a means for easy transportation, storage and longer shelf life. The objective of this research work are to produce banana milk powder that can help children that suffers from constipation as well as to produce pineapple powder at lower inlet drying temperature. The effect of spray and freeze dryer were studied for banana milk powder, whereas, spray drying method was chosen for producing pineapple powder. The effects of the type of dryers, <b>pump</b> <b>feed</b> speed in the spray dryer and the ratio proportion of the banana milk powder were investigated in the study. The result indicate that increasing proportion ratio of the banana milk powder produced lower yield of the powder. It was also concluded that speed 2 was the ideal condition for banana.

3000|$|Coal-based {{electric}} power generation remains the basic source of obtaining energy. With increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, improving power unit efficiency has become an issue of utmost significance. Surely, one of the possibilities to improve the efficiency of new power units is raising the steam parameters. With improved power plant efficiency, there is a lower demand for power of almost all auxiliary equipment except the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that the power needed to drive the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is an almost linear function of the steam pressure. This means that, even though the steam mass flow (and, consequently, the feed water mass flow) is reduced and the efficiency of <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> is improved, their power increases. For this reason, it is very important to find the optimum drive of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The main aim of the conducted analysis was to compare various drive options of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> for a conceptual ultra-supercritical 900 -MW steam power unit.

30|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the impact of}} various factors {{affecting}} coal-fired power plant economics of 210  MW subcritical unit situated in north India for electricity generation. In this paper, the cost data of various units of thermal power plant in terms of power output capacity have been fitted using power law {{with the help of}} the data collected from a literature search. To have a realistic estimate of primary components or equipment, it is necessary to include the latest cost of these components. The cost analysis of the plant was carried out on the basis of total capital investment, operating cost and revenue. The total capital investment includes the total direct plant cost and total indirect plant cost. Total direct plant cost involves the cost of equipment (i.e. boiler, steam turbine, condenser, generator and auxiliary equipment including condensate extraction <b>pump,</b> <b>feed</b> water pump, etc.) and other costs associated with piping, electrical, civil works, direct installation cost, auxiliary services, instrumentation and controls, and site preparation. The total indirect plant cost includes the cost of engineering and set-up. The net present value method was adopted for the present study. The work presented in this paper is an endeavour to study the influence of some of the important parameters on the lifetime costs of a coal-fired power plant. For this purpose, parametric study with and without escalation rates for a period of 35  years plant life was evaluated.

40|$|A {{physical}} and mathematical model describing pulsation flow in centrifugal pumps and fans has been built. Numerical methods and software {{have been created}} to calculate the pressure fluctuation amplitudes in the discharge device of the centrifugal pump (fan) unit for the given operating conditions and geometry of the flow portion. The {{physical and}} mathematical model {{is based on the}} representation of the pulsation flow of a compressible working medium {{in the form of a}} vortex-type and an acoustical motion modes under the assumption of a two-dimensional subsonic isenthropic flow of a non-viscous fluid. The analysis of a flow in a centrifugal wheel by using the method of single vortices has been used to state the non-stationary boundary condition of a vortextype mode. A software package has been developed for the first time, which permits to optimize the flow portion of the centrifugal pump (fan) on a computer by means of a computational experiment in order to reduce the vibration intensity of the unit at a design stage without experimental expenditures. The method has been tested by comparing the results of the pressure fluctuation calculation with the experimental measurements made on a series of the pumps. The difference in the design and experimental data does not exceed 4 dB. The software and the results of the work have been used in the development of a number of the <b>pump</b> <b>feed</b> units of liquid propellant rocket engines and general-purpose commercial pumps.

Next to EN-protocol violations due to insufficient care, we hypothesized technical factors to be responsible for this deficit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems frequently used in the ICU. METHODS: Thirteen commercially available EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pumps</b> with their own delivery systems were tested in 12 sessions with different EN feeding tubes and EN formulas in a laboratory setting. The reproducibility of the measurements was determined for the 8 best performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. RESULTS: There were clinically important differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of EN in the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The deficit in volume ranged from + 66 mL (surplus of 66 mL) to - 271 mL (deficit of 271 mL) per 24 hours (14 % of prescribed volume). Viscosity of test fluids (water/EN feeding formulas) and resistance of test tubes had no influence on the delivered volume by the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems, because differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes were consistently found for each system while varying these test settings.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of currently planned exploration efforts, {{as well as}} those further in the future, require significant advancements in propulsion technologies. The current Lunar exploration architecture has set goals and mission objectives that necessitate the use of new systems and the extension of existing technologies beyond present applications. In the near term, the majority of these technologies are the result of a need to apply high performing cryogenic propulsion systems to long duration in-space applications. Advancement of cryogenic propulsion to these applications is crucial to provide higher performing propulsion systems that reduce the vehicle masses; enhance the safety of vehicle systems and ground operations; and provide a path for In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Use of a LOX/LH 2 main propulsion system for Lunar Lander Descent is a top priority because more conventional storable propellants are far from meeting the performance needs of the current architecture. While LOX/LH 2 <b>pump</b> <b>feed</b> engines have been used in flight applications for many years, these engines have limited throttle capabilities. Engines that are capable of much greater throttling while still meeting high performance goals are a necessity to achieving exploration goals. Applications of LOX/CH 4 propulsion to Lander ascent propulsion systems and reaction control systems are also if interest because of desirable performance and operations improvements over conventional storable systems while being more suitable for use of in-situ produced propellants. Within the current lunar architecture, use of cryogenic propulsion for the Earth Departure Stage and Lunar Lander elements also necessitate the need for advanced Cryogenic Fluid Management technologies. These technologies include long duration propellant storage/distribution, low-gravity propellant management, cryogenic couplings and disconnects, light weight composite tanks and support structure, and subsystem integration. In addition to the propulsive and fluid management system technologies described, many component level technologies are also required to enable to the success if the integrated systems. The components include, but are not limited to, variable/throttling valves, variable position actuators, leak detectors, light weight cryogenic fluid pumps, sensor technology and others.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Feed</b> <b>pumps</b> are an {{essential}} subsystem of boilers used in industrial process plants and called as boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> (BFP). Normally, BFP is high pressure unit that takes suction from condensate return system {{and can be}} of the centrifugal type pump. In centrifugal pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and exits radially. Generally, electric motor is used as prime mover to run the <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> To force water into boiler, the pump must generate sufficient pressure to overcome steam pressure developed by boiler. In the present study, design and analysis of boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> having a flow of 2000 m 3 /hr, head of 470 m and operating at 130 ± 10 o C has been taken up. The various pump parameters are obtained from design and pump model is developed using modelling software Creo Parametric. To evaluate the results at given operating conditions, CFD analysis is carried out using Ansys CFX module. Blade number has great influence on the pump performance. Therefore, CFD analyses are carried out for the pump with 5, 6 and 7 blades. Based on performance of every pump model, the best <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> design is selected.
