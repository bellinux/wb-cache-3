Starting with {{the failure of the}} attempt to establish closer links between the <b>departmental</b> <b>directorates</b> for urban development and the <b>departmental</b> <b>directorates</b> for agriculture and forestry in 1993, the article aims to throw light on the delicate situation of devolved services after the decentralisation process begun in 1982 and the difficulty of finding an adequate response {{in the context of an}} active reform policy. Given the importance of the services concerned, there is much to be learned from this example. Not only does it make a point of the nature and quality of the piloting process of any reform, but reminds us that devolved services cannot be reorganised without giving serious thought first of all to how the administrative organisation will function, given today's means of public action, and secondly, without defining the missions themselves of the devolved state. Lacking real support, devolved administrations today must bear with the present more than they are able to contribute to their future in a context of action where devolvement is no longer a simple affair. In a country where the now devolved services had been the pillars of a centralised state, "devolvement breakdowns" are revelatory of a deep mutation of the state itself, which neither researchers nor those involved on a practical level can disregard...|$|R

A secondary related {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the existence and utilisation of a proper strategic plan in the Division of Information Technology. A Division or Programme without a proper strategy would not be in a position to compile a credible budget. Two different self-administered questionnaires were developed. The first questionnaire was a survey of all Information Technology staff members including high-ranking officials such as assistant directors, deputy directors and managers. The second questionnaire was directed to <b>provincial</b> <b>departmental</b> officials across various departments who were willing to take part in the study. Eight provincial departments were chosen and the sample represented a total population of twelve provincial departments in the North West Provincial government. In addition to the surveys, direct interviews were conducted in cases where the respondents were not able to complete questionnaires without assistance. Although the intention of the study was to determine the impact of funding on the service delivery of information technology Division in the Department of Finance, the overall findings revealed that the strategic plan, which was not well defined, was found as the major problem that impacted on the process of compiling a reasonable budget.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 The primary {{research}} problem revolves around lack of basic financial management skills (e. g. financial management, project management, strategic management, computer literacy, supply chain management, risk management, compliance with legislation and various regulations) among the non-core financial {{managers in the}} North West Provincial departments. These managers have been entrusted with the responsibility to manage public funds, and subsequently deliver services {{in terms of their}} departmental strategic objectives. These strategic objectives are linked to national and <b>provincial</b> <b>departmental</b> service delivery mandates, in line with government priorities. Non-core financial managers are involved in major operational activities of government, and are also the producers of crucial government information and reports, and therefore they need basic financial knowledge or skills, coupled with soft skills (motivation, time, conflict and stress management, etc.) to be able to respond to the basic questions raised by the report users. In the case of the North West Provincial Government, the main purpose of the research was to investigate basic financial management skills levels of non-core financial managers, the impact thereof on service delivery, and to develop strategies to address the shortcomings identified. Research methodology A questionnaire was used to collect data from non-core financial managers at post levels 9 to 12 within various departments in the North West Provincial Government, using the PERSAL salary administration system as the source of information. A number of interviews were also conducted with various management officials from the North West provincial departments, within different functional areas, including human resource development managers. The individuals interviewed also included seniors managers. The outcomes of the study The results of this research have provided more evidence that the majority of non-core financial managers do not have the requisite basic financial management skills to be able to manage public funds. What is of critical importance is that basic financial management skills cut across these managers' day-to-day operational activities, hence the importance of developing these officials in this discipline of financial management. The implication of {{the findings of this study}} is quite clear that the North West Provincial Government will find it difficult to achieve its service delivery mandates, given the huge challenge it has in terms of shortcomings in financial management skills for the non-core financial managers. Structured financial skills development interventions, in conjunction with proper implementation of the Performance Management Development System, should be put in place in order to address the identified problem of critical financial management skills shortages.

Alternatively, re-engineering could be implemented on a <b>departmental</b> (or general <b>directorate)</b> basis, in which case operational level buy-in needs to be ensured by Treasury senior management and process redesign should involve top to middle management participation both in regard of knowlegde level and to minimize resistance to change. Certain re-engineering principles could be applicable the areas where Treasury needs improvement, especially strategic management to switch from reactive performance to proactive functioning. Achieving this requires a coordinated and well planned transition over a long term towards a totally new organization that truly generates policies rather than being involved with daily fire-fighting. The coordination should include government support and rule based relationships with other agencies. Once a clear and formal objective statement is defined, then concepts of process re-engineering could be employed to attain the objectives, provided that effects are simulated a priori. Akbaş, ArdaM.

40|$|For many years, {{tropical}} and subtropical forests {{have been}} deforested for agriculture, grazing, and timber extraction. Nevertheless {{in the last}} decade, several publications have suggested that some regions of Latin America are showing a process of forest transition. Forest transition theory predicts that industrialization and urbanization {{will lead to the}} abandonment of marginal agriculture lands and the recovery of natural systems such as forests. However, there are many ecological, economic, and social factors that could act as barriers to ecosystem recovery. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the socioeconomic and land-use changes during the last 30 years at the <b>provincial</b> and <b>departmental</b> level in the province of Misiones, Argentina. We described the changes in the distribution of urban and rural populations based on national population censuses from 1970, 1980, 1991, and 2001. Land-use change was based on a supervised analysis of four mosaics of Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1973, 1979, 1987 / 1989, and 2006. Although the change in the rural population varied greatly among the departments, there has been a dramatic increase in the urban population at the provincial level. The major land-use changes between 1973 and 2006 were an increase in monospecific plantations of mainly Pinus and Eucalyptus of 2702 km² and a loss of 4689 km² of natural forest. Misiones possesses the largest remnant of continuous Atlantic Forest, which is famous for its high level of biodiversity and endemism, but much of this forest now comprises monospecific plantations. Although demographic changes in Misiones are similar to those that have occurred other regions (i. e., rural&# 8211;urban migration), and the increase in forest plantations helps to maintain forest cover, this cover has much lower ecological value than that of natural forest. To ensure the conservation of the high-diversity Atlantic Forest in Misiones requires a better effort to understand the interactions among the diverse factors that affect land-use patterns in this region...|$|R
40|$|After the {{democratic}} election of 1994, {{a new and}} integrated education system was developed in South Africa in accordance with international trends and the stipulations of the South African Bill of Rights with regard to equality, human dignity, basic education and equal access to education. According to the inclusive education system, learners with learning and developmental barriers should be accommodated within the mainstream of education. In order for inclusive education to succeed, a network of support was developed on <b>departmental,</b> <b>provincial,</b> district and school level. At school level, the school-based support team is directly responsible for supporting learners with learning and developmental barriers, educators and parents/caregivers. The effectiveness of these school-based support teams will, eventually, determine the quality of this inclusive education approach. The question which guided this research, is: How effectively does the school-based support team fullfil its function in {{the teaching and learning}} of learners with learning and developmental barriers within the framework of inclusive education? A qualitative research design was chosen which is exploratory, descriptive and explanatory. After an initial literature study in which international and national trends in this field were investigated, five primary mainstream schools were selected in the Western Cape according to certain criteria. A pilot study was conducted in another school to refine data collection strategies. Information was then gathered in the five schools by means of structured questionnaires, individual and focus group interviews, field notes and the study of appropriate documents. In order to evaluate these teams, eleven criteria were designed to serve collectively as an evaluation instrument. The effectiveness of the school-based support teams in the five schools were subsequently assessed and placed in various categories according to a conceptual framework. It was found that the school-based support teams function relatively effectively in most areas. The composition of the teams is effective.

40|$|Ph. D.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 The main {{assumption}} that {{is inherent in}} the present study is that better utilization of volunteers will add value to {{the quality of life of}} all South Africans. The social welfare service delivery is the responsibility of the professional social workers who are either employed by the Government department of Social Development, other Government departments with related responsibilities or well established Non-Governmental organizations who are referred to as voluntary organizations in this study. The problem at hand that is being addressed by the study is : The nature and extent of volunteering which is unknown; The prevailing need for the use of volunteers and how those that are actively participating are being acknowledged and utilized; and There are no recruitment strategies to facilitate the selection, training, structuring of volunteers and supervision as well as evaluation of volunteers' service. Voluntary work is an old phenomenon, which is older than social work profession itself. It is an ancient exercise enshrined within the African cultural heritage of Botho/Ubuntu, which is within some people and need to be cultivated. There are many people who are, or would be interested and enthusiastic to be involved in voluntary work is approved and properly motivated. The present study was designed to investigate the indepth practice and extent of volunteering in the North West Province, establishing the cooperation between professional social workers and volunteers. An attempt has been made in the study to determine the areas where volunteers can be legitimately utilized and the effective measures of how to recruit, select, train and place volunteers. The study sample was drawn from four units of analysis listed below and different instruments for data collection were used in the process : Questionnaires were administered to 130 voluntary organizations drawn from the total population of North West Province; Mailed questionnaires were sent to professional social workers registered with the council, from North West and 54 responded; Telephonic interview schedule was administered to 102 respondent community members in the Province; and An experience survey was conducted which involved three case studies of organizations which are well established and known for utilizing volunteers. The descriptive research design as well as exploratory design were used in the study. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were used when collecting data through administered questionnaires and during case studies. The findings indicated that there are a great number of volunteers that are unknown and those known by professional social workers but not acknowledged. Also, that there are no purposeful recruiting measures in place to facilitate the selection, training and placement of volunteers. Whilst there is an oversight of identifying and acknowledging volunteers on the side by authorities and professionals, volunteers have been discovered to be playing a major role in the sustainability of economic development in the country. Towards the end of the Apartheid era, there were non-governmental organizations established in great numbers characterized by funding of their projects and programmes from foreign institutions or local government departments. However the study revealed that there is need for more organized support and training of both volunteers and professionals empowerment and capacity-building by structures that utilize volunteers. The most significant measure for recruitment identified through the study is the establishment of a Bureau for Volunteers, a center which will recruit, select, train, place volunteers and coordinate their services. It is recommended that the Bureau should operate from National level under the Department of Social Development whilst its branches cascade down to the provincial departments of social services. Advanced training of both volunteers and professionals is recommended as a most powerful machinery for sustaining voluntary service. Community Liaison Officers presently responsible for <b>Provincial</b> Social development <b>departmental</b> programmes would serve as link between volunteers and professionals, to add value to the present noble service of volunteers. Recommendations and suggestions for further research are made. Doctora...|$|R
