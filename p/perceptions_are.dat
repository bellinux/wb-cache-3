25|$|Besides {{artificial}} systems, an animal's {{control systems}} are proposed {{to be organized}} as a hierarchy. In perceptual control theory, which postulates that an organism's behavior {{is a means of}} controlling its perceptions, the organism's control systems are suggested to be organized in a hierarchical pattern as their <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> constructed so.|$|E
25|$|Within Christian traditions, many {{instances}} reported involve images of Jesus or other Christian figures seen in food; in the Muslim world, structures {{in food and}} other natural objects {{may be perceived as}} religious text in Arabic script, particularly the word Allah or verses from the Qur'an. Many religious believers view them as real manifestations of miraculous origin; a sceptical view is that such <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> examples of pareidolia.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further {{broken down into}} simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.” When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions {{can be broken down}} into smaller and smaller parts until <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> reached that have no parts of their own, and these <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> thereby referred to as being simple.|$|E
40|$|We often {{attribute}} {{the state of}} mind to inanimate things. This type of <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> called animacy <b>perception.</b> animacy <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be a}} part of theory of mind module as Fodor’s sense and is attracted much attention in function to social <b>perception.</b> Animacy <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> once said to <b>be</b> misleading <b>perception</b> because it <b>was</b> automatically triggered by inanimate thing. The range of parameter’s change which was used in previous studies was too small compared with that of actual living things and the interaction of the parameters that effect animacy <b>perception</b> <b>was</b> not considered. We used wide-range parameters and determined animacy perception’s psychometric function in this study. Then we got the function of animacy <b>perception</b> that might <b>be</b> appropriate to determine whether the stimulus was a living thing or not. This result suggests that animacy <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> not misleading but optimal when there is little information. Moreover, animacy <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> not response to only one parameter but inference by considered several parameters...|$|R

25|$|In {{the study}} of perception, Gestalt psychologists {{stipulate}} that <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the behaviorist approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the organization of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). The gestalt effect is the capability of our brain to generate whole forms, {{particularly with respect to}} the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The health action process {{approach}} (HAPA) {{is designed}} as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Motivational self-efficacy, outcome-expectancies and risk <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> assumed to be predictors of intentions. This is the motivational phase of the model. The predictive effect of motivational self-efficacy on behaviour {{is assumed to be}} mediated by recovery self-efficacy, and the effects of intentions are assumed to be mediated by planning. The latter processes refer to the volitional phase of the model.|$|E
25|$|The {{letters of}} Alfred Newton include one {{to his brother}} giving an {{eye-witness}} account of the debate, and written {{less than a month}} afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought he had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{notion of}} how things are seen <b>is</b> that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> passive, that the eyes are windows, and in floods reality. Physiological work of the 19 th century cast doubt on this view that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> passive acceptance of reality. <b>Perception</b> <b>is</b> not {{at the present time}} a popular topic for philosophers. This must be partly because scientific accounts of perception have now gone a long way away from appearances. They depend on physiological and psycho-physical experiments which require technical investigation and do not fall within traditional concepts of philosophy. Theories of visual <b>perception</b> <b>are</b> examined, both from a physical and psycho-physical standpoint...|$|R

25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E
25|$|During {{the limited}} series Vision and the Scarlet Witch, Magneto forces Bova {{to reveal the}} truth about his missing children, who are {{revealed}} to be Pietro and Wanda. After their mother Magda dies in childbirth, the children are given by the High Evolutionary to Django Maximoff to raise as his own. Pietro and Wanda reject Magneto when told. His marriage to Crystal is also strained when she has an affair. Crystal's uncle Maximus the Mad uses technology to cause Quicksilver to become psychotic. This drove him to frame the Avengers for treason as his <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> twisted to perceive them as having 'betrayed' him, forcing them to escape the government-sponsored Freedom Force, and then deal with Quicksilver's new 'team' of LMD-based duplicates of the Zodiac, until the Vision convinces Pietro to stand down by showing him images of his newborn nephews.|$|E
25|$|The Charvaka {{epistemology}} holds perception as {{the primary}} and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. <b>Perceptions</b> <b>are</b> of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable {{means by which the}} efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.|$|E
5000|$|For Kant, {{there is}} {{absolutely}} no knowledge of an object unless there is thought which employs abstract concepts. For him, <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> not knowledge because it is not thought. In general, Kant claimed that <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> mere sensation.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, to {{rationalize}} sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates {{that the brain}} utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity. In this case, orientation is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the retina, irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as slant and distance. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source {{could be used to}} tweak the accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.|$|E
500|$|As noted earlier, {{even among}} writers who {{consider}} consciousness to be a well-defined thing, {{there is widespread}} dispute about which animals other than humans {{can be said to}} possess it. Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties. [...] Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of [...] evolutionary biology as an adaptation {{in the sense of a}} trait that increases fitness. [...] In his article [...] "Evolution of consciousness", John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness (" [...] psychon ... linked to [...] dendron through quantum physics"). [...] Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this [...] "recursive" [...] circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms. Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality. This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.|$|E

50|$|Direct <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> {{knowledge}} which excludes conceptual thought (kalpanā). This only {{reveals the}} bare features {{of an object}} via the senses.

Each item of sense <b>perception</b> <b>is</b> unique. Dignāga does not specify what {{the nature of the}} object of <b>perception</b> <b>is,</b> but implies that although it is not atomic or otherwise, it is existent. It is real because it is causally efficient (artha-kriyā).|$|R

2500|$|Emotional exhaustion, which {{related to}} {{employee}} health and burnout, {{is related to}} overall organizational justice perceptions. As perceptions of justice increase employee health increases and burnout decreases (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009). [...] Distributive, procedural, and interactional justice <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> able to capture state specific levels of emotional exhaustion which fade over time; however, overall organizational justice perceptions give the most stable picture {{of the relationship between}} justice perceptions and emotional exhaustion over time (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009).|$|E
2500|$|Absenteeism, or non-attendance, {{is another}} outcome of {{perceived}} injustice related to equity theory (Johns, 2001).

[...] Johns (2001) found that when people saw both their commitment to the organization and the organization's commitment to them as high, absenteeism is diminished. [...] Additionally, withdrawal, or leaving the organization, is a more extreme outcome stemming from the same equity theory principles. [...] Distributive justice <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> most strongly related to withdrawal (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001).|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{asserts that}} {{experience}} is based {{both on the}} perception of external objects and a priori knowledge. The external world, he writes, provides those things that we sense. But it is our mind that processes this information and gives it order, allowing us to comprehend it. Our mind supplies the conditions {{of space and time}} to experience objects. According to the [...] "transcendental unity of apperception", the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and the perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension. Without the concepts, <b>perceptions</b> <b>are</b> nondescript; without the perceptions, concepts are meaningless — thus the famous statement, [...] "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions (perceptions) without concepts are blind." ...|$|E

Earlier estimates of the prevalence of synesthesia were based on [...] "best-guess" [...] estimations only (e.g. 1 in 250,000) or had limitations in their methodologies because they required synesthetes to refer themselves for study (e.g. 1 in 2000) and for this reason the authors of those studies had been moderate in their claims.
