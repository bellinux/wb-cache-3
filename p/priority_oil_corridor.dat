40|$|Security {{of energy}} supply {{is crucial to}} energy {{dependent}} economies toensure stable supplies and not to impede their economic development andsocial well-being. The rising concern in the European Union (EU) about energysupply security has led to various different risk and vulnerability reductionstrategies being put in place. One of the options considered is to improveEurope’s interconnection with neighbouring countries by promoting trans-European networks. Diversifying sources of supply and transport routes is one ofthe fundamental intermediate objectives {{in the process of}} promoting energysupply security. Turkey has been considered as a key country in the hydrocarbon supplydiversification strategy. However, a rigorous quantitative analysis was neededto assess the actual significance of Turkish corridors for the EU's energy security. The aim of this doctoral thesis has been to analyse the development of theTurkish corridors’ contribution to the EU's energy security from 2000 to 2020. The approach taken here uses factor analysis to measure geopoliticalenergy risks of countries and chokepoints along oil and natural gas corridors. The estimation of the Energy Supply Geopolitical Risk Index allowed the level ofsecurity in energy corridors to be pinned down. The aggregation of thecountries and chokepoints’ security indicators in every corridor constitutes theEnergy Supply Geopolitical Security Index by corridor. Finally, the developmentover time of Turkish corridors’ contribution to the EU’s energy security has beenanalysed, having been measured as the level of security of every corridorweighted for its relative physical capacity. The findings of this research are that, inter alia, a change is taking placein the relative importance of Turkey in the EU’s energy supply, but that this ishappening in different ways and over different timescales in the case of oil andnatural gas. The contribution of Turkey’s <b>oil</b> <b>corridors</b> to the EU’s security of supply rosefastest between 2000 and 2010 (60 %), while the increase in its role over theperiod 2010 - 2020 is set to be smaller (23 %). By 2020 the contribution of Turkey’soil corridors will be approximately 5 %, so it is expected to more than double itscontribution to EU’s security between 2000 and 2020. 3 Turkey’s gas corridors would go from 0 % contribution to the EU's securityof supply in 2000 to account for almost 9 % in 2020. The greater change will takeplace in the time-frame 2010 - 2020, by multiplying by five. Thus, whereas the contribution of Turkey's <b>oil</b> <b>corridors</b> to the security ofthe EU’s energy system saw a rapid rise between 2000 and 2010, the growth inthe role of its natural gas corridors is expected to take place during the presentdecade. Both cases entail an improvement in the relative position of Turkishcorridors in the EU, from which it may be deduced that the EU’s policy ofdiversification has led to Turkey’s gaining in geostrategic importance for theEU’s security of supply...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Greece is a net {{importer}} {{of oil and}} gas and is among the most vulnerable countries of the European Union (EU) on energy supply disruptions. Furthermore, is considered a ""crossroad"" of existing and forthcoming infrastructure for importing energy to the EU. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the presentation of the web tool that implements the developed methodology for the quantification of socio-economic risks of <b>oil</b> and gas <b>corridors.</b> The tool is applied to the main present and future <b>oil</b> and gas <b>corridors</b> to Greece, and the related outcomes are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A structured and coherent review on the future and present oil and natural gas (NG) corridors to Greece was elaborated, based on desk analysis and collection of the related data from national and international sources. Factor analysis was employed for the quantification of socio-economic risks of each energy corridor. Particular emphasis was laid on the tool's design, so as to be user-friendly, combining intuitive menus and navigation throughout the steps of the system. Findings: The calculation of socio-economic risks of the main <b>oil</b> and gas <b>corridors</b> to Greece provides operative and measurable concepts for supporting energy-modelling processes. Indeed, this paper provides useful insights on the factors affecting the smooth energy supply and the reliability {{of oil and gas}} supply options to the Greek energy system. Moreover, the presented web tool can be used as a reference point for the researcher working on energy supply risks quantification. Originality/value: The introduction of the energy corridors perspective in the valuation of supply security is of significant importance, taking into account the constantly increasing energy dependence of EU countries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, a structured and coherent review of the future and present <b>oil</b> and NG <b>corridors</b> to Greece is not present in the international literature.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is the first in}} a series {{reporting}} on in vitro toxic potencies of oils. The objective was to determine whether 11 crude oils and refined products activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in a dioxin receptor¿mediated luciferase assay. Cells were exposed for 6 and 24 h to different oil concentrations to screen for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon¿like or dioxin-like activity. Moreover, cytotoxicity of the oils was determined using rat hepatoma cells. Except for one crude oil, none of the oils appeared cytotoxic up to 100 mg/L, but all oils activated the AhR. Strong AhR induction was observed for most oils after 6 h, and responses decreased after 24 h, indicating the presence of metabolizable agonists. However, several oils still caused high responses after 24 h, also demonstrating the presence of persistent agonists. The potencies (calculated based on comparisons of concentrations at which 50 % of the maximal effect was observed) of oils were found to be approximately 40 to 106 times lower than the potency of the assay's standards benzo[a]pyrene and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. However, considering that oils contain thousands of chemicals, the potencies of petrochemical agonists may be very high. Among the most potent oils were bunker and crude oils. Induction up to 200 % as compared to the maximum induction caused by benzo[a]pyrene was observed for these oils. Such supermaximal responses suggest mixture effects that may not be receptor-mediated.

50|$|The {{origin of}} American {{economic}} {{involvement in the}} Middle East, particularly with regards to oil, dates back to 1928 with {{the signing of the}} Red Line Agreement. This was preceded by the founding of the Turkish Petroleum Company, which was created with the intention of exploring and extracting oil within the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, after the discovery of a large oil field in Iraq in 1928, the issue of distribution arose. Each of the large powers - France, the United Kingdom, and the United States - worried about being edged out by the other two. The Red Line Agreement was eventually signed, giving the Near East Development Corporation, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch/Shell, and the Compagnie Française des Pétroles each 23.75% of any oil that was produced by the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Near East Development Corporation represented American interests and included Jersey Standard Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Gulf Oil, the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Atlantic Refining. The remaining 5% share went to an Armenian businessman, Calouste Gulbenkian, who had previously owned shares within TPC. The more important provision of the Red Line Agreement was that none of the four parties could develop any oilfields from the Suez Canal to the Iran, with the exception of Kuwait (the area that the TPC had jurisdiction over), unless that party gained support and approval from the other three. Thus, the United States broke into the oil market in Iraq and later into the rest of the Middle East.Eventually, due to the aligning of Prime Minister Rashid al-Gilani with Germany, the West, particularly Great Britain, gained open access to Iraq. However, WWII left the UK weakened and unable to retain its dominance in the region, and as such the Truman and Roosevelt administrations were able to achieve their top <b>priority,</b> monopolizing <b>oil</b> in the region.|$|R

40|$|Power plants {{producing}} energy through solar fields use a {{heat transfer}} fluid that lends itself to be influenced and changed by different variables. In solar power plants, a {{heat transfer fluid}} (HTF) is used to transfer the thermal energy of solar radiation through parabolic collectors to a water vapor Rankine cycle. In this way, a turbine is driven that produces electricity when coupled to an electric generator. These plants have a heat transfer system that converts the solar radiation into heat through a HTF, and transfers that thermal energy to the water vapor heat exchangers. The best possible performance in the Rankine cycle, and therefore in the thermal plant, is obtained when the HTF reaches its maximum temperature when leaving the solar field (SF). In addition, {{it is necessary that}} the HTF does not exceed its own maximum operating temperature, above which it degrades. The optimum temperature of the HTF is difficult to obtain, since the working conditions of the plant can change abruptly from moment to moment.

The main sources of funds for the functioning of economic mechanisms for encouragement of the modernization programs and projects can be: funds of the state and local budgets received from the established taxes, penalties and increased payments for energy resources; own funds of the entities; credit facilities; internal and external investments. The implementation of the strategic objectives of development of oil and gas entities, introduction of large-scale measures for the development, technical upgrading and modernization of the fixed assets, as well as the consistent introduction of competitive relations on the domestic and external markets shall be fulfilled through improving the pricing and tariff policy by the introduction of the economically justified level of prices and tariffs for energy resources. Value/originality. The current state of the oil and gas complex of Ukraine is analyzed and its problems are identified, upon which its development prospects are substantiated. The main challenges inhibiting the stable development of oil and gas entities and their solutions are considered. The challenge of modernization and technical re-equipment of the oil and gas complex entities and the possibility of their organizational and economic reforming are covered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Newborn {{infections are}} {{responsible}} for approximately one-third of the estimated 4. 0 million neonatal deaths that occur globally every year. Appropriately targeted research is required to guide investment in effective interventions, especially in low resource sellings. Setting global priorities for research to address neonatal infections is essential and urgent. Methods: The Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development of the World Health Organization (WHO/CAH) applied the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) priority-setting methodology to identify and stimulate research most likely to reduce global newborn infection-related mortality by 2015. Technical experts were invited by WHO/CAH to systematically list and then use standard methods to score research questions according to their likelihood to (i) be answered in all ethical way, (ii) lead to (Or improve) effective interventions, (iii) be deliverable, affordable, and sustainable, (iv) maximize death burden reduction, and (v) have an equitable effect in the population. The scores were then weighted according to the values provided by a wide group of stakeholders from the global research priority-setting network. Findings: On a 100 -point scale, the final priority scores for 69 research questions ranged from 39 to 83. Most of the 15 research questions that received the highest scores were {{in the domain of}} health systems and policy research to address barriers affecting existing cost-effective interventions. The <b>priority</b> questions focused <b>oil</b> promotion of home care practices to prevent newborn infections and approaches to increase coverage and quality of management of newborn infections in health facilities {{as well as in the}} community. While community-based intervention research is receiving some current investment, rigorous evaluation and cost analysis is almost entirely lacking for research on facility-based interventions and quality improvement. Interpretation: Given the lack of progress in improving newborn survival despite the existence of effective interventions, it is not surprising that of the top ranked research priorities in this article the majority are in the domain of health systems and policy research. We urge funding agencies and investigators to invest in these research priorities to accelerate reduction of neonatal deaths, particularly those due to infections...|$|R
40|$|A {{decision}} support {{model for the}} Single Vehicle Flexible and Selective Delivery Routing Problem (SVFSDRP) {{is presented as a}} method to improve planning and reduce costs in offshore bulk logistics. Reducing costs in {{the oil and gas industry}} has become the main <b>priority</b> with decreasing <b>oil</b> prices in 2014 - 2016. As logistics account for 14 % of the cost of drilling operation, it is important to reduce costs in this area. The routing analysis previously done in offshore shipping has deck cargo as its the focus area, instead of bulk cargo. Moreover, Statoil is considering introducing a specialized bulk vessel. The model presented in this paper would work well in combination with such a vessel. One of the most important challenges in offshore logistics is demand uncertainty. This model may improve logistical personnel s ability to respond to this uncertainty, as the model can quickly provide a new solution to changes in demand. The method used is a model designed through an optimization approach, the model solves the SVFSDR problem. This thesis is based on the authors work experience, research on the system and literature study on the topic. The model is developed based on earlier work stated in the literature study. Additionally, the model has novel constraints and features which are based on the authors understanding of the bulk supply logistics system. The author may be subject to misinterpreting parts of the system or factors. When reviewing the result one should keep in mind that this is only a model; the outputs are direct results of the inputs used. The model is subject to assumptions and estimates used through this thesis. The model may be used in similar problems in bulk shipping, but it is restricted to bulk logistical problems. Flexibility improves the solution by reducing cost, increasing transported volume and increasing revenue. However, it is at the cost of high flexibility, up to 30 %, which may increase uncertainty as it will take more time before personnel at offshore installations know the exact volume they will receive. Additionally, it may be hard to achieve high flexibility on demands as it causes uncertainty in the supply chain. The model may also give logistical personnel the ability to better respond to uncertainty in demand, as it quickly finds new solutions. The proposed model may also be used to test different designs in a bulk supply context. With regards to further work, it is recommended to make a dynamic model that includes the sequential effects of chosen route and cargo mix...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in part-fu 1 fi~entof the M-Tech Business Administration in the Facu 1 ty of Business at the Peninsu 1 a Technikon, 2002 The {{closure of}} Marine Oil Refiners (MOR) in 1999 was probably inevitable if {{results of the}} Greenpeace protests against the consumption of unsustainable fish oil in 1996 were evaluated. The world's largest biscuit factories excluded fish oil from their ingredients and companies like Unilever responded in a similar manner. However MOR's closure was unexpected and therefore the South African market shift did not align with the international market changes. This research project explores {{one of the problems}} with which the fishing industry is confronted with. In particular, the research focuses on the distribution of the fish oil produced in the Fishing Industry after the closure of MOR in July 1999, which was the sole consumer of fish oil. The closure of MOR has effectively left South African and Namibian fish oil-producing companies without an established South African market to sell to. This research deals with marketing strategies for the fish oil producing companies, the problems associated with these strategies and the examination of available alternative solutions to this problem. The effect of changes in the chicken feed market segment on the fishmeal & oil industry will also be addressed. One of the aims of this research was to clarify the factors that impact on the consumption of the current South African fish oil market. The research concluded that the following are important factors that impact on the South African fish oil consumption: Quality of the oil The international fish oil price Comparative competitive prices of fish oil substitutes The growing and declining demand of the different fish oil application markets. The price of heavy furnace oil compared to fish oil selling price. (Heavy furnace oil is used to generate energy). The research also investigated the impact of low price fish oil substitutes on the South African fish oil producers. The most important substitute in the current South African majority market, the animal feed market, is vegetabl"e oils. The research finding is that the South African fish oil producers must follow the vegetable oil selling price trend. The most important finding of the research is the high <b>priority</b> the fish <b>oil</b> quality achieves in all the fish oil market segments. The South African domestic market is limited in that it is only the animal feed market and the refinery. export market. The alternative market to sell to is the However, the international fish oil market perceives the South African fish oil to be of low quality. A mindset regarding the importance of fish oil quality has to start at the South African fish oil producers. It is vital that the South African fish oil producers institute quality systems to improve their fish oil quality. The South African fish oil producers must gear themselves to become globally competitive...|$|R
