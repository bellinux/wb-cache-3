The reason {{of this paper}} writing was publishing of innovative information to the technical society. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved by solution of much research and development works in the very long time interval. The main methods used for our research was study of physic-chemical interaction between a liquid metal and surrounding atmosphere. The approach {{to the topic of}} our research was the elimination of interactions between the C, O, N and H and Ti, Al, V, Y, Zr in liquid metal. Contemporary we have solved also the acute ceramic mould for casting of perfect castings from metal of very high affinity to C, O, N and H. The main subject scope of the paper is assignee of very clean materials and much application from that. We are oriented particularly on the preparing parts of cementless total hip joint replacement (THR) and instruments for implantation. Findings: We have created the new original design of the <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> for smelting and castings of high reaction of metal up to 3000 K. temperature. The main conclusion of our result was a practical using for research on very high level and for production of metal and castings from special metal in the final shape. Practical implications: It has been found that the quality of castings from Ti and Nb alloys is very good. The quality of casting was tested by metallographic analysis and by notch specimens. We have been finding out that the mass of casting can be approximately 1. 00 kg. This is true statement in the first approximation if the new <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> is arranged as smelting – cleaning – casting system. If the new <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> is arranged as continual smelting system, than we can obtain ingot with the mass two or more kilograms. Originality/value: The design of new <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> is original and also the castings from Ti, Ta and Nb alloys are in our laboratory original resultants and the metallographic analysis as well. In the case, when the castings with a good biocompatibility plays important role, this new <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> can be very useful for preparing implants for body skeleton and spatial casting of material of very high affinity to elements as C, O, H, and N...|$|E

These processes produce a layer of supersaturated austenite, usually called expanded austenite or S-phase, which exhibits good corrosion and wear resistance.

In this paper, an analytical solution to the non-equilibrium Marshak diffusion problem in a planar slab and spherical shell of finite thickness is presented. Using Laplace transform method, the radiation and material energy densities are obtained {{as a function of}} space and time. The variation in integrated energy densities and leakage currents are also studied. In order to linearize the radiation transport and material energy equation, the heat capacity is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the material temperature. The steady state energy densities show linear variation along the depth of the planar slab, whereas non-linear dependence is observed for the spherical shell. The analytical energy densities show good agreement with those obtained from finite difference method using small mesh width and time step.

50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or <b>plasma</b> arc <b>furnace</b> (electrothermic reactor).

The SPS tech-nique under the present conditions has produced Fe– 14 Cr materials that apparently exhibit different microstructures yielding inferior mechanical properties than the counterpart material consolidated by hot isostatic pressing. Although {{the presence of a}} dispersion of Y-rich particles is evident, the oxide dis-persion strengthened (ODS) Fe– 14 Cr alloy consolidated by SPS exhibits poor tensile properties. The extensive decoration of the powder particle surfaces with Cr-rich precipitates and the residual porosity appear to be responsible for the impaired properties of this ODS alloy consolidated by SPS.

40|$|The {{development}} of reliable, high powered plasma generators {{has resulted in}} many plasma processes being proposed as alternatives to existing pyrometallurgical technologies. This work evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of plasma systems by reviewing plasma generators, their integration with reactors and the process economics. Many plasma systems were shown to be technically and economically superior to existing technologies, but some of the plasma system advantages quoted in the literature were found to be impractical because of other system constraints. Process applications were limited by the power inputs available from plasma generators compared to AC electric furnaces. A series of trials were conducted where chromite and steelplant baghouse dusts were smelted in the Tetronics' 2. 0 MW transferred arc/open bath reactor to confirm the operating characteristics of the plasma system and its economics. Chromite smelting was technical superior to submerged arc furnace technology, but the economics were unfavourable because of the limited power available from the water-cooled plasma torch and the high electrical energy consumption. A DC graphite electrode <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> using preheated and prereduced chromite concentrates will compete economically with the submerged arc furnace. Ni, Cr and Mo were economically recovered from high alloy content steelplant dusts for recycling. Five Electric Arc Furnace dusts were smelted to produce a non-toxic residue and recover the contained zinc to an enriched zinc oxide product for recycling. It should be possible to condense the zinc vapour directly in a zinc splash condenser to increase the value of the product. Because of the limited power available from plasma generators, plasma processes will be most suitable for treating high and medium value materials such as Au, Pt, Mo, Ni, Ti, V, Cr etc at small production rates, heating metals in tundishes and ladles and remelting superalloy scrap.

40|$|The Graphite Electrode DC Arc Furnace (DC Arc) is a {{high-temperature}} thermal process, {{which has}} been adapted from a commercial technology, {{for the treatment of}} mixed waste. A DC Arc Furnace heats waste to a temperature such that the waste is converted into a molten form that cools into a stable glassy and/or crystalline waste form. Hazardous organics are destroyed through combustion or pyrolysis during the process and the majority of the hazardous metals and radioactive components are incorporated in the molten phase. The DC Arc Furnace chamber temperature is approximately 593 [...] 704 C and melt temperatures are as high as 1, 500 C. The DC Arc system has an air pollution control system (APCS) to remove particulate and volatiles from the offgas. The advantage of the DC Arc {{is that it is a}} single, high-temperature thermal process that minimizes the need for multiple treatment systems and for extensive sorting/segregating of large volumes of waste. The DC Arc has the potential to treat a wide range of wastes, minimize the need for sorting, reduce the final waste volumes, produce a leach resistant waste form, and destroy organic contaminants. Although the DC arc <b>plasma</b> <b>furnace</b> exhibits great promise for treating the types of mixed waste that are commonly present at many DOE sites, several data and technology deficiencies were identified by the Mixed Waste Focus Area (MWFA) regarding this thermal waste processing technique. The technology deficiencies that have been addressed by the current studies include: establishing the partitioning behavior of radionuclides, surrogates, and hazardous metals among the product streams (metal, slag, and offgas) as a function of operating parameters, including melt temperature, plenum atmosphere, organic loading, chloride concentration, and particle size; demonstrating the efficacy of waste product removal systems for slag and metal phases; determining component durability through test runs of extended duration, evaluating the effect of feed composition variations on process operating conditions and slag product performance; and collecting mass balance and operating data to support equipment and instrument design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{intended}} to reduce the difference of thermal expansion coefficient between metallic interconnector and solid electrolyte of SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) without sacrificing of electrical conductivity. Fe-Cr alloys have been chosen as candidate materials due to its merit of low cost and high temperature oxidation resistance. Different amount of alloys element and compositions have been varied to optimize the properties by method of alloys design with aid of thermodynamics software Thermal-Cal. Phase diagrams of multi-components alloys have been drawn to predict the possible stable phases formed in the investigated metals. An arc melter and <b>plasma</b> melting <b>furnace</b> were used to melt the investigated alloys. The measurements of thermal expansion coefficients and electrical conductivities are carried out with TMA and ASR resistance instrument. The {{results indicate that the}} Fe- 10 Cr alloy exhibits the smallest thermal expansion coefficient among the alloys, while Fe- 16 Cr has a lowest electrical resistance...|$|R
40|$|On April 14, 1998, a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{researcher}} performing {{work in the}} Building 324 facility approached {{facility management}} and asked if facility management could turn off the tritium sampler in the main exhaust stack. The researcher was demonstrating the feasibility of treating components from dismantled nuclear weapons in a device called a <b>plasma</b> arc <b>furnace</b> and was concerned that the sampler would compromise classified information. B and W Hanford Company (BWHC) operated the facility, and PNNL conducted research as a tenant in the facility. The treatment of 200 components in the furnace {{would result in the}} release of up to about 20 curies of tritium through the facility stack. The exact quantity of tritium was calculated from the manufacturing data for the weapons components and was known to be less than 20 curies. The Notice of Construction (NOC) approved by the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) had been modified to allow releasing 20 curies of tritium through the stack in support of this research. However, there were irregularities in the way the NOC modification was processed. The researcher was concerned that data performed on the sampler could be used to back-calculate the tritium content of the components, revealing classified information about the design of nuclear weapons. He had discussed this with the PNNZ security organization, and they had told him that data from the sampler would be classified. He was also concerned that if he could not proceed with operation of the <b>plasma</b> arc <b>furnace,</b> the furnace would be damaged. The researcher told BWHC management that the last time the furnace was shut down and restarted it had cost $ 0. 5 million and caused a six month delay in the project`s schedule. He had already begun heating up the furnace before recognizing the security problem and was concerned that stopping the heatup could damage the furnace. The NOC that allowed the research did not have an explicit requirement to operate the sampler during a release. The sampler was installed several years previously for other research. After reviewing the NOC and other safety basis documents, and after consulting environmental compliance specialists, facility management agreed to turn off the sampler...|$|R
