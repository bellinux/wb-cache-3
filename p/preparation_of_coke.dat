40|$|The greater {{resistance}} to coke deposition for Pt/ZrO 2 compared to Pt/Al 2 O 3 in the CH 4 /CO 2 reaction has {{been attributed to}} the higher reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> with CO 2 on Pt/ZrO 2 [1]. Hence, in this communication, the reaction <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> derived from methane (CHx: which is an intermediated in the reforming reaction and also a source <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> deposition) with CO 2 was studied on Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 at 1070 K.

However, the reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> toward CO 2 was lower.

Next, the ability of the active site to activate CO 2 (probably oxygen defect sites on the support), as shown by CO evolution measurement in CO 2 stream, was higher on Pt/ZrO 2 than on Pt/Al 2 O 3. Therefore, the high reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> toward CO 2 on Pt/ZrO 2 is attributed not to the intrinsic reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> itself but to the high activity of CO 2 at oxygen defect sites of ZrO 2 that are in the vicinity of Pt particles...|$|R

In this study, coke samples excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at MEFOS in Luleå, Sweden were collected. The centreline quenched coke samples from different zones of this EBF were used to observe the influence of in-furnace reactions on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> properties and their associations with CO 2 reactivity. Carbon structure <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> was found to increasingly ordered, silicon and iron concentration in the coke samples decreased, while alkali concentration particularly potassium and sodium were found to increase as the coke descended towards {{lower part of the}} EBF. Both isothermal and non-isothermal reactivity based on TGA measurements showed that coke reactivity towards CO 2 is increased as coke descends towards cohesive zone despite increasing order of carbon structures. Increased reactivity <b>of</b> <b>cokes</b> at lower parts of EBF was related to alkali enrichments <b>of</b> <b>cokes.</b> The study further shows that increased alkali components in cokes have a strong impact on CO 2 gasification in EBF such that influence <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> graphitisation could be compensated by catalytic influence of alkalis.

Accumulative thicknesses were different with different kinds of catalyst used and they decreased more, the smaller the surface areas. The initial deactivation constant was directly related to the accumulative thickness <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> and metal. Moreover, it was found that the effect <b>of</b> the <b>coke</b> deposition accumulative thickness on reduction of pore diameter was almost triple to that of metal deposition. The catalyst deactivation on the SOR (start of run) in the hydrodesulfurization reaction was mainly responsible for the deposition <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> on the catalyst. " 2 種類の常圧残油（AR）の水素化脱硫反応を平均細孔径の異なる 3 種類の触媒を組み合わせて行い，操作日数を変化させてコークおよびメタルたい積量の異なる使用済触媒を得た。これらの元素分析および物理性状の測定（窒素脱吸着法・水銀庄入法）を行い，初期活性劣化に及ぼすコークおよびメタルたい積の影響を定量的に検討した。水銀庄入法による平均糾し径から算出されたコーク密度（Pc）およびメタル密度（pm）は操作日数や触媒種を変化させても同一であり，それぞれPc＝ 1 ・ 25 g／cm 3 ，Pm＝ 2 ． 50 g／cm 3 となった。この結果から，コークたい積が細孔容積の減少に及ぼす影響はメタルのそれの約 2 倍になった。また，細孔を単純な円柱と仮定して，平均細孔径の減少から計算されたコークのたい積層厚さおよびメタルのたい積層厚さは，触媒によって異なり，表面積の小さな細孔径の大きい触媒ほど大きくなった。総括劣化速度式で求めた初期劣化定数（α 1 ）はたい積層厚さとともに増加した。これらの結果より，単位たい積量あたりのたい積層厚さはコークの方がメタルより 3 倍以上大きく，運転初期（SOR）での触媒劣化機構が主にコーク劣化で進行することを定量的に示すことができた...|$|R
30|$|The {{deposition}} <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> {{is highly}} dependent on the reaction conditions, especially on reaction temperature and hydrogen partial pressure. Increases in the reaction temperature of PyGas hydrogenation not only increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> deposition but also result in a more condensed hydrogen deficient coke on the surface. Carbon laydown can be decreased by increasing hydrogen partial pressure [1].|$|R
