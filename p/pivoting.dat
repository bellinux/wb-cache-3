After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line <b>pivoting</b> around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians.

40|$|The typical leaf-type isosceles-trapezoidal {{flexural}} (LITF) <b>pivot</b> {{consists of}} two flexural beams and two rigid-bodies. The single LITF <b>pivot</b> has the small range of motion and rel-atively large center shift. However, the vacancy in the <b>pivot</b> point makes LITF <b>pivots</b> much easier to be cascaded than other commonly used flexure joints. The performances of LITF <b>pivots</b> will be greatly improved by connecting them together in series. This paper presents an innovative design of LITF <b>pivots.</b> The single LITF <b>pivot</b> {{is regarded as a}} basic configurable module, and four of them can be used to construct new types of flexure joint, which are referred to here as quadri-LITF (Q-LITF) <b>pivot.</b> Ten types of Q-LITF <b>pivots</b> are synthesized in this paper. Compared with a single LIFT <b>pivot,</b> the stroke of a Q-LITF <b>pivot</b> is larger, and stiffness of the mechanism becomes smaller. The center-shift of the Q-LIFT <b>pivot</b> can be optimized by tuning geometric parameters of its single LITF mod-ules. Based on the pseudorigid-body (PRB) model of the single LITF <b>pivot,</b> the method for analyzing the Q-LITF <b>pivots</b> is proposed.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{software}} startups, project failure is embraced actively and considered crucial to obtain validated learning {{that can lead to}} <b>pivots.</b> A <b>pivot</b> is the strategic change of a business concept, product or the different elements of a business model. A better understanding is needed on different types of <b>pivots</b> and different factors that lead to failures and trigger <b>pivots,</b> for software entrepreneurial teams to make better decisions under chaotic and unpredictable environment. Due to the nascent nature of the topic, the existing research and knowledge on the <b>pivots</b> of software startups are very limited. In this study, we aimed at identifying the major types of <b>pivots</b> that software startups make during their startup processes, and highlighting the factors that fail software projects and trigger <b>pivots.</b> To achieve this, we conducted a case survey study based on the secondary data of the major <b>pivots</b> happened in 49 software startups. 10 <b>pivot</b> types and 14 triggering factors were identified.

5000|$|A {{series of}} 180-degree <b>pivots.</b> Can be done both ways but both {{start on the}} nose (or on the tail while rolling fakie).

If you originally did a 180 Frontside <b>Pivot,</b> you will now do a 180 Backside <b>Pivot.</b> When these 180 <b>pivots</b> are done in consecutive lines, they are considered End-Overs (End Over End).

5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC.

The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, {{but there are so many}} such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E

The real <b>pivot</b> measures a depth variation of 16 % over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4. 7.

5|$|The Battle of Sharon {{began on}} 19 September with a Western Front style {{bombardment}} during which {{two thirds of}} the mainly ground based heavy artillery, supported by the firepower of two destroyers pounded Ottoman positions, while one third of the heavy artillery fired creeping barrages to cover the infantry assaults. The XXI Corps infantry attacked simultaneously along the front line from the Mediterranean coast where the 60th Division, launched an attack on the western coastal section of the front line defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps. During this Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division breached the front and second line trenches to eventually capture Tulkarm, the site of the Eighth Army headquarters. On their right, the main Tabsor system of trenches held by the Ottoman XXII Corps was attacked and eventually captured during the Battle of Tabsor, by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut), and the 75th Divisions. These three divisions subsequently advanced, despite the Ottoman XXII Corps being reinforced, to capture Et Tire and Masudiye Station. In the process of the battles for Tulkarm and Tabsor the 7th (Meerut) and 60th Divisions created a gap in the front line, for the Desert Mounted Corps to ride through. They rode north and eastwards to the rear to capture the defending Ottoman armies' lines of communication. The right flank of the attacking XXI Corps was protected from the Eighth Army's Asia Corps, by the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the French Colonial Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie holding and <b>pivoting</b> on the Rafat salient, during the Battle of Arara as the infantry battle progressed.|$|E
