50|$|High-quality {{brazed joints}} require that parts be closely fitted, and the base metals {{exceptionally}} clean {{and free of}} oxides. In most cases, joint clearances of 0.03 to 0.08 mm are recommended for the best capillary action and joint strength. However, in some brazing operations {{it is not uncommon}} to have joint clearances around 0.6 mm. Cleanliness of the brazing surfaces is also important, as any contamination can cause <b>poor</b> <b>wetting</b> (flow). The two main methods for cleaning parts, prior to brazing, are chemical cleaning and abrasive or mechanical cleaning. In the case of mechanical cleaning, it is important to maintain the proper surface roughness as wetting on a rough surface occurs much more readily than on a smooth surface of the same geometry.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{limitation}} {{in the use}} of MLC is {{the reduction}} in efficiency (peak broadening) that is observed when purely aqueous micellar mobile phases are used. [...] Several explanations for the poor efficiency have been theorized. <b>Poor</b> <b>wetting</b> of the stationary phase by the micellar aqueous mobile phase, slow mass transfer between the micelles and the stationary phase, and poor mass transfer within the stationary phase have all been postulated as possible causes. To enhance efficiency, the most common approaches have been the addition of small amounts of isopropyl alcohol and increase in temperature. A review by Berthod studied the combined theories presented above and applied the Knox equation to independently determine the cause of the reduced efficiency. The Knox equation is commonly used in HPLC to describe the different contributions to overall band broadening of a solute. The Knox equation is expressed as: ...|$|E
50|$|In surface science, {{the term}} {{adhesion}} almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as {{a drop of}} liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the contact angle is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a Centrifugal Adhesion Balance allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the lower contact angle corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in {{a high degree of}} wetting, a lyophilic condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in lyophobic conditions with high measured contact angles and <b>poor</b> <b>wetting.</b>|$|E

50|$|Time above {{liquidus}} (TAL), or time above reflow, measures {{how long}} the solder is a liquid. The flux reduces surface tension at the juncture of the metals to accomplish metallurgical bonding, allowing the individual solder powder spheres to combine. If the profile time exceeds the manufacturer’s specification, the result may be premature flux activation or consumption, effectively “drying” the paste before formation of the solder joint. An insufficient time/temperature relationship causes {{a decrease in the}} flux’s cleaning action, resulting in <b>poor</b> <b>wetting,</b> inadequate removal of the solvent and flux, and possibly defective solder joints. Experts usually recommend the shortest TAL possible, however, most pastes specify a minimum TAL of 30 seconds, although {{there appears to be no}} clear reason for that specific time. One possibility is that there are places on the PCB that are not measured during profiling, and therefore, setting the minimum allowable time to 30 seconds reduces the chances of an unmeasured area not reflowing. A high minimum reflow time also provides a margin of safety against oven temperature changes. The wetting time ideally stays below 60 seconds above liquidus. Additional time above liquidus may cause excessive intermetallic growth, which can lead to joint brittleness. The board and components may also be damaged at extended times over liquidus, and most components have a well-defined time limit for {{how long the}}y may be exposed to temperatures over a given maximum. Too little time above liquidus may trap solvents and flux and create the potential for cold or dull joints as well as solder voids.|$|E

30|$|Contact {{angle is}} one of the {{important}} indicators to measure the wettability of a surface or material. A low value of contact angle indicates that the liquid spreads, or wets well, while a high contact angle indicates <b>poor</b> <b>wetting.</b> The two materials had very different contact angles with water. The contact angle between petroleum coke and water was 91 °, while that between lignite and water was only 59 °, indicating lignite was more hydrophilic than petroleum coke. This result was consistent with FTIR analysis. Due to the high content of oxygen functional groups, the surface of lignite showed strong hydrophilicity, and thus its contact angle with water was smaller. On the contrary, petroleum coke had a hydrophobic surface, which is difficult to wet.|$|E

40|$|Surface wetting on {{polyelectrolyte}} multilayers (PEMs), {{prepared by}} alternating deposition of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), was investigated mainly in water‐solid‐oil systems. The surface‐wetting behavior of as‐prepared PEMs was well correlated to the molecular {{structures of the}} uncompensated ionic groups on the PEMs as revealed by sum frequency generation vibrational and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopies.

The underwater oil repellency of PSS‐capped PEMs was successfully harnessed to manufacture highly efficient filters for oil‐water separation at high flux. Wet surfaces: Liquid wetting on charged surfaces is well correlated with the molecular nature of surface ionic groups.
