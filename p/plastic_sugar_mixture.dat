30|$|It was {{observed}} that xylose consumption was inhibited {{by the presence}} of glucose; therefore, the specific xylose consumption rates in the <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> were lower than when xylose was the sole carbon source (Table  3, line 9 vs. 12, 10 vs. 13, 11 vs. 14) (Demeke et al. 2013; Diao et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2012), However, the same parameter was still kept lower (Fig.  3 g) in the xylose consumption phase (Hou et al. 2009 b) after the depletion of glucose from the <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture.</b> We defined such a phenotype—the continued impact of glucose on xylose metabolism after glucose depletion—as the “post-glucose effect” in the present work, which is an underappreciated phenomenon frequently evident in data shown in previous publications (Demeke et al. 2013; Diao et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2012).

30|$|Kinetics of C 6 /C 5 sugar {{fermentation}} by S. stipitis/S. cerevisiae co-culture {{shown in}} Figs.  1 c and 2 b suggested that by varying cell ratio of co-culture system, the conversion rate of glucose–xylose mixture to ethanol could be adjusted. Thus, {{the system could}} be optimized in cell ratio {{with respect to the}} change in sugar composition in the biomass feedstock. This was also confirmed in Fig.  2 a where different cell ratio of co-culture converted the <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> into ethanol at different ethanol production rate. The outperformed productivity of co-culture system relative to single-strain culture in the mixed sugar fermentation is expected since dedicating one strain to consume all <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> would lead to a longer fermentation time for the completed conversion of all sugars compared to having multiple strains as illustrated in several previous studies (Ashoor et al. 2015; Karagöz and Özkan 2014; Yadav et al. 2011; Suriyachai et al. 2013). The co-culture kinetic model could be used for optimization of co-culture fermentation by predicting an optimal initial cell ratio of the co-culture in any given <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture.</b> It is worth noting that although co-culture strategy has been previously implemented for utilization of C 6 and C 5 sugar, the kinetic model that can describe fermentation performance of the co-culture has not yet been developed.

40|$|In this research, {{the results}} for biocellulose {{production}} by Acetobacter xylinum in mixed medium culture were reported. Biocellulose production was determined by utilizing different feedstocks of single <b>sugars</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>mixtures</b> which were applied according to certain glucose to fructose ratio. Data for pH changes and the biocellulose production from every medium culture were thoroughly analyzed. In this experiment, it was ensured that all the samples had the initial temperature and pH of 30 ºC and pH 5. 5 respectively. The temperature was kept constant throughout the whole experiment while the changed pH value was taken as final pH {{at the end of}} the experiment for every sample. The highest production using <b>sugar</b> <b>mixtures</b> of 1 : 9 glucose to fructose ratio was 1. 57 g/l. The final pH values recorded in the different <b>sugar</b> <b>mixtures</b> were in the range of 4. 0 – 5. 5. The lowest final pH of 4. 56 was determined in the medium that contained a single carbon source of glucose, as most of the glucose was converted into gluconic acid and lead to lowest biocellulose production of 0. 69 g/l. In contrast, the highest pH value of 5. 3 was determined in the medium that contained a single carbon source of fructose and lead to the higher biocellulose production of 0. 9 g/l. Analyzing profiles for final pH and biocellulose production for the medium with higher glucose concentration showed that the glucose was preferable to be converted to gluconic acid rather than biocellulose synthesize. Besides, it was also determined that biocellulose production rate in mixed culture medium was higher than in culture medium that only consist of a single carbon source and this had proved that the experiment of enhancing biocellulose production with mixed medium culture was applicable.

30|$|Achieving {{economical}} lignocellulose-based bioprocess requires efficient {{utilization of}} C 6 and C 5 <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> present in biomass feedstock. In this study, we have implemented a model-based strategy to rationally design an optimized co-culture capable of efficiently converting glucose–xylose mixture into ethanol. Specifically, a consortia {{consisting of two}} yeast strains of S. stipitis and S. cerevisiae was modeled. The S. stipitis/S. cerevisiae co-culture kinetic model was applied to systematically assess ethanol fermentation kinetics under different cell ratio and to predict the optimal cell ratio for maximized batch ethanol production in two biomass feedstocks, rice straw and sugarcane bagasse. The model prediction was validated with fermentation and SSF experiments. The results prove the efficiency of optimized co-culture based on the model-based design for increasing ethanol titer and reducing fermentation time. The adjustability of co-culture {{is also a very}} appealing characteristic permitting an efficient fermentation of all types of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock by varying co-culture cell ratio to match with the composition of <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> available. Thus, this study demonstrates the utility of systematic approach based on co-culture kinetic model for guiding bioprocess design and optimization efforts aimed at rapidly improving efficiency of ethanol fermentation from lignocellulosic biomass. The modeling tool could also be useful for designing optimal cell ratio of co-culture for other lignocellulosic bio-based processes.|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{volatility}} in {{crude oil prices}} and widespread concern regarding global warming, there is increased need for finding sustainable alternatives to petrochemical based fuels. One way to achieve this objective is through the production of biofuels such as ethanol by microbial fermentation. In this context, this study focuses on the anaerobic fermentation of renewable substrates; glycerol and lignocellulosic <b>sugar</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{for the production of}} ethanol by P. macerans. Further, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) was used as a systemwide tool to understand the role of various metabolic pathways in the fermentative utilization of these substrates. Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel and bioethanol production, which is an abundant, inexpensive and renewable substrate. In this study, we have shown that P. macerans can anaerobically ferment glycerol in the absence of external electron acceptors. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the fermentation samples identified the production of ethanol, formate, acetate, succinate, and 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PDO) from glycerol. Use of U- 13 C glycerol as substrate demonstrated the incorporation of glycerol in the cell biomass. Glycerol fermentation was stimulated in a medium formulation with low concentrations of potassium and phosphate, cultivation at acidic pH, and the use of a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere. Since the consumption of reducing equivalents in the production of 1, 2 -PDO balances the reducing equivalents generated in the production of cell biomass, the synthesis of ethanol and 1, 2 -PDO are proposed to be a metabolic determinant of glycerol fermentation in P. macerans. Hexose and pentose sugars make the largest portion of lignocellulosic biomass, which is the ideal substrate for the production of biofuels. Most microorganisms can not utilize hexose and pentose sugars simultaneously. In this study, we have shown that P. macerans N 234 A can ferment hexose (glucose) and pentose (xylose and arabinose) sugars individually in the absence of external electron acceptors. Additionally, we have shown that P. macerans N 234 A can simultaneously utilize the three sugars of lignocellulosic biomass. We have also identified the factors pH and temperature, which improve the simultaneous sugar utilization by this microorganism. Metabolic flux analysis was used as an in vivo tool for systemwide study of glycerol and <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture</b> fermentations to elucidate the role of various pathways. In the case of glycerol fermentation, MFA analysis identified the role of 1, 2 -PDO production in achieving the redox balance by consuming the redox equivalents being generated in the production of biomass. Flux analysis also showed the role of PFL in pyruvate dissimilation in the glycerol fermentation. Similarly, in the case of <b>sugar</b> <b>mixture,</b> MFA analysis showed the role of PFL and PDH enzymes in the utilization of <b>sugar</b> <b>mixtures</b> by P. macerans...|$|R
