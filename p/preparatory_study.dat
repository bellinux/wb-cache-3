25|$|Deutsche Reichsbahn {{initiated}} the pre-planning {{in the summer}} of 1991. A <b>preparatory</b> <b>study</b> had been submitted to the central administration of the Reichsbahn (Zentralen Hauptverwaltung der Reichsbahn, ZHvDR) in November 1991. It served {{as the basis for the}} preliminary drafting plan, which was prepared by the Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit ("Planning Corporation for German Unity Railway Construction") from early 1992 and confirmed by the ZHvDR at the end of 1992. At the same time, a national and environmental protection planning study was carried out with the participating federal states and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. Within the scope of a space sensitivity test, a large-scale corridor investigation was carried out on the scale of 1:100,000 to determine route options. Among other things, conflicts and risks in relation to spatial and environmental factors along with railway operations and economic aspects were taken into account. According to the planning as of mid-1991, commissioning would be carried out by 2000 if possible.|$|E
2500|$|The work {{appears to}} be related to his drawing Three Men Digging, which may have been made as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>study,</b> [...] and {{notwithstanding}} the uncertainty in dating both works, it is supposed that both were done between 1815 and 1820 because of stylistic affinities to the Black Paintings. Despite similarities between the figures' positions in the drawing and the painting, there are several differences. The viewpoint in The Forge is lower, and makes the figures appear more imposing; unlike the drawing, two of the men's faces are visible; and the action in the drawing involves the digging of a hole with farm tools, while that of the painting is focused on an anvil. Both images may be seen as abstracted rather than realistic visions, as they each lack anecdotal context, and place three men in an impractical proximity.|$|E
