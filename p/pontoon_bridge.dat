5|$|Pontoon bridge: The Zhou Dynasty Chinese {{text of the}} Shi Jing (Book of Odes) {{records that}} King Wen of Zhou {{was the first to}} create a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> in the 11th century BC. However, the British scientist, sinologist and {{historian}} Joseph Needham has pointed out that in all likely scenarios, the temporary <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the Han Dynasty, 202 BC220 AD). Although earlier temporary pontoon bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC207 BC). The later Song Dynasty (9601279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote a description of the early pontoon bridges in China. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25220 AD), the Chinese created a very large <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> that spanned across the width of the Yellow River. There was also the rebellion of Gongsun Shu in 33 AD, where a large <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> with fortified posts was constructed across the Yangtze River, eventually broken through with ramming ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the Three Kingdoms period, during the Battle of Chibi in 208 AD, the Prime Minister Cao Cao once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a fire attack by Sun Quan's fleet. The armies of Emperor Taizu of Song had a large <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the Song Dynasty's conquest of the Southern Tang.|$|E
5|$|A brief famine {{of unknown}} extent occurred, perhaps caused by this {{financial}} crisis, but Suetonius claims it resulted from Caligula's seizure of public carriages; according to Seneca, grain imports were disturbed because Caligula repurposed grain boats for a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{discussion}} {{started with}} the plans to connect Meland, Flatøy and Lindøy with bridges. This {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in May 1975, and consisted of the Krossnessundet Bridge between Flatøy and Meland, which opened in November 1978. The Hagelsund Bridge opened on 1 April 1982 and connected Flatøy to Lindås and Knarvik, thus also connecting Meland and Lindås. Both bridges were partially financed with tolls. The plans for a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> were presented to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on 31 March 1981. They supported the choice of a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b> The decision to construct the bridge was taken by parliament on 9 December 1987, but they demanded that a larger ship channel be constructed.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Administration {{stated that}} they would not allow a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b> SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards {{receiving}} permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan—and thus complete—the Triangle Link. A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 {{percent of the population of}} Bømlo wanted the Triangle Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b> On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for the Triangle Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.|$|E

5|$|UN bombers {{immediately}} {{targeted the}} <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Han River at Seoul {{which was a}} main line of supply to the Pusan battlefield, and to destroy the repaired railroad bridge there. Several attempts in July by B-29s to destroy the rail bridge failed, but on July 29, 12 bombers succeeded in hitting the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> and reported it as having been destroyed. The next day, 47 B-29s bombed the Chosen Nitrogen Plant at Hungnam on the northeast coast. In the meantime, carrier-based planes from the USS Valley Forge, which was operating in the Yellow Sea, destroyed six locomotives, exploded 18 cars of a 33-car train, and damaged a combination highway and rail bridge at Haeju on July 22.|$|E
5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{position}} where the Wei forces {{set up the}} <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridges</b> was too exposed to be maintained by the Wei forces. Soon, another batch of Wu reinforcements led by Zhuge Jin and Yang Can (楊粲) arrived. Pan Zhang said, [...] "The Wei army's prowess was formidable at the beginning, and the river waters were shallow, so we could not match them at first." [...] Pan Zhang then ordered his men to move to 50 li upstream from the Wei army's location. They cut down and bundled together large quantities of reeds from the river to make big rafts, and sent them afloat down the river towards the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridges.</b> The reeds were set on fire, therefore burning down the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridges</b> to crisps. The Wu forces then executed a counter-attack on the Wei forces.|$|R
5|$|By 01:00 on 14 May, a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> {{had been}} erected over which {{elements}} of the 1st Panzer Division began crossing the Meuse into the bridgeheads. General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces ordered an air strike against the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b> Between 15:00 and 16:00 Allied bombers and fighters attacked the bridge. During this attack, Strachwitz organized the traffic across the bridge and ensured delivery of the anti-aircraft ammunition to help fend off the aerial attack, which inflicted only minor damage and did not stop the German advance. Panzer-Pionierbataillon 37 and Sturm-Pionierbataillon 43 ran into enemy tanks at Chéhéry and Panzer-Brigade I into French tanks at Bulson. More than 70 French tanks were left destroyed on the battlefield. While Kirchner ordered the bulk of 1st Panzer Division to keep heading west, French General Charles Huntziger ordered elements of his IIe Armée to protect the heights of Stonne, south of Sedan. This dissipated his forces and the French resistance was broken near Vendresse.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, {{and at first}} two technical methods for constructing the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> were considered: a continuous concrete floating caisson between the abutments, and a steel version incorporating a truss bridge carrying concrete pontoons. However, they were both rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the issue}} was brought up again, this time as a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge.</b> The depth and {{steepness}} of the fjord would {{make it impossible to}} fasten the bridge to the sea bottom. However, a method without lateral anchorage had been developed for the Hobart Bridge in Australia. Another alternative was launched in 1963, involving a submerged floating tunnel through the fjord. It was estimated to cost between NOK 19.5 and 26 million. Norwegian expatriate Leif J. Sverdrup, co-founder of Sverdrup & Parcel of the United States, inspected the fjord in 1965 and was later hired to plan the bridge in cooperation with Oslo-based civil engineering consultants Prosjektering. Municipal engineers started measuring currents in 1966. Prosjektering and Sverdrup & Parcel recommended a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> with a movable section to allow passage of ship traffic. In 1967, a new proposal was launched, in which a seaway tunnel would be blasted out in the rock on the Bergen side.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1916, Bodrog and Körös {{attacked}} a Romanian <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> being established across the Danube at Oryahovo, obtaining five direct hits, thus {{contributing to the}} defeat of the Romanian Flămânda Offensive. This was followed by action supporting the crossing of Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen's Austro-Hungarian Third Army at Sistow. Bodrog then wintered at Turnu Severin.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} for the Triangle Link was the desire to have a fixed link between the islands of Stord and Bømlo. The first documented proposals {{were made in the}} 1960s and involved building a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> across Stokksundet, inspired by the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge</b> between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from the shipping industry, who wished to continue to use the strait for ship traffic. The islands were connected with a network of five ferry services: Skjersholmane–Valevåg connected Stord and Sveio, Skjersholmane–Utbjoa connected Stord and Vindafjord, Sagvåg–Siggjarvåg connected Stord and Bølmo, and Bømlo was connected to the mainland both by the Mosterhamn–Valevåg Ferry and the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry.|$|E

5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge,</b> but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a <b>pontoon</b> <b>bridge,</b> and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
