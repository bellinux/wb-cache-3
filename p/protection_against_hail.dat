2500|$|In the 1960s, {{technological}} advances in frost protection introduced preventive measures, such as smudge pots and aspersion irrigation to the region. Smudge pots work by providing direct heat to the vines while aspersion involves spraying the vines with water {{as soon as}} temperatures hit [...] and maintaining persistent coverage. The water freezes on the vine, shielding it with a protective layer of ice that functions igloo-style, retaining heat within the vine. While cost {{is a factor in}} using smudge pots, there is a risk to the aspersion method if the constant sprinkling of water is interrupted of causing worse damage to the vine. There is no such <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>hail,</b> which in 2016 caused serious difficulties for some Chablis vignerons.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{growing in}} {{greenhouses}} and plastic tunnels has some advantages: obtaining early production, plant <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>hail,</b> hoarfrost, late {{spring and early}} autumn frosts. The main criteria considered for setting greenhouses are the existence of heating and water sources. Due to the compulsory location imposed by the above conditions, many greenhouses were placed on soils having low capability. After application of ameliorative measures some satisfactory results could be obtained on a relatively short period. Our studies on some soils in greenhouses and plastic tunnels in Romania have shown that after 15 - 20 years of the intensive exploitation an impermeable soil horizon with brittle blocky angular structure aggregates was formed at depth of circa 25 - 37 cm. The formation of this horizon is due to some pedogenenetic factors excluding compaction by soil tillage. The impermeable horizon shows some similar features to a fragipan (dense and brittle pan) that have been identified both in acid, neutral and even slight alkaline greenhouses soils: (i) evidence of pedogenesis within the aggregates; (ii) firm or firmer rupture-resistance class and a brittle manner of failure when soil is moist; (iii) restrict the entry of roots into (inactive and etiolated roots are distributed only on the structural aggregates). Nevertheless, some properties are not similar with a typical fragipan: (i) the diameter of soil aggregates frequently is lower than 5 cm; (ii) the structural aggregates are brittle on the moist state but are not submerged in water. Since this impermeable horizon has only some properties of fragipan we suggest to define it as horizon with protofragipanic characteristics. Moreover, due to the anthropogenic origin, these soils {{could be classified as}} Protofragipanic Hortic Anthrosol...|$|E

To explain {{the choice between}} the two alternatives for defence of fruit production <b>against</b> the <b>hail</b> risk, insurance and anti hail-nets, was developed a model that simulates the effects of variations of each component of cost and of the public aid. The quality of the model was then tested on three alpine areas representing different levels of hail risk.

40|$|The use {{of plastic}} nets in {{agriculture}} {{is now a}} consolidated reality all over the World. Plastic nets are used to protect orchards, flowers and vegetables thanks to the direct effect of crop <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> atmospheric agents (<b>hail,</b> wind, snow, heavy rain), birds and insects, as well as sand and saltiness, avoiding damages and/or dirtiness of the crop. Plastic nets perform indirect effects as well, when they are employed to close greenhouses and tunnels: due to their influence on {{the values of the}} main microclimatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, solar radiation, etc.), they could play a fundamental role on creating more favourable microclimatic conditions during the crop growth. The considerable success that plastic nets have registered in mild climate countries, as those located within the Mediterranean area, is currently pushing towards similar interesting application even in areas characterized by different climates - like the arid conditions usually found in Northern Africa and the Middle East - where greenhouse shading is essential in summer to reduce the solar radiation load. In the present paper, the spectro-radiometrical properties of some different nets - white, black and thermal-screen - employed in Saudi Arabia to shade the roof and side-walls of a polycarbonate ventilated greenhouse, were measured in laboratory in the solar/PAR range and in the thermal Infra-Red wavelength. From the obtained results, {{it is clear that the}} absorbance of the black plastic net is very high, both in the solar (nearly 70...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{propensity}} of retroviruses to rapidly establish persistent infections poses a formidable problem in vaccination strategies. In the current study, {{we use a}} live attenuated vaccine to study <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute and persistent Friend virus infections in mice. Adoptive transfers of immune CD 8 + T cells combined with passive immunizations with virus-neutralizing antibodies increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease compared with either treatment alone, {{but there was no}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infection. In addition, the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease elicited by the combination treatment was dependent on endogenous CD 4 + T cells as no protection was achieved in CD 4 + T-cell-depleted mice. Quantitative studies showed that doubling the numbers of immune lymphocytes used in adoptive transfer experiments increased <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease {{depending on the type of}} lymphocyte subset used in the transfer. CD 8 + T cells were the most potent subset for the transfer of such protection. However, even high numbers of immune CD 8 + T cells gave no <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the establishment of persistent infections. The data indicate that strengthening the numbers of specific immune cell subsets may have a beneficial effect on <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> acute disease, but protection from establishment of persistence requires complex immune responses involving multiple lymphocyte subsets...|$|R
