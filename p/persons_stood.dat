He had gone out a boy, and he was come home a hero; his eye shone like an eagle’s, and his beard was like a lion’s beard, and he stood up like a wild bull in his pride.|$|E
60|$|On {{a bright}} summer evening, two <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> among the {{shrubbery}} of a garden, stealthily watching a young girl, {{who sat in}} the window seat of a neighboring mansion. One of these unseen observers, a gentleman, was youthful, and had an air of high breeding and refinement, and a face marked with intellect, though otherwise of unprepossessing aspect. His features wore even an ominous, though somewhat mirthful expression, while he pointed his long forefinger at the girl, and seemed to regard her as a creature completely {{within the scope of}} his influence.|$|E

In that order they ran the first round, the second, and the third--both reserving their strength; both watched with breathless {{interest}} by every soul in the place. The trainers, with their cans in their hands, ran backward and forward over the grass, meeting their men at certain points, and eying them narrowly, in silence. The official <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> together in a group; their eyes following the runners round and round with the closest attention. The trainer's doctor, still attached to his illustrious colleague, offered the necessary explanations to Mr. Speedwell and his friend.|$|E

60|$|While {{the other}} {{travellers}} were hastening to the platform, two <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> passively apart {{as if they}} had not even yet decided on taking their places in the train. One of the two was a smart young man in a cheap travelling suit; mainly noticeable by his florid complexion, his restless dark eyes, and his profusely curling black hair. The other was a middle-aged woman in frowsy garments; tall and stout, sly and sullen. The smart young man stood behind the uncongenial-looking person with whom he had associated himself, using her as a screen to hide him while he watched the travellers {{on their way to the}} train. As the bell rang, the woman suddenly faced her companion, and pointed to the railway clock.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast {{over the}} anchor {{was at once}} pulled up, and in {{a quarter of an}} hour they were {{alongside}} a quay. Their appearance was so similar to that of the Lapps that they themselves would have attracted but little notice, but the canoe was so different in its appearance to those used by these people that several <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> on the little quay watching them as they came alongside. Their surprise at the boat was increased when Godfrey came up on to the quay. No Laplander or Finn of his height had ever been seen, and moreover, his face and hands were clean. They addressed him in a language that he did not understand. He replied first in English, then in Russian. Apparently they recognized the latter language, and one of them motioned to Godfrey to follow him.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the chair}} of state, at {{the upper end of}} the room, sat a small spare man, of about eight or nine-and-twenty, pale, and of a light complexion, with a rich dress of blue and gold. Sir Eric and several other <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> respectfully round him, and he was conversing with the Archbishop, who, as well as Sir Eric, cast several anxious glances at the little Duke as he {{advanced}} up the hall. He came up to the King, put his knee to the ground, and was just beginning, [...] "Louis, King of France, I--" [...] when he found himself suddenly lifted from the ground in the King's arms, and kissed on both cheeks. Then setting him on his knee, the King exclaimed, [...] "And is this the son of my brave and noble friend, Duke William? Ah! I should have known it from his likeness. Let me embrace you again, dear child, for your father's sake." ...|$|E

60|$|Below Nell and Joe, on the bank, {{were many}} log cabins. The yellow clay which filled the chinks between the logs gave these a {{peculiar}} striped appearance. There was life and bustle {{in the vicinity}} of these dwellings, in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the neighboring forests. There were canvas-covered wagons around which curly-headed youngsters were playing. Several horses were grazing on the short grass, and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that had been thrown to them. The smoke of many fires curled upward, and near the blaze hovered ruddy-faced women who stirred the contents of steaming kettles. One man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep, and the clean, sharp strokes rang on the air; another hammered stakes into the ground on which to hang a kettle. Before a large cabin a fur-trader was exhibiting his wares to three Indians. A second redskin was carrying a pack of pelts from a canoe drawn up on the river bank. A small group of <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> near; some were indifferent, and others gazed curiously at the savages. Two children peeped from behind their mother's skirts as if half-curious, half-frightened.|$|E
6000|$|People made {{way for her}} as she passed, others turned {{round and}} looked at her, and she {{received}} a great many greetings and pressings of the hand, all of which she accepted with the most delicate dignity. But though she smiled upon every one, she said nothing until she reached {{the last of the}} rooms, where she found her elder son. Then, [...] "This is enough, sir," [...] she declared with measured softness to Newman, and turned to the marquis. He put out both his hands and took both hers, drawing her to a seat with an air of the tenderest veneration. It was a most harmonious family group, and Newman discreetly retired. He moved through the rooms for some time longer, circulating freely, overtopping most people by his great height, renewing acquaintance with some of the groups to which Urbain de Bellegarde had presented him, and expending generally the surplus of his equanimity. He continued to find it all extremely agreeable; but the most agreeable things have an end, and the revelry on this occasion began to deepen to a close. The music was sounding its ultimate strains and people were looking for the marquise, to make their farewells. There seemed to be some difficulty in finding her, and Newman heard a report that she had left the ball, feeling faint. [...] "She has succumbed to the emotions of the evening," [...] he heard a lady say. [...] "Poor, dear marquise; I can imagine all that they may have been for her!" [...] But he learned immediately afterwards that she had recovered herself and was seated in an armchair near the doorway, receiving parting compliments from great ladies who insisted upon her not rising. He himself set out in quest of Madame de Cintre. He had seen her move past him many times in the rapid circles of a waltz, but in accordance with her explicit instructions he had exchanged no words with her {{since the beginning of the}} evening. The whole house having been thrown open, the apartments of the rez-de-chaussee were also accessible, though a smaller number of persons had gathered there. Newman wandered through them, observing a few scattered couples to whom this comparative seclusion appeared grateful and reached a small conservatory which opened into the garden. The end of the conservatory was formed by a clear sheet of glass, unmasked by plants, and admitting the winter starlight so directly that a person standing there would seem to have passed into the open air. Two <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> there now, a lady and a gentleman; the lady Newman, from within the room and although she had turned her back to it, immediately recognized as Madame de Cintre. He hesitated as to whether he would advance, but as he did so she looked round, feeling apparently that he was there. She rested her eyes on him a moment and then turned again to her companion.|$|E
50|$|After the Russian Revolution, {{the huge}} 17-domed church capable of {{accommodating}} more than 4,000 <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> unfinished, while the Soviets debated whether {{to have it}} reconstructed into a crematory or a radio centre. It was the largest church in Moscow after the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The dilapidated concrete shell was eventually torn down in 1952. A Pioneers Palace was raised on the old foundation in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|People {{do not go}} {{directly}} to heaven or hell. After death, they first go to what is termed the World of Spirits, halfway between Heaven and Hell. In the World of Spirits everyone goes through a three-stage process [...] that ends with their choosing, in free will, to go to Heaven or Hell to eternity. This free-will-choice-based system works because an evil <b>person</b> cannot <b>stand</b> the company in heaven, nor can a good <b>person</b> <b>stand</b> the company in hell.|$|R

5000|$|Before Cowdery {{served as}} one of the Three Witnesses, he had already {{experienced}} two other important visions. Cowdery said that he and Smith had received the Aaronic priesthood from John the Baptist in May 1829, after which they had baptized each other in the Susquehanna River. Cowdery said that he and Smith had later that year gone into the forest and prayed [...] "until a glorious light encircled us, and as we arose on account of the light, three <b>persons</b> <b>stood</b> before us dressed in white, their faces beaming with glory." [...] One of the three persons claimed to be the Apostle Peter and named the others James and John. The three laid their hands upon Cowdery's and Smith's heads and ordained them to the Melchizedek priesthood.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1810, the British Critic {{said they}} readily {{admitted}} that the language adopted by this book would be peculiarly effective {{on the minds of}} those pious Christians, in humble life, who were accustomed to read and revere their Bibles; but they thought that such <b>persons</b> <b>stood,</b> perhaps, in less need of the admonitions contained in this book than any others; while the price at which a book so elegantly printed could be sold would prevent it from falling into the hands of such persons. The British Critic said that they really regretted this circumstance because the book gave, in language with which such persons were best acquainted, a just view of the principles which led to the French Revolution, to the elevation of Buonaparte to the throne of the Bourbons, and to all the miseries under which Continental Europe had so long groaned; contrasting those miseries with the happiness Britons enjoyed under the mild government of George III. In 1908, The Nation described this pamphlet as being [...] "very curious as well as rare".|$|E

To them it might mean any wrong exercised in the interest of self-aggrandizement. Virtue with them was at its best, viewed from the present a personification of the vulgar and uncouth.
