30|$|The {{study is}} carried out in Ufuk University Dr.Rıdvan Ege Hospital {{in the city of}} Ankara, Turkey. Between April 2012 and December 2012, 128 {{patients}} who were performed 75 g OGTT, involved in study. The patients were joined the study from policlinics of internal medicine and endocrinology. The criteria to join the study were being 25  year old or older and having indication for OGTT. The exclusion criteria were, pregnancy, kidney disease (creatine levels 3  mg/dl or higher), liver disease, malabsorption syndromes, usage of steroids, polygala, tenuifolia, senega, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, anemia, DM diagnosis before, usage of antidiabetic drugs and history of gastrectomy. This study is a cross-sectional analysis of an observational study. Ufuk University ethical board approval has been received. All participants gave informed consent. All of the ethical considerations have been strictly followed in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. All of the measurements were performed within {{a few days after the}} indication for OGTT. Participants who agreed to attend study gave blood samples between hours 08.00 – 09.00 after minimum 10  h of fasting. 75 g OGTT was performed and the patients were divided into 5 groups according to OGTT World Health Organization (WHO) criteria which were IFG, IGT, IFG+IGT, DM and control groups. From fasting glucose samples Glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, trigliseride, BUN, creatinine, CBC, AST, ALT, albumine, total protein, sedimentation, fasting insulin, fasting c-peptide levels were detected. Blood samples from each patient taken for 1, 5 -AG levels had stored at − 83 cantigrat degree for the analysis day with ELISA method. Each patients arterial blood pressure were measured and demographic data were recorded. Waist circumference measurement executed from half of distance between inferior costa and spina iliaca anterior superior. Body mass index and HOMA-IR (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (mg/dl) × fasting plasma insulin (μ/ml)/ 405) were calculated for each participant. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> function were calculated with the formula of 360  × fasting plasma insulin (μ/ml)/FPG (mg/dl) − 63  %. The analysis of blood samples were performed at Ufuk University Dr. Rıdvan Ege Hospital Biochemistry Department Laboratuary. Glycated hemoglobin was measured with “Agilent 1100 Series” with “High Pressure Likid Chromatography” method whereas fructosamine was measured with “Cobas Integra 400 Plus” with spectrophotometric method. BUN, creatinine, HDL, LDL, trigliseride, total cholesterol, albumine, total proteine blood samples were detected with “Cobas Integra 800 ” with spectrophotometric method. The analysis of plasma samples for glucose levels were executed with hexocinase method by “Cobas Integra 800 ”. 1, 5 -AG is measured with “Cusabio Human 1, 5 -anhydroglucitol ELISA Kit” by “DSX Automated Elisa System” machine.|$|E

These functions are dependent on <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> antigen receptor (BCR) specificity and expression of MHC, implicating linked autoantigen recognition and presentation to effector T cells. BCR-antigen affinity requirements for participation in disease are unclear. We hypothesized that BCR affinity for the autoantigen insulin differentially affects lymphocyte functionality, including tolerance modality and the ability to acquire and become activated in the diabetogenic environment. Using combined transgenic and retrogenic heavy and light chain to create multiple insulin-binding BCRs, we demonstrate that affinity for insulin is a critical determinant of the function of these autoreactive cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{variation}} in peripheral blood B lymphocyte subsets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: B lymphocyte subsets in disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) -naïve patients with RA (n =  30), patients with RA treated with DMARDs (n =  73) and healthy controls (n =  46) {{were analyzed by}} flow cytometry.

RESULTS: Total memory <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> IgM memory <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and non-switched memory <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were reduced in RA patients at diagnosis compared to controls (P <  0. 05). In patients with treated RA, there was a further reduction of total <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> CD 21 lo <b>cells,</b> transitional <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and plasmablasts, compared to controls (P <  0. 05). The reduction in absolute numbers of total <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> switched memory <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> CD 21 lo <b>cells,</b> transitional <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and plasmablasts in treated RA patients was significant (P <  0. 05) even {{when compared to the}} DMARD-naïve patients. Only treatment responders (Disease Activity Score <  3. 2) had reduced total <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> and absolute numbers of switched and IgM memory <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> (P <  0. 05).

We first observed that MuHV- 4 -specific <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> represent a minority of the latent population, and to better understand the influence of the virus on non-MuHV- 4 specific <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> we used the SWHEL mouse model, which produce hen egg lysozyme (HEL) -specific <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> By tracking HEL+ and HEL 2 <b>B</b> <b>cells,</b> we showed that in vivo latency was restricted to HEL 2 <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> while the two populations were equally sensitive to the virus in vitro. Moreover, MuHV- 4 induced two waves of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> activation. While the first wave was characterized by a general <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> activation, as shown by HEL+ and HEL 2 <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> expansion and upregulation of CD 69 expression, the second wave was restricted to the HEL 2 population, which acquired germinal center (GC) and plasma cell phenotypes. Antigenic stimulation of HEL+ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> {{led to the development of}} HEL+ GC <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> where latent infection remained undetectable, indicating that MuHV- 4 does not benefit from acute <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> responses to establish latency in non-virus specific <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> but relies on other mechanisms of the humoral response. These data support a model in which the establishment of latency in <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> by c-herpesviruses is not stochastic in terms of BCR specificity and is tightly linked to the formation of GCs...|$|R

However, specific deletion of Dock 10 in <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> {{was associated with a}} mild phenotype with normal <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development and normal <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> spreading, polarization, motility, chemotaxis, aggregation, and Ig class switching. Dock 10 -deficient <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> showed lower proliferation in response to anti-CD 40 and IL- 4 stimulation. Moreover, the IgG response to soluble antigen in vivo was lower when Dock 10 was specifically deleted in <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Together, we found that most <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> responses were intact in the absence of Dock 10.

We show that the coculture of monocytes with <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> from peripheral blood or from diffuse large <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> lymphoma enabled prolonged <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Under these conditions, diffuse large lymphoma <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> proliferated, and addition of B cell-activating factor of the TNF family and IL- 2 enhanced cell division. Monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) had similar antiapoptotic activity on healthy <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> but displayed differences with respect to <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. Monocytes and cord blood-derived CD 14 (+) <b>cells</b> promoted <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in the presence of an anti-CD 40 stimulus, whereas DC supported <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation when activated through the BCR. DC and CD 14 (+) cells were able to induce plasmocyte differentiation. When <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> were activated via the BCR or CD 40, they released the leukocyte attractant CCL 5, and this chemokine is one of the main chemokines expressed in diffuse large <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> lymphoma.

Recent studies of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> populations, based on evaluation of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation markers, now allow the enumeration and enrichment of other stage specific precursor cells. In this study we report {{detailed analysis of the}} ontogeny of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> lineage subsets in New Zealand black (NZB) and control strains of mice. Our data suggest that <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development in NZB mice is partially arrested at the fraction A Pre–Pro <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> stage. This arrest at the Pre-Pro <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> stage is secondary to prolonged lifespan and greater resistance to spontaneous apoptosis. In addition, expression of the gene encoding the critical <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development transcription factor BSAP is reduced in the Pre–Pro <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> stage in NZB mice. This impairment may influence subsequent <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development to later stages, and thereby accounts for the down-regulation of the <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor component Igα (mb- 1). Furthermore, levels of expression of the Rug 2, λ 5 and Igβ (B 29) genes are also reduced in Pre–Pro <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> of NZB mice.

In this study, we assessed the in vivo response of MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in mice immunized with viral particles derived from the RNA phage Qbeta. We found that both follicular (FO) and MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> responded to immunization with viral particles. MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> responded with slightly faster kinetics, but numerically, FO <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> dominated the response. <b>B</b> 1 <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> responded similarly to MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Both MZ and FO <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> underwent isotype switching, with MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> again exhibiting faster kinetics. In fact, almost all Qbeta-specific MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> expressed surface IgG by day 5. Histological analysis demonstrated that a population of activated <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> remain associated with the MZ, probably due to the elevated integrin levels expressed by these cells. Thus, both MZ and FO <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> respond with rapid proliferation to viral infection and both populations undergo isotype switching, but MZ <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> remain in the MZ and may be responsible for local Ab production, opsonizing pathogens entering the spleen...|$|R

To investigate the role of CD 22 during T cell-dependent (TD) Ab responses and memory <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> formation, we analyzed Ag-specific <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> responses generated by wild-type (WT) or CD 22 -/- <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> following immunization with a TD Ag.

40|$|MicroRNAs {{have emerged}} as key {{regulators}} of <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> fate decisions and immune function. Deregulation of several microRNAs in <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> leads {{to the development of}} autoimmune disease and cancer in mice. We demonstrate that the microRNA- 212 / 132 cluster (miR- 212 / 132) is induced in <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> in response to <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> receptor signaling. Enforced expression of miR- 132 results in a block in early <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development at the prepro-B cell to pro-B cell transition and induces apoptosis in primary bone marrow <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Importantly, loss of miR- 212 / 132 results in accelerated <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> recovery after antibody-mediated <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> depletion. We find that Sox 4 is a target of miR- 132 in <b>B</b> <b>cells.</b> Co-expression of SOX 4 with miR- 132 rescues the defect in <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development from overexpression of miR- 132 alone, thus suggesting that miR- 132 may regulate B lymphopoiesis through Sox 4. In addition, we show that the expression of miR- 132 can inhibit cancer development in cells that are prone to <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> cancers, such as <b>B</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the c-Myc oncogene. We have thus uncovered miR- 132 as a novel contributor to <b>B</b> <b>cell</b> development...|$|R
