60|$|The peas of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry, are pale greenish-brown, thickly {{covered with}} dots of dark purple so minute {{as to be}} visible only through a lens, and Mr. Laxton has never seen or heard of this variety {{producing}} a purple pea; but <b>in</b> the crossed <b>pod</b> one of the peas was of a uniform beautiful violet-purple tint, and a second was irregularly clouded with pale purple. The colour lies in the outer of the two coats which surround the pea. As the peas of the purple-podded variety when dry are of a pale greenish-buff, it would at first appear that this remarkable change of colour <b>in</b> the <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> the crossed <b>pod</b> {{could not have been}} caused by the direct action of the pollen of the purple-pod: but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has purple flowers, purple marks on its stipules, and purple pods; and that the Tall Sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers and stipules, and microscopically minute purple dots on the peas, we can hardly doubt that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in combination modified the colour of the <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> the crossed <b>pod.</b> After having examined these specimens, I crossed the same two varieties, and the <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> one <b>pod</b> but not the pods themselves, were clouded and tinted with purplish-red in a much more conspicuous manner than the <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> the uncrossed <b>pods</b> produced at the same time by the same plants. I may notice as a caution that Mr. Laxton sent me various other crossed peas slightly, or even greatly, modified in colour; but the change in these cases was due, as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to the altered colour of the cotyledons, seen through the transparent coats of the peas; and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these cases are not in any way remarkable.|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} {{narrative is}} included {{in this article as}} it links the video data example to family activity in order to clarify the cultural milieu of Luci’s family. Prior to capturing the mobile phone video data, a family gathering around a dinner table makes a connection between Luci’s counting experience (Wagoner 2017) and her transitory symbolic play moment with the felt necklace. The context for the connection is the family home where Luci is sitting on her aunt’s knee around a dinner table. Aunt begins a guessing game by taking a sugar snap pea from a bowl and asking how many <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pod?</b> Aunt playfully holds the pea pod up to her own face to pretend it’s an upwardly curving smile. Luci smiles and watches her Aunt intently. Luci has been opening the pea pods herself and feeding on the peas inside, not thinking about how many <b>peas</b> are <b>in</b> each <b>pod.</b> Luci looks at Aunt’s pea pod and answers ‘two’ and when the pod is opened she sees that there are indeed two <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pod.</b> Luci’s face lights up with a huge smile and with a glancing gesture to her family around the dinner table she sees their nods and looks of beaming recognition, as they acknowledge she correctly guessed the number of peas. Luci has an understanding of what ‘two’ can be; in this case, two <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a <b>pod.</b> <b>In</b> the light of this small story, the notion that Vygotsky (2004, 7 – 97) considered creative activity is based on the ability of the brain to combine elements, fits very well: “whenever a person imagines, combines, alters, and creates something new, no matter how small, this thing appears …compared to the work of others.” Luci has configured a new thing (two-ness) in her home situation. Davydov (2008) had observed that: “A person's conscious activity is mediated by the collective” (p. 31). Past collective mediations such as those learned around the dinner table, are implicitly present in collective memory. In this way when Luci brings past collectively mediated experiences to her present handling of the felt beads, she already remembers and understands that counting is useful and valued in her family life (White and Dalli 2017). Vygotsky (1994) notes in relation to cultural development of the child: “the amount remembered is determined by the degree of his [her] attention, by the amount of his individual memory and by the measure of his interest in the matter” (p. 64).|$|R

60|$|Nigel {{had indeed}} lain {{with all the}} breath shaken from his body, and as he was unaware that his helmet had been carried off, he had not {{understood}} either the alarm or the amusement that he had caused. Now freed from the great hauberk {{in which he had}} been shut like a <b>pea</b> <b>in</b> a <b>pod,</b> he stood blinking in the light, blushing deeply with shame that the shifts to which his poverty had reduced him should be exposed to all these laughing courtiers.

60|$|A {{few days}} before the King had {{examined}} the tree and found the animal-crackers not quite ripe. Whereupon he had gone away and forgotten all about them. And, in his absence, they had ripened to a delicious light brown; and their forms had rounded out, so that they hung as thickly together as <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a <b>pod.</b> As they swung from their stems, swaying backward and forward in the light breeze, they waited and waited for some one to come and pick them. But no one came near the tree, and the animals grew cross and restless in consequence.|$|R
60|$|Provided that {{we could}} kill the two guards in the proper fashion--rather a large proviso, I admit--the thing was simple as {{shelling}} peas which, notwithstanding the proverb, in my experience is not simple at all, since generally the shells crack the wrong way {{and at least one}} of the <b>peas</b> remained <b>in</b> the <b>pod.</b> So it happened in this case, for Janee, whom we had both forgotten, remained <b>in</b> the <b>pod.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fusion of the nuclei (karyogamy) {{takes place}} in the U-shaped cells in the hymenium, and results in the {{formation}} of a diploid zygote. The zygote grows into the ascus, an elongated tube-shaped or cylinder-shaped capsule. Meiosis then gives rise to four haploid nuclei, usually followed by a further mitotic division that results in eight nuclei in each ascus. The nuclei along with some cytoplasma become enclosed within membranes and a cell wall to give rise to ascospores that are aligned inside the ascus like <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a <b>pod.</b> (For a general description of meiosis and its adaptive function see Meiosis and Bernstein and Bernstein).|$|R

Each new summer of the few left must be shorter and swifter than the last: its Junes will be thirty days long, and its Julys and Augusts thirty-one, in compliance with the almanac; but the days will be of so small a compass that fourteen of them will rattle round in a week of the old size like shrivelled <b>peas</b> <b>in</b> a <b>pod.</b>|$|R
