40|$|Abstract: The {{relatively}} {{rapid development}} of microbial resistance after {{the entry of}} every new antimicrobial into the marketplace necessitates a constant supply of new agents to maintain effective pharmacotherapy. Despite extensive efforts to identify novel lead compounds from molecular targets, only the <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> inhibitors (PDIs) have shown any real promise, with some advancing to phase I human trials. Bacterial <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase,</b> which catalyzes {{the removal of the}} N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB- 83698 and oral NVP LBM- 415) entered phase I human trials. However, agents to the present have suffered from major potential liabilities. Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC 90 values ranging from 1 – 8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase)</b> are worrisome. These could portend a short timespan of efficacy after marketing. Despite these current liabilities, further pursuit of more potent and broader spectrum PDIs which are less susceptible to bacterial mechanisms of resistance is still warranted...|$|E

Methionine, the universal start signal in mRNA translation, undergoes a series of transformations prior to its incorporation into proteins (reviewed in reference 16). Thereafter, it is removed in most cases from mature proteins by a ubiquitous enzyme, methionine aminopeptidase.

40|$|<b>Peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> (EC 3. 5. 1. 31) is a {{mononuclear}} iron {{enzyme that}} cleaves the formyl {{group of the}} N-terminal formyl-methionine residue of nascent polypeptide chains in eubacteria.

The metal ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by a water molecule and the side chains of residues Cys 90, His 132, and His 136.

40|$|<b>Peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> is an {{attractive}} target for developing novel antibiotics. Previous studies at pH 3. 0 showed <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> from Leptospira interrogans (LiPDF) exists as a dimer in which one monomer is in a closed form {{and the other is}} in an open form, with different conformations of the CD-loop controlling the entrance to the active pocket.

Interestingly, both of the monomers are almost in the same closed form as that observed at pH 3. 0. However, when the enzyme is complexed with the natural inhibitor actinotin, the con-formation of the CD-loop is half-open. Two pairs of Arg 109 -medi-ated cation- interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds, have been identified to stabilize the different CD-loop conformations.

40|$|Identifying {{potential}} {{ligand binding}} sites on a protein surface {{is an important}} first step for targeted structure-based drug discovery. While performing control experiments with Escherichia coli <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> (PDF), we noted that the organic solvents used to solubilize some ligands perturbed many of the same resonances in PDF as the small molecule inhibitors.

The correlation between sites of solvent and inhibitor binding highlights the utility of organic solvents to rapidly and effectively validate and characterize binding sites on proteins prior to designing a drug discovery screen.

40|$|<b>Peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> {{activity}} {{was thought to}} be limited to ribosomal protein synthesis in prokaryotes, where new peptides are initiated with an N-formylated methionine. We describe here a new human <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> (Homo sapiens PDF, or HsPDF) that is localized to the mitochondria. HsPDF is capable of removing formyl groups from N-terminal methionines of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins, an activity previously not thought to be necessary in mammalian cells. We show that actinonin, a peptidomimetic antibiotic that inhibits HsPDF, also inhibits the proliferation of 16 human cancer cell lines. We designed and synthesized 33 chemical analogs of actinonin; all of the molecules with potent activity against HsPDF also inhibited tumor cell growth, and vice versa, confirming target specificity. Small interfering RNA inhibition of HsPDF protein expression was also antiproliferative. Actinonin treatment of cells led to a tumor-specific mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ATP depletion in a time- and dose-dependent manner; removal of actinonin led to a recovery of the membrane potential consistent with indirect effects on the electron transport chain. In animal models, oral or parenteral actinonin was well tolerated and inhibited human prostate cancer and lung cancer growth.

The bacterial susceptibility to such a cytoplasmic target primarily depends on the capacity of the compound to reach and accumulate in the cytosol. Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine the respective involvement of penetration (influx) and pumping out (efflux) mechanisms to <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> inhibitors (PDF-I) activity, the potency of various series was determined using various genetic contexts (efflux overproducers or efflux-deleted strains) and membrane permeabilizers.

Conclusions/Significance: Our results clearly show that the bacterial membrane {{plays a key role in}} modulating the antibacterial activity of PDF-Is.
