40|$|This Article {{provides}} {{the first comprehensive}} analysis of patent law 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 pioneer invention doctrine 2 ̆ 2 in almost two decades. Since the early 1990 s, patent scholars have unanimously reported that case law favoring so-called 2 ̆ 2 pioneer 2 ̆ 2 patents-i. e., those disclosing the most revolutionary inventions-is dead letter. Accordingly, most scholars have ignored the pioneer doctrine entirely. Those few who have studied it have consistently argued that the doctrine ought to be raised from the dead and reintroduced to patent law. This Article refutes scholarly consensus on both points. First, empirical evidence shows that the pioneer doctrine {{is still very much}} good law, especially at the district court level where it is routinely applied. In fact, the pioneer doctrine actually arises in litigation just as frequently as other issues that receive substantial scholarly attention. Second, this Article argues that the pioneer doctrine should now be excised from patent law once and for all, rather than returned to a place of prominence. Numerous aspects of patent law ensure that pioneer inventors receive generous patent rights without additional assistance. Further, the history of innovation strongly suggests that truly pioneering inventions do not exist. Despite the notoriety of inventors like Edison and Bell, a close reading of history shows that virtually all 2 ̆ 2 pioneer 2 ̆ 2 inventions were independently and contemporaneously invented by multiple groups working to solve the same known problems. Finally, case studies from various industries demonstrate that dominant <b>pioneer</b> <b>patent</b> rights generally stifle rather than promote innovation because they significantly discourage investment in the development of next-generation technology...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the structure and}} the evolution of the patents declared as essential for three major technical standards in information technology (MPEG 2, DVD and W-CDMA). These standards have many essential patents, which are owned by many firms with different interests. Many patents have been applied even after the standard was set. We analyze three important reasons for why the essential patents are many and increase over time: they cover a number of different technology fields, there exist R&D competition even in a narrowly defined technology field and a firm can expand its patent portfolio by using continuations and other practices based on the priority dates of its earlier filed patent applications in the USA. Around 40 % of the essential US patents for MPEG 2 and DVD standards have been obtained by using these applications. However, our empirical analysis suggests that a firm with <b>pioneering</b> <b>patents</b> does not obtain more essential patents, using these practices. standard, essential patent, continuations...|$|R

500|$|The {{idea for}} a video game console was thought up by Baer in August 1966, {{and over the next}} three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven {{successive}} prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console in September 1972 through their dealerships, Magnavox sold between 69,000 and 100,000 units by the end of the year, and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the Magnavox Odyssey series of dedicated consoles, as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey². One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the console. Baer's patents for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as [...] "the <b>pioneering</b> <b>patent</b> of the video game art", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits over 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million.

40|$|Bachelor‘s {{thesis is}} {{focuses on the}} issue of {{designing}} electrical switching devices, especially dimensioning of the current-carrying paths according to the effects of electrodynamic forces. There are dimensioning requirements for current carrying paths of switching devices in the introductory chapter. Fundamental requirements are: sufficient dielectric strength between parts at different potential, resistance to thermal effects of electric current and current path arrangement considering electrodynamic forces. Typical current path arrangements of electrical apparatuses are justified in second chapter. Furthermore, the actual problems to solve are formulated, corresponding with the development of technical solutions. Emphasis is laid upon proper description of modifications of the proposal so to limit their negative impact of secondary phenomena such as electrodynamic forces or thermal effects. The best solutions then directly positively use these phenomena. The present progressive technical solutions retrieved in a patented state of the art using Goldfire Innovator software are described in the third chapter. The work is then focused on rotary contact arrangement patents from the very first, through the <b>pioneering</b> <b>patent</b> to the present. Hereinafter are described the features of the evolution of technology development – micro and macrosegmentation.

The house and grounds were designed as a small country estate. The house occupies a hillside location and is sited on two stonework terraces, pierced by three stone staircases placed among gardens designed by landscape architect Mabel Symmes in 1938-1939. The house is significant under Criterion B for its association with {{the final stage of}} Charles W. Merrill's long and distinguished career.

50|$|In 1979, {{a company}} {{was founded in}} Texas by Gordon Matthews called ECS Communications (the name was later changed to VMX, for Voice Message exchange). VMX {{developed}} a 3000-user voice messaging system called the VMX/64 {{and was the first}} company to offer a voice messaging system for sale commercially for corporate use. In the early 1980s, VMX sold voice messaging systems to several large corporations, such as 3M, Kodak, American Express, Intel, Hoffmann-La Roche, Corning Glass, Arco, Shell Canada and Westinghouse. The impressive list of early adopters started the ball rolling on corporate voice-mail. While VMX began with a good start, it failed at developing the market, and the company was not a commercial success. It took several years before its products could answer outside calls (and then only under certain circumstances), they were physically enormous, expensive, light on important user features and had serious reliability issues. In addition, the user interface was cumbersome, requiring the users to remember non-intuitive multi-digit Touch-tone commands. Matthews, a prolific entrepreneur and patenter, applied for and was granted a patent on voice-mail (patent number 4,371,752) which issued in February, 1983. The patent was promoted as the <b>pioneering</b> <b>patent</b> for voice-mail.However, the patent application was filed on 11/26/1979, 5 years after and issued in 1983, 2 years after that of Kolodny and Hughes as described above, and cannot therefore be considered as the pioneering foundation of voice mail.|$|R
40|$|With the multi-billion dollar generic {{pharmaceutical}} industry growing annually, litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act—the legislation that expedited the Food 2 ̆ 6 Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) approval process for generic drugs—can have substantial economic implications on American consumers. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a generic drug company can challenge a brand-name pharmaceutical company’s <b>pioneer</b> drug <b>patent(s)</b> in an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) by filing a Paragraph IV certification with the FDA, and the patentee can—and usually does—sue for infringement.

The United States District Court for the District of Delaware’s four Article III judges hear {{the majority of cases}} arising under the Hatch-Waxman Act. However, unlike other patent-heavy dockets, the District of Delaware does not have uniform local patent rules and very rarely entertains motions for summary judgment in Hatch-Waxman litigation. This article evaluated the District of Delaware’s procedures in handling Hatch-Waxman cases and presents an empirical study of the district’s summary judgment practice in these cases. The empirical study shows that the District of Delaware’s practice is efficient and predictable and not contrary to the purpose behind the Hatch-Waxman Act: to bring more low-cost generic drugs to consumers. Because the district has a bench experienced in patent litigation, the District of Delaware does not need to adopt local patent rules and should continue its current practice of rarely hearing summary judgment motions in ANDA cases...|$|R
