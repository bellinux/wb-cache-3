The photometry was obtained with one of the CSTAR telescopes during 128 days of the 2008 Antarctic winter. We used this photometric data set to derive site statistics for Dome A and to search for variable stars. Thanks to the nearly uninterrupted synoptic coverage, we found six times as many variables as previous surveys with similar magnitud...|$|E
40|$|The LIMS {{experiment}} {{sounded the}} upper atmosphere from late October 1978 to late May 1979 and provided vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, 03, H 2 O, HNO 3, and NO 2. Radiance averaging was used before retrieval to measure the altitude distribution of NO 2 over the altitude range from the lower stratosphere into the mesosphere. Observations in the <b>polar</b> <b>winter</b> <b>night</b> region northward of about 70 deg N reveal NO 2 levels near 175 ppbv at about 70 km, and they show a significant longitudinal variability (factor of 4 to 7). A definite temporal trend exists, showing a buildup of mesospheric and stratospheric NO 2 during the polar night and a subsequent slowing of the increase of decline after sunlight returns, depending on altitude. The data represent the first experimental evidence that the thermosphere is an NO(x) source for the mesosphere and stratosphere...|$|E

The observations were performed by the MIPAS instrument on the Envisat satellite.

5000|$|The {{stratosphere}} (...) is {{the second}} major layer of Earth's atmosphere, just above the troposphere, and below the mesosphere. About 20% of the atmosphere's mass is contained in the stratosphere. The stratosphere is stratified in temperature, with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the Earth. The increase of temperature with altitude {{is a result of}} the absorption of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation by the ozone. This is in contrast to the troposphere, near the Earth's surface, where temperature decreases with altitude. The border between the troposphere and stratosphere, the tropopause, marks where this temperature inversion begins. Near the equator, the stratosphere starts at 18 km; at mid latitudes, it starts at 10 - 13 km and ends at 50 km; at the poles, it starts at about 8 km. Temperatures vary within the stratosphere with the seasons, in particular with the <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> (<b>winter).</b> The greatest variation of temperature takes place over the poles in the lower stratosphere; those variations are largely steady at lower latitudes and higher altitudes.|$|R

40|$|The Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model (MTGCM) was {{exercised}} for Ls = 90 (aphelion) solar minimum, and Ls = 270 perihelion) solar maximum conditions. Simulated MTGCM outputs (i. e. helium density distributions) {{were compared}} to those previously observed for Earth and Venus. <b>Winter</b> <b>polar</b> <b>night</b> bulges of helium are predicted on Mars, similar to those observed on the nightside of Venus and in the <b>winter</b> <b>polar</b> regions of Earth. A poster on this research {{was presented at the}} European Geophysical Society Meeting (EGS) in 2003. This research paves the way for what might be expected in the polar night regions of Mars during upcoming aerobraking and mapping Campaigns. Lastly, Mars thermosphere (approx. 100 - 130 km) <b>winter</b> <b>polar</b> warming was observed at high Northern latitudes during the perihelion season, but not at high Southern latitudes during the opposite aphelion season. Presumably, the Mars thermospheric circulation is responsible for the dynamically controlled heating needed to warm polar night temperatures above radiative equilibrium values. Again, MTGCM simulations were conducted for Ls = 90 and Ls = 270 conditions; polar temperatures were examined and found to be much warmer at Northern high latitudes (perihelion) than at Southern high latitudes (aphelion), similar to Mars aerobraking datasets. The Mars thermospheric circulation is found to be stronger during perihelion solstice conditions than during aphelion conditions, owing to both stronger seasonal solar and dust heating during Mars perihelion. An invited talk was given at the Spring AGU 2004 on this research. A forthcoming GRL paper was drafted on this same topic, but not submitted before the termination of this 1 -year grant...|$|R
40|$|The oxygen isotope {{composition}} of nitrogen oxides (NO x) {{in the atmosphere}} is {{a useful tool for}} understanding the oxidation of NO x into nitric acid / nitrate in the atmosphere. A set of experiments was conducted to examine change in isotopic {{composition of}} NO x due to NO x –O 2 –O 3 photochemical cycling. At low NO x / O 2 mixing ratios, NO x became progressively and nearly equally enriched in 17 O and 18 O over time until it reached a steady state with Δ 17 O values of 39. 3 ± 1. 9 ‰ and δ 18 O values of 84. 2 ± 4 ‰, relative to the isotopic composition of the initial O 2 gas. As the mixing ratios were increased, the isotopic enrichments were suppressed by isotopic exchange between O atoms, O 2, and NO x. A kinetic model was developed to simulate the observed data and it showed that the isotope effects occurring during O 3 formation play a dominant role in controlling NO x isotopes and, in addition, secondary kinetic isotope effects or isotope exchange reactions are also important during NO x cycling. The data and model were consistent with previous studies which showed that the NO + O 3 reactions occur mainly via the transfer of the terminal atoms of O 3. The model predicts that under tropospheric concentrations of NO x and O 3, the timescale of NO x –O 3 isotopic equilibrium ranges from hours (for ppbv NO x / O 2 mixing ratios) to days (for pptv mixing ratios) and yields steady state Δ 17 O and δ 18 O values of 45 ‰ and 117 ‰ respectively (relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW)) in both cases. Under atmospheric conditions when O 3 has high concentrations, the equilibrium between NO x and O 3 should occur rapidly (h) but this equilibrium cannot be reached during <b>polar</b> <b>winters</b> and/or <b>nights</b> if the NO x conversion to HNO 3 is faster. The experimentally derived rate coefficients can be used to model the major NO x –O 3 isotopologue reactions at various pressures and in isotope modeling of tropospheric nitrate...|$|R
