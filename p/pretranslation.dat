Aim: To introduce prospective university students, such as sixth formers, {{to the kind}} of assignment they might be given {{at the start of a}} university course in Translation Studies in German. It is intended to give students an idea as to the type of text they might be required to translate and the issues they would need to think about when beginning to train as a professional translator. 2 parts, 12 tasks - total time 4 hours. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} for Cross-Lingual Question Answering (CLQA), where the statistical machine translation (SMT) is utilized. In the proposed method, the SMT is deeply incorporated into the question answering process, instead of using it as the pre-processing of the mono-lingual QA process {{as in the previous}} work. The proposed method can be considered as exploiting the SMT-based passage retrieval for CLQA task. Our experimental results targeting the English-to-Japanese CLQA using the NTCIR CLQA 1 and 2 test collections showed that the proposed method outperformed the previous <b>pretranslation</b> approach. ...|$|E

Experiments on the effects of phrasal translation, indexing of translated phrasal terms, pre-translation feedback and parallel documents feedback in diverse retrieval settings, are reported. The results show that pre-translation pseudorelevance feedback is always effective. We confirmed that phrasal translation is effective and crucial even the retrieval system does not use phrasal indexing units.

40|$|Semantic {{knowledge}} {{has been adopted}} recently for SMT preprocessing, decoding and evaluation, {{in order to be}} able to compare sentences based on their meaning rather than on mere lexical and syntactic similarity. Little attention has been paid to semantic knowledge in the context of integrating fuzzy matches from a translation memory with SMT. We present work in progress which focuses on semantics-based <b>pretranslation</b> before decoding in SMT. This involves applying fuzzy matching metrics based on lexical semantics and semantic roles, aligning parse trees based on semantic roles, and pretranslating matching source sentence parts using aligned tree nodes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to push the {{envelope}} of system performance, microprocessor designs are continually exploiting higher levels of instruction-level parallelism, resulting in increasing bandwidth demands on the address translation mechanism. Most current microprocessor designs meet this demand with a multi-ported TLB. While this design provides an excellent hit rate at each port, its access latency and area grow very quickly as the number of ports is increased. As bandwidth demands continue to increase, multi-ported designs will soon impact memory access latency. We present four high-bandwidth address translation mechanisms with latency and area characteristics that scale better than a multiported TLB design. We extend traditional high-bandwidth memory design techniques to address translation, developing interleaved and multi-level TLB designs. In addition, we introduce two new designs crafted specifically for high-bandwidth address translation. Piggyback ports are introduced as a technique to exploit spatial locality in simultaneous translation requests, allowing accesses to the same virtual memory page to combine their requests at the TLB access port. <b>Pretranslation</b> is introduced as a technique for attaching translations to base register values, making it possible to reuse a single translation many times. We perform extensive simulation-based studies to evaluate our designs. We vary key system parameters, such as processor model, page size, and number of architected registers, to see what effects these changes have on the relative merits of each approach. A number of designs show particular promise. Multi-level TLBs with as few as eight entries in the upper-level TLB nearly achieve the performance of a TLB with unlimited bandwidth. Piggyback ports combined with a lesser-ported TLB structure, e. g., an interleaved or multi-ported TLB, also perform well. <b>Pretranslation</b> over a singleported TLB performs almost as well as a same-sized multi-level TLB with the added benefit of decreased access latency for physically indexed caches. ...|$|E
40|$|Query {{expansion}} by pseudo-relevance {{feedback is}} a well-established technique in both mono- and cross- lingual information retrieval, enriching and disambiguating the typically terse queries provided by searchers. Comparable document-side expansion {{is a relatively}} more recent development motivated by error-prone transcription and translation processes in spoken document and cross-language retrieval. In the cross-language case, one can perform expansion before translation, after translation, and at both points. We investigate the relative impact of pre- and post- translation document expansion for cross-language spoken document retrieval in Mandarin Chinese. We find that posttranslation expansion yields a highly significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness, while improvements due to <b>pretranslation</b> expansion alone or in combination do not reach significance. We identify two key factors of segmentation and translation in Chinese orthography that limit the effectiveness of pre-translation expansion in the Chinese-English case, while post-translation expansion yields its full benefit. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{inexpensive}} COTS translation package, augmented with a downloadable bilingual dictionary, {{was employed}} {{for a study}} of English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) using the query translation approach. The experimental setting involved the 170 MB Chinese collections and 54 queries of TREC and their relevance judgment, and our PIRCS bi-lingual retrieval system. With some standard retrieval techniques such as <b>pretranslation</b> query expansion and combination of retrieval lists, we were able to achieve over 70 % of monolingual results for both long and short queries. Insufficient context of short queries appears not a problem for machine translation for English-Chinese CLIR. 1 Introduction CLIR has gained importance in recent years (Oard & Dorr 1996, Grefenstette 1998, Schauble & Sheridan 1998) because accessing foreign web sites and text searching have become popular and convenient. Many language pairs need to be considered, but one can fairly say that autom [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Teachers whose {{aspiration}} is {{for their}} students to achieve Translation Competence need an understanding of its nature and of ways to help students attain it. The notion is related to that of Natural Translation, which proposes a series of developmental stages of the interpreting ability of a bilingual infant/child. The theory claims that links established between sets of items in a bilingual’s languages as the languages are acquired are exploited during a <b>pretranslation</b> stage from which Natural Translation develops. This is not incompatible with recent understanding of the Universal Grammar hypothesis and recent findings in the neurolinguistics of bilingualism. However, the model cannot account for non-native bilinguals’ abilities to translate, nor for translation abilities developed during formal instruction. These abilities might be based on innate Interlingual Proficiency and Transfer Proficiency Potentials. I list {{a number of ways}} in which Toury has agued that these potentials may be encouraged and add a suggestion or two of my own. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a casestudy {{of an experiment}} on how reflexivity and technology can enhance learning, by using ePorfolios as a training environment to develop translation skills. Translation is today a multiskilled job and translators need to assure their clients a good performance and quality, both in language and in technology domains. In order to accomplish it, for the translator all the tasks and processes he develops appear as crucial, being <b>pretranslation</b> and posttranslation processes equally important as the translation itself, namely as far as autonomy, reflexive and critical skills are concerned. Finally, the need and relevance for collaborative tasks and networks amongst virtual translation communities, led us to the decision of implementing ePortfolios {{as a tool to}} develop the requested skills and extend the use of Internet in translation, namely in terminology management phases, for the completion of each task, by helping students in the management of the projects deadlines, improving their knowledge on the construction and management of translation resources and deepening their awareness about the concepts related to the development and usability of ePorfolios...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{biofortification}} with Se {{is widely}} accepted. However, {{little is known}} about the efficiency of selenomethionine (Se-Met) incorporation into the seed and tuber protein fraction of crops. Here, we report on the efficiency of Se incorporation into the seed and tuber protein fraction of soybean, flax, and potato and the putative identity of some of the proteins that are likely targets for this random <b>pretranslation</b> modification. Soybean, flax, and potato plants received Se using different sodium selenate application methods and rates, and Se-Met was determined in seed, tuber, and their protein fractions. Selenium content in seed and tuber tissues and in protein fractions was increased by 2 to 86 times. The methionine (Met) pool was increased, as was the proportion of Se-Met in the Met pool, but the ratio of Se-Met:total Met was well conserved (1 : 1) between the treated and nontreated plants. After two-dimensional (2 D) protein electrophoresis, five protein spots were identified as glycinin, trypsin inhibitor (soybean), patatin- 3 -Kuras- 1, patain-B 2, and phosphoenol carboxy kinase (potato), none of which showed S to Se substitution in their primary structure. Linking Se and three stress markers in fresh tuber extracts, glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were increased by 20 to 35 %. The data showed low protein modification in these non-Se-accumulator crops and indicated that rates of 5 to 10 g ha- 1 Se, through foliar application, may ensure not only an adequate daily intake levels for humans but may also activate antioxidant enzyme systems within the tuber tissue.

40|$|Interferon and {{interferon}} inducers {{are well}} known to depress hepatic cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450). Previous reports have suggested that all constitutive members of the P- 450 family of proteins are affected in this manner, whereas inducible P- 450 s [...] including cytochrome P- 4503 A 1 (CYP 3 A 1) [...] are resistant {{to the effects of}} interferons. We examined the effect of interferon [produced in response to polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (polyIC; 10 mg/kg) administration] on the induction of CYP 3 A 1 in the female rat by the macrolide antibiotic troleandomycin (TAO; 200 mg/kg), and the antiglucocorticoid pregnenolone- 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN; 300 mg/kg). The induction of CYP 3 A 1 was characterized by erythromycin N-demethylation, Western blotting, and mRNA quantitation with a specific oligonucleotide cDNA probe. PCN-mediated induction of erythromycin metabolism was depressed by 85 % following polyIC administration. PolyIC depressed the induction of CYP 3 A 1 apoprotein by TAO (84 %) and PCN (73 %). The depression of enzyme activity and protein were accompanied by a corresponding decrease in hepatic CYP 3 A 1 mRNA. It is concluded that CYP 3 A 1 is sensitive to the depressant effects of interferon, and that interferon appears to act at a <b>pretranslation</b> step that is independent of the induction process per se.

40|$|INTED 2010, the 4 th International Technology, Education and Development Conference {{was held}} in Valencia (Spain), on March 8, 9 and 10, 2010. When it comes to translators training, the {{acquisition}} of indexing and terminological competences (both at retrieval and management stage) has {{a major role in}} the performance of future translators. A good terminological database, as a result of an accurate research, along with computer assisted translation tools (CAT tools) can improve translation’s speed and quality and also reduce revision costs, bringing in benefits for all the players in the translation industry: language service providers and clients. That process (analysis, selection, retrieval and storage of terminology) takes place mostly in the <b>pretranslation</b> stage, but underlies the whole translation work and can be a determining factor to the quality of the final product and to its homogeneity, especially when carried out in a collaborative environment. The development of terminological databases is an essential step in the training of translators and the efficient search for the right word a necessary skill in today's globalised translation market. Moreover being the quest for the right word almost entirely run over the Internet, data diversity can greatly increase the noise. This search poses several questions, mainly (1) how and where to retrieve information and (2) how to manage it efficiently, especially to students who are neither experts in terminology nor in translation. To ease some of these problems, students were assigned a project in terminology (a database) and, in order to accomplish it, both a Webquest and an ePortfolio were proposed as guidance tools. Along the process, students were expected to build up their thematic and communicative competence and, in parallel, widen their skills in computer-assisted translation tools as well as standard officeautomation software. This paper aims at discussing how these two tools helped students guide their research, structure the problem solving activities, develop critical thinking and terminological competencies...|$|E
40|$|Translation Environment Tools (TEnTs) {{became popular}} in the early 1990 s as a partial {{solution}} for coping with ever-increasing translation demands and {{the decreasing number of}} translators available. TEnTs allow the creation of repositories of legacy translations (translation memories) and terminology (integrated termbases) used to identify repetition in new source texts and provide alternate translations, thereby reducing the need to translate the same information twice. While awareness of the important role of terminology in translation and documentation management has been on the rise, little research is available on best practices for building and using integrated termbases. The present research is a first step toward filling this gap and provides a set of guidelines on how best to optimize the design and use of integrated termbases. Based on existing translation technology and terminology management literature, as well as our own experience, we propose that traditional terminology and terminography principles designed for stand-alone termbases should be adapted when an integrated termbase is created in order to take into account its unique characteristics: active term recognition, d one-click insertion of equivalents into the target text and document <b>pretranslation.</b> The proposed modifications to traditional principles cover a wide range of issues, including using record structures with fewer fields, adopting the TBX-Basic’s record structure, classifying records by project or client, creating records based on equivalent pairs rather concepts in cases where synonyms exist, recording non-term units and multiple forms of a unit, and using translated documents as sources. The overarching hypothesis and its associated concrete strategies were evaluated first against a survey of current practices in terminology management within TEnTs and later through a second survey that tested user acceptance of the strategies. The result is a set of guidelines that describe best practices relating to design, content selection and information recording within integrated termbases that will be used for translation purposes. These guidelines will serve as a point of reference for new users of TEnTs, as an academic resource for translation technology educators, as a map of challenges in terminology management within TEnTs that translation software developers seek to resolve and, finally, as a springboard for further research on the optimization of integrated termbases for translation...|$|E
40|$|Reordering {{has been}} an {{important}} topic in statistical machine translation (SMT) as long as SMT has been around. State-of-the-art SMT systems such as Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004 a) still employ a simplistic model of the reordering process to do non-local reordering. This model penalizes any reordering no matter the words. The reordering is only selected if it leads to a translation that looks like a much better sentence than the alternative. Recent developments have, however, seen improvements in translation quality following from syntax-based reordering. One such development is the pre-translation approach that adjusts the source sentence to resemble target language word order prior to translation. This is done based on rules that are either manually created or automatically learned from word aligned parallel corpora. We introduce a novel approach to syntactic reordering. This approach provides better exploitation of the information in the reordering rules and eliminates problematic biases of previous approaches. Although the approach is examined within a pre-translation reordering framework, it easily extends to other frameworks. Our approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system and previous approaches to <b>pretranslation</b> reordering, including (Li et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007 b; Crego & Mari˜ no, 2007). This is consistent both for a very close language pair, English-Danish, and a very distant language pair, English-Arabic. We also propose automatic reordering rule learning based on a rich set of linguistic information. As opposed to most previous approaches that extract a large set of rules, our approach produces a small set of predominantly general rules. These provide a good reflection of the main reordering issues of a given language pair. We examine the influence of several parameters that may have influence {{on the quality of the}} rules learned. Finally, we provide a new approach for improving automatic word alignment. This word alignment is used in the above task of automatically learning reordering rules. Our approach learns from hand aligned data how to combine several automatic word alignments to one superior word alignment. The automatic word alignments are created from the same data that has been preprocessed with different tokenization schemes. Thus utilizing the different strengths that different tokenization schemes exhibit in word alignment. We achieve a 38 % error reduction for the automatic word alignmen...|$|E
