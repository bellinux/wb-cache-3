It relies on absorption properties of labels (gold nanoparticles, semiconductor nanocrystals, etc.), and can be realized on a conventional microscope using a resonant modulated heating beam, non-resonant probe beam and lock-in detection of <b>photothermal</b> signals from a single nanoparticle. It is the extension of the macroscopic <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopy to the nanoscopic domain. The high sensitivity and selectivity of <b>photothermal</b> microscopy allows even the detection of single molecules by their absorption. Similar to Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), the <b>photothermal</b> signal may be recorded with respect to time to study the diffusion and advection characteristics of absorbing nanoparticles in a solution. This technique is called <b>photothermal</b> correlation spectroscopy (PhoCS).|$|E

50|$|<b>Photothermal</b> {{spectroscopy}} is a {{group of}} high sensitivity spectroscopy techniques used to measure optical absorption and thermal characteristics of a sample. The basis of <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopy is the change in thermal state of the sample resulting from the absorption of radiation. Light absorbed and not lost by emission results in heating. The heat raises temperature thereby influencing the thermodynamic properties of the sample or of a suitable material adjacent to it. Measurement of the temperature, pressure, or density changes that occur due to optical absorption are ultimately the basis for the <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopic measurements.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} methods and {{techniques}} used in <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopy. Each of these {{has a name}} indicating the specific physical effect measured.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>photothermal</b> {{mechanism}} manifests itself, {{besides the}} photoacoustic effect, also by other physical changes, notably emission of infra-red radiation {{and changes in}} the refraction index. Correspondingly, it may be detected by various other means, described by terms such as [...] "photothermal radiometry", [...] "thermal lens" [...] and [...] "thermal beam deflection" [...] (popularly also known as [...] "mirage" [...] effect) (see <b>Photothermal</b> spectroscopy.

5000|$|While the <b>photothermal</b> {{mechanism}} is universal, there could exist additional other mechanisms, superimposed on the <b>photothermal</b> mechanism, which may {{contribute significantly to}} the photoacoustic signal.

50|$|As with photoacoustic {{spectroscopy}}, <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopy is {{an indirect}} method for measuring optical absorption, {{because it is}} not based on the direct measure of the light which is involved in the absorption. In another sense, however, <b>photothermal</b> (and photoacoustic) methods measure directly the absorption, rather than e.g. calculate it from the transmission, as is the case of more usual (transmission) spectroscopic techniques. And it is this fact that gives the technique its high sensitivity, because in transmission techniques the absorptance is calculated as the difference between total light impinging on the sample and the transmitted (plus reflected, plus scattered) light, with the usual problems of accuracy when one deals with small differences between large numbers, if the absorption is small. In <b>photothermal</b> spectroscopies, instead, the signal is essentially proportional to the absorption, and is zero when there is zero true absorption, even in the presence of reflection or scattering.|$|E

50|$|<b>Photothermal</b> {{microspectroscopy}} (PTMS), alternatively {{known as}} <b>photothermal</b> temperature fluctuation (PTTF), {{is derived from}} two parent instrumental techniques: infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In one particular type of AFM, known as scanning thermal microscopy (SThM), the imaging probe is a sub-miniature temperature sensor, which may be a thermocouple or a resistance thermometer. This same type of detector is employed in a PTMS instrument, enabling it to provide AFM/SThM images: However, the chief additional use of PTMS is to yield infrared spectra from sample regions below a micrometer, as outlined below.|$|E
5000|$|In this {{detection}} scheme {{a conventional}} scanning sample or laser-scanning transmission microscope is employed. Both, the heating and the probing laser beam are coaxially aligned and superimposed using a dichroic mirror. Both beams are focused onto a sample, typically via a high-NA illumination microscope objective, and recollected using a detection microscope objective. The thereby collimated transmitted beam is then imaged onto a photodiode after filtering out the heating beam. The <b>photothermal</b> signal is then the change [...] in the transmitted probe beam power [...] {{due to the}} heating laser. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio a lock-in technique may be used. To this end, the heating laser beam is modulated at a high frequency {{of the order of}} MHz and the detected probe beam power is then demodulated on the same frequency. For quantitative measurements, the <b>photothermal</b> signal may be normalized to the background detected power [...] (which is typically much larger than the change [...] ), thereby defining the relative <b>photothermal</b> signal ...|$|E

50|$|Gold {{nanorods}} {{are being}} investigated as <b>photothermal</b> agents for in-vivo applications. Gold nanorods are rod-shaped gold nanoparticles whose aspect ratios tune the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band from the visible to near-infrared wavelength. The total extinction of {{light at the}} SPR {{is made up of}} both absorption and scattering. For the smaller axial diameter nanorods (~10 nm), absorption dominates, whereas for the larger axial diameter nanorods (>35 nm) scattering can dominate. As a consequence, for in-vivo applications, small diameter gold nanorods are being used as <b>photothermal</b> converters of near-infrared light due to their high absorption cross-sections. Since near-infrared light transmits readily through human skin and tissue, these nanorods can be used as ablation components for cancer, and other targets. When coated with polymers, gold nanorods have been observed to circulate in-vivo with half-lives longer than 6 hours, bodily residence times around 72 hours, and little to no uptake in any internal organs except the liver.Apart from rod-like gold nanoparticles, also spherical colloidal gold nanoparticles are recently used as markers in combination with <b>photothermal</b> single particle microscopy.|$|E
