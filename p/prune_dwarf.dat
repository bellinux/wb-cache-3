50|$|When a host tree is {{infected}} by plum pox, the infection eventually results in severely reduced fruit production, and the fruit that is produced is often misshapen and blemished. The presence of plum pox can also enhance {{the effects of}} other endemic viruses infecting various species of the genus Prunus, such as <b>prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus, Prunus necrotic (browning) ringspot virus, and apple chlorotic (yellowing) leaf spot virus, resulting in still greater economic losses.In peach, infected trees may exhibit color-breaking symptoms in the blossoms. This appears as darker pink stripes on the flower petals and can be useful for early season surveys. Symptoms can be present in young leaves {{in the spring and}} /or on developing fruit.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mechanistic}} model of carbon partitioning, {{based on the}} Münch hypothesis of phloem transport and implemented with PIAF-Münch modelling platform (Lacointe and Minchin 2008), was tested for an architecture more complex than any tested previously.

The observed treatment responses were successfully predicted. However, the observations could not be completely explained if the modelled stem contained only one phloem pathway: tracer from a labelled leaf was always detected in both shoot apex and root, whichever of the two leaves was labelled. This shows that bidirectional flow occurred within the stem, with solute moving simultaneously in both directions.

40|$|The {{presence}} of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) and Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) was monitored throughout 2005 in stone fruit trees by ELISA and tissue printing hybridization. The highest detection rate {{for all three}} viruses was ob-tained in winter with both techniques. Detection was re-liable also in spring and early summer, except for Ap-MV. However, neither technique was able to identify successfully all infected samples in one season. Overall, ELISA was more successful for PNRSV and PDV de-tection and tissue-printing hybridization for ApMV. Key words: PNRSV, PDV, ApMV, diagnosis, ELISA, tissue-printing hybridization. Among the different viruses affecting stone fruit trees, Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) and Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), all mem-bers of the genus Ilarvirus, family Bromoviridae (Roos-inck et al., 2005) have a worldwide distribution and are the most significant economically.

Crop losses vary from none in Italian prune, to 15 % in sweet cherry, up to 100 % in peach in certain years (Barbara, 1988). The virus is also a serious threat to the nursery industry, causing poor graft take and reduced growth of grafted trees.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{reliability}} and sensitivity of {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) in the detection of ilarvirus (isometric labile ringspot virus) subgroup B and <b>prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) isolates in Prunus and Malus species has been well established. To use this technique in large scale virus indexing programs more information was required on the reactions of commercially available antisera against {{the wide range of}} naturally occurring ilarvirus isolates. Specifically, information was required to determine whether an antiserum, or a group of antisera, exists that will detect the entire spectrum of ilarvirus subgroup B and PDV isolates (here-after referred to as ILAR-b type isolates) in ELISA tests. In this thesis 44 isolates of ILAR-b have been tested by ELISA using eleven antisera prepared against isolates of this group. The virus isolates used were collected by previous workers in 12 states and four countries from a multitude of hosts, and cover a wide range of the isolates originally referred to by R. W. Fulton (1968) as ILAR viruses. Six of the antisera used were commercially available. Only three of the 44 isolates reported to be the ILAR-b type were not detected by any of the eleven antisera used. Those isolates detected by ELISA fell into three of the serogroups originally described by Fulton for this type of virus, namely a necrotic ringspot virus (NRSV) serogroup, an apple mosaic virus (ApMV) serogroup, and a <b>prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) serogroup. Other serogroups described for ilarviruses were not used in this research. In these ELISA tests, the ability to detect a virus isolate in one serogroup using antisera of another serogroup was quite poor, whereas within-group detection was fairly uniform for all isolate-antiserum combinations. A mixture of the best antisera of each serogroup was able to detect all isolates previously detected individually by the three separate antisera. Bioassays employing Chenopodium quinoa and Cucumis sativus, detected ILAR-b isolates in young spring tissue of Malus and Prunus sp. with reliability about equal to ELISA. ELISA, however, was far more efficient (space, material, and time-wise) and proved more sensitive {{over an extended period of}} the growing season.

To improve the detection of PDV and PPV by PCR technology, we investigated the possibility of de-tection of these viruses in standard and multiplex RT-PCR-ELISA assays. Total RNA was extracted from cherry, peach, or plum leaves and cherry pollen of PDV-infected or uninfected trees. Total RNA was also extracted from PPV-infected or uninfected leaves. Sam-ples were extracted using commercially available RNA extraction kits. A RT-PCR-ELISA assay was developed for the detection of PDV in a single reaction or with PPV in a multiplex reaction. The use of a PDV-specific capture probe or a PPV-specific capture probe allowed the detection of each virus in a single RT-PCR-ELISA assay. Simultaneous use of the PDV-specific and PPV-specific capture probes permitted the sensitive detec-tion of both viruses in a multiplex RT-PCR-ELISA as-say.

To investigate this evolutionary process in <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), 31 accessions retrieved from international databases, supplemented by one Tunisian isolate described here, were analyzed. Two recombination detection programs were used: RDP v 3. 31 β and RECCO. While the first program did not detect any significant recombination events, RECCO detected several breakpoints in partial sequences of the coat protein gene (CP) of fifteen isolates. The Tajima neutrality test implemented in the MEGA 4. 1 β program indicated that there were numerous deletion/insertion events in the sequences. The strongest signal was found in Portuguese isolate 3. 12 N. 14 (accession number AY 646846) which had position nt 296 – 523 in the CP gene. The evolutionary historical relationships between all analyzed isolates were determined by constructing a dendrogram using Neighbor joining (NJ), Minimum evolution (ME), Maximum parsimony (MP), Maximum likelihood (ML), and the Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA); all gave similar results.

40|$|<b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) {{is one of}} {{the members}} of Bromoviridae family, genus Ilarvirus. Host {{components}} that participate in the regulation of viral replication or cell-to-cell movement via plasmodesmata are still unknown. In contrast, viral infections caused by some other Bromoviridae members are well characterized. Bromoviridae can be distinguished based on localization of their replication process in infected cells, cell-to-cell movement mechanisms, and plant-specific response reactions. Depending upon the genus, “genome activation” and viral replication are linked to various membranous structures ranging from endoplasmic reticulum, to tonoplast. In the case of PDV, there is still no evidence of natural resistance sources in the host plants susceptible to virus infection. Apparently, PDV has a great ability to overcome the natural defense responses in a wide spectrum of plant hosts. The first manifestations of PDV infection are specific cell membrane alterations, and the formation of replicase complexes that support PDV RNA replication inside the spherules. During each stage of its life cycle, the virus uses cell components to replicate and to spread in whole plants, within the largely suppressed cellular immunity environment.

In spite of the heterogeneity found in almond, the amino acid composition of the domain at the N terminus of the coat protein maintained the potential to form an amphipathic helix, and hence the capacity to serve the previously suggested function of binding the viral RNA during particle formation. Except for synonymous substitutions, measures of nucleotide diversity calculated for the two groups, respectively 13 sequences from almond and 14 sequences from other hosts, were found to be significantly different, with the almond group showing a much higher variability. Analysis of the dendrogram constructed based in all 27 PDV CP sequences did not reveal host specificity, in agreement with previous findings.

40|$|Sweet {{cherry trees}} (Prunus avium L.) are {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} diseases, but there have been no studies to date about the viral infection of sweet cherry trees in Spain. To determine the phytosanitary status of Spanish sweet cherry plantations, the incidence and leaf symptoms induced by <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> (PDV), Prunus necrotic ringspot (PNRSV) and Apple chlorotic leaf spot (ACLSV) viruses were investigated during 2009. Young leaf samples were taken from 350 sweet cherry trees, corresponding to 17 cultivars, and were analysed by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). To associate the leaf symptoms with the virus, 50 mature leaves from each infected tree were visually inspected during the summer. The ELISA results revealed that 72 % of sweet cherry trees were infected by {{at least one of the}} viruses. PDV occurred in all sampled cultivars and presented the highest infection rate, followed by ACLSV and PNRSV. A high number of trees showed asymptomatic, in both single and mixed infections. The leaf symptoms associated with the viruses involved generalized chlorosis around the midvein (PDV), chlorotic and dark brown necrotic ringspots on both secondary veins and intervein regions (PNRSV), chlorotic and reddish necrotic ringspots (ACLSV) and generalized interveinal chlorosis (PDV-PNRSV) ...|$|E
40|$|One hundred twenty-five trees (each of a {{different}} cultivar) of sour and sweet cherry from two large vari-etal collections in Serbia were visually inspected for virus symptoms and tested {{for the presence of}} cherry viruses by ELISA, herbaceous host assays, graft-index-ing on P. serrulata cv. Kwanzan, and RT-PCR. All sam-ples were tested by ELISA for Prunus necrotic ring spot virus (PNRSV), <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), Apple chlorot-ic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), and Plum pox virus (PPV). The overall detection of PDV, PNRSV, and ACLSV was 63 %. Additional ELISA tests were done on 80 trees for Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV), Strawberry latent ring spot virus (SLRSV), Petunia asteroid mosaic virus (PetAMV), Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV), Tomato black ring virus (TBRV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV). In these tests, one tree tested positive for PetAMV. RT-PCR test-ing of 44 trees detected another five viruses: Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV), Cherry necrotic rusty mottle virus (CNRMV), Cherry virus A (CVA), Euro-pean rusty mottle associated virus (ERMaV) and Plum bark necrosis and stem pitting-associated virus (PB-NSPaV), but not Cherry mottle leaf virus (CMLV). In graft-indexing tests on Kwanzan with all 125 trees, sam-ples from 38 trees induced symptoms of necrotic crook disease (causal agent unknown). Viruses reported fo...|$|E
40|$|Sweet cherry is an {{important}} fruit crop with increasing economical value in Turkey and the world. A number of viruses cause diseases and economical losses in sweet cherry. <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), {{is one of the}} most common viruses of stone fruits including sweet cherry in the world. In this study, PDV was detected from 316 of 521 sweet cherry samples collected from 142 orchards in 10 districts of Isparta province of Turkey by double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). The presence of PDV in ELISA positive samples was confirmed in 37 isolates by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. A genomic region of 862 bp containing the coat protein (CP) gene of PDV was re-amplified from 21 selected isolates by RT-PCR. Amplified DNA fragments of these isolates were purified and sequenced for molecular characterization and determining genetic diversity of PDV. Sequence comparisons showed 84 – 99 % to 81 – 100 % sequence identity at nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively, of the CP genes of PDV isolates from Isparta and other parts of the world. Phylogenetic analyses of the CP genes of PDV isolates from different geographical origins and diverse hosts revealed that PDV isolates formed different phylogenetic groups. While isolates were not grouped solely based on their geographical origins or hosts, some association between phylogenetic groups and geographical origins or hosts were observed...|$|E
40|$|The RNA 3 of prunus {{necrotic}} ringspot ilarvirus (PNRSV) {{has been}} cloned and its entire sequence determined. The RNA 3 consists of 1943 nucleotides (nt) and possesses two large open reading frames (ORFs) separated by an intergenic region of 74 nt. The 5 ' proximal ORF is 855 nt {{in length and}} codes for a protein of molecular mass 31. 4 kDa which has homologies with the putative movement protein of {{other members of the}} Bromoviridae. The 3 ' proximal ORF of 675 nt is the cistron for the coat protein (CP) and has a predicted molecular mass of 24. 9 kDa. The sequence of the 3 ' non-coding region (NCR) of PNRSV RNA 3 showed a high degree of similarity with those of tobacco streak virus (TSV), <b>prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), apple mosaic virus (ApMV) and also alfalfa mosaic virus (A 1 MV). In addition it contained potential stem-loop structures with interspersed AUGC motifs characteristic for ilar-and alfamoviruses. This conserved primary and sec-ondary structure in all 3 ' NCRs may be responsible for the interaction with homologous and heterologous CPs and subsequent activation of genome replication. The CP gene of an ApMV isolate (ApMV-G) of 657 nt has also been cloned and sequenced. Although ApMV and PNRSV have a distant serological relationship, the deduced amino acid sequences of their CPs have an identity of only 51 " 8 %. The N termini of PNRSV and ApMV CPs have in common a zinc-finger motif and the potential to form an amphipathic helix...|$|E

Transgenic clone C 5, subsequently named “HoneySweet”, showed high resistance to PPV. None of the C 5 trees became naturally infected by aphids {{for more than}} ten years. Known to develop the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism, we assessed the effect of heterologous viruses on the efficacy and stability of PTGS displayed by the C 5 plum against PPV. In this way, C 5 trees were graftinoculated with different combinations of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV), <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV) and PPV-D strain. The engineered resistance to PPV in C 5 transgenic plums was stable and was not suppressed by the presence of the assayed heterologous viruses over a threeyear experimental period. Because the constitutive transcription of PPV-CP sequences naturally occurs in transgenic C 5 plums, the environmental safety issues have been expressed on potential hazards concerning the emergence of PPV variants. In order to analyze this potential environmental effect was compared the serological and molecular variability of PPV detected in the transgenic trees versus those found in conventional plums. This risk assessment revealed a high similarity between PPV isolates from transgenic and conventional plums, and hence the transgenic plums utilized in this study do not affect the diversity of indigenous PPV populations...|$|E
40|$|Field {{surveys were}} carried out to assess the {{sanitary}} status of stone fruits in Egypt. A total of 716 samples was tested by ELISA for Prunus necrotic ring spot virus (PNRSV), Plum pox virus (PPV), <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) and Ap-ple mosaic virus (ApMV). The viruses most frequently detected were PNRSV (57 %) and PPV (41 %); PDV and ACLSV were found in 3 % of samples and ApMV was not detected. Plum bark necrosis stem pitting-asso-ciated virus (PBNSPaV) and Apricot latent virus (ApLV) were detected {{for the first time}} in Egypt by using RT-PCR. Of 693 samples tested by tissue-imprint hybridiza-tion (TIH), 101 (15 %) were found to be infected by ei-ther Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) or Hop stunt viroid (HSVd). Key words: Prunus, ELISA, RT-PCR, tissue-imprint hybridization, sanitary status. Stone fruit trees are a major fruit industry in the Mediterranean area. The stone fruit cultivated area in Egypt is 49. 209 ha with an approximate yearly produc-tion of 476849 tons (6 % of total fruit production). Apricot, peach and Japanese plum are the most impor-tant stone fruit crops. The total stone fruit area is made up of the old lands (16 % with production of 86. 933 tons/year) and the new reclaimed lands (84 % with pro-duction of 389. 916 tons/year) (Anonymous, 2005). The production areas are concentrated in north and north-eastern parts of the country. Prior to this study, several viruses had been detected in stone fruit trees in Egypt: Plum pox virus (PPV) in apricot, peach, and plum (Dunez, 1988; Wetzel et al. ...|$|E

Sci., 48 (Special Issue) : S 43 -S 48. Commercialisation of Biotech/GM (Biotech) crops started in 1995. Not only field crops, but also horticultural transgenic crops are under development and {{are beginning to}} be commercialised. Genetic engineering {{has the potential to}} revolutionise fruit tree breeding. The development of transgenic fruit cultivars is in progress. Over the past 20 years an international public sector research team has collaborated in the development of HoneySweet plum which is highly resistant to Plum pox virus (PPV) the most devastating disease of plums and other stone fruits. HoneySweet was deregulated in the USA in 2010. HoneySweet (aka C 5) has been evaluated for eleven years (2002 - 2012) in a regulated field trial in the Czech Republic for the resistance to PPV, <b>Prune</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (PDV), and Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), all of them being serious diseases of plum. Even under the high and permanent infection pressure produced through grafting, PPV has only been detected in HoneySweet trees in several leaves and fruits situated close to the point of inoculum grafting. The lack of infection spread in HoneySweet demonstrates its high level of PPV resistance. Co-infections of PPV with PDV and/or ACLSV had practically no influence on {{the quantity and quality of}} HoneySweet fruit which are large, sweet, and of a high eating quality. In many respects, they are superior to the fruits of the well-known cultivar Stanley. Many fruit growers and fruit tree nurseries in the Czech Republic are supportive of the deregulation of HoneySweet plum to help improve the plum production and control the spread of PPV...|$|E
