5000|$|CSR's Brisbane {{refinery}} was {{the fourth}} in a chain of refineries established by the company in Australia's capital cities in the late 19th century; refineries were opened in Sydney (Pyrmont 1878 which became the largest in Australia), Melbourne (Yarraville; purchased [...] ), and Adelaide (Glanville 1891). A refinery in Perth was added in 1930 to complete the chain. According to company records {{the establishment of the}} Brisbane refinery was closely linked to the imposition of <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duties</b> on sugar products (in particular recent increases in taxes on syrup and molasses) which would have substantially compromised CSR's share in the golden syrup market in Queensland. The establishment of a local refinery had the added benefit of enabling the company to compete in the refined sugar markets (which were also protected by colonial taxes) in Australia's fourth most populous city.|$|R

25|$|The {{expansive}} {{growth of}} the Hunter Valley {{in the mid to}} late 19th century came directly from its monopoly position of the lucrative Sydney market. The provincial government of New South Wales had enacted regulations that placed <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duties</b> on wines from other areas such as Victoria and South Australia. This had the effect of limiting any competition for Hunter Valley winemakers in Sydney. But the turn of the 20th century brought a shifting dynamic to the Hunter Valley wine industry as the provinces on the Australian continent became federated into states and a new constitution was drafted that banned such interstate trade barriers. The opening of the Sydney market to the flux of out of state wine, as well as the changing public tastes from dry wines to sweet, fortified ports, muscats and sherry signalled a period of steep decline for the Hunter Valley.|$|R
2500|$|The gin {{crisis was}} severe. From 1689 onward the English {{government}} encouraged the industry of distilling, as it helped prop up grain prices {{which were then}} low, and increase trade, particularly with England's colonial possessions. Imports of French wine and spirits were banned to encourage the industry at home. Indeed, Daniel Defoe and Charles Davenant, among others, particularly Whig economists, had seen distilling {{as one of the}} pillars of British prosperity in the balance of trade. (Both later changed their minds—by 1703 Davenant was warning that, [...] "Tis a growing fad among the common people and may in time prevail as much as opium with the Turks," [...] while by 1727 Defoe was arguing in support of anti-gin legislation.) In the heyday of the industry there was no quality control whatsoever (gin was frequently mixed with turpentine), and licences for distilling required only the application. When it became apparent that copious gin consumption was causing social problems, efforts were made to control the production of the spirit. The Gin Act 1736 imposed high taxes on sales of gin, forbade the sale of the spirit in quantities of less than two gallons and required an annual payment of £50 for a retail licence. This had little effect beyond increasing smuggling and driving the distilling trade underground. Various loopholes were exploited to avoid the taxes, including selling gin under pseudonyms such as Ladies' Delight, Bob, Cuckold's Delight, and the none-too-subtle Parliament gin. The <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duty</b> was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1743. Francis Place later wrote that enjoyments for the poor of this time were limited: they had often had only two: [...] "...sexual intercourse and drinking," [...] and that [...] "...drunkenness {{is by far the most}} desired..." [...] as it was cheaper and its effects more enduring. By 1750 over a quarter of all residences in St Giles parish in London were gin shops, and most of these also operated as receivers of stolen goods and co-ordinating spots for prostitution.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{not going}} to discuss the Fiscal Question (said Reginald); I wish to be original. At the same time, I think one suffers more than one realises from the system of free imports. I should like, for instance, a really <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duty</b> put upon the partner who {{declares}} on a weak red suit and hopes for the best. Even a free outlet for compressed verbiage doesn't balance matters. And I {{think there should be}} a sort of bounty- fed export (is that the right expression?) of the people who impress on you that you ought to take life seriously. There are only two classes that really can't help taking life seriously--schoolgirls of thirteen and Hohenzollerns; they might be exempt. Albanians come under another heading; they take life whenever they get the opportunity. The one Albanian that I was ever on speaking terms with was rather a decadent example. He was a Christian and a grocer, and I don't fancy he had ever killed anybody. I didn't like to question him on the subject--that showed my delicacy. Mrs. Nicorax says I have no delicacy; she hasn't forgiven me about the mice. You see, when I was staying down there, a mouse used to cake-walk about my room half the night, and none of their silly patent traps seemed to take its fancy as a bijou residence, so I determined to appeal to the better side of it--which with mice is the inside. So I called it Percy, and put little delicacies down near its hole every night, and that kept it quiet while I read Max Nordau's Degeneration and other reproving literature, and went to sleep. And now she says there is a whole colony of mice in that room.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide a}} {{preliminary}} assessment of the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) in order to highlight the directions that might take the next stage of reform. A particular focus is made on the Quads countries. Our findings are that, in spite of the URAA arrangements, tariffs on agricultural products are still three times higher on average than on manufactured products. The tariffication process has often led to <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duties</b> and to an increase in tariff dispersion. Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) have not always been filled and market access has shown only limited improvement. Export subsidies still exist and domestic farm policies have often experienced only minor changes to match the Agreement requirements. These points, which have been identified as live issues for the next Round of Negotiations, are then debated {{in the rest of the}} document. We discuss in particular the modalities of ameliorating market access, with the definition of a more effective tariff cut and the improvement of TRQs' administration and efficiency. As far as exports are concerned, we tackle the issue of effectiveness of a new reduction of export subsidies, the status of export credit and of export restrictions. The more general question of state involvement in agricultural trade is also discussed. Finally, we pose the question of a deepening of the reduction of support to agriculture, with an elimination of the "blue box" and a new definition of the "green box" content. support to agriculture., export subsidies, market access, agriculture, trade negotiations, WTO...|$|R
5000|$|To {{serve the}} growing Australian cities, CSR erected {{a chain of}} {{refineries}} around Australia's capital cities by the late 19th century, with Melbourne (Yarraville; purchased [...] ), Sydney (Pyrmont 1878 which became the largest in Australia), Adelaide (Glanville 1891), and Brisbane. The Perth refinery was added in 1930. These dispersed plants were necessary because the refined product would otherwise be contaminated by sea voyages if distributed from the growing areas. CSR's monopoly was defended through the imposition of <b>prohibitive</b> intercolonial import <b>duties</b> on sugar products (in particular increases in taxes on syrup and molasses {{in the late nineteenth}} century) which would otherwise have had substantially compromised CSR's share in the golden syrup market in Queensland.

40|$|The {{presence}} in Australia of English and American magazines has not attracted significant critical attention in histories of magazines or writing. But the defence of imported magazines at a 1930 Tariff Board Inquiry stresses their importance to Australian magazine culture during the 1920 s. This paper considers the evidence {{presented to the}} Inquiry {{in conjunction with the}} magazine holdings of several libraries and a small news-agency. In the commercial and cultural operations of retailers and lenders a new idea of Australian magazine culture emerges; one that does not reject imported culture, but embraces it as a significant element of its very existence. This article has been peer-reviewed. In March and April 1930 the Australian Tariff Board held an ‘Inquiry into a Proposal of Duty on Books, Magazines and Fashion Plates’. Of particular interest to the Inquiry was the cultural and commercial significance of English and American magazines in the Australian market. To some, the presence of foreign magazines was seen as a threat to local industry. But the <b>prohibitive</b> <b>duty</b> under consideration at the Inquiry was opposed by newsagents, librarians and import companies, all stakeholders in a wider magazine industry that relied on foreign publications {{to meet the needs of}} the readers they served.
