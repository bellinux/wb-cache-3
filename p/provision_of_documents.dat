40|$|The External Thermal Insulation Composite System (ETICS) has a {{long-term}} problem without a cause {{that has yet}} been determined – colonisation of the surface by microorganisms. The technical performance and estimated service life of the ETICS system can be ensured through the documentation about its use, maintenance and repairs. The regional legislation {{does not require the}} <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> about the use of buildings or building parts. The research was therefore focused on suggesting a conceptual manual {{for the use of the}} ETICS system and its implementation in practice. The suggested monitoring and management of decontamination technology for the ETICS system allows for an external wall’s resistance to microorganisms. The generalised results will be the basis for the creation of a user manual for buildings according to regional standards and legislation. The article relies on research on the destruction of microorganisms on external walls with an ETICS system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the opportunities for}} greater participation of Brazilian police officers in United Nations peace operations, offering recommendations for facilitating such contributions and maximizing their impact {{with a view to}} Brazil's international profile. Following a presentation of the general evolution of peace operations with an emphasis on the rule of law component, the text introduces the tasks, doctrine and challenges of past police participation in these operations, using concrete examples, and discusses the national institutional arrangements that govern police components, including recruitment and training. The text's third section maps Brazilian internal processes, essentially in three phases: before, during and after deployment. The analysis begins with the selection process and training. Still before deployment, there is discussion of the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and health services to those deployed. Deployment itself is treated in some detail, with emphasis on officers' communication with Brazil and on legal and financial questions. The fourth and final section offers concrete policy recommendations for the continued utility of these contributions as an opportunity to strengthen Brazil's profile in an important international activity. The policy inputs are divided between the international, (Brazilian) federal and state levels...|$|E

40|$|Background Survivorship {{care plans}} (SCPs), {{including}} a treatment summary and follow-up plan, intend to promote coordination of posttreatment cancer care; yet, {{little is known}} about the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> these <b>documents</b> by oncologists to primary care physicians (PCPs). This study compared self-reported oncologist provision and PCP receipt of treatment summaries and follow-up plans, characterized oncologists who reported consistent <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> these <b>documents</b> to PCPs, and examined associations between PCP receipt <b>of</b> these <b>documents</b> and survivorship care. Methods A nationally representative sample of medical oncologists (n = 1130) and PCPs (n = 1020) were surveyed regarding follow-up care for breast and colon cancer survivors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Multivariable regression models identified factors associated with oncologist <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> treatment summaries and SCPs to PCPs (always/almost always vs less frequent). Results Nearly half of oncologists reported always/almost always providing treatment summaries, whereas 20. 2 % reported always/almost always providing SCPs (treatment summary + follow-up plan). Approximately one-third of PCPs indicated always/almost always receiving treatment summaries; 13. 4 % reported always/almost always receiving SCPs. Oncologists who reported training in late- and long-term effects of cancer and use of electronic medical records were more likely to report SCP provision (P <. 05). PCP receipt of SCPs was associated with better PCP-reported care coordination, physician–physician communication, and confidence in survivorship care knowledge compared to receipt of neither treatment summaries nor SCPs (P <. 05). Conclusions Providing SCPs to PCPs may enhance survivorship care coordination, physician–physician communication, and PCP confidence. However, considerable progress will be necessary to achieve implementation of sharing SCPs among oncologists and PCPs...|$|R
