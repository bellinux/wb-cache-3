Project Engineering Office for Ammunition (PEO Ammo) have worked with the U. S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Energetics and Warheads Division (EWD) to develop a highly reproducible and well characterized standardized 81 mm shaped charge jet initiation test configuration. This 81 mm shaped charge and jet attack configuration is used to determine whether an acceptable explosion or lower level response is observed. The test is completed as per STANAG 4526. The 81 mm shaped charge is comprised of a high precision forged and machined liner made from C 101 Oxygen Free Copper (OFE, UNS C 10100) and a bare billet LX- 14 <b>pressed</b> <b>billet</b> configuration that is machined to final dimensions. This warhead choice overcomes the issue of testing variability observed if actual production RPGs are used for Insensitive Munitions (IM) threat testing. The test configuration includes an aluminum buffer plate {{that is used to}} condition the jet for desired jet characteristics, as well as a representation for RPG probe position. Modeling and simulation was used to develop the shaped charge and test configuration. The resulting configuration has been experimentally characterized using flash radiography for short and long stand-off in order to provide quantified jet characterization including velocity profiles, accumulated length, accumulated mass, jet diameter and v 2 d profiles.

40|$|A {{program was}} {{conducted}} to develop nickel-base superalloy disk material using prealloyed powder metallurgy techniques. The program included fabrication of test specimens and subscale turbine disks from four different prealloyed powders (NASA-TRW-VIA, AF 2 - 1 DA, Mar-M- 432 and MERL 80). Based on evaluation of these specimens and disks, two alloys (AF 2 - 1 DA and Mar-M- 432) were selected for scale-up evaluation. Using fabricating experience gained in the subscale turbine disk effort, test specimens and full scale turbine disks were formed from the selected alloys. These specimens and disks were then subjected to a rigorous test program to evaluate their physical properties and determine their suitability for use in advanced performance turbine engines. A major objective {{of the program was}} to develop processes which would yield alloy properties that would be repeatable in producing jet engine disks from the same powder metallurgy alloys. The feasibility of manufacturing full scale gas turbine engine disks by thermomechanical processing of pre-alloyed metal powders was demonstrated. AF 2 - 1 DA was shown to possess tensile and creep-rupture properties in excess of those of Astroloy, one of the highest temperature capability disk alloys now in production.

40|$|Two gamma-TiAl alloy {{groups were}} {{the subject of}} this investigation. From the first group, Ti- 40 Al- 5 Mn and Ti- 40 Al- 10 Mn alloy ingots, {{produced}} by cold-hearth plasma arc melting were characterised using light and electron microscopy and XRD. Their dendritic microstructures comprised of alpha 2 /gamma lamellar areas and single-phase gamma, beta and Laves (Mn 2 Ti) grains or precipitates. The lamellar alpha 2 /gamma Volume fraction was less in the Ti- 40 Al- 10 Mn alloy, due to the influence of its higher Mn content. The alloys were heat treated at 1200 °C for 4 hours, resulting in nearly lamellar and duplex microstructures in the Ti- 40 Al- 5 Mn and Ti- 40 Al- 10 Mn alloys, respectively, hi both cases, the lamellar colonies contained poorly formed, discontinuous alpha 2 lamellae. Raising the heat treatment temperature to 1300 °C provided both alloys with fully lamellar microstructures with well formed, linear and continuous alpha 2 lamellae. From the second alloy group, the Ti- 47 Al- 4 (Nb, Mn, Cr, Si, B) alloy known as gamma-TAB, was produced as hot isostatically <b>pressed</b> <b>billets.</b> Its microstructure comprised of some "feathery" lamellar colonies and single phase gamma-matrix. Unique phases based on Ti-B and Ti-Si were identified as being TiB and Ti 5 Si 3, respectively. The boride stringers were profusely spread in the microstructure, whereas the Ti 5 Si 3 was very elusive and found only once in TEM analysis. Heat treatment at 1400 °C for 6 hours resulted in a fully lamellar Ti- 47 Al- 4 (Nb, Mn, Cr, Si, B) alloy with wide interlamellar spacing and greater gamma lamellae volume fraction; however the lamellar morphology was generally linear and continuous. In order to assess microstructural and lamellar morphological stability of the fully lamellar alloys, isothermal ageing at 800 °C for durations of 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 hours was conducted. Major microstructural changes took place in the Ti-Al-Mn alloys, whereby Ostwald ripening of alpha 2 agglomerates and beta grains in the early stages, gave way to Laves phase lamellae and grains in the latter stages of ageing. This was more extensive in the Ti- 40 Al- 10 Mn alloy due to phase equilibrium requirements, whereby more of the alpha 2 /gamma lamellar content was eliminated. However, the specific resilience of alpha 2 lamellae was inferior in the Ti- 40 Al- 5 Mn, as greater serration, fragmentation and termination migration within lamellar regions was witnessed. Termination migration within lamellar regions was considered as being independent to termination migration of the colony boundaries, which was distinguished as recession or contraction of the lamellar region, with an equivalent extension of the gamma-matrix. Boundary splitting was not precisely seen, but must have been the precursor to termination migration. In the Ti- 47 Al- 4 (Nb, Mn, Cr, Si, B) alloy, no Ostwald ripening of alpha 2 agglomerates or formation of beta or Laves phases was observed. The gamma-matrix did progressively extend to eliminate alpha 2 /gamma lamellar grains to some degree, and gamma lamellae coarsened profoundly. Fragmentation and termination migration of alpha 2 lamellae was more prominent after 1500 hours ageing. Mean interlamellar spacing (lambda) and coarsening ratio (r) increased the most in the Ti- 40 Al- 5 Mn alloy, due to the extent of alpha 2 lamellar fragmentation and termination migration, followed by the Ti- 47 Al- 4 (Nb, Mn, Cr, Si, B) and Ti- 40 A 1 - 10 Mn alloys, respectively. Modes of morphological evolution that had not taken place during thermal ageing in all alloys studied, were direct cylinderisation, edge spheroidisation and discontinuous coarsening. Overall, the Ti- 47 Al- 4 (Nb, Mn, Cr, Si, B) alloy provided the best model for development of gamma-TiAl alloys with enhanced morphological stability, if issues such as the low alpha 2 phase volume fraction and coarse gamma lamellae could be resolved. The role of silicon in gamma-TiAl alloys also needs to be examined, and whether it has any bearing on lamellar morphological stability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the creation of}} a model to predict the manufacturing cost of parts made by the extrusion process. Feature Based Costing (FBC) techniques have been used to develop the cost model, which is intended to be used early in the design phase of a part, when the geometry and the material are being defined in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software by the designer. The cost model was developed specifically for hot extruded parts made of aluminum alloys, extruded in the forward direction using single-hole dies, as this was found to be the case for the majority of extrusion work in the industry. As the cost model is developed, the main Geometric Cost Drivers (GCDs) and Non-Geometric Cost Drivers (NGCDs) of a part made by the hot extrusion process are identified. The main outputs of the model include the Piece Part Cost (broken down into its various recurring costs components), the Amortized Investment (i. e. Amortized Tooling Cost) and ultimately the Manufacturing Cost. The Piece Part Cost estimation includes an algorithm for selecting the optimal combination of <b>press</b> and <b>billet</b> size to extrude a given shape. Extrusion speed, cycle time and yield are all calculated by the model as well. The Piece Part Cost Model was validated against actual quotes data from extruders in the US for a number of different designs. The model predictions were shown to correlate within 3 % to the actual quotes. Unlike the Piece Part Cost, the Tooling Cost part of the model is of empirical nature, obtained by Multivariate Regression techniques from actual quotes data provided by extruders in the US. The Tooling Cost Model was validated statistically, and it was shown to explain 84 % of the variance observed in the actual quotes.

40|$|Abstract. Ti 6 Al 4 V {{is one of}} {{the best}} known and studied {{titanium}} alloy for the optimization of the thermo-mechanical treatments. The Ti-forgings represent a valid opportunity for the aircraft manufacturers and designers because of high tensile and fatigue properties. Nevertheless the total-cost reduction of the manufacturing-chain requires both: the ability to manufacture nearer-shaped components by mean of forging-process-modification and less final machining (material scraps). Even if Ti 6 Al 4 V is a well known alloy, any process parameters modification introduced still represents a challenge for the metallurgists and manufacturers. The idea, at the base of the present work, has been the feasibility study of forging experiments in the Beta-field using Hot Isostatic <b>Pressed</b> (HIP) powders <b>billets.</b> The preliminary compression tests has been carried out in laboratory and the results have been validated in a industrial Forging-Workshop. The deformation behavior of Ti 6 Al 4 V HIPped powders during high temperature deformation tests is reported. Laboratory compression and tensile tests have been coupled with relaxation tests in order to achieve robust data about strain rate sensitivity m-coefficient and activation energy Q. The obtained results have been fitted for the assessment of generalized exponential deformation law. The final result is a “Dorn model ” that takes into account and compares all the results from the three different deformation tests: compression, tensile and relaxation.
