50|$|Prior to {{comparing}} codec video-quality, it {{is important}} to understand that every codec can give a varying degree of quality for a given set of frames within a video sequence. Numerous factors play a role in this variability. First, all codecs have a bitrate control mechanism that is responsible for determining the bitrate and quality on a per-frame basis. A difference between variable bitrate (VBR) and constant bitrate (CBR) creates a trade-off between a consistent quality over all frames, on the one hand, and a more constant bitrate, which is required for some applications, on the other. Second, some codecs differentiate between different types of frames, such as key frames and non-key frames, differing in their importance to overall visual quality and the extent to which they can be compressed. Third, quality depends on <b>prefiltrations,</b> which are included on all present-day codecs. Other factors may also come into play.|$|R

In situ experiments based on a 23 factorial design were performed in mesocosm enclosures on 10 occasions. The manipulations used included phosphorus (PO,?) and nitrogen (NH,+) additions {{and the removal of}} metazooplankton by 1 OO+m <b>prefiltration.</b> In each experiment, the responses of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, hetero-trophic nanoflagellates, and protozooplankton were followed for 2 d.

Nitrogen was found to be the basic limiting nutrient for phytoplankton throughout the productive season. During early summer, only the combined addition of P and N evoked a clear increase in the growth of phytoplankton. In general, bacterial productivity was not highly affected by the manipulations. In summer the removal of metazooplankton caused a rapid increase in the amount of protozooplankton in the units with loo-pm <b>prefiltration</b> or <b>prefiltration</b> combined with N addition.

A previous investigation showed that separation by ultrafiltration is possible, but the flux was low due to the high viscosity of the solution and the presence of gel-forming substances in the solution. In this investigation the influence of <b>prefiltration</b> on solution viscosity and ultrafiltration performance was investigated. The viscosity of the hemicellulose solution after extraction was considerably reduced with both <b>prefiltration</b> methods tested, leading to a substantial increase in flux during ultrafiltration. The highest flux achieved without pretreatment was about 75 l/m 2 h, and was increased to 225 and 440 l/m 2 h after dead-end filtration and microfiltration, respectively. However, the loss of hemicelluloses was considerable during microfiltration, but < 5 % during dead-end filtration. After <b>prefiltration</b> by dead-end filtration, hemicelluloses could be successfully concentrated and purified by ultrafiltration. Eighty percent of the initial volume was removed during concentration at an average flux of 155 l/m 2 h. At the same time, the concentration and purity of the hemicelluloses increased from 7. 6 g/l and 15 % to 31. 6 g/l and 31 %, respectively.

Some sample processing considerations {{are discussed in the}} present study, and different combinations of existing procedures for preservation, size fractionation sequential filtration, and sonication were tested in conjunction with FISH. Results from this study show that water samples should be filtered and processed within no more than 10 to 12 h after collection, or else preservation is necessary. The commonly used <b>prefiltration</b> formaldehyde fixation was shown to be inadequate for the rRNA targeted by FISH. However, <b>prefiltration</b> formaldehyde fixation followed by immediate freezing and postfiltration paraformaldehyde fixation yielded highly consistent cell abundance estimates even after 96 days or potentially longer storage. Size fractionation sequential filtration and sonication together enhanced cell abundance estimates by severalfold. Size fractionation sequential filtration effectively separated particle-associated microbial communities from their free-living counterparts, while sonication detached cells from particles or aggregates for more-accurate cell counting using epifluorescence microscopy. Optimization in sonication time is recommended for different specific types of samples.

We screened 3 polysulfone (PS) membranes with cutoffs of 100, 50, and 25 kDa, respectively. Flux and retention for the 100 - and 50 -kDa membranes had the same order of magnitude, indicating that these properties were determined by fouling that formed on the membrane—not pore size. The PS membrane with the 50 -kDa cutoff performed best in terms of flux and retention of lignin-carbohydrate complexes and experienced the least membrane fouling. Two <b>prefiltration</b> methods were used to decrease the fouling of the 50 -kDa membrane: a 0. 2 -μm PS microfiltration membrane and dead-end filtration with 10 -um filter cloth and a 4 wt% mixture of kieselguhr (diatomite) and spent sulfite liquor prior to filtration. <b>Prefiltration</b> of the SSL with microfiltration increased the flux 3 -fold and decreased the fouling grade from 49 % to 7. 2 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the role of colloids in aquatic systems, better fractionation methods of environmental samples into particulate, colloidal, and truly dissolved phase are needed. An adequate fractionation procedure involves 1) <b>prefiltration</b> to remove large (i. e., settling) particles and 2) ultrafiltration to separate colloids from the truly dissolved compounds. <b>Prefiltration</b> is most commonly accomplished using filters with 0. 45 or 0. 22 μm pore size, which results in the inclusion of coarse colloids (size by definition up to about 1 μm) into the particulate phase. To evaluate the possible drawbacks of such operational procedures, the trace metal fraction associated with coarse colloids (size range 0. 45 - 1. 2 μm) was quantified in a number of rivers having different biogeochemical characteristics and degree of anthropogenic impact. Al, Pb, and Ti showed a strong association with coarse colloids (often over 50 % of the total filterable metal at 1. 2 μm) in all rivers. Other elements (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, U, V, and Zn) had a more variable behaviour, possibly linked to differences in conductivity, oxygen saturation, and nature of colloids (mineral, organic, or mixed) among rivers. No overall statistically significant relationships could be found between the percentage metal fractions associated with coarse colloids and master environmental variables. However, when systems where classified according to the nature of colloids, Al and Pb showed statistically significant relationships with suspended particulate matter. Significant relationships were also observed between the metal pairs Mn/Co, Mn/Cu, Mn/V, Fe/Co, and Fe/Ni. The association of trace metals with coarse colloids has important implications as to their transport, fate and bioavailability in natural systems. These findings suggest that, at least in some cases, the use of the classical size limit of 0. 45 μm as a boundary between the particulate and dissolved phases should be partially reconsidered and redefined...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of return series from financial markets is {{often based on}} the Peaks-over-threshold (POT) model. This model assumes independent and identically distributed observations and therefore a Poisson process is used to characterize the occurrence of extreme events.

40|$|A slow {{sand filter}} system was {{developed}} which was suitable both for experimental purposes and full scale community water supply. The {{performance of the}} system was enhanced by the incorporation of pretreatments such as gravel <b>prefiltration,</b> sub-sand <b>prefiltration</b> and direct protection of filters by the incorporation of synthetic fabric layers. The system {{was used to examine}} aspects of the biological and physico-chemical nature of Slow Sand Filtration with particular reference to the removal of Rotavirus and a variety of bacterial and viral indicators. The results of the developmental phase and experiments conducted with operational filters and in the laboratory confirmed the importance of biological mechanisms, in particular adsorption to biological surfaces present in the upper horizons of slow sand filters. It was observed that both the efficiency and pattern of removal of Rotavirus in Slow Sand Filtration were similar to those observed for faecal indicator bacteria, bacteriophage and turbidity ie colloidal clay and other particles. Thus it was concluded that negatively charged particulate colloidal entities appear to behave similarly despite differences in size and surface characteristics and that Rotavirus is no more or less likely to pass through slow sand filters than any other particle. Thus, a well operated slow sand filter may be expected to achieve a reduction in Rotavirus densities of 2 log 10 orders of magnitude. The principal mechanisms of removal of Rotavirus in the upper horizons would appear to be transportation by diffusion and adsorption to biofilms and biomass. Microbial predation is not likely to play a dominant role in the removal of Rotavirus from the aqueous phase but may be important in inactivation. A detailed examination of the incidence, prevalence and seasonal occurrence of rotaviral and other diarrhoeas in less developed countries led to the observation that unlike some of the bacterial pathogens, transmission of Rotavirus does not have a strong association with water quality. Hence. The case for low level waterborne transmission and thereby maintenance of endemicity in the community remains entirely theoretical. Moreover, bearing in mind the likelihood that slow sand filters will be operated sub-optimally in many cases, a moderate reduction in Rotavirus densities eg 1 - 2 log 10 units may not be significant in terms of diarrhoeal disease risk, particularly for children and especially in the rural sector. In view of these observations and other factors eg the low infective dose of the virus and the undoubted pre-eminence of person-to-person spread, it was concluded that as a single process, Slow Sand Filtration is probably not capable of significantly reducing the incidence of rotaviral diarrhoea in less developed countries...|$|E

The AOM (3 mg DOC/L) extracted from a Microcystis aeruginosa culture at three phases of growth (10, 20 and 35 days) all caused severe flux decline, and its fouling potential increased with increasing growth time. Size exclusion chromatography, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra and organic matter fractionation showed that the high MW biopolymers were the major component determining the severity of the AOM fouling of the ceramic membrane. For the AOM at stationary phase (35 days), 0. 45 and 1 mm pre-filtration gave greater flux decline and hydraulically irreversible fouling than 5 mm <b>prefiltration</b> due to the denser foulant layer formed and greater amounts of small organic molecules entering membrane pores. However, the non-pre-filtered AOM (with algal cells) caused the greatest flux decline which was likely due to the presence of the high fouling potential cell surface organic matter.

We hypothesized that those -proteobacterial genera that are rapidly enriched would also be most strongly affected by HNF regrowth. In the absence of HNF, the mean protein content per bacterial cell increased in both treatments compared to environmental samples, whereas the opposite trend was found in incubations of unaltered seawater. Significant responses to the experimental manipulations were observed in Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, and Vibrio populations. No treatment-specific effects could be detected {{for members of the}} Roseobacter group, the Cytophaga latercula-C. marinoflava lineage, or the NOR 5 clade. Statistical analysis confirmed a transient increase in the proportions of Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, and Vibrio cells at reduced HNF densities only, followed by an overproportional decline during the phase of HNF regrowth. Cells from these genera were significantly larger than the community average in the dilution treatments, and changes in their relative abundances were negatively correlated with HNF densities. Our findings suggest that bacteria affiliated with frequently isolated genera such as Alteromo-nas, Pseudoalteromonas, and Vibrio might be rare in coastal North Sea picoplankton because their rapid growt...|$|E
40|$|A new two-step {{filtration}} protocol {{followed by}} a real-time PCR assay based on SYBR green I detection was developed to directly quantitate salmonellae in two types of biological samples: i. e., chicken rinse and spent irrigation water. Four <b>prefiltration</b> filters, one type of final filter, and six protocols for recovery of salmonellae from the final filter were evaluated to identify an effective filtration protocol. This method was then combined with a real-time PCR assay based on detection of the invA gene. The best results were obtained by subsequent filtration of 100 ml of chicken rinse or 100 ml of spent irrigation water through filters with pore diameters of > 40 μm to remove large particles and of 0. 22 μm to recover the Salmonella cells. After this, the Salmonella cells {{were removed from the}} filter by vortexing in 1 ml of physiological saline, and this sample was then subjected to real-time quantitative PCR. The whole procedure could be completed within 3 h from sampling to quantitation, and cell numbers as low as 7. 5 × 102 CFU per 100 -ml sample could be quantified. Below this limit, qualitative detection of concentrations as low as 2. 2 CFU/ 100 ml sample was possible on occasion. This study has contributed {{to the development of a}} simple, rapid, and reliable method for quantitation of salmonellae in food without the need for sample enrichment or DNA extraction...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{abundance}} and community composition were investigated along trophic gradients in the barrier reef lagoon of Noumea, New Caledonia. Bacterial {{abundance and}} the percentage of high nucleic acid (%HNA) bacteria (a potential indicator for bacterial production) increased from offshore waters towards the head of the bays. 16 S rRNA gene PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used as genetic fingerprints for assessing differences in bacterial community composition. Sequences of DGGE bands were assigned to (1) the genera Rugeria and Roseobacter (Rhodobacteriaceae), (2) the SAR 11 cluster, (3) other Alphaproteobacteria, and (4) the genus Alteromonas. Removal of the operationally defined attached bacteria by <b>prefiltration</b> did not affect community profiles in offshore waters but had a strong influence in the bays, probably clue to the much higher particle load and thus, attached bacteria in the bays. For the free-living community, the number of bands decreased linearly with increasing water residence time, chlorophyll a concentration, and viral abundance. Specific bands were found for offshore waters and the 2 investigated semi-enclosed bays, whereas the lagoon showed no specific bands. A similarity analysis showed specific clusters for offshore water, the lagoon, and the bays. A principle component analysis together with cluster and correlation analysis indicated that water residence time, viruses, and a complex top-down cascading effect of ciliate grazers on flagellates influenced community composition. Also, data from fingerprints of the total and free-living communities suggest that the free-living and the attached community are controlled by different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Four enteric viruses, {{poliovirus}} type 1, echovirus type 1, reovirus type 3, and simian adenovirus SV- 11, were concentrated from seeded 1. 3 -liter {{volumes of}} raw, finished, and granular activated carbon-treated waters by adsorption to 47 -mm-diameter (17 cm 2), electropositive (Virosorb 1 MDS) filters at pH 7. 5 or electronegative (Filterite) filters at pH 3. 5 {{with and without}} 5 mM added MgCl 2, followed by elution with 0. 3 % beef extract in 50 mM glycine at pH 9. 5. Removal of particulates from raw and finished waters by 0. 2 -micron <b>prefiltration</b> before virus addition and pH adjustment {{had little effect on}} virus concentration efficiencies. Soluble organic compounds reduced virus adsorption efficiencies from both raw and finished waters compared with granular activated carbon-treated water, but the extent of interference varied with virus type and adsorption conditions. For electropositive 1 MDS filters, organic interference was similar with all virus types. For Filterite filters, organic interference was evident with poliovirus and echovirus, but could be overcome by adding MgCl 2. Reovirus and SV- 11 were not adversely affected by organics during adsorption to Filterite filters. Elution of reovirus and adenovirus was inefficient compared with that of poliovirus and echovirus. None of the three adsorption schemes (1 MDS at pH 7. 5 and Filterite with and without 5 mM MgCl 2 at pH 3. 5) could be judged superior for all viruses and water types tested...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved gases {{produced}} within engineered {{anaerobic processes}} subsequently create a fugitive emission which can have financial, environmental {{and health and}} safety implications. Whilst desorption technology {{has been used to}} control dissolved gases in the drinking water sector, there is considerably less understanding of its deployment in wastewater for which there are numerous existing and emerging challenges. This review therefore focuses on existing and proposed technological approaches to gas desorption in engineered anaerobic wastewater processes, with specific emphasis on technology compatibility and downstream gas phase management. Simplified engineered solutions such as diffused aeration and multi-tray aerators appear robust solutions for implementation into wastewater. However, these processes are characterised by a low mass transfer coefficient and require high gas to liquid ratios (G/L) to achieve reasonable separation, which suggests their suitability is limited to small scale applications, in which gas recovery is not a priority. Packed columns and membrane contactors afford process intensification through increasing interfacial area which favours large scale applications; although both will require <b>prefiltration</b> technology to obviate media clogging. Vacuum or steam is the preferred driving force for separation when gas recovery is sought, while sweep-gas is energetically favoured. Sweep-gas has been used for gas recovery by operating at G/L toward the equilibrium value, which somewhat constrains mass transfer. Process selection must therefore be weighted on whole life cost, but will also be dependent upon process scale, financial (e. g. incentivisation) and non-financial (e. g. carbon) instruments, which are strongly influenced by regional policy...|$|E
40|$|Dutch {{greenhouse}} horticulture has {{to treat}} all discharged water from soilless cultivations {{for the removal}} of plant protection products, to meet the new Dutch Directive Hoofdlijnenakkoord (2015). Building on previous research, (1) the life span of activated carbon filters, (2) the effect of increasing concentrations of plant protection products on the removal efficacy of ozone and the removal efficacy of (3) multimedia filtration and (4) ultrasonic water treatment have been investigated. It turned out to be difficult to design an active carbon based water treatment system capable of durable treatment of greenhouse discharge water: organic and mineral material in the water blocked the pores, thereby clogging the filter system and causing leakage by pressure build-up. Activated carbon filtration (granular activated carbon, 48 min contact time, 50 μm <b>prefiltration</b> with sand filter) achieved a removal efficacy of > 95 % for up to 430 bed volumes treated. Combination with advanced oxidation improved the removal efficacy, but the removal time of the filter could not be determined due to leakage. The removal efficacy of ozone oxidation remained > 98 %, even at increased concentrations (factor 10 and 100) of plant protection products in the untreated water. The multimedia filter removed 75 % of the plant protection products by adsorption, biological breakdown within the filter was not determined. Treatment of the water with ultrasonic waves hardly had any effect (maximum 30 % efficacy) on the breakdown...|$|E
