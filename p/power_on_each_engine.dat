50|$|The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>engine</b> unit were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze coupled wheel axle boxes were fitted with Ajax grease lubrication systems. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests, cylinders and the ball joint of the main steam pipes <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>engine</b> unit.|$|R

50|$|The airliner's four Curtiss Wright R-1820 radial engines used crankshaft-driven {{two-speed}} superchargers {{both for}} added power and for greater performance at altitude.

50|$|The 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain was {{probably}} the optimal Garratt wheel arrangement, with the four-wheeled leading bogies and the two-wheeled trailing trucks <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>engine</b> unit ensuring stability at speed and with sixteen coupled wheels for traction. More coupled wheels would inhibit the locomotive on tight curves, while the only advantage of more non-coupled wheels would be to reduce the axle loading.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of speeds of 57 mph, but it {{was found to be}} unsteady at high speed due to the absence of a leading bogie <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>engine</b> unit.
