5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the <b>political</b> <b>context</b> was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E
5|$|His Teutonic Knights {{returned}} to Poland's history. Describing the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian {{victory over the}} Germans in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, the book had a substantial contemporary <b>political</b> <b>context</b> in the ongoing Germanization efforts (Kulturkampf) in German Poland. The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German National Democracy political movement, and {{became part of the}} Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.|$|E

5|$|One {{year after}} Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital {{alliance}} with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's brother Henry, who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death {{paved the way}} for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The potential for a question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage, was much later (and in a completely different <b>political</b> <b>context)</b> exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|The disdain of the British {{people for}} the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as the}} 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a <b>political</b> <b>context</b> in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E
5|$|The <b>political</b> <b>context</b> of the event, {{coupled with}} a variety of curious {{circumstances}} (for instance, the Russian agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibaltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of some 2000 examples, one {{commentator}} has argued that “Gray’s Elegy has probably inspired more adaptations than any other poem in the language”. It has also been suggested that parody acts {{as a kind of}} translation into the same tongue as the original, something that the printing history of some examples seems to confirm. One of the earliest, John Duncombe’s “An evening contemplation in a college” (1753), frequently reprinted {{to the end of the}} 18th century, was included alongside translations of the Elegy into Latin and Italian in the 1768 and 1775 Dublin editions and 1768 Cork edition of Gray’s works. In the case of the American The Political Passing Bell: An Elegy. Written in a Country Meeting House, April 1789; Parodized from Gray for the Entertainment of Those Who Laugh at All Parties by George Richards (d.1804) and published from Boston MA, the parody was printed opposite Gray's original page by page, making the translation to the <b>political</b> <b>context</b> more obvious.|$|E

25|$|Censorship {{of images}} in the Soviet Union was {{widespread}} in the USSR. Visual censorship was exploited in a <b>political</b> <b>context,</b> particularly during the political purges of Joseph Stalin, where the Soviet government attempted to erase some purged figures from Soviet history, and took measures which included altering images and destroying film. The USSR curtailed access to pornography, which was specifically prohibited by Soviet law.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or <b>political</b> <b>context</b> allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a <b>political</b> <b>context).</b> New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rational}} planning model was innovative at its conception, the concepts are controversial and questionable processes today.

Going further, Guy Benveniste argued that {{the rational}} model could not be implemented without taking the <b>political</b> <b>context</b> into account.|$|E

25|$|Goldfield {{writes that}} the overall effects of {{globalization}} on unionization in the particular case of the United States may be understated in econometric studies on the subject.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this social and {{political}} change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and <b>political</b> <b>context</b> that language evolves.|$|E
