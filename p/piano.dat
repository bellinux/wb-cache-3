5|$|A book of <b>piano</b> {{sheet music}} {{arrangements}} {{from the original}} soundtrack has been arranged for the <b>piano</b> and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level <b>piano</b> solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. The actual <b>piano</b> sheet music from the Final Fantasy XIII <b>Piano</b> Collection album has been published as a corresponding music book by Yamaha Music Media. Yamaha has additionally published its own sheet music book for <b>piano</b> arrangements from the original soundtrack, {{as well as a}} book of <b>piano</b> and vocal sheet music for the vocal tracks on the original soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} <b>piano</b> version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a <b>piano</b> version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's <b>piano</b> version but reduced to only one <b>piano,</b> also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one <b>piano.</b> Ricordi published a <b>piano</b> reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original <b>piano</b> version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E

50|$|Upright <b>pianos,</b> {{also called}} {{vertical}} <b>pianos,</b> are more compact because {{the frame and}} strings are vertical. Upright <b>pianos</b> are generally less expensive than grand <b>pianos.</b> Upright <b>pianos</b> are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments, and they are popular models for in-home purchase. The hammers move horizontally, and return to their resting position via springs, which are susceptible to degradation. Upright <b>pianos</b> with unusually tall frames and long strings are sometimes called upright grand <b>pianos.</b> Some authors classify modern <b>pianos</b> according to their height and to modifications of the action {{that are necessary to}} accommodate the height.|$|R
5000|$|Concertos {{and concert}} works for two solo <b>pianos</b> {{were written by}} Bach (two to four <b>pianos,</b> BWV 1060-65, {{actually}} harpsichord concertos, but often performed on <b>pianos),</b> Mozart (two, K 242 (originally for three <b>pianos</b> and orchestra) and K 365), Mendelssohn (two, 1823-4), Bruch (1912), Béla Bartók (1927/1932, a reworking of his Sonata for two <b>pianos</b> and percussion), Poulenc (1932), Arthur Bliss (1924), Arthur Benjamin (1938), Peter Mieg (1939-41), Darius Milhaud (1941 and 1951), Bohuslav Martinů (1943), Ralph Vaughan Williams (c. 1946), Roy Harris (1946), Gian Francesco Malipiero (two works, both 1957), Walter Piston (1959), Luciano Berio (1973), and Harald Genzmer (1990). Apart from the Bach and Mozart examples, works {{for more than two}} <b>pianos</b> and orchestra are considerably rarer, but have been written by Carl Czerny (Quatuor Concerto for four <b>pianos,</b> op. 230), Morton Gould (Inventions for four <b>pianos</b> and orchestra, 1954), Peter Racine Fricker (Concertante for three <b>pianos,</b> timpani, and strings, 1956), Wolfgang Fortner (Triplum for three <b>pianos</b> and orchestra, 1966) and Georg Friedrich Haas (limited approximations for six microtonally tuned <b>pianos</b> and orchestra, 2010)http://www.universaledition.com/Georg-Friedrich-Haas/composers-and-works/composer/278/work/13386 ...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{successful}} models were the updated [...] "A"-185 and [...] "B"-208 grand <b>pianos.</b> The upright <b>pianos</b> became more popular after the war, and C. Bechstein were successful with its upright <b>pianos</b> Model-8 and Model-9, {{both of which}} have been considered the finest upright <b>pianos.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Rhodes <b>piano</b> (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes <b>piano</b> or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} <b>piano</b> invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s. Like a <b>piano,</b> it generates sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack <b>piano</b> there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk <b>piano,</b> where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack <b>piano,</b> so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old <b>piano</b> from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the <b>piano</b> hammers.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{the actual}} <b>piano</b> sheet music {{from each of}} the ten Final Fantasy <b>Piano</b> Collections albums has been {{published}} as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI <b>Piano</b> Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone <b>piano</b> album is published by Yamaha.|$|E
5|$|All of Chopin's {{compositions}} {{include the}} <b>piano.</b> Most are for solo <b>piano,</b> though {{he also wrote}} two <b>piano</b> concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented {{the concept of the}} instrumental ballade. His major <b>piano</b> works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig {{with the concept}} of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, a rarity in London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including <b>piano</b> trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for <b>piano</b> solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the <b>piano</b> virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E

5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The <b>piano</b> pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the <b>piano.</b> The <b>piano</b> pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the <b>piano.</b> Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the <b>piano,</b> the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|During his {{association}} with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 <b>piano</b> rolls {{of his own and}} others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand <b>piano</b> via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc. This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's <b>Piano</b> Concerto.|$|E

5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes <b>piano,</b> a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the <b>piano</b> and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the <b>piano</b> bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes <b>piano.</b> The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Ferrier {{entered the}} Carlisle Festival open <b>piano</b> {{competition}} and, {{as a result}} of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the <b>piano</b> trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in <b>piano</b> and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage <b>Piano</b> was {{introduced}} as a lighter and more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack.

The older style <b>piano</b> continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed the Suitcase <b>Piano,</b> with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
