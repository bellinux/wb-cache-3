5|$|The <b>p-adic</b> {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the <b>p-adic</b> numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The <b>p-adic</b> numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the <b>p-adic</b> logarithm, the inverse function of the <b>p-adic</b> exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} fields are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and <b>p-adic</b> fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the <b>p-adic</b> integers, and, if one point {{is removed from}} it, to the <b>p-adic</b> numbers.|$|E
25|$|For schemes in {{characteristic}} p, crystalline cohomology {{theory can}} handle questions about p-torsion in cohomology groups better than <b>p-adic</b> étale cohomology. This {{makes it a}} natural backdrop {{for much of the}} work on <b>p-adic</b> L-functions.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck's {{crystalline}} cohomology theory {{gets around}} this obstruction {{because it takes}} values in the ring of Witt vectors over the ground field. So if the ground field is the algebraic closure {{of the field of}} order p, its values are modules over the <b>p-adic</b> completion of the maximal unramified extension of the <b>p-adic</b> integers, a much larger ring containing n-th roots of unity for all n not divisible by p, rather than over the <b>p-adic</b> integers.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, Hensel {{introduced}} <b>p-adic</b> numbers.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>p-adic</b> {{integers}} are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, {{they form}} a compact set.|$|E
25|$|The <b>p-adic</b> numbers {{may have}} {{infinitely}} long expansions {{to the left}} of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the <b>p-adic</b> numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|If b = p {{is a prime}} number, one {{can define}} base-p numerals whose {{expansion}} to the left never stops; these are called the <b>p-adic</b> numbers.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the usual absolute value, the <b>p-adic</b> norm gets smaller when q is multiplied by p, leading to quite different behavior of Qp vis-à-vis R.|$|E
25|$|Non-archimedean {{local class}} field theory of {{characteristic}} 0: The module A is the algebraic closure {{of a field}} of <b>p-adic</b> numbers, and G is the Galois group.|$|E
25|$|In {{analysis}} with <b>p-adic</b> numbers, Mahler's theorem {{states that the}} assumption that f is a polynomial function can be weakened {{all the way to}} the assumption that f is merely continuous.|$|E
25|$|In particular, this norm gets smaller when {{a number}} is multiplied by p, in sharp {{contrast}} to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the <b>p-adic</b> norm |−|p yields the field of <b>p-adic</b> numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} definition uses {{ideas from}} mathematical analysis to define jets and jet spaces. It can {{be generalized to}} smooth functions between Banach spaces, analytic functions between real or complex domains, to <b>p-adic</b> analysis, and {{to other areas of}} analysis.|$|E
25|$|Paul Joseph Sally, Jr. (January 29, 1933 – December 30, 2013) was a {{professor}} of mathematics at the University of Chicago, {{where he was the}} Director of Undergraduate Studies for 30 years. His research areas were <b>p-adic</b> analysis and representation theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} of an algebraic function field over a finite field and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see Function field analogy). Therefore, {{they are often}} regarded as numbers by number theorists. The <b>p-adic</b> numbers {{play an important role}} in this analogy.|$|E
25|$|Commutative algebra is {{the branch}} of algebra that studies {{commutative}} rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. Prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings, rings of algebraic integers, including the ordinary integers , and <b>p-adic</b> integers.|$|E
25|$|Numeral {{systems are}} {{sometimes}} called number systems, but that name is ambiguous, {{as it could}} refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of real numbers, the system of complex numbers, the system of <b>p-adic</b> numbers, etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians of {{the nineteenth}} century assumed that {{algebraic}} numbers were a type of complex number. This situation changed with the discovery of <b>p-adic</b> numbers by Hensel in 1897; and now it is standard to consider all of the various possible embeddings of a number field F into its various topological completions at once.|$|E
25|$|Representation theory {{depends upon}} the type of field over which the vector space is defined. The most {{important}} case is the field of complex numbers. The other important cases are the field of real numbers, finite fields, and fields of <b>p-adic</b> numbers. Additional difficulties arise for fields of positive characteristic and for fields that are not algebraically closed.|$|E
25|$|Equidissections do {{not have}} many direct applications. They are {{considered}} interesting because the results are counterintuitive at first, and for a geometry problem with such a simple definition, the theory requires some surprisingly sophisticated algebraic tools. Many of the results rely upon extending <b>p-adic</b> valuations to the real numbers and extending Sperner's lemma to more general colored graphs.|$|E
25|$|Completing {{with respect}} to this {{absolute}} value |.|P yields a field E'P, the proper generalization of the field of <b>p-adic</b> numbers to this setting. The choice of c does not change the completion (different choices yield the same concept of Cauchy sequence, so the same completion). It is convenient, when the residue field D/P is finite, to take for c the size of D/P.|$|E
25|$|This {{section is}} an {{informal}} introduction to -adic numbers, using {{examples from the}} ring of 10-adic (decadic) numbers. Although for <b>p-adic</b> numbers p should be a prime, base 10 was chosen to highlight the analogy with decimals. The decadic numbers are generally not used in mathematics: since 10 is not prime or prime power, the decadics are not a field. More formal constructions and properties are given below.|$|E
25|$|The Ihara zeta {{function}} of a finite graph is an analogue of the Selberg zeta function, which was first introduced by Yasutaka Ihara {{in the context of}} discrete subgroups of the two-by-two <b>p-adic</b> special linear group. A regular finite graph is a Ramanujan graph, a mathematical model of efficient communication networks, if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis as was pointed out by T. Sunada.|$|E
25|$|Number {{theory is}} {{concerned}} with the properties of numbers in general, particularly integers. It has applications to cryptography, cryptanalysis, and cryptology, particularly with regard to modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality testing. Other discrete aspects of number theory include geometry of numbers. In analytic number theory, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include transcendental numbers, diophantine approximation, <b>p-adic</b> analysis and function fields.|$|E
25|$|One {{must also}} {{consider}} the type of field over which the vector space is defined. The most important case is the field of complex numbers. The other important cases are the field of real numbers, finite fields, and fields of <b>p-adic</b> numbers. In general, algebraically closed fields are easier to handle than non-algebraically closed ones. The characteristic of the field is also significant; many theorems for finite groups depend on the characteristic of the field not dividing {{the order of the}} group.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s1950s, Ellis Kolchin, Armand Borel, and Claude Chevalley {{realised}} {{that many}} foundational results concerning Lie groups {{can be developed}} completely algebraically, giving rise {{to the theory of}} algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups, as well as in algebraic geometry. The theory of automorphic forms, an important branch of modern number theory, deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over adele rings; <b>p-adic</b> Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.|$|E
25|$|Real {{and complex}} embeddings {{can be put}} on the same footing as prime ideals by {{adopting}} a perspective based on valuations. Consider, for example, the integers. In addition to the usual absolute value function |·| : Q → R, there are <b>p-adic</b> absolute value functions |·|p : Q → R, defined for each prime number p, which measure divisibility by p. Ostrowski's theorem states that these are all possible absolute value functions on Q (up to equivalence). Therefore, absolute values are a common language to describe both the real embedding of Q and the prime numbers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} basic invariants of an {{infinite}} abelian group A is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of A. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank r is a subgroup of Qr. On the other hand, the group of <b>p-adic</b> integers Zp is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert and Pólya {{suggested}} {{that one way}} to derive the Riemann hypothesis would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(s) would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a <b>p-adic</b> zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups.|$|E
25|$|A prototypical question, posed at {{a global}} level, is whether some {{polynomial}} equation has a solution in F. If {{this is the}} case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The local-global principle or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of F, which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as intermediate value theorem at the archimedean places and <b>p-adic</b> analysis at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where local class field theory is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related {{to the fact that}} the Galois groups of the completions Fv can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of Q are far less understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of extra structure relates {{these types of}} groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for abstract harmonic analysis, whereas Lie groups (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of differential geometry and unitary representation theory. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, compact connected Lie groups have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group Γ can be realized as a lattice in a topological group G, the geometry and analysis pertaining to G yield important results about Γ. A comparatively recent trend {{in the theory of}} finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups (profinite groups): for example, a single <b>p-adic</b> analytic group G has a family of quotients which are finite p-groups of various orders, and properties of G translate into the properties of its finite quotients.|$|E
500|$|The field [...] is used {{in number}} theory and -adic analysis. The {{algebraic}} closure [...] carries a unique norm extending the one on , but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, {{it is called the}} field of complex <b>p-adic</b> numbers and is denoted by [...]|$|E
500|$|The first clear {{definition}} of an abstract field is due to [...] In particular, Weber's notion included the field Fp. Veronese (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led [...] to introduce the field of <b>p-adic</b> numbers. [...] synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections Galois theory, Constructing fields and Elementary notions {{can be found in}} Steinitz's work. [...] linked the notion of orderings in a field, and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties. Emil Artin redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the primitive element theorem.|$|E
500|$|Some topological spaces may be {{endowed with}} a group law. In order for the group law and the {{topology}} to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions, that is, , and g−1 must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little.

The most basic examples are the reals R under addition, , and similarly with any other topological field such as the complex numbers or <b>p-adic</b> numbers. All of these groups are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals.
