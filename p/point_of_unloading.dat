The city gave signs of growth; a temple was raised (the Temple with embossing), as well as thermal baths and dwelling houses including one with a central court. Under Trajan (97-117 AD) or under Hadrian (117-138 AD), a new structuring of urban space seemed to take place by conferring to the city an orthogonal urbanism plan with thermal baths and a small temple dedicated to Venus-Astarte. The development and the enrichment of the city conveyed in the continuing enlarging and transformation of the river thermal baths, {{in the construction of}} new temples bordering the bank of Sebou river and in new dwellings such as the [...] "House of pavement" [...] which adopted the plan of the rich residences of Volubilis and Spain. Modest houses, workshops and utility buildings occupyed many districts. In addition to its commercial and industrial functions which are behind its development, the town of Thamusida was to play a significant military role. It was populated by veterans and under Marc-Aurelius (161-180 AD) was built the most imposing fortress of Tingitane so to ensure the protection of the civilian population. Under Commode (176-192 AD) or Septimius Severus (193-211 AD), an enclosure was built and which reemployed funerary steles and crushed a part of the pavement house, that indicated the fact that the work was dictated by the fear of a close or remote danger.At the IIIrd century, the city was always active as showed the extent of the river thermal baths and the density of the ceramic founds is the spot until occurred the final abandonment which took place between 274 and 285 AD, but it was not known if it was due to the departure of the Army or to a posterior cause. Scattered finds and some walls of Thamusida attested of a ephemeral occupation posterior to the date of evacuation.Ellingham, Mark ...|$|E

The fully recrystallized microstructure showed a similar transition in strain sensitivity. However, this occurred at stains greater than ε*.

These three curves are termed as envelope curve, common point curve and stability point curve. The envelope curve is obtained by superimposing the cyclic peaks on the monotonic stress-strain curve. The common point curve is the locus <b>of</b> intersection <b>points</b> <b>of</b> loading and <b>unloading</b> curves <b>of</b> the cycles.

Counterstaining with aniline blue demonstrates the presence of plasmodesmata and this suggests a potential symplasmic pathway from the mesophyll to the sieve tubes.

Using a combination of electron microscopy, transport of the phloem-mobile symplasmic tracer carboxyfluorescein, movement of the companion cell-expressed and the green fluorescent protein-tagged viral movement protein, and assays of the sucrose cleavage enzymes, the pathway <b>of</b> phloem <b>unloading</b> was studied in the berries of a hybrid grape (Vitis vinifera × Vitis labrusca). Structural investigations showed that the sieve element-companion cell complex is apparently symplasmically connected through plasmodesmata with surrounding parenchyma cells throughout fruit development, though {{a small portion of}} plasmodesmata are apparently blocked in the ripening stage. Both carboxyfluorescein and the green fluorescent protein-tagged viral movement protein were released from the functional phloem strands during the early and middle stages of fruit development, whereas the two symplasmic tracers were confined to the phloem strands during the late stage. This reveals a shift <b>of</b> phloem <b>unloading</b> from symplasmic to apoplasmic pathway during fruit development. The turning <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the phloem <b>unloading</b> pathways was further shown to be at or just before onset of ripening, an important developmental checkpoint of grape berry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates a new method for how emissions from freight transport routes with single or several <b>points</b> <b>of</b> loading and <b>unloading,</b> can be allocated to individual consignments. The method, called Dedicated Distance Proportional Allocation (DDPA), {{has been developed}} based on a literature review, discussions with logistics providers, and analysis. DDPA is designed to have low data processing requirements and be easy to explain to actors involved. Furthermore, it supports several levels of information availability, and accounts for any set of vehicle-limiting factors, as well as prepositioning/repositioning. DDPA has been evaluated in simulations with different levels of information availability, together with three existent allocation methods: the Equal profit method (EPM), the CEN EN 16258 : 2011 standard and the Greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol. The simulations show that the GHG protocol under-allocates {{the total amount of}} emissions, on average. EPM and DDPA achieve equal relative savings, whereas for CEN EN 16258 : 2011 and the GHG protocol, relative savings vary, on average. When DDPA is used with low level of information availability, an error is introduced which can be reduced by applying compensation factors. Since DDPA accepts low information availability, the Intelligent Products concept can be applied for computing and storing emissions allocations, at the time <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> The results from this study can be used for further development and implementation of consignment allocation methods. Furthermore, by combining DDPA with other environmental load approaches for other parts of a product’s life cycle, a complete life cycle assessment of the product’s environmental impact can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of aging on skeletal myocyte apoptosis {{is not well}} understood. In this study we examined apoptosis and apoptotic regulatory factor responses to muscle atrophy induced via limb unloading following loading-induced hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy was induced by attaching a weight to one wing of young and aged Japanese quails for 14 days. Removing the weight for 7 or 14 days after the initial 14 days of loading induced muscle atrophy. The contralateral wing served as the intra-animal control. A time-released bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pellet was implanted subcutaneously with wing weighting to identify activated satellite cells/ muscle precursor cells throughout the experimental period. Bcl- 2 mRNA and protein levels decreased after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> but they were unchanged after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young muscles. Bcl- 2 protein level but not mRNA level decreased after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in muscles <b>of</b> aged birds. Seven days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> increased the mRNA level of Bax in muscles from both young and aged birds. Fourteen days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> increased mRNA and protein levels of Bcl- 2, decreased protein levels of Bax, and decreased nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) protein level in muscles of aged birds. BrdU-positive nuclei were found in all unloaded muscles from both age groups, {{but the number of}} BrdU-positive nuclei relative to the total nuclei decreased after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> compared with 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) index was higher after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in both young and aged muscles and after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in aged muscles. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that almost all of the TUNEL-positive nuclei were also BrdU immunopositive, suggesting that activated satellite cell nuclei (both fused and nonfused) underwent nuclear apoptosis during unloading. There were significant correlations among levels of Bcl- 2, Bax, and AIF and TUNEL index. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that apoptosis regulates, at least in part, unloading-induced muscle atrophy and loss of activated satellite cell nuclei in previously loaded muscles. Moreover, these data suggest that aging influences the apoptotic responses to prolonged unloading following hypertrophy in skeletal myocytes. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Immunofluorescent staining indicated that myo-nuclei and activated satellite cell nuclei contributed to the increased number of p 53 -positive nuclei.

Although Cu-Zn-SOD content was not different in unloaded and control muscles, Mn-SOD content increased in PAT muscles after 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> in young quails, suggesting that unloading induced an oxidative disturbance in these muscles.

40|$|Interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) mRNA is constitutively {{expressed}} in skeletal muscle. Although IL- 15 has proposed hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic roles in vitro, {{its role in}} skeletal muscle cells in vivo is less clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if skeletal muscle aging and unloading, two conditions known to promote muscle atrophy, would alter basal IL- 15 expression in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that IL- 15 mRNA expression would increase as a result of both aging and muscle unloading and that muscle would express the mRNA for a functional trimeric IL- 15 receptor (IL- 15 R). Two models <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> were used in this study: hindlimb suspension (HS) in rats and wing unloading in quail. The absolute muscle wet weight of plantaris and soleus muscles from aged rats was significantly less when compared with muscles from young adult rats. Although 14 days of HS resulted in reduced muscle mass of plantaris and soleus muscles from young adult animals, this effect was not observed in muscles from aged animals. A significant aging times unloading interaction was observed for IL- 15 mRNA in both rat soleus and plantaris muscles. Patagialis (PAT) muscles from aged quail retained a significant 12 and 6 % of stretch-induced hypertrophy after 7 and 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> respectively. PAT muscles from young quail retained 15 % hypertrophy at 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading</b> but regressed to control levels following 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> A main effect of age was observed on IL- 15 mRNA expression in PAT muscles at 14 days of overload, 7 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> and 14 days <b>of</b> <b>unloading.</b> Skeletal muscle also expressed the mRNAs for a functional IL- 15 R composed of IL- 15 RÎ±, IL- 2 / 15 R-Î², and -Î³c. Based on these data, we speculate that increases in IL- 15 mRNA in response to atrophic stimuli may be an attempt to counteract muscle mass loss in skeletal muscles of old animals. Additional research is warranted to determine the importance of the IL- 15 /IL- 15 R system to counter muscle wasting. Copyright Â© 2007 the American Physiological Society.
