A previous study conducted using the same testing methodology found out that in particle intensive spaces with visible mould the actively measured <b>particle</b> <b>counts</b> could be[*]>[*]nine times higher than passively measured <b>particle</b> <b>counts</b> [11], therefore {{it can be argued that}} the particle intensity of the basement could be significantly more than twice as much.

The aggregating suspension is forced through a narrow capillary particle counter {{and the size of}} each aggregate is being analyzed by light scattering.

If the suspensions contain high amounts of salt, one could equally use a Coulter counter. As time proceeds, the size distribution shifts towards larger aggregates, and from this variation aggregation and breakup rates involving different clusters can be deduced. The disadvantage of the technique is that the aggregates are forced through a narrow capillary under high shear, and the aggregates may disrupt under these conditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} <b>particle</b> <b>counting</b> {{is based upon}} either light scattering, light obscuration, or direct imaging. A high {{intensity}} light source is used to illuminate the particle as it passes through the detection chamber. The particle passes through the light source (typically a laser or halogen light) and if light scattering is used, then the redirected light is detected by a photo detector. If direct imaging is used, a halogen light illuminates particles from the back within a cell while a high definition, high magnification camera records passing particles. Recorded video is then analyzed by computer software to measure particle attributes. If light blocking (obscuration) is used the loss of light is detected. The amplitude of the light scattered or light blocked is measured and the particle is counted and tabulated into standardized counting bins. The image to the right shows a light scattering particle counter diagram. More information about types of particle counters and types of particle detection follow in this article.|$|E

50|$|Similar to TOC, SEM {{particle}} analysis {{represents a}} lower cost alternative to the expensive online measurements and therefore it is commonly a method of choice in less critical applications. SEM analysis can provide <b>particle</b> <b>counting</b> for particle size down to 50 nm, which generally is in-line with the capability of online instruments. The test involves installation of the SEM capture filter cartridge on the UPW sampling port for sampling on the membrane disk with the pore size equal or smaller than the target size of the UPW particles. The filter is then transferred to the SEM microscope where its surface is scanned for detection and identification of the particles. The main disadvantage of SEM analysis is long sampling time. Depending on the pore size and the pressure in the UPW system, the sampling time can be between one week and one month. However, typical robustness and stability of the particle filtration systems allow for successful applications of the SEM method. Application of Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) provides compositional analysis of the particles, making SEM also helpful for systems with on-line particle counters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The city of Phnom Penh is {{experiencing}} growth and, with this growth, an increased level {{of air pollution}} {{in the form of}} airborne particles that are attributed to increased vehicle traffic in the city – vehicular exhaust and re-entrained dust. For this study, airborne particulates were counted and sorted using a six-channel laser particle counter. Initial sample counts were taken at 88 sites within the city of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on days representative of dry season conditions. A subset of 33 sites was re-sampled on a day representative of the wet season. Objectives of this study are to provide a baseline count for airborne particulates in the city of Phnom Penh, and to explore the characteristics of the particulate counts utilizing summary statistics and maps. The median Phnom Penh city-wide fine and coarse <b>particle</b> <b>counts</b> are 1. 07 * 108 /m 3 and 1. 36 * 106 /m 3, respectively.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) has recently {{worked with a}} mining equipment manufacturer to examine a new cab filtration system design for underground industrial minerals equipment. This cab filtration system uses a combination of three particulate filters to reduce equipment operators' exposure to dust and diesel particulates present in underground industrial mineral mines. NIOSH initially examined this cab filtration system using a two-instrument <b>particle</b> <b>counting</b> method at the equipment company's manufacturing shop facility to assess several alternative filters. This cab filtration system design was further studied on several pieces of equipment during a two- to seven-month period at two underground limestone mines.

40|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>counting,</b> a {{sensitive}} indicator of water quality, is rapidly gaining acceptance {{as a tool}} for monitoring water treatment processes. In this paper, instrumentation specifications (particle count sensors and components for on-line <b>particle</b> <b>counting</b> networks) are described. Important installation and operating considerations, including monitoring frequencies and data collection formats, for on-line <b>particle</b> <b>counting</b> are also presented. At least 400 particles must be counted in order to achieve 10 percent precision during a particle count analysis. In on-line <b>particle</b> <b>counting,</b> a sensor should be selected that counts the number of particles required to achieve a desired precision within a reasonably short count interval. Turbidity and particle count results correspond, but the relationship is poorest in highly clarified water samples (less than 0. 1 ntu). Data presentation formats useful for treatment plant optimization include: total particle counts and differential counts in specific size ranges of interest. Differential particle counts in a specified size range provide information similar to that gleaned from total particle counts. Particle size distribution information is valuable for assessing the quality of the data and identifying over-concentration errors. Analysis of both source and finished water particle counts provides data for calculation of log removal. The main disadvantage of using log removal rather than total counts to evaluate treatment plant performance is that log removal values are greatly influenced by the magnitude of particles in the source water. Lowest finished water particle counts are not necessarily associated with the best log removal values. Total particle counts greater than the lower size detection limit of the sensor proved to be the simplest and best data format to use as a treatment plant performance criterion...|$|E

The par-ticle count defines oil cleanliness by counting the number of particulate contaminants in the certain size ranges, and the gravimetric analysis shows the weight of contaminants remaining on a membrane filter disc after a certain quantity of oil was filtered under vacuum, the oil was washed out, and the membrane filter disc was completely dried.
