25|$|On January 6, 2012, Heinz {{closed its}} tomato sauce factory in Girgarre as {{announced}} in the previous May. 146 workers lost their jobs. A local group was seeking to purchase the factory and start its own production, with offers of financial assistance from investors. The group's first offer for the site was rejected by Heinz. Girgarre was the second to last tomato sauce factory in Australia, and its closing brought an end to Heinz's 70 years of tomato <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> in Australia.|$|E

Ketchup <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> were to be consolidated at the company's US locations. Over 800 local jobs were lost due to the town's largest employer ending operations there. A local effort began {{in an attempt to}} save the 105-year-old Leamington plant, which included a Facebook page to gather support. On February 27, 2014 the Highbury Canco Corporation signed a letter of intent to acquire and operate the facility. In April it was reported that Highbury Canco Corporation had received a one-year license to process tomatoes at the facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{consumer}} digital cameras produced a new demand for HDR imaging {{to improve the}} light response of digital camera sensors, which had a much smaller dynamic range than film. Steve Mann developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the MIT Media Laboratory. Mann's method involved a two-step procedure: (1) generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations (operations that affect all pixels identically, without regard to their local neighborhoods); and then (2) convert this image array, using local neighborhood processing (tone-remapping, etc.), into an HDR image. The image array generated by {{the first step of}} Mann's process is called a lightspace image, lightspace picture, or radiance map. Another benefit of global-HDR imaging is that it provides access to the intermediate light or radiance map, which has been used for computer vision, and other image <b>processing</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Information {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} applied mathematics, {{electrical}} engineering, and computer science involving the quantification of information. [...] Information theory was developed by Claude E. Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in statistics, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, anomaly detection {{and other forms of}} data analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Audio is {{typically}} recorded at 8-, 16-, and 24-bit depth, which yield a theoretical maximum signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) for a pure sine wave of, approximately, 49.93dB, 98.09dB and 122.17dB. [...] CD quality audio uses 16-bit samples. Thermal noise limits the true {{number of bits}} {{that can be used}} in quantization. Few analog systems have signal to noise ratios (SNR) exceeding 120dB. [...] However, digital signal <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> can have very high dynamic range, consequently it is common to perform mixing and mastering operations at 32-bit precision and then convert to 16- or 24-bit for distribution.|$|E

It became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange that same year. By 1996, it had grown to US$550 million in assets, and carried US$525 million in long-term debt. NGC Corporation also established several subsidiaries to enable it to enter the electrical generation, marketing, and sales areas. [...] Electric Clearinghouse sold electricity, and the Energy Store marketed it. In August 1996, it purchased the natural gas gathering, marketing, and <b>processing</b> <b>operations</b> of Chevron Corporation. The latter deal gave Chevron a 29 percent stake in NGC. NGC followed that deal by buying Destec Energy for US$1.27 billion. The deal required NGC Corporation to sell Destec's power generation subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for US$407 million, although NGC Corporation retained Destec's 20 domestic gas-fired power plants.|$|E
