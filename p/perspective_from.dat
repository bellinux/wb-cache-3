5|$|In From Dust, players {{assume a}} god-like, first-person <b>perspective</b> <b>from</b> which they {{manipulate}} an archipelago environment {{in an effort}} to save and enlighten a nomadic tribe and help them to seek their lost knowledge. With a spherical cursor, the user controls certain types of matter in real time. Lava cools to form solid rock, vegetation propagates in soil and spreads naturally once a village is built, and moving water quickly erodes the terrain. Physical changes to the world occur extremely rapidly, allowing players to restructure islands within minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Lion King {{tells the}} story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is {{manipulated}} into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable <b>perspective</b> <b>from</b> his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person <b>perspective</b> <b>from</b> within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the main menu {{of the game is}} designed around the interior of a ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E

5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in <b>perspective</b> <b>from</b> the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E
