50|$|Irwin {{moved on}} to {{landscape}} projects after developing a stylistic move towards experiential space, projecting what he learned about line, color, and most of all, light onto the built environment. Since 1975 Irwin has conceived of fifty-five site projects. 9 Spaces 9 Trees (1980-3) was originally commissioned in 1980 for the rooftop of the Public Safety Building by the Seattle Arts Commission; it was re-imagined in 2007 and sited on campus at the University of Washington. Irwin's Filigreed Line (1979) made for Wellesley College, Massachusetts, consists of a stainless steel line, running along a ridge of grass near a lake, in which a pattern of leaflike forms is cut. His 1983 work Two Running Violet V Forms, two crossing blue-violet, <b>plastic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> fences fixed with high poles, is featured {{as part of the}} Stuart Collection of public artwork {{on the campus of the}} University of California, San Diego. For Sentinel Plaza (1990) in the Pasadena Civic Center District, Irwin chose small desert plants and cacti. He later consulted on the master plan for Dia:Beacon, creating, in particular, the design and landscaping of the outdoor spaces, and the entrance building and the window design.|$|E

The feasibility of using ultrasonic guided waves to measure insulation condition was examined.

50|$|Rigging- wire or rod {{used to hold}} up a mast. Since the 1960s {{stainless}} steel wire has become universal in the developed world. Elsewhere galvanized wire or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays. Type 7 x 7 is a semi flexible wire used for luff wires in sails, halyards (sometimes <b>plastic</b> <b>coated)</b> trapeze <b>wires</b> and light halyards. Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, wire sheets, vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of swagging. The wire loop is then fastened to a rigging screw with a bow shackle to the chain plate. Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} a {{short-term}} field experiment conducted in summer 2010 {{and designed to}} provide preliminary data on the bioextraction (removal) of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) for two different size classes (both 3 ̆c 76 mm shell height) of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) at six sites in the Great Bay estuarine system in New Hampshire. Sites were chosen to represent a range of ambient nutrient concentrations, water flow conditions, and location within the estuary. Two of the sites were at oyster aquaculture farms: Granite State Shellfish {{at the mouth of}} the Oyster River, and Little Bay Oyster Company near Fox Point in Little Bay. At each site, oysters were deployed in 10 mm mesh polyethylene bags typically used on oyster farms in New England. Approximately one thousand “seed” size (10 ? 15 mm shell height), or two hundred (200) 1 ?year old (30 ? 40 mm shell height) oysters were placed into each bag. Two bags (one for each size class) were suspended 10 ? 20 cm off the bottom attached to <b>plastic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> cages at each site from August 9 until November 4, 2010. The oysters were inspected and the bags were cleaned each month to reduce fouling. There were no significant differences in final size among the six sites, indicating similar growth rates.

40|$|Investigating the {{contribution}} of roots in the reinforcement of slopes against shallow landslides needs {{to better understand the}} local root-soil interactions at the root and root-soil block scales. Many experimental studies were carried out in order to quantify {{the contribution}} of roots to soil shear strength. Most of these experiments consist in shearing rectangular parallelepiped soil blocks (shear tests) with and without roots and deducing a “root additional cohesion-friction angle” from the analyses of resulting response curves. However {{it is often difficult to}} interpret the results without considering the effect of each individual root as well as the group effect involved by neighbor roots. Finite Element Models (FEM) can help analyzing the distribution of stresses and strains (elastic or plastic) within a heterogeneous solid body submitted to external forces. The aim of this study is to present such a FEM that simulates shear tests of root-soil blocks, and to analyze numerically {{the contribution of}} root elements on the mechanical response of the global system. Two modeling approaches, i. e. a standard lagrangian approach and an Euler explicit approach, were developed and compared using the Abaqus software (www. simulia. com). 3 D numerical results were compared with real shear tests done separately with reinforcement elements (<b>plastic</b> <b>coated</b> copper <b>wires)</b> embedded in the soil. The effect of an increase in the stiffness of the wires on soil shear resistance was analyzed. The main results are: 1 - the Euler explicit method is suitable to simulate shear tests involving large distortion; 2 - simulations explained why real shear tests exhibited lower shear strength of “reinforced” soils compared to bare soils, and thus can help designing more suitable experiments; 3 - a variation in the bending stiffness of wires modifies the stiffness and shear resistance of reinforced soil blocks through a modification of the ratio between normal and shear stress components involved during their deformation...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} and performance characteristics of simvastatin (SIM) selective electrodes were developed. Three types of electrodes: <b>plastic</b> membrane I, <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> II, and <b>coated</b> graphite rod III were constructed {{based on the}} incorporation of simvastatin with phosphotungstic (PTA) or phosphomolybdic (PMA) acids and mixed ion pair (PTA/PMA) for the three electrodes, respectively. The influence of membrane composition, kind of plasticizer, type of ion-pair, pH of the test solution, soaking time, and foreign ions on the electrodes was investigated. The electrodes showed a Nernstain response with a mean calibration graph slope of 56. 24 ± 0. 43, 55. 44 ± 0. 14 and 58. 93 ± 0. 34 mV decade- 1 at 25 °C over simvastatin concentration range from 1. 0 x 10 - 6 - 5. 0 x 10 - 2, 9. 0 x 10 - 6 - 5. 0 x 10 - 3 and 9. 0 x 10 - 7 - 1. 0 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1, with detection limit of 5. 0 x 10 - 7, 3. 9 x 10 - 6 and 3. 2 x 10 - 7 mol L- 1 for electrode I, II and III, respectively. The pH range for the proposed electrodes was 4 - 7. The influence of possible interfering species such as common inorganic cations, many sugars, amino acids and a pharmacologically related drug 'ezetimibe' was studied.

40|$|The {{activated}} flux <b>coated</b> <b>wires</b> {{are used}} to examine the effect of the fluxes on the weld penetration of the magnesium alloy. A series of emission spectroscopy of arc plasma for TIG welding for magnesium with normal wire and activated flux <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> are developed. It is found that intensities of emission spectra of Mg I increase significantly when the flux wires are used. All the flux <b>coated</b> <b>wire</b> can increase the weld penetration of the TIG welding. The electron temperature and electron density of welding plasma are estimated.

It is believed that the current density increases with the electron density increase, {{which is one of the}} reasons that the penetration depth increase when the flux wires are used.

This is to ensure adhesion of the new coating. Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire.
