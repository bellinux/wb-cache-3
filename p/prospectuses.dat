40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the two {{important}} issues {{of the law of}} capital market. Namely, the period of time in which the <b>prospectus</b> is valid (validity) and obligation to asupplement (to correct and update) the <b>prospectus.</b> The Law on the Capital Market of Serbia regulates validity of the <b>prospectus,</b> i. e. the time period in which the <b>prospectus</b> is valid. The <b>prospectus</b> shall be valid for 12 months after its publication {{for the purposes of the}} offers of securities to the public or the admission to a regulated market, under the condition that the information in the <b>prospectus,</b> where appropriate, updated by a supplement to the <b>prospectus,</b> containing the latest information on the issuer and securities which shall be offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. The paper is particularly focused on the difference between the time of the validity of the <b>prospectus</b> and the period of the validity of public offering of securities. The time for which the <b>prospectus</b> is valid (validity) is an issue which is connected to the obligation to update and supplement the <b>prospectus</b> as well as to the ad hoc obligation to inform the public in the capital market. An obligation to supplement (to update and/or to correct). i. e. to create a supplement to the <b>prospectus</b> exists from the moment the <b>prospectus</b> is approved until the end of the public offering or until the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. An obligation to update and correct the <b>prospectus</b> indicates and obligation to include completely new relevant information in the supplement of the <b>prospectus</b> or to correct the relevant irregularities or incompleteness of information contained in the <b>prospectus</b> with regard the issuer and securities which are to be offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF, as long as those facts might be of relevance for the investment decision...|$|R

25|$|Following the Scottish Reformation in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but {{in other}} respects was largely {{resistant}} to change. George Keith, the fifth Earl Marischal was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of Peter Ramus. In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, Marischal College. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby Fraserburgh by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University <b>prospectuses</b> observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge).|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the <b>prospectuses</b> written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
25|$|This was the fiscally sound, {{but still}} burdened, Reading Railroad whose {{presidency}} Gowen assumed in 1869. Instead of gleaning insight from the railroad's successful struggle to bring its overhead under control, {{he turned the}} enterprise in the following decade into a mysteriously accounted borrowing machine. In 1874, a former Gowen friend turned enemy by Gowen's organization of the anthracite industry, accused Gowen in print of dishonest and misleading financial representations in the Reading's annual report and its <b>prospectuses.</b> Though Gowen was able to easily slough off such accusation at that time, it was renewed more powerfully in 1876 by Charles E. Smith—Gowen's direct predecessor as president, who had recommended the young man for the position in his absence. Even following Gowen's election to the post in his own right, Smith had remained on the corporation's Board of Managers. After hearing from Gowen of a US$7 million floating debt {{that had never been}} discussed in any board meetings, Smith inspected the unpublished books of the subsidiary Coal & Iron Co., which issued no annual report of its own. He found that the parent corporation's floating debt was being transferred to the subsidiary before the parent's fiscal year end in November, to avoid appearing in year-end statements; only to be shifted back to the parent prior to the subsidiary's own fiscal year end in December, thus effectively masking the joint enterprise's precarious condition overall. Smith raised the issue to the Reading's principal source of funds, the McCalmont Brothers investment banking firm in London, seeking Gowen's ouster, but was rebuffed. Though Gowen remained as president, and Smith resigned from the board, the incident forced Gowen's 1876 annual report to approximate frankness. It indicated the corporation's funded debt as US$65 million, resulting in US$5.5 million annually in carrying charges, compared to just over US$3 million in earnings for the railroad and a US$600,000 loss for the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E

2500|$|While {{corporate}} governance primarily concerns the general relative {{rights and duties}} of shareholders, employees and directors in terms of administration and accountability, corporate finance concerns how the monetary or capital stake of shareholders and creditors are mediated, given {{the risk that the}} business may fail and become insolvent. Companies can fund their operations either through debt (i.e. loans) or equity (i.e. shares). In return for loans, typically from a bank, companies will often be required by contract to give their creditors a security interest over the company's assets, so that in the event of insolvency, the creditor may take the secured asset. The Insolvency Act 1986 limits powerful creditors ability to sweep up all company assets as security, particularly through a floating charge, in favour of vulnerable creditors, such as employees or consumers. If money is raised by offering shares, the shareholders' relations are determined as a group by the provisions under the constitution. The law requires disclosure of all material facts in promotions, and <b>prospectuses.</b> Company constitutions typically require that existing shareholders have a pre-emption right, to buy newly issued shares before outside shareholders and thus avoid their stake and control becoming diluted. Actual rights, however, are determined by ordinary principles of construction of the company constitution. A host of rules exist to ensure that the company's capital (i.e. the amount that shareholders paid in when they bought their shares) is maintained for the benefit of creditors. Money is typically distributed to shareholders through dividends as the reward for investment. These should only come out of profits, or surpluses beyond the capital account. If companies pay out money to shareholders which in effect is a dividend [...] "disguised" [...] as something else, directors will be liable for repayment. Companies may, however, reduce their capital to a lower figure if directors of private companies warrant solvency, or courts approve a public company's reduction. Because a company buying back shares from shareholders in itself, or taking back redeemable shares, has the same effect as a reduction of capital, similar transparency and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled. Public companies are also precluded from giving financial assistance for purchase of their shares, for example through a leveraged buyout, unless the company is delisted and or taken private. Finally, in order to protect investors from being placed at an unfair disadvantage, people inside a company are under a strict duty to not trade on any information that could affect a company's share price for their own benefit.|$|E
