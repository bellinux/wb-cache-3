40|$|Zn-Al alloys {{are mainly}} used {{due to their}} high {{tribological}} and damping properties. A very important issue is determination of the hardness of <b>the</b> phases <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zn-Al-Cu alloys. Unfortunately, in literature there is lack of studies on the hardness of <b>the</b> phases <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alloys Zn-Al-Cu. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine the hardness of <b>the</b> phases <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ZnAl 22 Cu 3 Si and ZnAl 40 Cu 3 Si alloys. The scope of the research included examination of the structure, chemical composition of selected micro-regions and hardness of phases <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> examined alloys. The research carried out has shown, that CuZn 4 phase is characterized by a similar hardness as the hardness of the interdendritic areas. <b>The</b> phases <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure of ZnAl 40 Cu 3 and ZnAl 22 Cu 3 alloys after soaking at the temperature of 185 °C are characterized by lower hardness than <b>the</b> phase <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure of the as-cast alloys...|$|R
