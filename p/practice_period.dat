5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b> Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E

Sōji-ji {{was the other}} main Soto temple of Japan, and again Suzuki underwent the harsh tangaryo initiation. Sojiji was founded by the great Zen master Keizan and had a more relaxed atmosphere than Eihei-ji. At Sōji-ji Suzuki travelled back to Zoun-in frequently to attend to his temple.|$|E

25|$|The name {{suspended}} {{derives from}} an early polyphonic technique developed during the common <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or suspended by extending {{the duration of the}} previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the third in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called added ninth and added eleventh chords instead.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} task for educators is to balance, integrate and optimise courses in both nursing and medical science {{in order to}} accomplish a holistic competence.

The Diploma of Actuary is given by the Actuaries Union of Greece, after successful exams within the Union.

25|$|The major time {{divisions}} {{of classical music}} up to 1900 are the early music period, which includes Medieval (500–1400) and Renaissance (1400–1600) eras, and the Common <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1730–1820) and Romantic (1780–1910) eras. Since 1900, classical periods have been reckoned more by calendar century than by particular stylistic movements that have become fragmented and difficult to define. The 20th century calendar period (1901–2000) includes most of the early modern musical era (1890–1930), the entire high modern (mid 20th-century), and the first 25 years of the contemporary (1945 or 1975–current) or postmodern musical era (1930–current).

Using a lifecycle simulation model, we show that even though deficit policies shift sizable tax burdens to future generations, individuals live long enough to make the assumption of an infinite horizon a good approximation for analyzing the short-run savings effects. In <b>practice,</b> <b>periods</b> of debt accumulation such as that in the United States during World War II are reversed sufficiently rapidly to make their short-run effects on consumption and national savings relatively small. ...|$|R

It is important to observe, however, that the first explanation of this practice is in the context of an essay about vocal expression and intelligibility.

2500|$|Encompassing a {{wide variety}} of post-Romantic styles {{composed}} through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. Modernism (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and serial music. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 1930. Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the [...] "contemporary music" [...] composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{popular and}} jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and {{characters}} indicating their qualities. For example, a lead sheet may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. [...] In {{many types of}} music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with [...] "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval {{in relation to the}} bass. Typically, in the classical common <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> a dissonant chord (chord with tension) [...] "resolves" [...] to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between [...] "tense" [...] and [...] "relaxed" [...] moments.|$|E

A number of studies, however, have demonstrated that students, having acquired positive attitudes towards such methods during their training, turn to more traditional teaching quite soon after becoming certificated teachers.
