40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to design and 3 D print a {{lightweight}} protective structure of a robotic vehicle structure. Lightweight structure design is a prevalent technology considered by aerospace and automotive engineers that carries challenges associated with protection capabilities under impact. The design problem to be addressed is the optimal structural layout that preserves the mechanical integrity of the structure subjected to external loading using the minimum amount of material. Our work addresses this problem using three-dimensional structural topology optimization. The use of topology optimization allows the designer to synthesize a concept structure by distributing a given amount of material within a volume, {{referred to as the}} design domain. The design domain does not include any predetermined structural feature, allowing topology optimization synthesizing innovative, non-conversional designs. In our work, the concept structural design is refined using computer-aided design tools and 3 D printed. The final 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>component</b> is tested and assembled to the robotic device. This technology involving three-dimensional topology optimization and 3 D printing {{can be applied to the}} design of innovative structures in micromechanical applications and extended to the aerospace and automotive industries...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} copyright’s applicability to 3 D printing technology, {{by analyzing the}} facts surrounding the (formerly) proposed development of a fully 3 D printable firearm. Critical to this analysis however, is {{an understanding of how}} copyright has traditionally protected intellectual property, and why 3 D printers do not fit into this conventional framework. As 3 D printing is advancing at an extraordinarily rapid rate, any discussion of this topic would be incomplete without reference to the “moving target” that is 3 D printing technology. In the short time between when this article was initially submitted for evaluation to the PIPSELF Law Forum in December 2012, and when it will be published in May 2013, many new uses for 3 D printing have already been demonstrated, and indeed some of the issues discussed in this article have already become outdated, all within a six month timespan. This article discusses at length, the efforts of the Defense Distributed project to develop a 3 D printable firearm. When the article was originally submitted in 2012, Defense Distributed had already managed to prove the feasibility of using 3 D printed firearms components, but the gun utilizing the <b>printed</b> <b>component</b> promptly broke apart after only successfully firing 6 shots. However, in February 2013, Defense Distributed released a new video, demonstrating a redesigned 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>component</b> that was successfully used to fire over 600 rounds without a structural failure. Other recent developments in 3 D printing include a company whose goal is to produce 3 D printable cultured leather and edible meat products. Finally, in January 2013, the organization Public Knowledge released a whitepaper entitled “What 2 ̆ 7 s the Deal with Copyright and 3 D Printing?” written by Michael Weinberg. As both the whitepaper and this article discuss the same basic principles, but do so by analyzing slightly different areas of the law, I view the whitepaper as a companion piece to this article. UPDATE (5 / 5 / 13) : Defense Distributed has completed (and successfully test fired) the world’s first entirely 3 D printed pistol. UPDATE (5 / 10 / 13) : In the timespan of a single week after the release of the first 3 D printed pistol, the U. S. State Department has initiated procedures to force Defense Distributed to remove all its 3 D printable gun components from the Internet, with the State Department claiming it needs to review the files for compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Further there are other measures being proposed by Congressman Steve Israel to outright ban 3 D printed guns. However, considering that the 3 D printable pistol was already downloaded over 100, 000 times before the recent ITAR action, {{and the fact that the}} inherent design of the Internet means that many websites are foreign based, and therefore entirely outside the jurisdiction of the U. S., it appears to be an increasingly futile effort to force “removal” of these files from the Web. These files are still widely available on the Internet, and likely will continue to remain so, as websites like The Pirate Bay will continue to host 2 ̆ 6 distribute 3 D firearm files, regardless of any laws passed or litigation filed attempting to compel their removal...|$|E

40|$|Design {{scalability}} is {{a technique}} used in routine design and manufacturing to adapt existing design knowledge to varying requirements. Guidelines exist for design scalability for subtractive manufacturing but there is much less support for components produced through additive manufacturing process.

The objective of the investigation described in this paper is to evaluate the effect of using design scalability technique for the 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> with a focus on mechanical properties of the design. This is done through identifying and aggregating a list of comprehensive process parameters from research and available 3 D printing machines, and then developing a standard based Taguchi’s design of experiment to analyse the effect of these parameters, including scalability on the mechanical properties of an ISO compliant test sample for ultimate tensile stress and Elastic Modulus.

40|$|Abstract As use {{of printed}} {{electronics}} is going towards expansion in near future, researchers are studying methods {{for development of}} <b>printed</b> <b>components,</b> and also procedures for driving them. Few low speed but low cost, and flexible stand alone systems e. g., some sensor systems and displays; have already {{made their way to}} market after competing conventional, high speed, high cost, and rigid silicon electronics. At present, there are different type of printed sensors and display matrices, which have been developed but not being used in stand alone systems. Thus, there was a need for demonstrating ‘developed printed electronic components’ in such a way, that they are integrated with other core electronic circuits like embedded systems, to assure their ability to replace individual conventional component. In the thesis, some experiments were conducted to drive <b>printed</b> electronic <b>components</b> while overlooking their manufacturing details; i. e., the circuit used to drive the <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> was not a part of printed technology (e. g., printed processing, memory units), rather a conventional system (e. g., microcontroller and microprocessor boards available in market) is used. Particularly for this project the <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> are meant to be capacitive sensor matrix, resistive touch screen, organic light emitting diodes (OLED) matrix, electrophoretic display matrix, and electrochromic display matrix. These components were interfaced using embedded system {{in such a way that}} they can be driven meaningfully e. g., resistive touch screen can control display option for OLED matrix. Embedded Linux has significant advantages over previously used OS and non-OS based solutions as it is robust, scalable, and manage resources efficiently. Such a system with backbone of Linux processing was a part of design, which handled a separately designed interface board capable of interfacing 13 capacitive sensor (maximum 8 pF) inputs, a four wire resistive touch screen (with few hundred ohm resistance between terminals), a current driver with 50 mA segment current for 10 x 10 display matrix and voltage range from 0 to 5 V, voltage driver for two led segments capable of dissipate 40 mA at 5 V, finally a voltage driver for separate 10 led segments capable of dissipating 40 mA from 0 to 15 V or a 10 x 10 display matrix with power rating of maximum 16. 9 mA at 0 to 15 V. So, in this way different displays or individual led segments can be interfaced with a system which can download their display configuration from HTTP client based user interface, and upload the capacitive sensor and resistive touch screen readings back to user. The device was capable of changing demonstration parameters e. g., blinking, animation for displays via user interface, and program structure was kept convertible so that minor changes can create completely new demonstration: interfacing different components. Design included a power board capable of providing stable 1 A supply current at 5 V. A Current-Voltage (I-V) characterizing board was part of design which can measure I-V curve of printed solar cells. <b>Printed</b> electronic <b>components</b> were interfaced with embedded systems without much problem, making one comfortable in conclusion that these individual components are ready to replace conventional components in non-standalone systems at-least...|$|R
50|$|Many printers, {{originally}} those {{influenced by}} the RepRap project, make extensive use of 3D <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> in their own construction. These are typically printed connector blocks {{with a variety of}} angled holes, joined by cheap steel threaded rod. This makes a construction that is cheap and easy to assemble, easily allows non-perpendicular framing joints, but does require access to a 3D printer. The notion of 'bootstrapping' 3D printers like this has been something of a dogmatic theme within the RepRap designs. The lack of stiffness in the rod also requires either triangulation, or gives the risk of a gantry structure that flexes and vibrates in service, reducing print quality.|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} is {{a rapidly}} expanding technology. It allows {{the creation of}} very complex 3 D objects by adding layers of material, {{in spite of the}} traditional production systems based on the removal of material. The development of additive technology has produced initially a generation of additive manufacturing techniques restricted to industrial applications, but their extraordinary degree of innovation has allowed the spreading of household systems. Nowadays, the most common domestic systems produce 3 D parts through a fused deposition modeling process. Such systems have low productivity and make, usually, objects with no high accuracy and with unreliable mechanical properties. These side effects can depend on the process parameters. Aim of this work is to study the influence of some typical parameters of the additive manufacturing process on the prototypes characteristics. In particular, it has been studied the influence of the layer thickness on the shape and dimensional accuracy. Cylindrical specimens have been created with a 3 D printer, the Da Vinci 1. 0 A by XYZprinting, using ABS filaments. Dimensional and shape inspection of the <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> has been performed following a typical reverse engineering approach. In particular, the point clouds of the surfaces of the different specimens have been acquired through a 3 D laser scanner. After, the acquired point clouds have been post-processed, converted into 3 D models and analysed to detect any shape or dimensional difference from the initial CAD models. The obtained results may constitute a useful guideline to choose the best set of the process parameters to obtain <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> of good quality in a reasonable time and minimizing the waste of material...|$|R
