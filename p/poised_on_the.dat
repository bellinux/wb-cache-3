Some guerrillas emerged from nearby Lima Site bases to cut Route 7; failing that, they settled for sniping at enemy resupply.

25|$|Underneath the bay on the {{far left}} is the bronze statue of Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini. It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the Medusa's severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands <b>poised</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right leg. Perseus is {{reflecting}} and he seems to be frightened by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing Perseus freeing Andromeda, is a copy of the one in Bargello.|$|E
25|$|General Vang Pao {{now found}} himself in a {{strategic}} dilemma. Although his Operation Barrel Roll tactical air allotment had been temporarily increased to 60 daily sorties to support his operation, he knew Vietnamization would slash that quota on 1 July. The U.S. belief that Operation Lam Son 719 was best followed by ongoing interdiction strikes further cut his close air support. His American backers were urging him to go on the defensive as a means of aiding peace negotiations to end the Laotian Civil War. Yet the North Vietnamese were <b>poised</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink of victory; they had at least two more months dry weather for staging their attacks on Long Tieng, and they held the entire Plain of Jars for a staging area. To survive, the Hmong guerrillas had to at least wage limited spoiling offensives. Not only that, the Hmong Council of Elders had to be reassured that he was still fighting, lest the Elders provoke a migration of the community away from the war.|$|E
25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency {{established}} a secret guerrilla {{army in the}} Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought {{to hold on to}} their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos. After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) beat him to it with Campaign Thoan Thang. After the Vietnamese campaign ran its course, Vang Pao launched yet another inconclusive offensive that failed to clear the foe from the Plain of Jars, Operation Off Balance. By 28 June 1969, the PAVN had 60 tanks deployed. Additionally, there were seven new Vietnamese infantry battalions <b>poised</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plain, while the Royalist remained unreinforced. The PAVN now had a total of 26 battalions in the Plain of Jars area, seemingly poised for a further wet season offensive.|$|E

He was the head coach for Young Lions from 2009 to 2010, and Tanjong Pagar United from 2011 to 2012.|$|R
60|$|I recall {{something}} of one talk under the overhanging bushes of <b>the</b> shrubbery--I <b>on</b> <b>the</b> park {{side of the}} stone wall, and the lady of my worship a little inelegantly astride thereon. Inelegantly do I say? {{you should have seen}} the sweet imp as I remember her. Just her <b>poise</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall comes suddenly clear before me, and behind her the light various branches of the bushes of the shrubbery that my feet might not profane, and far away and high behind her, dim and stately, the cornice of the great facade of Bladesover rose against the dappled sky. Our talk must have been serious and business-like, for we were discussing my social position.|$|R

Along came my poet, hurrying, hatted, haired, emitting dactyls, spondees and dactylis. I seized him.|$|R
500|$|Following {{a string}} of roles in {{successful}} films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established {{a reputation as a}} top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each performance. His film appearances were likened by David Kamp of GQ to [...] "discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend".

2500|$|The game {{remained}} evenly <b>poised</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third day, {{but with}} Sussex {{slightly in the}} lead, with rain predicted for the fourth. Sussex took their score on to 312, thereby setting a target of 285. Hampshire were on 89 for 3 {{at the end of}} day three. With rain predicted on the fourth day, the game could have gone any one of four ways. Kevin Pietersen (61), assisted by Sean Ervine (57), took the challenge to Sussex - and the game was always in the balance. When the eighth wicket fell, the score was on 256 for 8. And with 29 required off 34 balls, the game looked set for one of those exciting finishes that only the longer form of the game can provide. Disappointingly for the crowd, Hampshire captain Shane Warne ordered his batsmen to shut up shop. Sussex were unable to take the final two wickets, and on 267 for 8, the game was drawn. Hampshire finished the day second behind Warwickshire, but the ten points given up here had crucial repercussions later on in the season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} year 1980 saw the U.S. punk rock movement hitting a peak in popularity. With Damaged and their growing {{reputation as an}} impressive live band, Black Flag seemed <b>poised</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cusp of a commercial breakthrough. The record was to be distributed by now-defunct Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of MCA. Trouble began when MCA refused to handle Damaged after MCA executive Al Bergamo determined the album was an [...] "Anti-Parent" [...] record. However, according to longtime SST employee Joe Carducci the [...] "Anti-Parent" [...] statement was not {{the real reason for}} MCA's refusing to distribute Damaged; Carducci reported that Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA stood to lose money by distributing the album, regardless of its content. This {{was the beginning of a}} legal dispute that would, for several years, disallow Black Flag from using their own name on any record after Damaged was released on SST Records and a copy of the [...] "Anti-Parent" [...] statement was placed on the album's cover.|$|E

50|$|During this era, the {{development}} of pointework, although still at a fairly basic stage, profoundly affected people's perception of the ballerina.

When he had related this, with an emphasis and <b>poise</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> word, 'assassin,' peculiarly belonging to his own language, and which did not serve to render it less terrible to Clennam, he suddenly sprang to his feet, pounced upon the bill again, and with a vehemence that would have been absolute madness in any man of Northern origin, cried 'Behold the same assassin!

2500|$|Purdue's Golden Girl {{ranks among}} the nation's best twirlers and {{is at the top}} of her art form. This talented {{performer}} is selected by audition each April, and serves as a leader of the AAMB as well as an ambassador for Purdue University. Recognized nationally for her unique talents, this coveted position has roots going back to the early history of Purdue Bands. The tradition of the Golden Girl was begun in 1954 during the era of quarterback Len Dawson, whose <b>poise</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field prompted the press to nickname him Purdue's [...] "Golden Boy." [...] At the same time, Dr. Al G. Wright (now Director of Bands Emeritus) brought his first twirling protégé to the field, Juanita Carpenter, who earned the title of [...] "Golden Girl." [...] When Dawson graduated Purdue was left without a Golden Boy, but Carpenter's graduation didn't have <b>the</b> same effect <b>on</b> her title. Instead Golden Girl evolved into a movable crown that's been passed down through generations, and the position has become the standard for excellence within the twirling community. Golden Girl #29 is Olivia Zugai, from Pittsburgh, PA.|$|R
