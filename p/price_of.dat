40|$|We {{consider}} a production economy where commodities are partitioned into K irreproducible factors and L reproducible goods, {{and the production}} technologies have constant returns to scale. We examine the geometry of the global production set {{in the space of}} commodities, and we derive theorems of non-substitution type. We define the "factors values" of the different goods, we use them to characterize the efficient production plans, and we investigate in detail the relations between the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> goods and the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> factors. We show that the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> factors uniquely determine the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> goods, and that, generically, equalising the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> 2 K goods equalises the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> factors.

40|$|This paper {{subjects}} to empirical testing the labour theory of value using input–output {{data from the}} economy of Japan for the years 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990. The results of the analysis show that labour values and <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production are extremely good approximations to market prices. In fact, the proximity <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production to market prices is closer than that of labour values, a result which suggests that <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production constitute more concrete centres of gravitation for market prices. Furthermore, we find that <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production change {{as a result of}} variations in income distribution more often than not in a monotonic way and that in fewer cases they display curvatures, which may even reverse the order between <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production and values. values, <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> production, income distribution, input–output tables, B 12, B 14, C 67, D 57,...|$|R
