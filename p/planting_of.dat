5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries a ferme ornée was established, with <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> various tress and the damming of streams to form ponds with paths and seating around them. Tenant farmers leased the {{majority}} of the land and during most of the 20th century it was used for dairy cattle, sheep and pigs. Much of the estate was sold in 1987 to the Avon Wildlife Trust who established their Folly Farm nature reserve on the site.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{a council}} {{gardening}} scheme created a horticultural landscape {{next to the}} southern end of the M32. The project included <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds.

The gardens were well-received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In a {{case study}} of the Los Angeles Basin, {{simulations}} showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and the <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E

5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E

5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E

He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 by publishing his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> the Christian Religion in this Island, which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy.

5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter <b>planting</b> <b>of</b> corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
