Some of Mahler's immediate musical successors included the composers of the Second Viennese School, notably Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten are among later 20th-century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler.

40|$|Small-scale fleets (SSF) are {{important}} components of many ICES fisheries and are receiving growing attention within the CFP-reform and Marine Spatial Planning initiatives. In {{order to assess}} the importance of SSF within Europe, 2015 ICES WGCATCH compiled descriptions and data (effort, catch and value) of SSF fishing in EU waters, using 2012 as reference year and categorizing fleets by vessel length. The compiled information covered 17 countries describing a range of scenarios, spanning from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean. The < 10 m and 10 – 12 m vessels were ranked highest in importance in nearly all countries in terms of number of vessels and employment. They were generally involved in multi-gear and multi-species fisheries developing seasonal or <b>part-time</b> <b>activities</b> into coastal areas with generally more sensitive habitats as nursery grounds or spawning aggregations. SSF were also found to be important for several fisheries in terms of effort, value and landings, and to represent a significant share of some TAC-quota or catches of regulated species, even though their landings may be under-reported. Group members also described the way SSF are sampled and estimated in their countries. The wide diversity in methodologies used to sample and estimate the impacts of SSF creates challenges to harmonize and standardize data quality indicators across European countries. We put forward some best practice guidelines for sampling SSF and show that these {{will have to be}} adapted at regional level in order to encompass existing variability at fleet and fisheries level...|$|R

50|$|The Industrial Revolution in the Sillon {{industriel}} embraced four industrial basins: Borinage, La Louvièrecalled Centre, Charleroi and Liège, and a semi-industrial basin in Namur.

40|$|Objectives: To analyse the {{interventions}} undertaken by Belgian hospitals during a pilot phase of supporting local antibiotic managers (AM) and multidisciplinary antibiotic management teams (AMT). Methods: In 2002 – 03, the Belgian government subsidised the <b>part-time</b> <b>activities</b> of AMs in 35 hospitals {{selected based on}} the presence of an operational AMT. The activities described in the first 8 -month progress reports were analysed according to national guidelines for AMTs. Material: The pilot hospitals had a median capacity of 654 (range, 154 – 1597) beds; 18 hospitals comprised several sites. Their regional distribution was representative of population size, with 18 hospitals located in Flanders, 11 in Wallonia and six in Brussels; 17 were general hospitals, eight teaching hospitals and 10 general hospitals with teaching beds. Results: AMs were trained as internists (28), microbiologists (13) and hospital pharmacists (13). In 18 hospitals the AM also served as infection-control physician. On average, AMTs included 10 members who met every 6 weeks. The pilot financing scheme allowed the implementation of 175 antibiotic management interventions, with a mean of five interventions per hospital. More interventions were launched in large size and teaching hospitals. All hospitals irrespective of size or affiliation had undertaken a wide range of measures: review of formulary (29), implementation of new clinical guidelines (24), restricted access to select antibiotics (25), improvement of susceptibility-testing methods (12), development of antibiotic consumption database (35) and analysis of antibacterial susceptibility data (31). Updated guidelines addressed mainly urinary tract infection (14), pneumonia (14) and meningitis (10) and indications for use of specific drugs (14). Use of glycopeptides, carbapenems, fluoro-quinolones, cefepime and ceftazidime was restricted in respectively 16, 12, 12, 12 and 10 hospitals. Conclusion: All hospitals that received financial incentive under the AMT pilot scheme have developed multiple antibiotic policy interventions independently of the hospital size and teaching status. Extension to all Belgian hospitals appears warranted. Further analysis is planned to monitor the impact of this scheme on the use of antibiotics and trends of antibiotic resistance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{opposition}} to the historiography which plots {{the rise of a}} historical profession in tum-of-the-century English Canada, this thesis argues that {{to think in terms of}} a rise from amateur history to professional history obscures more than it clarifies. Instead, it plots a different trajectory. Owing to the demands of an increasingly modern, urban and industrial society, intellectual life was transformed. In other words, one way of organizing intellectual life yielded to another way of organizing intellectual life. Whereas the nineteenth-century historian was a generalist for whom the study of the past was a <b>part-time</b> <b>activity,</b> the twentieth-century historian was a specialist for whom the study of the past was a full-time career. However, at the same time as there were changes in the practice of history, there were also important continuities. Against this backdrop, this thesis argues that while pre-professional historians could write hagiographic and patriotic books and articles, they also practised some of the techniques associated with professional history: archival research, historiography and the weighing of evidence. Moreover, women could be, and indeed were, historians when history was a <b>part-time</b> <b>activity.</b> Beginning with George Wrong's 1892 appointment to the University of Toronto, history began its migration into universities across English Canada. In addition, the Canadian Historical Review was launched in 1920; the Canadian Historical Association was founded in 1922; and graduate programmes were instituted. Historians also pursued a variety of professional strategies, including the drawing and policing of boundaries between who could and could not be a historical knower. Boundary-work was a gendered process. Whereas women were historians when history was understood as a past-time, they were excluded from the historical project when it was understood as a career. In this sense, the professionalization of history also saw its masculinization. Central to any professional project is the defence of independence. To study the defence of professional autonomy, this thesis examines the many relationships English-Canadian historians had with American philanthropy. In the absence of Canadian granting agencies, historians were forced to rely on American foundations for subventions to research and publication. Although the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Rockefeller Foundation had their own research objectives, at the end of the day English-Canadian historians successfully pursued their own research agendas. In the crisis of World War II and the Cold War, professional historians began to re-think the historical project. Abandoning history as a practical social science, they returned to an older notion of history as a humanity concerned with questions about human values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. Small-scale {{aquaculture}} {{is fundamental}} to the livelihoods {{of many of the}} rural poor in Asia and Africa. There is growing evidence that in many cases the poorer people have the greater dependence on aquatic resources, particularly low-value fish and non-fish aquatic resources. However, in spite of the benefits, the potential of aquaculture for rural development and food security is often overlooked by national authorities and international development agencies. The reasons include its often informal, small-scale nature and <b>part-time</b> <b>activity.</b> Limited availability of production, income and employment data exacerbate this underestimation. Taking examples from Bangladesh and Malawi, this paper examines the impact of aquaculture development on food security from the standpoint of its impact on employment, income and household consumption and nutrition. The analysis shows a positive impact of aquaculture development on employment, income and consumption. The paper concludes that it will pay-off if national policies in their medium to long-term plans are geared toward increasing the production of fish from aquaculture. Such policies will, however, need to concurrently address the food security and poverty issues more sharply than that has been done at present by increasing institutional and infrastructure support for diversification of production targeted to resource poor households...|$|E

40|$|Models of accrediting work-based {{learning}} are now commonplace in universities. The {{purpose of this}} viewpoint paper is to highlight an opportunity for universities to not only accredit students’ part-time work against the degree award, but also to extend the process into schools by accrediting the part-time work undertaken by year 12 and 13 students against their future degree studies. The operations and benefit of adopting such an approach {{from the perspective of}} all stakeholders is discussed. By accrediting year 12 and 13 students, and giving appropriate unit credit against the subsequent degree studies provides universities with enhanced relationships, potential student buy-in and thereby, may increase recruitment.
