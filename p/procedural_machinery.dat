In the context of Prolog and CLP-languages, however, most approaches to visualization aim at procedural aspects. Instead of explaining what a relation describes, visualization is used to animate <b>procedural</b> <b>machinery.</b> In this paper we present approaches to visualizing aspects of Prolog programs that try to avoid unnecessary and irritating procedural details. Answer substitutions are visualized with the help of so called viewers. Some procedural aspects are explained with animations. The viewers have been integrated into a side-e#ect free programming environment and are used in introductory Prolog and CLP courses. The didactical impact of our approaches is discussed. ...|$|E

A statement of fact is any statement in which an event is described as occurred in the domain of the real world. Statements concerning facts are a matter of choice and construction, but above all they can be proven to be true or false. The fact is not meaningful in itself, but only when it is bound up with a set of concepts, epistemological assumptions, linguistic conventions, shared values, general rules of experience, that gives it meaning. We deal with semantic, categorical, social or institutional constructions. Legal reasoning concerns both facts and norms. Their meaning is the result of their entering into a reciprocal correspondence. Reconstruction of facts and interpretation of law cannot be separated. In judicial contexts facts are the point of reference of a <b>procedural</b> <b>machinery</b> concerning evidence. Such facts are selected, determined and verified according to their relevancy in the case. A statement describing a fact is true when and insofar as it has been confirmed by the evidence presented to the court...|$|E
