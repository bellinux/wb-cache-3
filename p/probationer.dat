In January 1915, Smith signed up to the MMM, and in April went through the Minerval degree initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1. In May, he {{took part in the}} Lodge's public performance of the Rites of Isis, which it was hoped would attract further members. In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his A∴A∴ practices, and also began experimenting with the entheogenic properties of anhalonium. In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith. Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the <b>Probationer</b> level in the A∴A∴, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words Nubem Eripiam ("I will snatch away the cloud").|$|E
25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will run afoul of the double jeopardy clause if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a <b>probationer</b> of the court as a whole, and not that of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a <b>probationer,</b> to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not reviewable on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to abuse of discretion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{quality of}} life of <b>probationers</b> remains low when reestablishing life in society. Research has been {{conducted}} on how siblings can provide support to juveniles, yet minimal research supported how adult sibling relationships have affected <b>probationers</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{quality of life}}. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the phenomenon of the effect sibling relationships may have on <b>probationers</b> 2 ̆ 7 quality of life. Attachment theory was used as a theoretical framework to support the factors relating to sibling relationship types. This research study used a qualitative interview design in order to explore <b>probationers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perspective of their sibling relationship type and quality of life. The sample (N = 6) came from Transcendence Foundation, a facility providing support to <b>probationers</b> in the South Central Region of Minnesota. A thematic analysis was used to interpret the perceptions <b>probationers</b> have of their relationship with their sibling and how it affects their quality of life. Based on the results from past research studies and this research study, siblings with supportive, warm, and positive relationships reduce the negative aspects and feelings of <b>probationers.</b> The results of this study could potentially help <b>probationers</b> increase their quality of life through the development of interventions involving sibling support. A higher quality of life can create positive social change for <b>probationers</b> reentering into society by increasing their feelings of self-worth and reducing recidivism...|$|R

40|$|Within the United States, {{probation}} has customarily {{been used}} as a way to divert offenders away from prison. Over the past two decades the number of offenders who are sentenced to probation has increased tremendously. While there have been more offenders sentenced to probation, there has also been {{an increase in the number}} of <b>probationers</b> having that sentence revoked. The most prevalent type of revocation is a technical revocation. <b>Probationers</b> receive technical violations culminating in a revocation when they fail to satisfy the conditions of their probation sentence such as attending rehabilitative programming. The present study adds to the literature on technical revocations by examining characteristics of felony <b>probationers</b> from a large Southern state who were revoked between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Findings revealed that female <b>probationers,</b> older <b>probationers,</b> white <b>probationers,</b> and those <b>probationers</b> who had not completed high school were significantly more likely to be revoked for a technical revocation.

In addition, the typical university setting where nurses learned {{the work of the}} trade was not in existence back then. Instead, nurses learned the trade while working in the field. Another difference was that nursing students were called <b>probationers.</b> As <b>probationers,</b> they were required to follow the strict rules and regulations that were set forth by the institution. Additionally, <b>probationers</b> were required to follow all physicians’ orders without question and perform various household duties. After learning how to take orders, <b>probationers</b> were then sent to the operating room for a 6-week rotation.

25|$|Supervised {{release is}} {{recommended}} by the Guidelines for most offenders who are serving a prison sentence {{of more than a}} year. The court has power to supervise the conduct of the <b>probationer</b> not only during the period of probation but afterwards up to the time when the maximum sentence which could have been imposed would have expired. But the period of probation is not limited by the period of maximum sentence that might have been imposed. On the other hand, probation does not become a nullity if the period of probation was not specified in the sentence, since the probationary period is limited by the maximum term of the sentence.|$|E

Brought up in straitened circumstances, the boy was for five years (1830–5) a pupil and for four years (1835-9) a junior teacher at the Kingswood school for preachers' sons near Bristol. In 1839, he became assistant in the Rev. Firth's Academy, Hartstead Moor, near Leeds, and having made an unsuccessful effort to conduct a school of his own at Islington, London, he became in 1843 classical and mathematical master at John Conquest's school at Biggleswade.

25|$|The {{conditions}} of probation {{must be provided}} to the defendant {{in a written statement}} that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required. The District Court must state its reasons for imposing a term of supervised release where none is required by statute; appellate courts deem it inappropriate to assume that the sentencing court's reason for imposing a prison term likewise extends to its decision regarding supervised release. The conditions for probation must be reasonably related to the purposes of the Federal Probation Act, and the purposes sought to be served by probation (including rehabilitation of the <b>probationer),</b> the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement are factors considered in determining whether a reasonable relationship exists. The trial court is given wide discretion in establishing {{conditions of}} probation, and the order of the district judge providing for probation will be overturned only if it is abuse of discretion.|$|E

In another case, Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans (1982), a chief constable required a police <b>probationer</b> to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in Surinder Singh Kanda v.

500|$|Walton {{was born}} into a musical family in Oldham, Lancashire, the second son in a family of three boys and a girl. His father, Charles Alexander Walton, was a {{musician}} who had trained at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Charles Hallé, and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist. Charles's wife, Louisa Maria (née Turner), had been a singer before their marriage. William Walton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy, and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer: he and his elder brother sang in their father's choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn and others. Walton was sent to a local school, but in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for <b>probationer</b> choristers at Christ Church Cathedral School in Oxford and applied for William to be admitted. The boy and his mother missed their intended train from Manchester to Oxford because Walton's father had spent the money for the fare in a local public house. Louisa Walton had to borrow the fares from a greengrocer. Although they arrived in Oxford after the entrance trials were over, Mrs Walton successfully pleaded for her son to be heard, and he was accepted. He remained at the choir school for the next six years. The Dean of Christ Church, Dr Thomas Strong, noted the young Walton's musical potential and was encouraged in this view by Sir Hubert Parry, who saw the manuscripts of some of Walton's early compositions and said to Strong, [...] "There's a lot in this chap; you must keep your eye on him." ...|$|E
