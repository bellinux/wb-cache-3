Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0â€“4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin.

Reasonable conversions were obtained above 450 K. Both H-[Fe]ZSM- 5 and H-[Al]ZSM- 5 showed high activities at 450 K, with selectivities to <b>propyl</b> <b>acetates</b> of ~ 90 % using a propene:acetic acid ratio of 2 and ketones formed by dehydration of the acetates making {{up most of the}} remaining products. The reaction rate was completely stable at 450 K for at least 20 h, and the product distribution was insensitive to the reactant feed ratio for a propene:acetic acid ratio above 2. On H-[Fe]ZSM- 5, dehydration of the acetates became increasingly important at higher temperatures, with the selectivity to ketones approaching 80 % at 525 K. At still higher temperatures, reaction pathways that did not involve <b>propyl</b> <b>acetates</b> became important. The high selectivity for forming <b>propyl</b> <b>acetates</b> and the absence of olefin oligomerization is believed to result from having the acid sites occupied (saturated) by acetic acid.

Potential health and environmental problems resulting from their emission prompted the requirement for monitoring these species. It motivates development of new measurement techniques which are fast, cost effective, reliable and field deployable. One of novel approaches is ion mobility spectrometry. It dwells on ion separation in electric field, based on differences in ion mobility. Many variants of this method are developed. In this wok, differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS) was considered in respect of acetate measurements in air. It was demonstrated that DMS offers linear response to methyl, ethyl, <b>propyl</b> and butyl <b>acetate</b> in concentration range from 0. 3 ppm to 7 ppm.

Here, we {{examined the effects of}} various anions on solubilization of aromatic compounds and reduced lysozyme and on refolding of the lysozyme. All arginine salts tested increased the solubility of <b>propyl</b> gallate with <b>acetate</b> much more effectively than chloride. The effects of arginine salts were compared with those of sodium or guanidine salts, indicating that the ability of anions to modulate the propyl gallate solubility is independent of the cation. Comparison of transfer free energy of propyl gallate between sodium and arginine salts indicates that the interaction of propyl gallate is more favorable with arginine than sodium. On the contrary, the solubility of aromatic amino acids is only slightly modulated by anions, implying that there is specific interaction between acetic acid and propyl gallate. Unlike their effects on the solubility of small aromatic compounds, the solubility of reduced lysozyme was much higher in arginine chloride than in arginine acetate or sulfate. Consistent with high solubility, refolding of reduced lysozyme was most effective in arginine chloride. These results suggest potential broader applications of arginine modulated by different anions...|$|R

In order to represent the overall production in the target area, the investigation included 42 apples varieties consisting of ancient, non-native and new hybrid cultivars grown in Friuli Venezia Giulia and Alto Adige-South Tyrol, respectively. Moreover, apple samples from both conventional and organic agricultural practices were considered. Overall 118 volatile compounds were identified in the samples and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify apples based on their different geographical origin or growing conditions. Models highlighted good classification results both in calibration (over 91 %) and cross-validation (over 87 %), enabling to obtain a good separation between apple categories with high prediction accuracy (over 90 %). In addition, the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores of the PLS-DA models were calculated, allowing to identify a reduced number of volatiles (e. g., ethanol, ethyl <b>acetate,</b> isobutyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>propyl</b> propanoate, 1 -hexanol, D-limonene, (Z) - 2 -hexen- 1 -ol acetate and others) which are relevant for the discrimination of different apple groups.

The particles obtained were of 1. 58 Â± 0. 62 Î¼m size with a charge of 12. 48 Â± 2. 32 mV. The vaccine efficacy was evaluated by administering the particles via oral route to C 57 BL/ 6 female mice. At the end of vaccination, mice were challenged with live tumor cells. Vaccinated mice showed significant (around six-fold) retardation of tumor volume in comparison to non-vaccinated animals for 3 weeks after the tumor challenge (p 3 Ì†c 0. 001).

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the gas phase oxidation of the lower aliphatic esters and of propane. The kinetics of the oxidation of methyl, ethyl, and <b>propyl</b> formate, methyl <b>acetate,</b> methyl propionate and methyl butyrate were determined at various temperatures from 280 Â° to 450 Â°C. The experiments were made in a silica reaction vessel and the pressure changes accompanying oxidation were followed on a mercury manometer. The pressure-time curves usually showed an induction period after which the rate of change of pressure in the reaction vessel increased up to a maximum. Two temperature ranges of reactivity were observed with ethyl and propyl formate, methyl butyrate and propane. The rate of oxidation increased smoothly with increasing temperature up to about 350 Ã‚Â°C. Between 350 Ã‚Â° and 400 Â°C. the rate decreased rapidly with an increase in temperature. Above 400 Ã‚Â°C. the rate increased continuously until ignition occurred. At all temperatures, an increase in the initial concentration of the combustible material increased the rate of oxidation and decreased the induction period. In the high temperature region an increase in the oxygen concentration similarly increased the rate of oxidation. In the low temperature region the rate of oxidation was independent of the oxygen concentration. Except at very low partial pressures of oxygen the induction period was independent of ths oxygan concentration in both the low and high temperature regions. A mass spectrometer was used to analyse the combustion gases for the unchanged ester (or propane), for residual oxygen, and for the amount of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formed. At all temperatures the concentrations of the major constituents were directly proportional to the pressure changes measured in the reaction vessel. Sufficient experiments were made to establish the pressure measurements as a true measure of the oxidation process. Chemical and polarographic analyses were made for formaldehyde, aoetaldehyde, total acid and peroxide substances. In each case the concentration of the intermediate species passed through a maximum as the reaction went to completion. No significant oxidation was detected during the induction period. The outstanding feature of the general kinetics of the esters was the marked dependence of the rate of oxidation, in the low temperature region, on the molecular structure of the combustible material. An increase in the carbon chain length increased the rate of oxidation much more than would have been expected from tue normal organic chemistry of a homologous series. The effect was most pronounced between the esters of higher molecular weight. An increase in the carbon chain length on the ethereal side of the ester configuration had a much greater effect than a corresponding increase on the carbonyl side. Where only methyl groups, and no metnylene groups occurred, the ease of oxidation wae greatly reduced. The kinetic results are interpreted in terms of a series of reaction steps analogous to those proposed by Cullis and Hinshelwood for paraffin oxidation. The scheme postulates the formation of peroxide substances capable, in the low temperature region, of decomposition and the propogation of a branching chain reaction. The rate expression for the oxidation reaction is of the form f([O 2], [RH]) l - 2 kF The remarkable effects of the substituent groups are attributed largely to the effect of the structural changes on the rate of decomposition, k, of the peroxide species. The theories of Walsh and Norrish are discussed in relation to the experimental evidence of the present investigation. The analytical investigation of the cool flame mixtures of propane indicated that the products of cool flame combustion are very similar to those detected in the low temperature region of oxidation. The changes in the concentrations of the initial reagents and final products followed the same pattern as that observed at lower temperatures. The polarograme of the combustion samples collected immediately before, and after, the occurrence of a cool flame, showed a marked decrease in the concentration of peroxide material with the explosion. The analyses support the theory of Hardwell and Hinshelwood, that oool flakes result from the self-heating of the gas mixture by the thermal decomposition of the peroxide intermediates. The general scheme proposed is R- + 0 2 = R 00 - R 00 - + RH = R 00 H + R- R 00 H = R 0 - + - 0 H where the temperature coefficient of the rate of decomposition of the peroxide is greater than that of the rate of formation. If the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic, under appropriate conditions of concentration and reaction temperature, self-heating would be expected, and the rate would increase rapidly until the peroxide substances are largely consumed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Apple aroma is {{a complex}} of {{volatile}} compounds produced by fruit. It {{is one of the}} most important quality factors giving a characteristic flavour to fruit and its products. The present study investigated the effect of short-term hypoxic concentrations and duration of CO 2 and/or N 2 treatments at 20 Â°C on changes in production of important aroma volatile compounds after treatment during shelf-life conditions at 20 Â°C and 70 % RH, in some commercial apple cultivars at harvest and following storage in air or controlled-atmospheres (CA). Different methods of extracting and analysing aroma volatiles from apples were compared in order to optimise a process for subsequent experiments. Juice from homogenised apple fruit could be held in an ice bath for up to 60 minutes after homogenisation without loss of major volatile compounds. Octyl acetate concentrations between 50 and 5000 ppm in the final concentrated sample was a suitable internal standard for GLC analysis; as an external standard, a mixture of authentic volatile compounds of known concentration provided accurate quantification of aroma volatiles from juice samples. Volatiles were obtained from apple juice either by a dynamic headspace (purge and trap) technique using a TenaxÂ® trap or by direct extraction with a diethyl ether:n-pentane (2 : 1, v/v) mixture. The solvent extraction technique was simpler and faster than the purge and trap method, taking 5 seconds rather than 1 hour; it was also more efficient, resulting in 1. 7 fold more total volatiles with better reproducibility. Application of hypoxic gas atmosphere to apples (100 % CO 2, 100 % N 2 or < 2. 5 % O 2) demonstrated consistently enhanced headspace acetaldehyde, ethanol and ethyl acetate in 'Granny Smith', 'Braeburn' and 'Red Delicious' cultivars. A marked increased production of ethanol in response to hypoxic treatments was always followed by a several fold enhancement in both number and concentration of ethyl esters, including the aroma-impact volatiles ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2 -methyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate in juice from all cultivars. The increased concentration of these compounds was accompanied by decreased production of other esters requiring the same acyl group for their synthesis, such as <b>propyl</b> butanoate, butyl <b>acetate</b> and hexyl acetate, and some alcohols and aldehydes, including hexan- 1 -ol, 2 / 3 -methyl butan- 1 -ol and trans- 2 -hexenal. These results confirmed the hypothesis of the competitive nature of the acyl esterifying system in apples. Exposing apples to 100 % CO 2 for 18 - 24 hours at 20 Â°C achieved optimum enhancement; a longer time (48 hours) did not further increase important aroma-impact ethyl esters but caused a marked reduction in non-ethyl esters, while a shorter period of exposure (6 - 12 hours) had minimal effect. Apples previously stored (0 Â°C) for 6 months or longer before exposure to hypoxic treatments did not have important volatile ethyl esters enhanced. Application of 1000 ppm ethylene for 24 hours did not increase volatile production in apples compared with non-treated fruit. Poststorage production of most aroma volatile compounds from 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji' apples stored in a controlled-atmosphere (CA) of 2 % CO 2 + 2 % O 2 at 0. 5 Â°C was depressed after 10 - 14 weeks storage, although 2 -methyl butan- 1 -ol was enhanced and there was no effect on trans- 2 -hexenal. Poststorage treatment with 100 % CO 2 (24 hours at 20 Â°C) consistently and markedly enhanced headspace acetaldehyde, headspace ethanol, headspace ethyl acetate and aroma impact compounds, ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2 -methyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate in fruit from both refrigerated air (RA) and CA storage regimes. The hypoxic treatment had no effect on production of butan- 1 -ol and hexan- 1 -ol in CA, or hexanal in RA 'Granny Smith', propan- 1 -ol and butan- 1 -ol in either RA or CA, or hexanal and trans- 2 -hexenal in RA 'Fuji' apples. Hypoxic treatments reduced production of butyl and hexyl acetate in 'Fuji' apples, and 2 -methyl butan- 1 -ol in both cultivars. The ability to sustain enhanced production of ethyl esters in CO 2 treated RA or CA 'Granny Smith' or CA 'Fuji' apples decreased as time of storage progressed, probably due to shortage of acyl CoA substrates for volatile synthesis. CA retarded flesh softening and acid loss in both cultivars. Examination of volatile production from 6 commercial apple cultivars established that esters, alcohols and hydrocarbons accounted for 70 % - 88 % of the total number of volatiles found and compounds with straight chain and even numbered carbons predominated in the composition of esters and alcohols. Differences among apple cultivars were associated with number and concentration of volatile compounds produced. Treatment with 100 % CO 2 (24 hours at 20 Â°C) consistently enhanced production of headspace volatiles in all cultivars. Production of aroma impact ethyl esters following hypoxic treatments consistently occurred with 'Red Delicious', 'Braeburn', 'Granny Smith' and 'Pacific Rose', with less of a response in 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and none in 'Royal Gala' apples. Non ethyl esters and alcohols, other than ethanol and propan- 1 -ol, were reduced after CO 2 treatment in all cultivars, except for butan- 1 -ol in 'Cox's Orange Pippin' apples. Hexanal and trans- 2 -hexenal were either reduced or not affected following CO 2 treatment, depending on cultivar. The magnitude of enhancement and the degree of reduction in production of aroma volatile compounds following hypoxic treatment varied among cultivars; the higher the magnitude of enhancement of ethyl acetate, the greater the degree of reduction in other acetate esters, supporting the concept of a competitive interaction in the acyl esterification in apples. Hypoxic treatments consistently caused profound increases in aroma volatiles in most apples cultivars studied. Such a treatment has potential to increase the strength and value of commercially important flavour fractions in apple juice and aqueous essence and enhance aroma in fresh apples...|$|R

Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methodologies. In general, senescence led to a decrease in complexity of the aroma profile, but total area Counts increased compared with harvest levels. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that induced climacteric behavior in the NILs strongly affected the aroma profile during senescence. In senescent climacteric fruit, the relative contributions of acetate and non-acetate esters to the overall aroma profile increased in relation to harvest levels, particularly <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> isobutyl acetate, methyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, hexyl acetate and benzyl acetate. In the senescent non-climacteric NILs, 15 - 17 volatiles of the profile were undetectable. particularly some aldehydes, while other aldehydes Were reduced, esters did not change from harvest to senescence and sulfur-derived compounds increased. Methyl propanoate decreased with senescence irrespective of the climacteric behavior The climacteric senescent fruit of the NILs could be discriminated from the non-climacteric fruit by 11 compounds of the profile, mainly benzyl acetate, hexanal and pentanal among others (ethyl acetate, propan- 2 -yl acetate, nonanal, 2 -ethylhexan- 1 -ol, methyldisulfanyl-methane, acetone and 2 -ethylfuran). The grouping of senescent climacteric NILs was mainly attributable to high relative values of ethyl acetate, methyl butyrate and <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Finally, the physiological behavior of NILs also allowed to classify methyl propanoate, ethyl 2 -methylpropanoate, pentanal, acetone and 2 -ethylfuran as ethylene-independent aroma compounds while isobutyl acetate was classified as ethylene-dependent.

40|$|Volatile aroma-active esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf 1 p, Atf 2 p and Lg-Atf 1 p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF 1 and ATF 2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> isobutyl acetate, pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf 2 p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf 1 p. The atf 1 ? atf 2 ? double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p {{are responsible}} for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50 % of the wild-type strain), <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (50 %), and isobutyl acetate (40 %), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF 1 and ATF 2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes. 10 page(s...|$|E

It is found that the solubility of CO 2 in four mixed solvents follows the Henryâ€™s law and the linear compound has a greater ability to dissolve CO 2 than the cyclic compound at the same temperature. Furthermore, a modified equation is proposed to fit the solution data and a better equation is obtained in this paper. This will be useful for the future research in the screening of a potential physical solvent for CO 2 capture...|$|E

Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine and {{the rate of}} aqueous-phase hydrolysis of <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were used to identify and quantify BrÃ¸nsted acid sites associated with the Re component. Near ambient pressure XPS revealed a range of Re oxidation states on the Pt-Re catalysts after reduction in H 2 at 393 and 493 K, which accounts for the presence of BrÃ¸nsted acidity. A mechanism involving acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation was consistent with the negative influence of added base, a primary kinetic isotope effect with deuterated glycerol, an inverse isotope effect with dideuterium gas, and the observed orders of reaction...|$|E
40|$|RESTRITOThe main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the volatile compounds extracted from fermented grape musts by two extraction methods in order to characterize the samples. The purge and trap system provided the necessary sensitivity for the analysis of low-boiling point compounds, such as acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate, and the liquidâ€“liquid extraction method allowed for the analysis of a great number of medium to high boiling point volatile compounds, such as phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic and octanoic acids, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate. Ethyl propionate and <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> extracted by the liquidâ€“liquid method, characterized the sample of grape must fermented by Kloeckera apiculata. The sample of grape must fermented by Pichia membranaefaciens was characterized by 2 -propanol and 2 -hexanone, extracted by the purge and trap system and liquidâ€“liquid method, respectively. These results show that the purge and trap/dynamic headspace system and liquidâ€“liquid extraction method are complementary in the determination of the aroma profiles of fermented grape musts and characterization of the samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} analysis methodology {{adopted from}} reactive distillation {{is applied to}} membrane reactors. A model is formulated to depict the reactive liquid phase composition on the retentate side of a continuous type membrane reactor. The effects of both the chemical reaction kinetics and the membrane mass transfer kinetics on the feasible products are elucidated by means of retentate phase diagrams and bifurcation analysis. The proposed method {{can be applied to}} various membrane processes, independent of the specific structure of the membrane. Two quaternary reaction systems are considered to illustrate the methodology. In the first hypothetical system, it is shown how selective membranes can influence the sequence of effective volatilities which in turn affects the feasible products of the system. In the second example of practical importance, i. e. the heterogeneously catalysed synthesis of <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate</b> coupled with permeation through a porous polycarbonate membrane, the dusty gas model is applied to describe the component fluxes through the membrane. For the latter reaction system, the existence of reactive arheotrope is demonstrated. Arheotropes represent mass transfer controlled feasible products of membrane separation process...|$|E

The four multivariate calibration methods were Genetic Inverse Least Squares (GILS), Genetic Regression (GR), Principle Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Four different esterification reactions were investigated. These are methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and butyl acetate. The sample set contains 40 ternary mixtures of these esterification processes.

30|$|The {{production}} of aroma compounds by the microbial fermentation of whey was studied. Seven {{strains of the}} yeast Wickerhamomyces pijperi {{were used for the}} fermentation of glucose-added whey (whey-g). Twelve aroma compounds (isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, 2 -phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl benzoate) were identified in the fermented broth using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The major components were ethyl acetate (several tens to hundreds ppm), acetaldehyde (several tens ppm) and isoamyl alcohol (about 10 Â ppm). The strong fruity odor of ethyl benzoate (about 1 Â ppm) was detected in the broth of W. pijperi YIT 8095 and YIT 12779. The balance of aroma compounds produced was varied depending on the media used, and ethyl benzoate was only produced when using whey-g. The variation in the {{production of}} the aroma compounds over time using W. pijperi YIT 12779 at various culture temperatures (from 15 â€“ 30 Â°C) was also studied. From the results we propose that W. pijperi {{could be used as a}} novel microorganism for production of aroma compounds from whey.|$|E
40|$|Objective] The {{coupling}} {{of reaction}} and membrane separation brings several potential advantages as many applications {{have been reported}} in literature; but rare ones investigate the feasibility and synthesis of membrane reactors, i. e. to screen proper membranes and operating parameters for a target reaction. To develop a systematic methodology for membrane reactor synthesis, an approach adopted from distillation processes is generalized to be applicable for membrane separation processes. [New Results] 1. Retentate phase composition diagrams and bifurcation analysis are studied to evaluate the effects of membranes, catalyst concentration, operating pressure and temperature, etc. The reactive ternary mixtures in the ideal liquid phase, and the esterification reaction of <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate</b> coupled with permeation through porous polycarbonate membranes, are considered in detail as examples. 2. A new set of composition variables transforms the original model equations into an analogous form of open distillation, and leads to a hypothesis stating the explicit conditions for singular points in membrane processes which are termed as (reactive) arheotropes. [Significance] The vision of this work is to formulate a methodology such that the feasibility analysis and process synthesis of membrane reactors can be carried out directly based on the characterisation of the membranes...|$|E

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to isolate, identify, and to characterize, major {{volatile}} components of tomato fruit. Simultaneously, the confirmation was extended to the reported tomato volatiles. The volatile extracts from field- and artificially - ripe fruits were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The changes which occurred in the volatile components of the fruit {{at the onset of}} senescence also were delineated. A typical chromatogram from field-ripe tomatoes contained 60 peaks. The functional group properties of individual peaks were derived by chemical analysis. The short-chain (C 3 -C 6) alcohols represented 10 per cent, aldehydes and ketones 32 per cent, and hydrocarbons, long-chain alcohols, and esters were in 58 per cent of the total amount of the volatiles from the field-ripe fruits. Among alcohols and carbonyls, 3 -pantanol, 1 -nonanal, 1 -decanal, and 1 -dodecanal and among esters, <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> geranyl acetate, and cetronellyl butyrate were tentatively identified as volatile compounds of tomato fruit. Linalyl acetate, citronellyl butyrate, and geranyl butyrate were identified {{for the first time as}} the components of tomato volatiles. Comparisons of volatile concentrations of field- and artificially - ripe tomatoes were made. IN the latter category of fruits the concentrations of 1 -butanol, 3 -pentanol, 2 -methyl- 3 -hexanol, 3 -methyl-butanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, <b>propyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> isopentyl butyrate, and other unidentified carbonyls were higher than those observed in the field-ripe fruits. These short-chain compounds, especially the C 4 -C 6 moities, probably are formed in their maximum concentrations during the early stages of maturation. Under the conditions of restricted nutrient availability, sun light, and limited enzymatic activity during artificial ripening, the long-chain compounds are not sunthesized appreciably. The concentrations of some of these short-chain compounds may be to a level of masking the effects of more desirable compounds contributory to ripe tomato aroma. Notably, a pulp from the artificially ripe fruits lacked the characteristic ripe tomato aroma. The concentrations of the long-chain carbonyls and the terpene esters were low in the artificially ripe tomatoes as compared to the field-ripe ones. This may indicate major contribution of these compounds to ripe tomato aroma. An attempt has been made to theorize the mechanisms of the biogenesis of these components of tomato volatiles. The concentrations of the volatiles from field-ripe and overripe tomatoes were compared. During overripening the amounts of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and propionates generally decreased. However, the concentrations of diacetyl and butyric acid esters increased. It was assumed that at the onset of senescence the metabolic pathways for the formation of diacetyl and butyric acid were highly operative in tomato fruit. The mechanisms of these pathways were postulated...|$|E
