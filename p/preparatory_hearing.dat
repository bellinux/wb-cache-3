The Constitutional Court was to start the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Hearing</b> on December 22, with initial views from both sides.|$|E
5000|$|The Korean Rules of Evidence confer a high {{probative value}} to so called suspect {{interrogation}} records {{produced by the}} prosecutors, which is [...] "a protocol containing a statement of a suspect or of any other person, prepared by a public prosecutor or a judicial police." [...] However, this document is technically a hearsay under the English American legal system and contains a record of a confession made without assistance of legal counsel. While either the police officer or prosecutor can produce a suspect interrogation record, one made by a prosecutor is admissible if the suspect confirms the genuineness of the Record at a <b>preparatory</b> <b>hearing</b> or during the trial. If the suspect denies the genuineness, the record could still be admissible {{if there is a}} circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. However, a record made by a police officer is inadmissible if the suspect denies the genuineness later in the process.|$|E
40|$|In the {{criminal}} cases, {{the recording of}} defendant’s statements to threaten the victim or to confess his crime are often submitted as evidence to prove the charge in fact. However, {{it is important to}} disambiguate the admissibility of the recording medium because this issue implies some arguing points. It is acknowledged that hearsay rule should apply to the recording of statements, like written statements. Nevertheless, some critics do not agree with that the defendant"s confession recorded by the investigative agencies can be used to prove the facts constituting the crime charged. Also, regarding to the admissibility of the recording by individuals who are not he investigative agencies, there are several discrepancies among viewpoints. If the recording of the defendant"s statements to confess to the crime made by the investigative agencies satisfies the requirements of Criminal Procedure Act Article 312 paragraph (1) to (3), it may be admissible. However, in the light of CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT Article 312 paragraph (2), Article 381 - 2 paragraph (2) and ACT ON SPECIAL CASES CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT, ETC. OF SEXUAL CRIMES Article 30 paragraph (6), ACT ON THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AND JUVENILES AGAINST SEXUAL ABUSE Article 26 paragraph (6) the video-recorded product containing a defendant"s statement made by the investigative agencies is not admissible to prove the facts constituting the crime charged except for cases in which there are special regulations that allow a video-recorded product to use as proof of the facts constituting the crime charged. Therefore, the recording of the defendant‘s statements to confess to the crime made by the investigative agencies cannot be used to prove the facts constituting the crime charged, because the recording of defendant’s statement and the video-recorded product are similar in nature as a proof. On the other hand, in the case of individual recording, if it satisfies the requirements of CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT Article 313 paragraph (1), it may be used to prove the facts constituting the crime charged. In other words, if it is proven to be genuine by the acceptance of the defendant at a <b>preparatory</b> <b>hearing</b> or during a public trial, such recording medium is admissible. When it cannot be proven by the statement of the defendant at a <b>preparatory</b> <b>hearing</b> or during a public trial, for it"s being admissible, it should be proven to be genuine by the statement of the individual, who recorded the statement of the defendant, at a <b>preparatory</b> <b>hearing</b> or during a public trial and, if it goes to prove that the defendant"s statement was made in a particularly reliable state...|$|E
