30|$|Regarding the calibration, {{results show}} that all {{obtained}} parameters are statistically significant both in expected sign and validation statistics. From the analysis of import it emerged that the per capita income is relevant for perishable and consumption goods, at same way {{of the gross domestic}} product for industrial goods both for import and export, even if the influence on export is about double respect the import flows. Furthermore the presence of a <b>port</b> <b>inside</b> the zone determines a reduction of road flows due to the attractiveness of maritime transport, especially for long trips.|$|R

5000|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static <b>port.</b> <b>Inside</b> the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|R

The service included transports for the Sicilian Mafia boss, Nitto Santapaola, who headed the Mafia family of Catania on Sicily’s east coast. Iamonte and his ally Paolo De Stefano secured arms and drug transports when the harbour of Catania was controlled too strictly. In return Santapaola helped the Iamonte clan to get subcontracts {{for the construction of}} a railway repair yard in Saline with the construction company of Carmelo Costanzo from Catania.|$|R

50|$|The City of Los Angeles annexed Wilmington in 1909, {{and today}} it and {{neighboring}} San Pedro form the waterfront {{of one of}} the world’s largest import/export centers. Citizens of Wilmington were dubious that annexation would be in their best interests, fearing that it would shift economic activity out of their city and towards Los Angeles. Because the city government of Los Angeles so strongly wanted to have the growing <b>port</b> <b>inside</b> the city limits, it made a number of promises to Wilmington and also to the equally-dubious citizens of San Pedro. Among these promises were that $10 million would be invested in improvements to the port and that as much would be spent inside the city on public works as was collected in taxes.|$|R
5000|$|They {{predominantly}} {{serve the}} economy through freight transport, {{allowing for the}} better and cheaper transport of goods between dry <b>ports</b> <b>inside</b> Ethiopia and the Port of Djibouti. It is expected, that these railways will be {{the backbone of the}} Ethiopian transport sector and will ease exports and imports while making the transport of goods safer, cheaper and faster. They will promote the cash inflow into Ethiopia, therefore speeding up economic development. Apart from that, a standard gauge light rail is operating in the Ethiopian capital which is also the capital of the African Union, making the transport of persons easier and quicker and more time-efficient. The light rail tracks might connect to the main rail network in the future, as there is no break-of-gauge.|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{a design}} and {{simulation}} of a waveguide termination for WR 03 band, using SU 8 based micromachined waveguides is reported. To achieve low level reflection for the termination, two basic ideas are considered. Firstly, an open-ended waveguide <b>port</b> <b>inside</b> the lossy material of SU 8 has been investigated. Secondly, thin film conductor layers (silver and platinum) are considered for waveguide walls. Additionally, {{for the improvement}} of the final result, different kinds of tapering of the SU 8 open-ended waveguide have been analysed. Horn shaping of the waveguide structure in combination with tapering of SU 8 has also been evaluated. The best structure was WR 03 Platinum termination with height tapering with a predicted return loss of better than - 30 dB over the WR 03 band...|$|R

40|$|In-situ barrier {{emplacement}} {{techniques and}} materials {{are being developed}} for the containment of high-risk contaminants in soils. Because of their relatively high cost, they are used {{in cases where the}} risk is too great to remove the contaminants, the contaminants are too difficult to remove with current technologies, or the potential movement of the contaminants to the water table is so high that immediate action needs to be taken to reduce health risks. Assessing the integrity of the barrier once it is emplaced, and during its anticipated life, is a difficult but necessary requirement. Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) has developed and demonstrated an integrated tracer-based monitoring/verification system. This system, called SEAtraceTM, locates and sizes leaks in subsurface barriers emplaced in unsaturated media. It uses gaseous tracer injection, in field real-time monitoring, and real-time data analysis to evaluate barrier integrity. Multiple sample points are located outside the barrier, as well as one or more injection and sample <b>ports</b> <b>inside</b> the barrier. These ports are connected to a stand-alone data acquisition and analysis system. A tracer gas (typically sulfur hexafluoride) is injected into the barrier...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCyber-Physical Systems (smart grids, cities, homes, etc) are {{composed}} of computing resources, actuators and sensors, connected through IP networks. These IP networks involve many technologies. In order to help designing and evaluating these systems, we are studying the modeling and simulation of IP networks in this context. Since there is no universal IP simulator proposing a model library corresponding to all the required technologies, we propose a solution to make different major IP simulators, generally not interoperable, {{interact with one another}} in a same co-simulation. Moreover, they should also interact with simu-lators corresponding to other fields of expertise involved in the simulation, mostly related to the physical or social aspects of these systems (e. g. power models, traffic models, weather models, etc). In this paper, we propose to address these issues as a multi-modeling problem, by integrating well-known IP network simulators into a DEVS-based co-simulation platform. We propose some concepts, helping to split a network topology into several models, to create input/output <b>ports</b> <b>inside</b> them, and to integrate them to a DEVS multi-model.
