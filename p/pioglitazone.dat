25|$|Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – {{rosiglitazone}} {{and possibly}} <b>pioglitazone,</b> inhibitors of PPARγ, {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} osteoporosis and fracture.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{at least}} one large {{prospective}} study, PROactive 05, has shown that <b>pioglitazone</b> may decrease the overall incidence of cardiac events in people with type 2 diabetes who have already had a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, <b>pioglitazone,</b> repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to <b>pioglitazone,</b> finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for <b>pioglitazone.</b> The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or <b>pioglitazone.</b> The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than <b>pioglitazone.</b> This {{was confirmed by}} another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US.|$|E
50|$|More recently, <b>pioglitazone</b> {{and other}} active TZDs {{have been shown}} to bind to the outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane protein mitoNEET with affinity comparable to that of <b>pioglitazone</b> for PPARγ.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} are {{upper respiratory tract}} infection, diarrhea, combined edema/peripheral edema and headache, respectively. Most clinical adverse events were similar between groups treated with <b>pioglitazone</b> in combination with metformin and those treated with <b>pioglitazone</b> monotherapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> (brand name Actos) is a {{prescription}} drug of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class with hypoglycemic (antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic) action to treat diabetes. While <b>pioglitazone</b> does decrease blood sugar levels, studies on the main cardiovascular outcomes have not yielded statistically significant results.|$|E
50|$|Starting dose for {{patients}} switching from combination therapy of <b>pioglitazone</b> plus metformin as separate tablets: pioglitazone/metformin may be initiated {{with either the}} 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of <b>pioglitazone</b> and metformin already being taken.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> {{cannot be}} used in {{patients}} with a known hypersensitivity to <b>pioglitazone,</b> other thiazolidinediones or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Its safety in pregnancy, lactation (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established.|$|E

50|$|A meta {{analysis}} of all trials from 2010 confirmed {{a higher risk}} of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta analyses of real life cohortstudies found {{a higher risk of}} heart failure against <b>pioglitazone.</b> There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than <b>pioglitazone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> {{can cause}} fluid {{retention}} and peripheral edema. As a result, it may precipitate {{congestive heart failure}} (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause anemia. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In studies, patients on <b>pioglitazone</b> had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems.|$|E
50|$|There is {{tentative}} {{research that}} suggests that <b>pioglitazone</b> may be useful for treating major depression.|$|E
50|$|Troglitazone, {{like the}} other thiazolidinediones (<b>pioglitazone</b> and rosiglitazone), works by {{activating}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of metformin and <b>pioglitazone</b> (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor) remains available in U.S. and Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> and {{all other}} drugs of its class (thiazolidinediones) are {{absolutely}} contraindicated in patients with heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 Takeda {{established}} its own US R&D {{and sales}} force, for the diabetes drug <b>pioglitazone</b> (Actos).|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> {{has also}} been used to treat non-alcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (fatty liver), but this use is presently considered experimental.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> {{selectively}} {{stimulates the}} nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) {{and to a}} lesser extent PPAR-α. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. As a result, <b>pioglitazone</b> reduces insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|Pioglitazone/metformin {{should not}} be used during {{pregnancy}} unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with combination of <b>pioglitazone</b> and metformin or its individual components. It is not known whether <b>pioglitazone</b> and/or metformin are secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, pioglitazone/metformin {{should not be}} administered to a breastfeeding woman.|$|E
50|$|VLDLR {{expression}} is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ). A 2010 {{study showed that}} the prescription drug <b>Pioglitazone,</b> an agonist of PPAR-γ, increases VLDLR mRNA expression and protein levels in experiments using mouse fibroblasts. The <b>Pioglitazone</b> treated mice exhibited a higher conversion rate of plasma triglycerides into epididymal fats. As expected, mice deficient in VLDLR did not show this same response. These results suggest that VLDLR is important in fat accumulation.|$|E
50|$|Given {{previous}} {{experiences with}} the related drug troglitazone, acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a contraindication for <b>pioglitazone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{interactions}} include decreased {{levels and}} less effectiveness of antiretroviral agents, everolimus, atorvastatin, rosiglitazone, <b>pioglitazone,</b> celecoxib, clarithromycin, caspofungin, voriconazole, and lorazepam.|$|E
50|$|Both {{rosiglitazone}} and <b>pioglitazone</b> are contraindicated {{in people}} with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. They are not commanded for heartfailure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pioglitazone</b> (Actos), France and Germany have {{suspended}} its sale after a study {{suggested the}} drug could raise {{the risk of}} bladder cancer.|$|E
50|$|Combination with sulfonylureas or insulin {{reciprocally}} exponentiate risk of hypoglycemia. Therapy with <b>pioglitazone</b> {{increase the}} chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception.|$|E
5000|$|Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) - {{rosiglitazone}} {{and possibly}} <b>pioglitazone,</b> inhibitors of PPARγ, {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} osteoporosis and fracture.|$|E
50|$|The {{antidiabetic}} drug <b>pioglitazone,</b> {{in addition to}} binding to the nuclear receptor PPAR, also {{has been shown to}} bind mitoNEET with approximately equal affinity.|$|E
5000|$|On July 30, 2007 an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration {{concluded}} {{that the use of}} rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of [...] "myocardial ischemic events" [...] when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. <b>Pioglitazone</b> is currently being reviewed. A meta-analysis released subsequently showed that <b>pioglitazone</b> reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased CHF.|$|E
50|$|An {{retrospective}} {{observational study}} performed using Medicare data found that patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 27% {{higher risk of}} stroke compared to those treated with <b>pioglitazone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Compounds {{that have}} been found to inhibit AGE {{formation}} in the laboratory include Vitamin C, benfotiamine, pyridoxamine, alpha-lipoic acid, [...] taurine, pimagedine, aspirin, carnosine, metformin, <b>pioglitazone,</b> and pentoxifylline.|$|E
