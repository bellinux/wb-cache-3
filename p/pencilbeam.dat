40|$|International audienceIntroduction. At the {{biomedical}} beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), we {{have established}} a method to study <b>pencilbeam</b> irradiation in-vivo in small animal models. The <b>pencilbeam</b> irradiation technique {{is based on the}} principle of microbeam irradiation, a concept of spatially fractionated high-dose irradiation. Using gamma H 2 AX as marker, we followed the development of DNA double strand breaks over 48 hrs after whole brain irradiation with the <b>pencilbeam</b> technique. Method. Almost square pencilbeams with an individual size of 51 x 50 mu m were produced with an MSC collimator using a step and shoot approach, while the animals were moved vertically through the beam. The center-to-center distance (ctc) was 400 mu m, with a peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) of about 400. Five groups of healthy adult mice received peak irradiation doses of either 330 Gy or 2, 460 Gy and valley doses of 0. 82 Gy and 6. 15 Gy, respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 12 and 48 hrs after irradiation. Results. DNA double strand breaks are observed {{in the path of the}} <b>pencilbeam.</b> The size of the damaged volume undergoes changes within the first 48 hours after irradiation. Conclusions. The extent of DNA damage caused by <b>pencilbeam</b> irradiation, as assessed by H 2 AX antibody staining, is dose-dependen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Scatterometers are {{remote sensing}} radars {{designed}} to measure near-surface winds over the ocean. The difficulties of accommodating traditional fan-beam scatterometers on spacecraft has {{lead to the development}} of a scanning <b>pencilbeam</b> instrument known as SeaWinds. SeaWinds will be part of the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite II (ADEOS-II) to be launched in 1999. To analyze the performance of the SeaWinds design, a new expression for the measurement accuracy of a pencil-beam system is required. In this paper we derive a general expression for the backscatter measurement accuracy for a pencil-beam scatterometer which includes the effects of transmit signal modulation with simple power detection. Both separate and simultaneous signal+noise and noise-only measurements are considered. The utility of the new expression for scatterometer design tradeoffs is demonstrated using a simplified geometry. A separate paper [8] describes detailed tradeoffs made to develop the SeaWinds design. Index Terms—Scatterometry, SeaWinds, wind measurement. I...|$|E
40|$|Deformable 3 D {{dosimeters}} {{have potential}} applications in validating deformable dose mapping algorithms. This study evaluates a novel deformable PRESAGE ® dosimeter and its application toward validating the deformable algorithm employed by VelocityAI. The deformable PRESAGE ® dosimeter exhibited a linear dose response with a sensitivity of 0. 0032 ΔOD/(Gy/ cm). Comparison of an experimental dosimeter irradiated with an MLC <b>pencilbeam</b> checkerboard pattern under lateral compression up to 27 % to a non-deformed control dosimeter irradiated {{with the same}} pattern verified dose tracking under deformation. CTs of the experimental dosimeter prior to and during compression were exported into VelocityAI and used to map an Eclipse dose distribution calculated on the compressed dosimeter to its original shape. A comparison between the VelocityAI dose distribution and the distribution from the dosimeter showed field displacements up to 7. 3 mm and up to a 175 % difference in field dimensions. These results highlight the need for validating deformable dose mapping algorithms to ensure patient safety and quality of care. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{conducted}} the first in-vivo experiments in <b>pencilbeam</b> irradiation, a new synchrotron radiation technique {{based on the}} principle of microbeam irradiation, a concept of spatially fractionated high-dose irradiation. In an animal model of adult C 57 BL/ 6 J mice we have determined technical and physiological limitations with the present technical setup of the technique. Fifty-eight animals were distributed in eleven experimental groups, ten groups receiving whole brain radiotherapy with arrays of 50 mu m wide beams. We have tested peak doses ranging between 172 Gy and 2, 298 Gy at 3 mm depth. Animals in five groups received whole brain radiotherapy with a center-to-center (ctc) distance of 200 mu m and a peak-to-valley ratio (PVDR) of similar to 100, in the other five groups the ctc was 400 mm (PVDR similar to 400). Motor and memory abilities were assessed during a six months observation period following irradiation. The lower dose limit, determined by the technical equipment, was at 172 Gy. The LD 50 was about 1, 164 Gy for a ctc of 200 mu m and higher than 2, 298 Gy for a ctc of 400 mu m. Age-dependent loss in motor and memory performance was seen in all groups. Better overall performance (close to that of healthy controls) was seen in the groups irradiated with a ctc of 400 mu...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Dual X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used techniques fornon-invasive assessment of bone status. Radiation dosimetry is well established technique for <b>pencilbeam</b> and fan beam DXA system, for the assessment of the surface absorbed dose. No publishedassessment of the absorbed dose for the various depths of the critical organs such as the thyroid anduterus was found. Therefore, in this study, we measured the surface dose and depth dose of criticalorgans to determine the correlation between the depth dose and the surface dose. Materials and Methods: A Lunar DPX-MD (pencil beam) system was used in this study. Ananthropomorphic phantom was designed. AP spine and femur scan modes were used to measure thesurface and depth doses of the thyroid left and right lobes and uterus in various deeps and scan centers. TLDs- 400 were placed at the surface, near the source and also inserted at different depths in thyroidand uterus of the anthropomorphic phantom. Absorbed doses were measured on the phantom for APspine and femur scans. The correlation between the absorbed dose and the depth was found using thelinear regression analysis. Results: There was no significant correlation between the depth dose and the scan center doseexcept in the femur scan. AP spine effective dose were calculated as 0. 064, 0. 059, 0. 061 and 0. 242 μSv for thyroid left, right lobes, uterus and ovary, respectively. Conclusion: It is concluded that there is significant correlation between the surface and the doseof various depths of the scanned sections...|$|E
40|$|Far-infrared cooling {{lines are}} {{ubiquitous}} {{features in the}} spectra of star-forming galaxies. Surveys of redshifted fine-structure lines provide a promising new tool to study structure formation and galactic evolution at redshifts including the epoch of reionization {{as well as the}} peak of star formation. Unlike neutral hydrogen surveys, where the 21 cm line is the only bright line, surveys of redshifted fine-structure lines suffer from confusion generated by line broadening, spectral overlap of different lines, and the crowding of sources with redshift. We use simulations to investigate the resulting spectral confusion and derive observing parameters to minimize these effects in <b>pencilbeam</b> surveys of redshifted far-IR line emission. We generate simulated spectra of the 17 brightest far-IR lines in galaxies, covering the 150 - 1300 m wavelength region corresponding to redshifts 0 < z < 7, and develop a simple iterative algorithm that successfully identifies the 158 m [C II] line and other lines. Although the [C II] line is a principal coolant for the interstellar medium, the assumption that the brightest observed lines in a given line of sight are always [C II] lines is a poor approximation to the simulated spectra once other lines are included. Blind line identification requires detection of fainter companion lines from the same host galaxies, driving survey sensitivity requirements. The observations require moderate spectral resolution 700 < R < 4000 with angular resolution between 20 and 10, sufficiently narrow to minimize confusion yet sufficiently large to include a statistically meaningful number of sources...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory motion during PET {{acquisition}} {{may lead}} to blurring in resulting images and underestimation of uptake parameters. The advent of integrated PET/MR scanners allows us to exploit the integration of modalities, using high spatial resolution and highcontrast MR images to monitor and correct PET images degraded by motion. We proposed a practical, anatomy-independent MRbased correction strategy for PET data affected by respiratory motion and showed that it can improve image quality both for PET acquired simultaneously to the motion-capturing MR and for PET acquired up to 1 h earlier during a clinical scan. Methods: To estimate the respiratory motion, our method needs only an extra 1 -min dynamic MR scan, acquired {{at the end of}} the clinical PET/MR protocol. A respiratory signal was extracted directly from the PET listmode data. This signal was used to gate the PET data and to construct a motion model built from the dynamic MR data. The estimated motion was then incorporated into the PET image reconstruction to obtain a single motion-corrected PET image. We evaluated our method in 2 steps. The PET-derived respiratory signal was compared with an MR measure of diaphragmatic displacement via a <b>pencilbeam</b> navigator. The motion-corrected images were compared with uncorrected images with visual inspection, line profiles, and standardized uptake value (SUV) in focally avid lesions. Results: We showed a strong correlation between the PET-derived and MRderived respiratory signals for 9 patients, with a mean correlation of 0. 89. We then showed 4 clinical case study examples (18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-DOTATATE) using the motion-correction technique, demonstrating improvements in image sharpness and reduction of respiratory artifacts in scans containing pancreatic, liver, and lung lesions as well as cardiac scans. The mean increase in peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax) in a patient with 4 pancreatic lesions was 23. 1 % and 34. 5 % in PET acquired simultaneously with motion-capturing MR, and 17. 6 % and 24. 7 % in PET acquired 50 min before as part of the clinical scan. Conclusion: We showed that a respiratory signal can be obtained from raw PET data and that the clinical PET image quality can be improved using only a short additional PET/MR acquisition. Our method does not need external respiratory hardware or modification of the normal clinical MR sequences...|$|E
