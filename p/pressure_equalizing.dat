50|$|An oxygen {{concentrator}} has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> reservoir, and some valves and tubes. In the first half-cycle the first cylinder receives {{air from the}} compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 1.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, radon and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> reservoir, which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At {{the end of the}} first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. Pressure in the first cylinder drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> reservoir from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve.|$|E

50|$|Under normal circumstances, {{the human}} Eustachian tube is closed, {{but it can}} open to let {{a small amount of}} air through to prevent damage by {{equalizing}} pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. Pressure differences cause temporary conductive hearing loss by decreased motion of the tympanic membrane and ossicles of the ear. Various methods of ear clearing such as yawning, swallowing, or chewing gum may be used to intentionally open the tube and equalize pressures. When this happens, humans hear a small popping sound, an event familiar to aircraft passengers, scuba divers, or drivers in mountainous regions. Devices assisting in pressure equalization include an ad hoc balloon applied to the nose, creating inflation by positive air pressure.Some people learn to voluntarily 'click' their ears, together or separately, performing a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> routine by opening their Eustachian tubes when pressure changes are experienced, as in ascending/descending in aircraft, mountain driving, elevator lift/drops, etc. Some are even able to deliberately keep their Eustachian tubes open for a brief period, and even increase or decrease air pressure in the middle ear. The 'clicking' can actually be heard audibly by putting one's ear to another's while performing the clicking sound. This voluntary control may be first discovered when yawning or swallowing, or by other means (above). Those who develop this ability may discover that it can be done deliberately without force even when there are no pressure issues involved.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Dysfunction of Eustachian tube (ET) and the {{associated}} <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> problems are concerning patients especially in flying and diving. The effect of pressure-regulating earplugs (PREP) on complaints while flying has been evaluated. In addition, the effectivity of laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LETP) has been investigate in a pressure chamber. Methods: 60 patients were included in 3 studies. All of them were examined in a hyperbaric pressure chamber with continuous impedance measurement. In the PREP-study 21 patients were examined double-blind with and without PREP in the pressure chamber. In the LETP- (n= 30) and the diver-longterm-study (n= 9) the ET function before and after LETP were measured. ET opening pressure, ET closing pressure and ET opening duration were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. In the diver-longterm-study also longterm results after 3 - 4 years were collected. Results: PREP-study: Evidence of ET dysfunction was found in twice as many patients with the impedance method in the pressure chamber compared to tympanometry and Valsava test. The number of pressure-equalizing maneuvers did not differ significantly. Patients reported a significantly better subjective state on the visual analogue scale with than without PREP (p < 0. 003). LETP-study: Bevore LETP, 17 patients showed a blocked pattern in pressure chamber testing. Postoperatively, 13 patients of this group showed an improved ET function with a restored normal opening pattern (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced from 6. 24 ± 3. 46 mbar preoperatively to 4. 06 ± 2. 36 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 013). Diver-longterm-study: Preoperatively 5 divers showed a blocked pattern in pressure chamber testing. In 4 of them a normal opening pattern was restored postoperatively (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced significant from 7. 40 ± 1. 52 mbar preoperatively to 2. 85 ± 1. 11 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 005). In the long-term, all subjects reported a restored ability for pressure equalization and 7 of 9 were diving again. Conclusion: A combination of Valsalva manoeuver, tympanometry and continuous impedance measurement in the pressure chamber identifies more patients with <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> problems than only the both first mentioned ENT-routine diagnostics allone. Although use of PREP {{showed no signs of}} improving ET function, it did significantly improve individual subjective state during sudden pressure changes.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} 2006 in the Netherlands a test {{is going}} on with a passive beach {{drainage}} system called Ecobeach. The system consists of vertical draining tubes with a length of 2. 0 m called PEMs (<b>Pressure</b> <b>Equalizing</b> Modules). Under the surface level, every 100 m a row of PEMs is installed between the high and low waterline. Ecobeach is a Danish invention and the inventor claims that at beaches at different places around the world the volume of sand is increased thanks to the PEMs. This “drainage system” differs from other beach drainage systems in the way that normally horizontal drains are being placed under the beach, connected by a pump. When the Dutch test started very little was known about the functioning of the PEM system. For this reason scientific research to the PEMs was being started in September 2008. First the situation in the test area is examined. The beach, and especially the swash zone, is a complex area, influenced by tides, waves, sediment transport and groundwater flows. Five hypotheses are formulated of the influence PEMs can have on their environment. If a PEM can influence the groundwater behaviour in its direct vicinity, a process can be initiated which has an effect on the total beach. The initial events, caused directly by the PEMs, have to be studied in the field to make clear if the different hypothesised processes are realistic. Moreover consequences of the possible processes initiated by the PEMs should be recognized if anything happens. For this reason a fieldwork is executed in August-September 2009. Measurement results of the groundwater behaviour in the vicinity of PEMs show that some hypotheses are unlikely, and some are still questionable. An analysis of the sediment in and around the test area makes clear that possibly a process {{is going on in the}} Ecobeach test area, which could be a result of the PEMs. Because this study will be continued, this report shows an initial study to a very complex system. It shows the setup of a large study, interesting analysis methods and surprising results. Nevertheless it will lead sometimes to new questions.

40|$|Laminitis is {{a common}} but devastating condition, and {{affected}} horses are often euthanized or influenced a very long time. Many horses never return to their original capacity. Laminitis {{is often associated with}} severe pain and a long time of convalescence. Symthoms includes lameness, hoof hyperthermia, strenghthened digital pulse and pain. The horse often tries to move the body weight away from the forelegs which are often more severly affected than the hindlimbs. The lamellae in the hoof are partly or totally destroyed when affected by laminitis. The cells are destroyed and disconnected from each other, which is called lamellar separation. This can lead to hoof dislocation because the lamellae is no longer connected to the coffin bone and the hoof capsule. Much is written about the condition, but the exact mechanism concerning how laminitis arises is still unknown. Conditions proposed to be triggers of the development of laminitis include sepsis mainly caused by gram negative bacteria, equine metabolic syndrome, excess intake of carbohydrates, cushings disease or treatment with cortisone, high body weight and lack of exercise. This literary study will compile research done concerning laminitis and suggest how veterinary nursing can help horses affected by laminitis. Cryotherapy is a method that seems to help horses in the initiate phase of laminitis, but {{more research is needed to}} develop a good method. Feeding, shoeing, treatment of conditions causing laminitis and exercise are some of the things considered. These are of big interest in this study for treatment and prevention of laminitis. Research accentuate the importance of feeding the laminitic horse with hoof sthrengthening nutrients like calcium, biotin and high quality proteins. This is of greatest interest during the first three months of treatment, because the body needs extra nutrition for tissue healing. Shoeing of the horse is suggested in the chronic phase. Factors to be considered includes distribution of body weight, reducing the pressure on the lamellae and reducing the pull of the deep flexor tendon. In the acute phase of laminitis the horse needs box rest at a soft and <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> material. Analgesia is needed because of the severe pain often seen in the acute phase.

40|$|Authors: Ren-Qi Wang, Teng-Teng Ong, Ke Huang, Weihua Tang & Siu-Choon Ng ### Abstract We {{described}} a facile and effective protocol wherein radical copolymerization is employed to covalently bond cationic β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto silica particles with extended linkage, {{resulting in a}} chiral stationary phase (IMPCSP) {{that can be used}} for the enantioseparation of racemic drugs in both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Starting from commercially available chemicals, the IMPCSP is prepared in several steps: (i) reaction of β-CD with 1 -(p-toluenesulfonyl) -imidazole to afford mono- 6 A-(p-toluenesulfonyl) - 6 A-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin (B); (ii) nucleophilic addition between B and 1 -vinylimidazole and followed by treatment with anionic-exchange resin to give mono-vinylimidazolium-CD chloride (C); (iii) electrophilic addition between C and phenyl isocyanate to generate 6 A-(3 -vinylimidazolium) - 6 -deoxyperphenylcarbamate-β-CD chloride (D); (iv) reaction of silica gel with 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to engender vinylized silica (E); (v) immobilization of C onto vinylized silica via radical copolymerization with 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene in the presence of 2, 2 ’-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) to afford the desired chiral stationary phases. The overall IMPCSP preparation and column packing protocol requires ~ 2 weeks. ### Introduction Chromatographic methodologies have been extensively explored for accurate sample analyses, online monitoring of reaction progress and purifying of synthesized products (1). Especially, modern chromatographic techniques have been developed as powerful tools for chiral separation and preparation of enantiomers, most of which are of biological and pharmaceutical interests. Whatever chiral chromatographic techniques are used, chiral selectors either dissolved as mobile phases or mobilized onto supporting materials as stationary phases are crucial for successful and robust enantioseparations. Among the chiral selectors used so far, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives have been widely used in chiral chromatography since its first introduction by Armstrong et al. (2). In order to obtain a better solubility, the charged moieties are favorably introduced onto CD rims for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The self-mobility of CD in the ionized form enhances the separation ability when it is opposite to the electrophoretic mobility of the analytes (3). The hydrophobic moieties on the analytes could be included or adsorbed into the chiral cavity of CDs. Meanwhile, the analytes could also interact with the substituents on the CD rims (4, 5). The native CDs and their chemically-modified derivatives afford fine-tuned hydrophobicities, charges and cone shapes etc., which ultimately result in different tightness and interactions for CD-analytes complexes selectors and thus chemically-manipulated diving forces for chiral recognitions (6 - 14). The charged CD-based chiral mobile phases and chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been extensively explored in drug chiral analyses (15 - 20). A sulfated β-CD based CSP was developed which enabled great enantioseparations towards 33 racemic drugs in high-perfomace liquid chromatography (HPLC) 9. Recently, ionic-liquids featured positively-charged CDs have been covalently bonded onto silica gels to prepare novel CSPs, which exhibited dual selectivity in HPLC for the enantioseparation of both polar and non-polar compounds (18). The additional electrostatic interactions are significant to achieve separations of polar analytes which may interact with the neutral CDs too weakly, where 16 aromatic alcohol racemates and 2 drugs were achieved in polar organic mobile phases 19. In our previous report, a series of coated CSPs based on fully derivatized cationic β-CD were prepared. These cationic β-CD CSPs have shown strong enantioseparation abilities and moderate retention times towards a series of α-phenyl alcohols in both supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC 20. However, polar organic solvents in the mobile phase could cause damage to the coated CSPs. Besides, the efficiencies of the coated CSPs are usually low as the surface thickness of chiral selectors is hard to control (21). Figure- 1 (R Wang) Syntheses of Ts-CD (B), compounds C and D. The immobilization of functionalized CD onto silica gel is generally achieved by chemical reactions between highly reactive substituent on CD and the functional groups on silica gel (14, 16 - 18). Tedious synthetic approaches with possible protecting and de-protecting steps are usually required for successful grafting. Comparatively, the facile co-polymerization method is more accessible and reliable, universally employed in producing non-silica fillings for columns applicable for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or ion-exchange applications (22). The polymerized materials used for chromatography have wide applicable pH ranges and improved retentions for polar analytes, although lower mechanic strength and efficiency are often observed than the silica-based CSPs. The co-polymerization approach was also explored in the immobilizing of polysaccharide or enantiopure small molecules onto silica gel for the preparation of CSPs (23, 24). Figure- 2 (R Wang) Preparation of IMPCSP via radical copolymerization. In view of the our continuous and successful research endeavors in developing powerful cationic CDs as chiral selectors for both CE and HPLC (12, 25, 26), we recently developed the facile copolymerization methodology in preparing novel covalently-bonded cationic β-CD CSPs via co-polymerization approach (see Figs. 1 and 2). These as-prepared CSPs have successfully expanded the enatioseparation windows towards a broader range of chromatographic conditions for both HPLC and SFC application (27, 28). The linkage between CD selector and silica-support was built by using diene (ca. 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) as the third monomer for the dual copolymerization system with vinyllated CD and silica gel. The extended linkage can effectively improve the surface loading issue of CD onto silica gel, a challenge faced when direct immobilizing CD derivatives onto silica surface with short spacers due to steric hindrance (29). The as-developed CDs CSPs exhibited great potential in drug enantioseparations in both HPLC and SFC applications. The protocol describes herein the synthesis of imidazolium-based IMPCSP. This methodology can also be applied for the synthesis of other ammonium-based cationic CD CSPs (27, 28), which may find wide applications for both drug enantioseparations and NOM assessments. ### Reagents 1. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD; > 95 %; TCI, cat. no.

Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Weigh out 6 A-toluenesulfonyl-β-CD B 12. 91 g (0. 01 mol) into the flask. - Turn on the circulating water in the condenser. - Add 20 ml DMF into the flask and switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - Inject 1 -vinylimidazole 3 ml (0. 03 mol) into the flask though a plastic syringe. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Allow the reaction to proceed at 90 °C for 48 h under reflux. Cool down to room temperature. - Precipitate the product in acetone (200 ml). Collect the precipitate by filtration. Wash the raw product with acetone. - Dissolve the solid into water/methanol (200 ml/ 50 ml) - ! CAUTION The solution could be heated towards 50 °C to afford a clear solution. - Fill a column (I. D. 30 × 250 mm) with Amberlite IRA- 900 ion-exchange resin and washed with MilliQ water till the effluent pH going neutral. - Transfer the solution from step 8 into the column and let it hold for 1 h. Subsequently, collect the effluent drop by drop. Flush the column with equal volume MilliQ water and collect the effluent. - Distill off water on rotary evaporator to yield C as a light yellow solid (9. 7 g, 78 % yield) - PAUSE POINT Compound C can be stored in oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of compound D** - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Weigh out compound C 2. 15 g (1. 72 mmol) into the flask. - Add 20 ml dried pyridine into the flask and switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - ! CAUTION Pyridine is highly toxic solvent. All experiments dealing with pyridine should be operated in fumehood. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn. - Inject phenyl isocyanate 12 ml (110. 32 mmol) into the flask though a plastic syringe. - ! CAUTION Phenyl isocyanate has acute toxicity. It may cause severe skin burns and eye damage. It may cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled. Adding 12 ml phenyl isocyanate as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. It is strongly recommended to add phenyl isocyanate dropwise with <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> funnel. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn before experimental operation in fumehood. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP Phenyl isocyanate should be added with four equal portions. Add 12 ml as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. Add phenyl isocyanate drop by drop with <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizing</b> funnel would end up with its transformation in the funnel and the liquid colour changes to light yellow. - Allow the reaction to proceed at 85 °C for 20 h. Set up the vacuum distillation pipeline. - Distill off pyridine under reduced pressure at 85 °C. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Dissolve the residue with chloroform 15 ml. - Add the solution into silica column. Flush the impurities with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (70 : 30 v:v). - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The ratio of n-hexane/ethyl acetate was determined by TLC analyses. The flash column separation progress was also monitored by TLC analyses. Lowering the ratio would result in an increase of the amount of solvents used for eluting the impurities completely. - Flush the product out of the column with MeOH. - Remove the solvent on rotary evaporator to yield D as a dark yellow solid (6. 2 g, 66 % yield). - PAUSE POINT Compound D can be stored in oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of vinylized silica E** - Dry spherical silica gel particles (5 μm, 5 g) in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 150 °C for 24 h. Cool down to room temperature. - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Add dry toluene 100 ml into the flask. Switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - Inject 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (2. 3 ml) into the flask. - Add dried silica gel from step 22 into the flask. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Allow the reaction to stand at 90 °C for 18 h. Product was collected by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet apparatus overnight. - Collect the product by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet extractor overnight. - Dry the product overnight in an oven at 60 °C in vacco to afford the vinylized silica E. - PAUSE POINT Vinylized silica E can be stored at room temperature for several months. - **Co-polymerization for preparation of IMPCSP** - Dissolve compound D (0. 7 g) in chloroform (30 ml). Filter the solution through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Transfer the filtrate and drop onto vinylized silica gel E (1. 4 g) evenly with a glass syringe. - ! CAUTION A glass syringe was preferred to avoid any introduction of siloxal impurities from plastic syringes. Chloroform could corrode the rubber piston of the plastic syringe. - Dry the colloid-like mixture in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 25 °C. - Fit a 100 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with two rubber septums. - Add the solid from step 32 into the flask. Add AIBN (3 mg) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The amount of AIBN should be controlled. A less amount of AIBN would lead to slow reaction rate but a great amount resulted in rapid radical reactions and short chain growth. In both conditions, successful immobilized CD amounts were low. - Inject anhydrous toluene (20 ml) and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (2. 6 ml) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP 2, 3 -Dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene should be added before heating started. It was initiated together with the vinyl groups in compound D and vinylized silica E. Therein, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene could act as a interlink. A delayed addition led to a lower CD amount on IMPCSP, since the radicals formed on D and E could have been annihilated before 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene was added. - Freeze the mixture in liquid N 2 in a Dewar dish and degas the reaction system in vacuum (10 mm Hg) for 0. 5 h. - ! CAUTION Liquid N 2 - Take the flask out of the Dewar dish and thaw at room temperature. - Repeat step 36 and 37 for three times. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Fit the flask with a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. Leave the reaction to proceed at 60 °C for 18 h. - Cool down the reaction mixture and collect the product by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Wrap the filter cake with filter paper. Extract the solid in a Soxhlet extractor overnight. - Stop heating and collect the silica from the Soxhlet extractor. Dry the product in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. - Pack IMPCSP into an empty stainless steel column with MeOH at 8, 000 psi for 30 min. - PAUSE POINT IMPCSP can be stored at room temperature for several months. ### Timing - Synthesis of B: ~ 40 h include synthesis of A. - Steps 1 - 11 Synthesis of C: Steps 1 - 5, 1 h; Step 6, 48 h; Steps 7 - 8, 1 h; Steps 9 - 10, 1 h; Step 11, 12 h. - Steps 12 - 21 Synthesis of D: Steps 12 - 14, 1 h; Step 15, 2 h; Step 16, 20 h; Step 17, 5 h; Steps 18 - 20, 12 h; Step 21, 12 h. - Steps 22 - 29 Preparation of E: Step 22, 12 h; Steps 23 - 25, 4 h; Steps 26 - 27, 18 h; Steps 28 - 29, 20 h. - Steps 30 - 44 Preparation of IMPCSP: Steps 30 - 32, 6 h; Steps 33 - 35, 1 h; Steps 36 - 38, 1 h; Steps 39 - 40, 20 h; Steps 41 - 42, 20 h; Step 43, 24 h; Step 44, 2 h. ### Troubleshooting **?

Surface modified silica gel E: Obvious vibration bands in FT-IR spectrum of 2964, 2855 cm- 1 (C-H) 1705 cm- 1 (C=O) 1635 cm- 1 (C=C) and 1130 cm- 1 (C-O and Si-O) represent the successful surface modification with mathacryloyl-groups. Microanalyses data give the surface double bond loading of 5 μm silica as 2. 16 μmol/m 2 based on the carbon content (Table 2) (30). **Prepared IMPCSP** The characteristic peaks in FT-IR spectrum at 1720 cm- 1 (C=O), 1647, 1558, 1458 cm- 1 (C=C phenyl group) and 1130 cm- 1 (C-O and Si-O) show the CD derivative has been successfully bonded onto silica surface.

However such bulging does occur during cardiac tamponade where <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizes</b> between all of the chambers of the heart.

This additional loss of volume of the left ventricle that only occurs with equalization of the pressures (as in tamponade) allows for the further reduction in volume, so cardiac output is reduced, leading to a further decline in BP. However, in situations where the left ventricular pressure remains higher than the pericardial sac (most frequently from coexisting disease with an elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure), there is no pulsus paradoxus.|$|R

30|$|As Pmcf {{is defined}} as the {{steady-state}} blood pressure during no-flow conditions, instantaneously Pmcf should mainly be similar for different vascular compartments even though each compartment may have different Vu and Vs [2, 40]. Four studies [16, 41 – 43] used the arm to estimate Pmcf. For arm occlusion, a rapid cuff inflator (inflates in 0.3  s) [16, 43] or a pneumatic tourniquet (inflates in 1.4  s) [41, 42] was inflated around the upper arm to 50  mmHg above systolic blood pressure. Arterial and venous pressures were measured via a radial artery catheter and a peripheral venous cannula in the forearm. When these two <b>pressures</b> <b>equalize,</b> Pmcf arm values are achieved. An initial study determined that a 25 – 30  s stop-flow time was adequate to achieve this equilibration [16]. Following this, in two studies Pmcf arm was measured as the average radial arterial pressure at 30  s after stop-flow [16, 43]. One study found the smallest difference between venous and arterial pressure after 60  s of stop-flow [41]. This discrepancy could be explained by different inflation time, i.e., induction of stop-flow.|$|R
