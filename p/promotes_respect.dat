2500|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} the constitutional violation the Court had identified {{and at the same}} time tailor the federal sentencing statutes more closely to Congressional intent, the Court struck out 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), the provision of the sentencing statute that made it mandatory for district courts to impose sentences according to the Guidelines. [...] The rest of the sentencing statute [...] "functioned independently." [...] It required district judges to [...] "consider" [...] the Guidelines sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant in order to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense, <b>promotes</b> <b>respect</b> for the law, provides for adequate deterrence, protects the public, and provides the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care.|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{particular}} facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant procedural error. [...] He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and [...] "thoroughly documented his reasoning." [...] In particular, the judge did not ignore {{the seriousness of the}} offense. [...] To be sure, he did not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. [...] Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. [...] "It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative." [...] Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case <b>promotes</b> <b>respect</b> for the law. [...] Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. [...] Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, [...] "a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing." [...] Finally, Gall understandably received a more lenient sentence because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not.|$|E
