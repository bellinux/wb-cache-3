40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{carbonation}} {{test and}} gas permeability radio method {{are used to}} study the durability of lightweight aggregate concrete. The concrete includes foam,lightweight aggregateï¼Œpre-wetting and air entraining. The test results show that The combined-effect of air entraining agent(AEA) and aggregate pre-wetting can increase permeability. The anti-carbonation capacity of pre-wetting and air entraining lightweight aggregate concrete is 40 % {{greater than that of}} ordinary concrete. gas permeability radio of pre-wetting and air entraining lightweight aggregate concrete is half of that foam concrete and expanded <b>pearlite</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|E
