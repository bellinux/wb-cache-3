Composites fail when micro-cracks, which usually originate at voids, propagate through the material.

The strength a lamina with various tow packing configurations, void content and void distribution were investigated utilizing the progressive failure model. The tow <b>packing</b> <b>configuration</b> can affect the strength of a lamina by approximately 25 percent. Voids located near the gaps between the tows severely affect the strength of the lamina.

From force-field molecular-dynamics and annealing simulations of BPDT self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) {{with up to}} 100 molecules on a Au(111) substrate, we identify an energetically favorable herringbone-type SAM <b>packing</b> <b>configuration</b> and a less-stable parallel <b>packing</b> <b>configuration.</b> Both SAMs are described by the (2 sqrt(3) ×sqrt(3)) R 30 ° unit cell including two molecules. With subsequent density-functional theory calculations of one unit cell of the (i) herringbone SAM with the molecular tilt angle theta[approximate] 15 °, (ii) herringbone SAM with theta[approximate] 30 °, and (iii) parallel SAM with theta[approximate] 30 °, we confirm that the herringbone <b>packing</b> <b>configuration</b> is more stable than the parallel one but find that the energy variation {{with respect to the}} molecule tilting within the herringbone packing is very small. Next, by capping these SAMs with the top Au(111) electrode, we prepare three molecular electronic device models and calculate their coherent charge transport properties within the matrix Green's function approach. Current–voltage (I–V) curves are then obtained via the Landauer–Büttiker formula. We find that at low-bias voltages (|V| ~ 0. 5 V), the I–V characteristics of the three models show noticeable differences due to different phenyl band structures. We thus conclude that the BPDT SAM I–V characteristics in the low-bias voltage region are mainly determined by the Si–Au interaction within the individual molecule-electrode contact, while both intramolecular conformation and intermolecular interaction can affect the BPDT SAM I–V characteristics in the high-bias voltage region...|$|E

We employ classical applied mathematical modelling using {{the basic principles}} of mechanics to exploit the Lennard- Jones potential function and the continuous approximation, which assumes that intermolecular interactions can be approximated by average atomic surface densities. We consider both zigzag and spiral configurations formed by packing methane molecules into (9, 5), (8, 8) and (10, 10) carbon nanotubes, and we derive analytical expressions for the interaction potential energy of these configurations. Our findings indicate that for the zigzag configuration for a (9, 5) tube, the potential energy of the system is minimized when the methane molecules simply form a linear chain along the tube axis, but genuine zigzag patterns are found as the tube size increases such as for the (8, 8) and (10, 10) tubes. For the spiral configuration, the potential energy of the system is minimized when the angular spacing is approximately equal to π for the (9, 5) and (8, 8) tubes, and π/ 2 for the (10, 10) tube. Overall, our results are in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations in the literature and show that the most energetically efficient <b>packing</b> <b>configuration</b> of the three tubes studied, occurs for a (10, 10) tube with a zigzag packing, while a (10, 10) tube with a spiral <b>packing</b> <b>configuration</b> has the largest free-cavity volume for methane adsorption at higher temperatures.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Jan. 19, 2011 -Jan. 19, 2013 In intra-arterial radioembolization, nano- and micro-scaled carriers are used in patients with liver tumors that cannot be removed by surgery to deliver various radioisotopes {{with the aim of}} improving the outcome of tumor radiotherapy, of minimizing dose to healthy tissue, and of improving the quality of the diagnosis and imaging. In this technique, radioisotopes are incorporated in either nanospheres or microspheres for delivery. The synthesis of these maybe performed either using the isotope in its radioactive form or nonradioative form; however, if the synthesis is performed using non-radioactive isotopes, a subsequent activation by neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor is required. This investigation focused on neutron-activation simulations using computer models of microspheres loaded with holmium acetylacetonate (HoAcAc) complex in a polymeric matrix that are used for intra-arerial radioembolization therapy of liver cancer. The polymer matrix is made of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) which is both biodegradable and biocompatible. In addition, as a requirement for therapeutic applications of these microspheres, not only their diameter must be within a range between 20 and 50 micrometers, but also before administration to a patient, they must be neutron-activated by turning holmium- 165 into holmium- 166. The main objective of this investigation was to minimize the energy deposited by neutrons and gammas produced by fission and neutron activation reactions that would result in damages to both the microsphere's polymeric matrix and holmium complex. To accomplish this objective, Monte Carlo N-Particle models were created to perform the following simulations: (1) microspheres loaded with a HoAcAc complex in a polymeric matrix were exposed to a neutron flux in the thermal column of a TRIGA reactor while arranged in a sheet-shaped <b>packing</b> <b>configuration,</b> and, similarly, (2) while arranged in a pile-shaped <b>packing</b> <b>configuration,</b> microspheres also loaded with a HoAcAc complex in a polymeric matrix were also exposed to the same neutron flux in the thermal column.

40|$|Thesis (DTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. Highly {{concentrated}} emulsions (HCE) {{are classified}} as high internal phase ratio emulsions (or simply HIPRE), and the dispersed phase droplets are ranged In a hexagonal closely <b>packed</b> <b>configuration.</b> This closely <b>packed</b> <b>configuration</b> and the profound hydrodynamic interaction between neighbouring droplets induce mechanical interference between the droplets, thus prohibiting their free movement. Hence, while the highly concentrated emulsions consist of very low viscosity and inelastic components, they show gel-like behaviour with high elasticity and non-Newtonian flow response. It has been suggested in the literature that this behaviour originated from interfacial energy in terms of Laplace pressure. Therefore, the scaling of rheological properties with Laplace pressure is expected, but several publications show a deviation from this scaling behaviour. It seems {{that the source of}} deviation from this scaling is interdroplet interaction, which can contribute to the rheological behaviour of highly concentrated emulsions. The shear modulus of highly concentrated emulsions in the presence of interdroplet interaction was developed in this work. The prediction of model was verified by the data presented in the literature. It was shown that a small source of interdroplet interaction can result in deviation from scaling of shear modulus with Laplace pressure...|$|R

Upon identifying the dispersion relation of the underlying linear problem, the resulting diffraction properties are considered. Analysis both via a heuristic argument for the linear propagation of a wave packet and via asymptotic analysis leading to the derivation of a Dirac system suggests the occurrence of conical diffraction. This analysis is valid for strong precompression, i. e., near the linear regime. For weak precompression, conical wave propagation is still possible, but the resulting expanding circular wave front is of a nonoscillatory nature, resulting from the complex interplay among the discreteness, nonlinearity, and geometry of the packing. The transition between these two types of propagation is explored...|$|E

A laboratory test defined an optimal three frozen gel <b>pack</b> <b>configuration</b> to maintain refrigerated environmental conditions for dummy product packs in a single type and size of insulated shipper. The internal environment was temperature monitored at 30 -min intervals in all tests. Twelve Glasgow to London transits were then studied over 2 years to include all seasonal temperature variations.

A modified four frozen gel <b>pack</b> <b>configuration</b> was suitable for summer transit. Thus cold shipment verification was successfully carried out for a small-scale distribution operation.
