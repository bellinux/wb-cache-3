50|$|Valentine {{views in}} the nineteenth century aimed at the {{national}} middle and upper class tourist market, with the production of both drawing room albums containing selections of photographs arranged geographically and individual landscape prints. They competed with Francis Frith and George Washington Wilson, who were producing pictures of similar quality. Landscapes were available in a choice of sizes - cabinet, imperial and card. Stereoscopic and magic lantern slides views were also produced. Valentines called themselves 'photographic publishers' and reproduced a great variety of <b>photographic</b> <b>goods</b> as well as the postcards for which they are best known.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a new perspective}} on British photography through an examination of the manufacturing and retailing of photographic equipment and sensitised materials between 1839 and 1914. This is contextualised around the demand for photography from studio photographers, amateurs and the snapshotter. It notes that an understanding of the photographic image cannot be achieved without this as it directly affected how, why and by whom photographs were made. Individual chapters examine how the manufacturing and retailing of <b>photographic</b> <b>goods</b> was initiated by philosophical instrument makers, opticians and chemists from 1839 to the early 1850 s; the growth of specialised photographic manufacturers and retailers; and the dramatic expansion in their number in response to the demands of a mass market for photography from the late 1870 s. The research discusses the role of technological change within photography {{and the size of the}} market. It identifies the late 1880 s to early 1900 s as the key period when new methods of marketing and retailing <b>photographic</b> <b>goods</b> were introduced to target growing numbers of snapshotters. Particular attention is paid to the role of Kodak in Britain from 1885 as a manufacturer and retailer. A substantial body of newly discovered data is presented in a chronological narrative. In the absence of any substantive prior work this thesis adopts an empirical approach firmly rooted in the photographic periodicals and primary sources of the period. Wider literature from the history of retailing, manufacturing and Victorian studies supports it. The study concludes that three key periods, the early 1850 s, the 1870 s and the 1890 s, were when substantive changes to photographic technology each released a latent demand for photography initially from the commercial portrait photographer and then, respectively, from the amateur and the snapshotter. This was met and enhanced by new manufacturing, retailing and marketing methods within photography underpinned by wider economic, social and economic changes...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the validity and reliability of assessing the presence of plantar foot ulceration and pre-ulcerative lesions in diabetes patients from digital photographs that were produced using a new photographic foot imaging device. In 32 diabetes patients who had a foot ulcer or were at high risk of ulceration (a total of 60 feet), high-quality photographic images of the plantar foot surface were collected. Each foot was assessed live, from photographs 2 weeks later, and again 4 weeks later for the presence of an ulcer, abundant callus, or the absence of signs. Each foot was assessed by four independently operating foot care specialists. Agreement scores were calculated using κ values (range, 0 - 1). Sensitivity and specificity scores were also calculated. Foot ulceration was cumulatively scored 59 times, callus 78 times, and absence of signs 149 times during live assessment. Agreement with photographic assessment was very good for ulcer (κ[*]=[*] 0. 87) and absence of signs (κ[*]=[*] 0. 83) and good for callus (κ[*]=[*] 0. 61). Sensitivity and specificity were high for ulcer (88 % and 98 %, respectively), callus (69 % and 89 %, respectively), and absence of signs (both 90 %). Intra-observer agreement between repeated <b>photographic</b> assessments was <b>good</b> to excellent for all outcomes and observers (κ between 0. 70 and 1. 00). Inter-observer agreement for <b>photographic</b> assessments was <b>good</b> for ulcer (κ[*]=[*] 0. 72 - 0. 88) and absence of signs (κ[*]=[*] 0. 59 - 0. 75) and moderate to good for callus (κ[*]=[*] 0. 48 - 0. 73). For live assessment, inter-observer agreement scores were only slightly higher. The data illustrate that diabetic foot ulcers and pre-ulcerative lesions can be diagnosed in a valid and reliable manner by trained professionals from digital photographs produced with the foot imaging device.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative efficacy and safety of two sclerosing agents and foam. METHOD: Of 150 randomized patients presenting comparable areas (lateral face of thigh) of telangiectasias and reticular leg veins, 147 could be evaluated by photographic assessment, patients' satisfaction score, and pain at injection sites. Internal and external agreement for the <b>photographic</b> assessment was <b>good</b> for two independent blinded experts. RESULTS: CG cleared vessels significantly better than POL solution or foam (p< 0. 002). The patients' satisfaction score was also higher in the CG group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. CG was significantly more painful at injection sites. Other side effects were very few, precluding any statistical comparison. Foam was associated with more side effects (microthrombi, matting) than CG or POL solution.

The target image was {{obtained}} by approximately painting desired brightness on the grayscale result of previous iterations. 1 Good lighting is hard We apply simplified image-based lighting methods and an intuitive painting interface to reduce the equipment, cost, time, and specialized skills required for high quality <b>photographic</b> lighting. <b>Good</b> studio lighting is difficult {{because it is a}} 4 D inverse problem that photographers solve by successive approximation and years of experience. It can be surprisingly frustrating and tedious for non-experts. Our system offers two contributions. We extend existing image-based lighting ideas to reduce the equipment required to a single light source and single camera; and permit users to specify studio quality lighting quickly and interactively using optimization and onscreen painting. Unlike previous image based relighting methods [Anrys and Dutré 2004; Debevec et al. 2000], our method requires no calibration, is less complex, and is much faster. In exchange for reduced angular precision, we get a system that is more suitable for novice users and quick everyday use. 2 Tedium Removal We construct a high quality user guided picture in three steps. First the system automatically captures low resolution light-aiming photos of the object for a densely sampled set of lighting angles around the it. These quick photos are used only to guide the lighting design. Second, the user iteratively paints the desired lighting by simple lighten/darken operations on a target image. The system makes use of linearity of light and finds weights, wi for each light-aiming photo such that their weighted sum matches the target image in the least squares sense. Finally the system takes a few select high resolution basis images by relighting the scene from light source positions that have weights wi greater than a threshold. A weighted sum of these high resolution images gives the final result (see Figure 1). If the results are no...|$|R

For 38 patients with diabetes who presented with a foot infection or were admitted to the hospital with a foot-related complication, photographs of the plantar foot surface using a photographic imaging device and temperature data from six plantar regions using an infrared thermometer were obtained. A temperature difference between feet of > 2. 2 °C defined a "hotspot. " Two independent observers assessed each foot for presence of foot infection, both live (using the Perfusion-Extent-Depth-Infection-Sensation classification) and from photographs 2 and 4 weeks later (for presence of erythema and ulcers).

40|$|Summary: In part 1 (a), {{after a brief}} {{historical}} {{outline of}} methods of ionospheric investigation and their development, the construction in this laboratory of manually operated equipment for sounding the ionosphere is described. <b>Photographic</b> records of <b>good</b> definition were taken at regular intervals {{over a period of}} four months during the summer of 1945 - 6. These were fully sealed for critical frequencies, true heights and thicknesses of all the layers present, and mean monthly values of these quantities for each hour are tabulated. An extensive correlation with magnetic data from Hermanus indicated good correlation between magnetic activity and disturbed ionospheric conditions. On these grounds some disturbed days were rejected, and others were eliminated on ionospheric grounds. Smoothed mean values are tabulated and graphs drawn. These are presented in concise form on "electron density maps", which are graphs showing lines of constant electron density plotted as functions of time and height. In part 1 (b), a new theory of layer-formation is developed, in which the temperature is assumed to vary linearly with height. The equations are compared at each step with those obtained by Chapman in his theory of layer-formation in an isothermal atmosphere. The equations for the maximum of electron density and its height are also given. The effect of the parameters on the shape of the layer is shown in graphical form. The equations are somewhat complex in form, but an ingenious graphical method has been devised suitable for the application of the theory to results given in the form of those in section 1 (a). From this application values are obtained for the temperature gradient, the temperature at 200 km. and its variation over the middle part of the day. The results obtained are in accordance with previous estimates, and offer numerical confirmation of the theory that the atmosphere expands bodily upwards during the middle part of a summer day...|$|R
