40|$|Popular {{narratives}} of African American adolescents in inner city school contexts underscore {{problems related to}} low achievement, school disengagement, and delinquency. In reality, many youth in urban high schools experience positive developmental trajectories that inform identity processes and create successful routes through adolescence. Part of the identity-formation process in adolescence includes acquiring a <b>purpose,</b> defined as “a stable and generalized intention to accomplish something {{that is at once}} meaningful to the self and of consequence to the world beyond the self” (Damon, Menon, & Bronk, 2003, p. 121). Though studies have highlighted the importance of <b>purpose,</b> few studies have examined <b>purpose</b> in low-income, African American adolescents. This quantitative study used an integrative personality framework to examine <b>purpose</b> and its correlates among urban-residing, African American high school students (N= 151, 51 % Male). Study 1 explored associations between <b>purpose</b> and personality, motivation, and contextual characteristics. Study 2 sought to identify profiles of <b>purpose</b> in African American students. Study 3 examined the relationships between these profiles of <b>purpose</b> and engagement. At the individual level, highly motivated students and more conscientious students reported higher <b>purpose</b> scores. Related to context, students who felt that they mattered to an adult in school scored higher on <b>purpose.</b> Interestingly, students who felt that their neighborhoods had less social capital also {{were more likely to have}} <b>purpose.</b> Three profiles of <b>purpose</b> emerged in Study 2 : Achieved <b>Purpose</b> (high <b>purpose</b> exploration/high <b>purpose</b> commitment), Unattained <b>Purpose</b> (high exploration/low commitment), and Diffused <b>Purpose</b> (low exploration/low commitment). Adolescents in the Achieved <b>Purpose</b> group had higher indicators of motivation, mattering, conscientiousness, and hope than their peers. Study 3 found that <b>purpose</b> profiles were associated with engaged living, but not school engagement. Students in the Unattained <b>Purpose</b> group were less engaged than their peers in the community through activity involvement and volunteerism. Findings from this study reveal the importance of both motivation and contextual factors in fostering purposefulness among African American youth in urban schools. Efforts to improve achievement and well-being for students in urban contexts should consider interventions that provide opportunities for students to discover <b>purpose</b> and engage in activities that can support optimal development...|$|R

30|$|The Laozi’s idea is {{whatever}} we do must have a <b>purpose</b> in our job, <b>purpose</b> allows us to fulfil ourselves effectively and efficiently. Laozi uses the metaphor of people who occupy different jobs to illustrate impact of <b>purpose</b> on performance. A good passenger’s <b>purpose</b> is to leave no tracks and footprint wherever he travels; a good speaker’s <b>purpose</b> is to make no slips whenever he speaks; a good accountant’s <b>purpose</b> is to make no miscalculation even when he does not use calculator; a good locker’s <b>purpose</b> is to keep doors unlocked {{even if he does}} not use bolts; and a good knotter’s <b>purpose</b> is to keep knots untied even when he does not use ropes. Laozi’s idea in this passage is more concerned with job <b>purpose</b> instead of job function. In our modern business philosophy, job <b>purpose</b> is different from job function. Job function is the set of tasks a person performs in their role, whereas job <b>purpose</b> is the intended outcome of the job in terms of its impact on organization, community, customers, society or environment (Izzo & Vanderwielen, 2018). Those who have high <b>purpose</b> in their jobs and lives work effectively and efficiently are less prone to waste of resources. As a result, whatever they do {{have a positive impact on}} environment and society. The purpose-driven or effective leaders must understand the distinction between job function and job <b>purpose,</b> and instill a sense of <b>purpose</b> in their job and act on it.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the search for purpose—defined as the attempt to find or enact one’s unique <b>purpose</b> in life. While much is known about the benefits of a purposeful existence (i. e., higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction and general well-being, reduced risk for psychopathologies, and greater physical health), far less is known about the effects of the search process. The first half of this document reviews what psychologists know about <b>purpose,</b> the benefits of <b>purpose,</b> and the search for <b>purpose.</b> The second half explores a new construct: <b>purpose</b> anxiety, a term meant to encapsulate the negative ramifications of the struggle for <b>purpose</b> in life. It also presents the findings of an original research study conducted to gather empirical data on <b>purpose,</b> the search for <b>purpose,</b> and <b>purpose</b> anxiety as perceived and experienced by American adults. Results indicated {{that the vast majority of}} people crave a sense of <b>purpose</b> in life, but nearly always encounter <b>purpose</b> anxiety during their search process, no matter the searcher’s age. Results also showed that <b>purpose</b> anxiety significantly hampers well-being—both overall and each element of PERMA. This project in no way intends to suggest that individuals should avoid searching for <b>purpose.</b> Rather, it merely means to enhance psychology’s knowledge of the search process so that interventions may be developed to prevent or mitigate the psychological distress that so often accompanies the struggle for <b>purpose</b> in life...|$|R
