5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to {{what was then the}} most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E

25|$|A {{functional}} model must thus achieve two aims {{in order}} to be of use. It must furnish a throughput description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last throughput states, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described in terms of this mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the throughput, but once again this is not.|$|E
25|$|Leaving a small {{force on}} the {{northern}} shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the Río Paraná for about 160 kilometers, where he founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the Río Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, after having obtained some silver objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the Río Paraná and entered the Río Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaraní tribes until a strong force of Agaces Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunción, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaraní in possession of silver objects, <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoils of Garcia's treasure. Imagining {{that he had found}} the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river Río de la Plata.|$|E

2500|$|It appears 1959 was {{a pivotal}} year for promotional model makers, and PMC in particular. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's decline {{had to do}} with the expense of {{engineering}} the new non-warping styrene plastic mixed with the tooling required to make the ever more popular kits that other manufacturers took up. PMC's kits were very simple and not as well known as those of AMT, SMP or Jo-Han. As a company, Jo-Han did well, but was always the lesser of the Big Three (being AMT, MPC and JoHan. Venerable maker SMP was absorbed by AMT, but PMC was several rungs down the promo ladder by 1960 and gradually weakened through the decade.|$|E
2500|$|David Maine {{wrote for}} PopMatters that [...] "there is little here to criticize. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{transitions}} {{are a bit}} abrupt, [...] {{maybe some of the}} characterization could be sharper." [...] Similarly, Sean Michael Robinson of The Comics Journal said Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths for its theme [...] "as well as its many strengths and virtues, it is a very difficult book to criticize". [...] Robinson's critics was that it has [...] "loosely characterized" [...] characters and that its art [...] "can also be a stumbling block". He said the art is [...] "problematic", is [...] "the hand-off—when characters suddenly leap modes, bouncy and expressive one moment, and photo-rendered and flat the next". Tom Spurgeon, writing for The Comics Reporter, said he had difficulty [...] "in not being able to easily track which soldiers are which at any one point in the book".|$|E
2500|$|After he {{completed}} subduing Mytilene, Paches sent {{the greater part}} of his army back to Athens, and sent with it the Mytileneans whom he had identified as particularly culpable in the revolt and the captured Spartan general Salaethus. [...] Salaethus was executed immediately, although he suggested that, in return for his life, he would have the Spartan force besieging Plataea withdrawn. [...] The assembly then turned its attention {{to the question of what}} to do with the prisoners at Athens and the rest of the Mytileneans back on Lesbos. [...] What followed was one of the most famous debates in the history of the Athenian democracy, and one of only two occasions on which Thucydides records the content, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual words, of the opposing speeches in the assembly. [...] As such, the debate has been the subject of much scholarly analysis, aimed elucidating both the circumstances of the revolt and the internal politics of Athens at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{clinical}} {{case that}} would a priori suggest a module for modularity in visual processing is visual agnosia. The well studied patient DF {{is unable to}} recognize or discriminate objects owing to damage {{in areas of the}} lateral occipital cortex although she can see scenes without problem – she can literally see the forest but not the trees. Neuroimaging of intact individuals reveals strong occipito-temporal activation during object presentation and greater activation still for object recognition. Of course, such activation could be due to other processes, such as visual attention. However, other evidence that shows a tight coupling of perceptual and physiological changes suggests activation in this area does underpin object recognition. Within these regions are more specialized areas for face or fine grained analysis, place perception and human body perception. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest evidence for the modular nature of these processing systems is the double dissociation between object- and face (prosop-) agnosia. However, as with color and motion, early areas (see [...] for a comprehensive review) are implicated too, lending support {{to the idea of a}} multistage stream terminating in the inferotemporal cortex rather than an isolated module.|$|E
