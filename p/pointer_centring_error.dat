The difference between the change-point estimator of the resampled sequence and the one of the original sequence can be used as an approximation of the difference between the real change-point and its estimator. This enables us to construct confidence intervals using the empirical distribution of the resampled time series.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Increasing {{practical}} {{interest has}} been shown in regression problems where the errors, or disturbances, are centred in a way that reflects particular characteristics of the mechanism that generated the data. In economics this occurs in problems involving data on markets, productivity and auctions, where it can be natural to centre at an endpoint of the error distribution, rather than at the distribution’s mean. Often these cases have an extreme-value character, and in that broader context, examples involving meteorological, record-value and production-frontier data have been discussed in the literature. We shall discuss nonparametric methods for estimating regression curves in these settings, showing that they have features that contrast so starkly with those in better-understood problems that they lead to apparent contradictions. For example, merely by <b>centring</b> <b>errors</b> at their endpoints rather than their means the problem can change from one with a familiar nonparametric character, where the optimal convergence rate is slower than n− 1 / 2, to one in the super-efficient class, where the optimal rate is faster than n− 1 / 2.

40|$|Extracellular electrograms {{recorded}} during {{atrial fibrillation}} (AF) are challenging to interpret {{due to the}} inherent beat-to-beat variability in amplitude and duration. Phase mapping represents these voltage signals in terms of relative position within the cycle, and has been widely applied to action potential and unipolar electrogram data of myocardial fibrillation. To date, however, {{it has not been}} applied to bipolar recordings, which are commonly acquired clinically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present a novel algorithm for calculating phase from both unipolar and bipolar electrograms recorded during AF. A sequence of signal filters and processing steps are used to calculate phase from simulated, experimental, and clinical, unipolar and bipolar electrograms. The algorithm is validated against action potential phase using simulated data (trajectory <b>centre</b> <b>error</b> < 0. 8  mm); between experimental multi-electrode array unipolar and bipolar phase; and for wavefront identification in clinical atrial tachycardia. For clinical AF, similar rotational content (R (2)  =  0. 79) and propagation maps (median correlation 0. 73) were measured using either unipolar or bipolar recordings. The algorithm is robust, uses standard signal processing techniques, and accurately quantifies AF wavefronts and sources.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a discriminative {{multi-task}} sparse learning scheme for object tracking in a particle filter framework. By representing each particle as a linear combination of adaptive dictionary templates, we utilise the correlations among different particles (tasks) {{to obtain a}} better representation and a more efficient scheme than learning each task individually. However, this model is completely generative and the designed tracker may not be robust enough to prevent the drifting problem {{in the presence of}} rapid appearance changes. In this paper, we use a Conditional Random Field along with a multi-task sparse model to extend our scheme to distinguish the object candidate from the background particle candidate. By this way, the number of particle samples is reduced significantly, while we make the tracker more robust. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 10 challenging sequences. The results confirm the effectiveness of the approach, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of accuracy measures including the <b>centre</b> location <b>error</b> and the overlap ratio, respectively.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{hip joint}} angles during selected motor tasks using stereophotogrammetric data, {{it is necessary}} to determine the hip joint centre position. The question is whether the errors affecting that determination propagate less to the angles estimates when a three degrees of freedom (DOFs) constraint (spherical hinge) is used between femur and pelvis, rather than when the two bones are assumed to be unconstrained (six DOFs). An analytical relationship between the hip joint <b>centre</b> location <b>error</b> and the joint angle error was obtained limited to the planar case. In the 3 -D case, a similar relationship was obtained using a simulation approach based on experimental data. The joint angle patterns resulted in a larger distortion using a constrained approach, especially when wider rotations occur. The range of motion of the hip flexion–extension, obtained simulating different location errors and without taking into account soft tissue artefacts, varied approximately 7 deg using a constrained approach and up to 1 deg when calculated with an unconstrained approach. Thus, the unconstrained approach should be preferred even though its estimated three linear DOFs most unlikely carry meaningful information...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{structure}} attributes {{produced from}} terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) rely on normalisation {{of the point}} cloud values from sensor coordinates to height above ground. One method {{to do this is}} through the derivation of an accurate and repeatable digital elevation model (DEM) from the TLS point cloud that is used to adjust the height. The primary aim of this paper was to test a number of TLS scan configurations, filtering options and output DEM grid resolutions (from 0. 02 m to 1. 0 m) to define a best practice method for DEM generation in sub-tropical forest environments. The generated DEMs were compared to both total station (TS) spot heights and a 1 -m DEM generated from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to assess accuracy. The comparison to TS spot heights found that a DEM produced using the minimum elevation (minimum Z value) from a point cloud derived from a single scan had mean errors > 1 m for DEM grid resolutions < 0. 2 m at a 25 -m plot radius. At a 1 -m grid resolution, the mean error was 0. 19 m. The addition of a filtering approach that combined a median filter with a progressive morphological filter and a global percentile filter was able to reduce mean error of the 0. 02 -m grid resolution DEM to 0. 31 m at a 25 -m plot radius using all returns. Using multiple scan positions to derive the DEM reduced the mean error for all DEM methods. Our results suggest that a simple minimum Z filtering DEM method using a single scan at the grid resolution of 1 m can produce mean errors < 0. 2 m, but for a small grid resolution, such as 0. 02 m, a more complex filtering approach and multiple scan positions are required to reduced mean errors. The additional validation data provided by the 1 -m ALS DEM showed that when using the combined filtering method on a point cloud derived from a single scan at the plot <b>centre,</b> <b>errors</b> between 0. 1 and 0. 5 m occurred in the TLS DEM for all tested grid resolutions at a plot radius of 25 m.

40|$|Abstract – Background: A {{principal}} design {{choice in}} providing steering wheel force feedback to assist drivers during lane-keeping is whether feedback {{should be provided}} for any error {{with respect to the}} lane centre (continuous feedback) or only when acceptable tolerance limits are exceeded (bandwidth feedback). Problem: Research has shown that continuously assisting the driver by means of steering wheel force feedback improves driver performance and reduces mental workload. However, {{it has been suggested that}} continuous feedback induces aftereffects during subsequent manual driving. Method: In a fixed-base driving simulator study, we evaluated driver performance and mental workload, while drivers (n= 32) received corrective force feedback on the steering wheel. Five designs were compared, namely no feedback (Manual), discrete bandwidth feedback (Band 1), bandwidth feedback with a hysteresis filter (Band 2), continuous feedback with feedback gain used in earlier studies (Cont), and continuous feedback with a feedback gain twice as strong (ContS). While driving the participants performed a secondary peripheral detection task. Participants were told that the feedback was not fully reliable. Towards the end of the trajectory the feedback algorithm was shut down in order to investigate short-term aftereffects. After each trial the participant would fill out a NASA-TLX and a Vanderlaan-questionnaire to measure workload, usefulness and satisfaction. Results: All four feedback designs eliminated the large lane centre deviations that occasionally occur during manual control. Both continuous feedback designs yielded smaller lane <b>centre</b> <b>errors</b> than bandwidth feedback and manual control. Shortly after the feedback was shut down, ContS resulted in worse lane keeping performance than Manual and bandwidth feedback. The secondary task showed a lower reaction time for Cont compared to Band 1 and the NASA-TLX indicated lower workload for continuous feedback compared to manual control. The satisfaction scale of the Vanderlaan-questionnaire showed a significantly higher score for Cont compared to Band 1. When the feedback shut down, drivers supported by ContS showed a lower minimum TLC, higher mean and maximum absolute lateral error, and more near lane departures. Conclusions: Providing the driver with continuous feedback is an effective way to improve the lane keeping performance and is experienced by drivers as more satisfactory and intuitive, as compared to bandwidth force feedback and manual steering. Bandwidth feedback is equally effective in preventing excessive deviation from the lane centre and did not suffer from the aftereffects that the ContS system did. Stronger continuous feedback resulted in better lane keeping performance, but also in larger aftereffects. The Cont design had a good performance, was perceived as satisfactory and showed no significant short-term aftereffects. Nevertheless, future research should point out if long-term behavioural adaptations lead to stronger aftereffects for continuous systems.

Based on any initial sea surface displacement, the database allows the fast calculation of full waveforms at the 50  m isobath offshore of coastal sites of interest by linear superposition. A computationally inexpensive procedure is set to estimate the coefficients for the linear superposition based on the potential energy of the initial elevation field. The elementary sources size and spacing is fine enough to satisfactorily reproduce the effects of M > [*]=[*] 6. 0 earthquakes. Tsunami propagation is modelled by using the Tsunami-HySEA code, a GPU finite volume solver for the non-linear shallow water equations. Like other existing methods based on the initial sea level elevation, the database is independent on the faulting geometry and mechanism, which makes it applicable in any tectonic environment. We model a large set of synthetic tsunami test scenarios, selected to explore the uncertainty introduced when approximating tsunami waveforms and their maxima by fast and simplified linear combination. This {{is the first time}} to our knowledge that the uncertainty associated to such a procedure is systematically analysed and that relatively small earthquakes are considered, which may be relevant in the near-field of the source in a complex tectonic setting. We find that non-linearity of tsunami evolution affects the reconstruction of the waveforms and of their maxima by introducing an almost unbiased (<b>centred</b> at zero) <b>error</b> distribution of relatively modest extent. The uncertainty introduced by our approximation can be in principle propagated to forecast results. The resulting product then is suitable for different applications such as probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis, tsunami source inversions and tsunami warning systems...|$|R
40|$|IEEE 802. 11 p, which {{operates}} at 5. 9 GHz, {{has been the}} widely adopted communications standard for vehicular communications and this has prompted studies at different physical locations on the network performance, pathloss, Doppler and delay spreads in the 5. 9 GHz radio channel. This thesis presents novel measurements of network performance, signal strength and Doppler spread under NLOS conditions at three T-junctions with different street widths and building layouts. The study {{found that there was}} less received power and poorer network performance in intersections with single/dual lanes and fewer buildings {{on either side of the}} roads – the maximum range for reliable operation (> 90 %) of the network is reduced to approximately 10 m from the intersection centre. Higher signal strength in the presence of buildings is consistent with multipath propagation contributing positively towards the signal strength as shown by a site specific ray tracing model developed as part of this project. Signal strength measurements were compared with predictions from the model virtualsource 11 p and a median error less than 5 dB was found for measurements in urban environments and closer to the intersection <b>centre.</b> The median <b>error</b> was greater than 10 dB and increased with the distance from the intersection centre in junctions with wider roads and fewer buildings either side of the road. The relationship between a vehicle’s size and the Doppler spread it causes is another unique observation of this study and has been investigated by developing a simple model. Doppler spreads become larger as the reflecting vehicle moves closer to the transmitter and receiver and when the size of this vehicle is larger. A directional antenna was used to determine the azimuth of arrival of the strongest multipath components with the observations demonstrating the importance of including transient features in maps when ray tracing...|$|R
