40|$|AbstractMobile <b>apps</b> <b>development</b> {{has been}} gaining {{popularity}} in Malaysia over the past 3 years. An app usually refers to a software application or programme. Although the development of software applications {{have been around for}} decades, <b>app</b> <b>development</b> on mobile devices reached the shores of Malaysia, mainly due to the popularity of Apple's <b>App</b> Store. Software <b>development</b> and complex object-oriented programming have been the exclusive harbour of technology hobbyists, IT professionals and business executives for many years. The flourishing presence of Web applications and the over-whelming influence of social media has augmented our need for greater connectivity, sharing and online presence. These have allowed smartphones and gadgets to become mainstream. This paper looks at how a design institution in Malaysia provides the growth of mobile <b>apps</b> <b>development,</b> and in supporting the national agenda to drive the Malaysian web and mobile application development industry to global standards.

40|$|Proceedings of the ECIS 2014 Paper Development Workshop, Tel Aviv, Israel,The underrepresentation {{of women}} in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector is a {{challenge}} despite the existing conducive opportunity for a career in ICT. In this digital era where smartphones are almost synonymous with urban living, this paper sought to explore the social sustainability of gender diversity as a degree of involvement {{of women in}} technically developing mobile <b>apps</b> (<b>apps).</b> <b>App</b> <b>development</b> is an emergent lucrative career choice today and is predicted to remain as such for the foreseeable future. The research drew on the individual differences theory of gender in ICT by Eileen Trauth (2006; 2004) to explore {{the extent to which the}} underrepresentation has similarly permeated <b>app</b> <b>development.</b> The findings from the exploratory study of 44 app developers in South Africa suggest that gender underrepresentation and bias has spread to <b>app</b> <b>development.</b> The results nonetheless reveal a similar degree of interest among women as men to attempt a career in <b>app</b> <b>development,</b> but more especially, that women have a preference for collaborative <b>app</b> <b>development</b> environments. For practice, the results call for more deliberate efforts and interventions to change female perceptions about <b>app</b> <b>development</b> and to stem the ever widening technological gender gap in a region where the mobile phone market has exploded. The study also lends support to the social constructionist view that women underrepresentation is ICT not primarily a result of essentialist differences between men and women but more a result of social and cultural habits.
