5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{national}} media began to report the extreme wealth of some Texans in magazines such as Life and Fortune. A stereotype emerged of the nouveau-riche Texas oil millionaire, popularized by the media. The popular image was often characterized by a rough and combative personality, heavy drinking, and extravagant spending. In 1956, the motion picture Giant helped to crystallize the image of Texans in the popular imagination as comical, eccentric figures. Glenn McCarthy was {{the inspiration for the}} character of Jett Rink in the film. Other films such as Boom Town and War of the Wildcats, and books such as The Lusty Texans of Dallas and Houston: Land of the Big Rich, also contributed to <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of oil's influence in Texas and surrounding states.|$|E
40|$|The <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of {{the social}} work {{profession}} is a rarely considered perspective, and yet a topic that is a concern to front Thepublic’sperceptionofthesocialworkprofessionisararelyconsideredperspective and yet a topic that is a concern to front line professionals. This paper explores how social workers experience and attempt to cope with <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of their profession. It highlights the impact of these concerns on social workers’ personal experiences and professional practice. Using semi-structured interviews with sixteen UK social workers, from local authorities and private organisations,we explore the experiences of this group. Thematic analysis of the data identified four concerns: the experience of <b>public</b> <b>perception,</b> drivers of <b>public</b> <b>perception,</b> coping with <b>public</b> <b>perception,</b> and mechanisms to raise the professions profile. Examining <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> through the eyes of social workers provides valuable insights into the lived experiences of these professionals, and offers practical implications at both the micro and macro levels. It reveals two key ways in which the profession can begin to address the prevailing negative perception considered to be emanating from the public: through developing a more co-operative relationship with external sources of <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> (e. g. government and the media) and by engaging in more pro-active self-promotion of the service...|$|R
40|$|Between 1952 and 2011, many nuclear {{accidents}} {{transformed the}} <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of nuclear power, yet there {{continues to be}} a disconnected relationship between the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of nuclear accidents and the governmental perception of nuclear accidents. In the 1950 s, nuclear accidents were quite unknown and people did not understand the negative consequences associated with such events. By 2011, nuclear accidents had become more known, and people understood the negative consequences and other implications that were associated with such events; this is also the time period where the disconnected relationship becomes more evident. The literature on nuclear accidents seems to focus largely on social, psychological and environmental scientific perspectives, but what is missing is the ethical perspective of this change in <b>public</b> <b>perception.</b> Study of the ethical perspective of this change in <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> can add to the current literature on nuclear accidents by showing that ethical thought is influenced and shaped through learning from the negative consequences of historical events. Drawing on the works of Roderick Nash and Gordon Graham, this thesis explores the ethical and historical perspectives of this change in <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of nuclear accidents and how this change will contribute to future energy use policies. I argue that this change in the <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of nuclear accidents stemmed from lessons learned from multiple nuclear accidents that occurred from 1952 to 2011. As the <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of nuclear accidents changes, the disconnected relationship between the <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> and the governmental perception becomes more evident...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{study sought to}} investigate the <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> of paedophiles. It was undertaken in Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Leicester (England) {{in an attempt to}} determine whether or not regional variations existed in relation to the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of paedophiles. In doing this, the study sought to test four hypotheses; (1) That the press affects the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of paedophiles; (2) that the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of paedophiles is not congruent with legal and clinical definitions; (3) that the Sarah Payne case has helped to reinforce the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> of a predatory paedophile; and (4) that the <b>public’s</b> <b>perception</b> is based on fear and irrationality. These hypotheses were tested via the distribution of a questionnaire to an opportunistic sample on the streets of Belfast and Leicester. Although the results did not support the hypotheses, they did yield some very interesting information. The study indicated that the public is quite well-informed about paedophilia; its recurrence rates, practices and in particular the influence of the media. Furthermore, the study indicated quite significant differences between the cities of Belfast and Leicester. In conclusion, the results indicated that a moral panic connected to paedophilia is very present in our contemporary society...|$|R
5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
