5|$|The {{original}} Mrs. Dow's School building {{remains as}} the co-ed residence hall Dow Hall at Pace University. Residents of Briarcliff Manor were initially {{pleased to have}} another educational institution at the site, although Pace illegally turned its 188-spot parking lot into an 800-spot one, and allowed an extensive number of cars to be <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neighboring streets. The village government and school eventually reached a compromise.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Vestby Station {{has seen}} several {{accidents}} and injuries. In January 2004, a Linx train from Gothenburg, travelling at , {{crashed into a}} plowing car that was partly <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway tracks at Vestby. No passengers were hurt in the accident. It was victim of sabotage in March 2004, when some local youth laid steel pipes over the tracks. In 2006, a two-year-old boy fell down from the platform and was {{run over by a}} passing train. In June 2010, the station building caught fire {{in the middle of the}} night, but left no injuries.|$|E
5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US {{aircraft}} to enter North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent {{aircraft to}} scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The aircraft was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.|$|E

25|$|The area {{through which}} the St. Charles Avenue Line {{traveled}} fared comparatively well in Hurricane Katrina's devastating impact on New Orleans {{at the end of}} August 2005, with moderate flooding only of the two ends of the line at Claiborne Avenue and at Canal Street. However, wind damage and falling trees took out many sections of trolley wire along St. Charles Avenue, and vehicles <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neutral ground (traffic medians) over the inactive tracks degraded parts of the right-of-way. At the start of October 2005, as this part of town started being repopulated, bus service began running on the St. Charles line.|$|E
25|$|All {{traffic from}} Gran Canaria, {{including}} five large airliners, had been diverted to Los Rodeos, a regional airport {{that could not}} easily accommodate them. The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway parallel to it, with four short taxiways connecting the two. While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen, the diverted aircraft took up so much space that they were <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long taxiway, meaning {{that it could not}} be used for taxiing. Instead, departing aircraft had to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack.|$|E
