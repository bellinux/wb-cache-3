40|$|Understanding the hydrologic {{behavior}} of bioretention systems during months of <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> {{is of particular}} concern in the semi-arid American West {{where most of the}} limited annual rainfall occurs in winter. In order to directly measure the water balance and obtain an estimate for evapotranspiration, three bioretention systems were established including: a noplant control, a native plant community that requires no additional irrigation in semi-arid climates, and an irrigated wetland community. Runoff events that represent the average precipitation regime were simulated once per month from October to April. By introducing a known quantity of water to the system and measuring the quantity of water flowing out, evapotranspiration was approximated. Fluctuations in soil storage were accounted for using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and all systems were sealed to prevent infiltration. Effluent volume was measured directly using a tipping bucket and data logger. This spring, leaf level transpiration will be measured using a LI-COR 6400 infrared gas analyzer to better understand water use patterns. Testing continues on this project, and the data reported includes results for the winter of 2011 - 2012. Preliminary findings indicate that all of the water flowing into each garden flows is accounted for in the effluent to within 10 gallons. As expected, transpiration rates appear to be minimal during <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy.</b> This suggests that for bioretention sites in xeric climate regimes winter water losses will be due primarily to garden exfiltration and not plant processes...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{experience}} of abiotic environmental {{factors such as}} temperature and light are well known to control seed <b>dormancy</b> in many <b>plant</b> species. Maternal biotic stress alters offspring defence phenotypes, but whether it also affects seed dormancy remains unexplored. We exposed Arabidopsis thaliana plants to herbivory and investigated plasticity in germination and defence phenotypes in their offspring, along with the roles of phytohormone signalling in regulating maternal effects. Maternal herbivory resulted in the accumulation of jasmonic acid-isoleucine and loss of dormancy in seeds of stressed <b>plants.</b> <b>Dormancy</b> was also reduced by engineering seed-specific accumulation of jasmonic acid in transgenic <b>plants.</b> Loss of <b>dormancy</b> was dependent on an intact jasmonate signalling pathway and was associated with increased gibberellin content and reduced abscisic acid sensitivity during germination. Altered dormancy was only observed in the first generation following herbivory, whereas defence priming was maintained {{for at least two}} generations. Herbivory generates a jasmonic acid-dependent reduction in seed dormancy, mediated by alteration of gibberellin and abscisic acid signalling. This is a direct maternal effect, operating independently from transgenerational herbivore resistance priming...|$|R

Pertinently, research on the effects of season of burn on the grass sward in southern Africa (West 1965, Trollope 1987) has shown the importance of <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> in minimizing the harmful effects of fire on the regrowth of grass plants, thereby promoting support for the desirability of applying prescribed burns throughout the entire dry winter period. The practice in the communal fire paradigm of applying grazing as soon as possible after a burn to take advantage of the highly palatable and nutritious regrowth of the grass sward is also now incorporated into the commercial fire paradigm. Intensive research conducted by Zacharias (1994) and Kirkman (2001) showed the benefits of this practice on positive animal performance, provided it was accompanied by a regular rotational resting program in the overall range management system, and encouraged the adoption of this indigenous practice.|$|E

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>{{dormancy}}</b> and dormancy breaking depend, {{at least}} partially, on close relationships between buds and tissues underlying bud (bud stands). In Prunus persica, the dormancy {{was related to}} high nutrient absorption in bud stands linked to high plasmalemma ATPase (EC 3. 6. 1. 3) activity. Two plasmalemma fractions was isolated from peach vegetative buds and bud stands using aqueous phase partitioning and ultracentrifugation. Results of markers enzyme assays indicated that both plasmalemma enriched fractions obtained were highly purified. During the dormancy period plasma membrane ATPase amount and activity were higher in bud stands than in buds. Moreover, assays performed at different temperatures (4, 18, 30 °C) indicated modifications of kinetic parameters (Km, Vm) in both tissues during dormancy release. In buds, from November to February, Km declined at 4 °C and increased at 30 °C whereas no changes was measured at 18 °C and Vm increased at all temperature. In bud stands, no changes of Km was measured at 4 °C and 18 °C whereas an increase occurred at 30 °C and Vm decreased at all temperature.

40|$|Summary Subcellular {{localization}} {{of calcium}} in apical bud cells of mulberry (Morus bombciz Koidz) was investigated {{by a combination}} of calcium antimonate precipitation and electron microscopy (EM), over a 10 -month period extending from July to May. Calcium antimonate deposits, an indication of Ca 2 + lo-calization, were found mainly in the intercellular spaces and vacuoles of tissues collected in summer (e. g., July 10). Few de-posits were seen in the cytosol and the nucleus, indicating that when plants were actively growing, the cytoplasm had a low concentration of Ca 2 +. As the day length became shorter (e. g., August 8), Ca 2 + deposits increased in the cytosol and the nu-cleus. When <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> and cold hardiness were rapidly developing in September and October, a large number of Ca 2 + deposits were seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where they remained for about 60 days.

Although there is important literature on the management of these species for biomass production on marginal lands, numerous aspects of their biology are as yet unexplored at the molecular level. Perenniality, a key agronomic trait, is a function of <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> and winter survival of the belowground parts of the plants. These include the crowns, rhizomes and meristems that will produce tillers. Maintaining meristem viability is critical for the continued survival of the plants.

There is nutrient mobilization from the aerial portions of the plant to the crowns and rhizomes during tiller senescence. Signals arising from the shoots and from the environment can be expected to be integrated as the plants enter into dormancy. Plant senescence and dormancy have been well studied in several dicot species and offer a potential framework to understand these processes in temperate C 4 perennial grasses. The availability of latitudinally adapted populations for switchgrass presents an opportunity to dissect molecular mechanisms that can impact senescence, dormancy and winter survival.

B. S. P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud.) seedlings subjected to typical northern Ontario, Canada, spring conditions in climate chambers after different exposures to natural chilling. Results indicate that chilling requirements (cumulative weighted chilling hours) differed substantially among the seven species, ranging from 300 to 500 h for spruce seedlings to more than 1100 h for trembling aspen and lodgepole pine. Only spruce seedlings had fulfilled their chilling requirements before December 31, whereas the other species continued chilling well into March and April. Species with lower chilling requirements needed more heat accumulation for budburst and vice versa. Insufficient chilling delayed budburst but only extremely restricted chilling hours (< 400) resulted in abnormal budburst and growth, including reduced needle and shoot expansion, early budburst in lower crowns, and erratic budburst on lower stems and roots. Effects, however, depended on both the species’ chilling requirements and the chilling–heat relationship. Among the seven tree species examined, trembling aspen {{is most likely to}} be affected by reduced chilling accumulation possible under future climate scenarios, followed by balsam poplar, white birch, lodgepole pine, and jack pine.

Omnivores can exploit a range of diff erent food resources {{over the course of}} a year, but they often rely on seasonally restricted highly nutritious fruiting bodies during critical life stages. Brown bears Ursus arctos in Sweden are dependent on berries for fattening before entering hibernation. We used a ten-year time series to evaluate the eff ect of temperature and snow on annual variation in berry abundance and how this variation aff ected bears. We found marked interannual variation in berry production of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and lingonberry V. vitis-idaea, that we could attribute in part to temperature during <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> and flowering and precipitation during fruit ripening. Both, autumn weights of female bears and spring weights of yearling bears increased linearly with bilberry abundance. When bilberry abundance was low, lightweight female bears had a lower reproductive success than females in better condition. Th is eff ect vanished when food abundance was above average, indicating that lightweight females could compensate for their initial weight during good bilberry years. Our study highlights the importance of considering individuals ’ dynamic responses to variation in food availability, which leave some more vulnerable to food shortage than others. Individual life-history heterogeneity in response to resource variation likely aff ects long-term population recruitment. Our fi ndings emphasize that Scandinavian bears can be dependent on a single food resource during a critical period of the year and are therefore less resilient to environmental change than expected for an omnivore. Future climate scenarios predict ambiguous trends for weather covariates that aff ected crucial stages of berry phenology, preventing a clear prognosis of how climate change may aff ect long-term bilberry production...|$|E

Three bioretention cells were established in 2010 to test the nitrogen treatment performance of different vegetation communities during times when the majority of the plants are dormant: 1) a no-plant control, 2) an upland native community that does not require irrigation in semi-arid climates, and 3) a wetland community that requires irrigation. To test the performance of these three treatments during winter and before plants re-activate in the spring, runoff events were simulated to represent an average precipitation regime using a synthetic stormwater blend created by mixing tap water with commercially available mulch soil amender. Mass load reductions were measured for total nitrogen (TN), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia (NH 4), and nitrate and nitrite (NOx) from one synthetic storm each month from November to March. The cells were said to “retain” nitrogen if the mass of nitrogen in the effluent was less than the total mass of nitrogen in the influent; cells are said to “leach” nitrogen if the mass of nitrogen in the effluent was greater than the influent. Preliminary findings show that minimum nutrient treatment performance occurred in January.

40|$|Proceedings of the 1991 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 19 - 20, 1991, Athens, Georgia. Land {{application}} {{is a viable}} alternative to conventional waste treatment plants for environmentally safe disposal of liquid wastes. To ensure protection of the state's water resources, guidelines have been established specifying variables that should be considered in design of land application systems. These guidelines also specify maximum levels of hydraulic loading, heavy metals in the soil, and N concentration in water percolating through the soil (Georgia EPD, 1986). Any of these three factors may limit the annual amount of waste applied to a site. For hydrologic loading, the design criteria are based on monthly net precipitation (precipitation - potential evapotranspiration) and soil properties that influence the hydrology of the soil. The maximum monthly rate of waste {{application is}} determined by the month in which net precipitation plus monthly waste addition is maximal. Total net precipitation plus waste additions during this month cannot exceed the soil's capacity to transmit the liquid without ponding and runoff. If nitrogen content of the waste is such that limits on soil percolate N concentration will be exceeded with application rates which meet hydrologic loading criteria, size of spray field area is determined based on an annual rather than monthly N balance. The major sink for N considered in design of land application systems is plant uptake. Rather than being uniform throughout the year as suggested by the current practice of using annual values in the system design, crop growth and associated N uptake is cyclic, and depending on the crop or crops growing, periods of <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> or reduced growth may occur when little or none of applied N is being removed from the soil. Thus, during these periods N applied may move quickly through the soil profile and potentially to shallow ground water. This may be especially true in Georgia where warm temperatures promote rapid nitrification and the retentive capacity of the soils for ammonium is low. Models to predict nitrate leaching through soils under different climatic and management regimes are currently available and improved versions are steadily being released. These models simulate N uptake by crops, N transformations such as nitrification, denitrification, and volatilization, and water and nitrate movement through the soil, and offer the opportunity {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} N removal by land treatment under various management, climatic, and soil conditions. The objective of this study was to use a N leaching model to evaluate the soil N balance under different soil and management conditions for a hypothetical land application system sized by current design criteria.

Hence, a new, more sustainable approach is promoted in this thesis and, besides meeting the protection requirements, takes into consideration the resources that can be recovered from the treatment processes, keeping in mind the energy use during such a recovery. To achieve this goal, a better knowledge of wastewater and contaminated soil treatment approaches needs to be developed, from a resource recovery perspective. In this thesis project, laboratory, pilot-scale and full-scale investigations were conducted to study phosphorus (P) sorption in blast furnace slag (BF slag) filters. Further, ammonium adsorption by, and desorption from, clinoptilolite was studied in laboratory columns. A full-scale wastewater treatment system, comprising a willow bed followed by two parallel P–filters with BF slag and Filtralite® P media was examined for the wastewater treatment efficiency, nutrient accumulation in willow biomass, and biomass production. In a similar way, laboratory, pilot-scale and full-scale investigations were conducted to examine arsenic (As) removal from As contaminated soils using physical separation and chemical extraction. Finally, the decontamination of the extraction effluents (contaminated by As) was studied by adjusting pH and adding a coagulant, iron chloride. Pollutant mobilisation and immobilisation were affected by pH, the organic mattercontent, redox potential, time (process duration) and temperature. Results showed that pollutants in the studied media have complex characteristics in terms of charge of species and redox speciation, and therefore, no general conclusions addressing all the conditions studied could be given. The P sorption capacity of BF slag was reduced by outdoor storage and weathering, {{and the content of}} organic substances in sewage seemed to have a more negative impact on the sorption process when using weathered BF slag. Arsenic mobilisation from As contaminated soils was affected by pH, the content of organic substances, and redox potential and the nature of these effects depended on the polluting chemicals (i. e. wood preservatives) and the content of calcium in the soil. Extractions at elevated temperatures facilitated high As mobilisation from the contaminated soils for short contact times, assuming that the extraction solution features vital for As mobilisation were not altered, and the fastest As mobilisation was achieved by using an acid oxalate citrate solution rather than reductive or alkaline extraction solutions at room temperatures. In the full-scale treatment system, the willow bed efficiently reduced the content of total suspended solids and biodegradable organic matter in the influent wastewater and prevented the clogging of downstream phosphorus filters during the one year of operation. The Filtralite® P treatment train simultaneously removed over 90 and 70 % of BOD and P, respectively, during the experimental period, and therefore, fulfilled the requirements for the low protection level over the period of one year, except for tot-P excesses during the snowmelt period. In the case of tot-N reduction (50 %), the high protection level was achieved. On the other hand, the treatment system with BF slag did not fulfil requirements for either low or high protection level, because the coarse-grained BF slag was inefficient in retaining P and the concentrations of oxygen consuming compounds were elevated downstream of the filter. The studied methods for recovering resources through treatment of wastewater and contaminated soils demonstrated a potential for improving environmental sustainability of these processes. Even though the willow bed did not accumulate nutrients from the fed wastewater to a high degree, it facilitated nutrient recovery in other treatment steps located downstream. Fresh, fine-grained BF slag showed capacity to recover P from wastewater, which was comparable to that of other efficient P sorbents. The BF slag material released high amounts of sulphuric compounds during the initial loading phase which consequently increased the concentration of oxygen consuming compounds in the filter effluent. Thus, the use of BF slag for P retention is not recommended when the effluent is discharged to sensitive receiving waters. Natural clinoptilolite studied showed a high capacity for adsorbing ammonium from the pre-treated wastewater, at low operating temperatures. Hence, the clinoptilolite filter has a potential to enhance N retention during the <b>plant</b> <b>dormancy</b> or prior to the maturity of willow beds when N retention is needed. However, the recovery of ammonium was limited by the inefficient desorption process using tap water without recycling the eluate. Fertigated willows grew nearly {{as well as in the}} south of Sweden, but in the highly loaded horizontal flow willow bed, the potential to produce biofuel was limited. To recover nutrients, willow clones with lateral growth are preferable. 90 % of nutrients accumulated in the above-ground parts of willows could be recovered from the experimental site operated over three growing seasons, particularly when using dense planting and annual harvesting prior to leaf fall. Soil treatment, comprising the exclusion of the fine soil fraction prior to the chemical extraction with strong extraction agents applied at an elevated temperature, was efficient in decontaminating soils, even for short contact times. However, this treatment procedure results in an incomplete soil recovery (i. e. the recovered mass of soil after decontamination is appreciably smaller than the soil mass prior to decontamination), consumes a high amount of energy and lowers the soil quality, which limits the potential end-use of the decontaminated soil. The alkaline extraction effluents could be decontaminated at a pH of 4 - 5 with the addition of a coagulant. Also, the treatment of alkaline extraction effluents was facilitated by the exclusion of the fine soil fraction from the chemical extraction step. The use of acid oxalate-citrate extraction solution was judged infeasible because the decontamination of such extraction solution is complicated due to the high pH buffering and complexing capacity of the solution. Konventionella metoder för avloppsvattenbehandling och efterbehandling av förorenade områden fokuserar på att skydda människors hälsa, recipient och miljö. Därmed inriktar dessa metoder sig på att reducera och avskilja föroreningar och är därför inte lämpade att skapa resurser genom återvinning av näringsämnen, energi eller sanerade jordar. Därför riktar sig denna avhandling på en ny, mer hållbar strategi som inte enbart uppfyller miljöskyddskraven, utan även tar tillvara resurser som kan erhållas vid behandling. För att uppnå detta mål behövs en mer fördjupad kunskap om metoder för behandling av avloppsvatten och efterbehandling av förorenade jordar, utifrån resurshushållnings perspektiv. I denna avhandling utfördes laboratorie, pilotskale och fullskale försök för att studera fosfor (P) sorption i masugnsslaggfilter. Ammoniumadsorption och desorption från klinoptilolit undersöktes i kolonnförsök. En fullskaleanläggning för avloppsvattenbehandling som bestod av en salixbädd följd av två parallella fosforfilter med masugnsslagg och Filtralite® P sorbenter undersöktes med avseende på avloppsrening, upptag av näringsämnen i salixbiomassa och biomasseproduktion. På liknande sätt utfördes laboratorie-, pilotskale- och fullskaleförsök för att undersöka arsenik (As) avskiljning från As förorenade jordar m. h. a. fysisk separation och kemisk extraktion. Även rening av As förorenade extraktionslösningar undersöktes genom pH justering och tillsats av järnklorid. Resultaten visade att avskiljningen av ämnen i avlopp och As förorenade jordar påverkades av pH, innehållet av organiskt material, redoxpotential, tid och temperatur. Resultaten visade även att föroreningar i de studerade medierna hade komplexa egenskaper i form av ladding och redox speciering, och därmed kan inga generella slutsatser dras för alla studerade förhållanden. Masugnsslaggens sorptionskapacitet m. a. p. fosfor ändrades genom vittring och förvaring av material utomhus. Närvaro av organiskt material tycktes påverka ha en mer negativ påverkan på fosforsorption för den mer vittrade masugnsslaggen. Frigörandet av As från As förorenade jordar påverkades av pH, innehåll av organiska ämnen och redoxpotential, och karaktären av dessa effekter berodde på den kemikalie som förorenade jorden (impregneringsmedel) samt innehåll av kalcium i jorden. Extraktion i förhöjd temperatur ökade As mobilisering från förorenade jordarna för korta kontakttider, förutsatt att avgörande egenskaper för As mobilisering hos extraktionslösning inte förändrades. Den snabbaste mobiliseringen uppnåddesm. h. a. en sur oxalat-citrat lösning istället för reduktiva eller alkaliska extraktionslösningar. I fullskaleanläggningens salixbädd reducerades halten av suspenderat material och biologiskt nedbrytbart organiskt material effektivt från avloppsvattnet och förhindrade igensättning av de efterföljande fosforfiltren under ett års drift. Behandlingssystemet med filtermaterialet Filtralite® P avskiljde > 90 % organiskt material och 70 % fosfor under den ett år långa försöksperioden, och uppfyllde därmed kraven för den normala skyddsnivån, förutom under snösmältperioden då kravet för tot-P inte uppnåddes. Dessutom uppfylldes kravet för tot-N reduktion (50 %) för den höga skyddsnivån. För systemet med masugnsslagg uppfylldes däremot inte reningskraven, varken för normal eller hög skyddsnivå eftersom den grovkorniga slaggen var ineffektiv på att sorbera P och halterna av syreförbrukande ämnen var förhöjda i utflödet. De studerade metoderna för återvinning av resurser genom behandling av avloppsvatten och förorenad jord visade potential på resurshushållning genom dessa studerade processerna. Även om salixbädden inte ackumulerade näringsämnen från det inkommande avloppsvattnet i större grad, främjade den näringsupptag i efterföljande reningssteg. Färsk, finkorning masugnsslagg visade sig ha förmåga att sorbera P från avloppsvatten och kapaciteten var jämförbar med andra effektiva P sorbenter. Dock lakades signifikanta mängder svavelföreningar ut från filtret med masugnsslagg initialt vilket följaktligen ökade koncentrationen av syreförbrukande ämnen i filtrets utflöde. Därför rekommenderas inte användning av masugnsslagg som P sorbent när utflödet leds ut till känsliga recipienter. Den undersökta naturliga klinoptiloliten visade på hög ammoniumadsorptionskapacitet från förbehandlat avloppsvatten vid låga temperaturer. Därmed har klinoptilolit potential att öka N reduktionen från avloppsvatten under vintern eller före full etablering av salix när N reduktion krävs. Återvinningen av ammonium var dock begränsad p. g. a. låg desorption med kranvatten utan återföring av eluatet. Salix bevattnad med avloppsvatten växte nästan lika bra som i referensanläggningar i södra Sverige, men i den högbelastade salixbädden med horisontelt flöde var potentialen att producera biobränsle låg. För att återvinna näringsämnen förordas salixkloner med horisontell tillväxt. 90 % av de ackumulerade näringsämnena i salixens växtdelar ovan jord kunde avlägnas från anläggningen som drevs under tre växtsäsonger, speciellt eftersom salixen var tätt planterad och skördandet genomfördes årligen innan löv fällningen. Att utesluta den fina jordfraktionen från kemisk extraktion var tillsammans med starka extraktionslösningar vid förhöjda extraktionstemperaturer ett effektivt sätt att tvätta jorden, även vid korta kontakttider. Denna behandling resulterade dock i en ofullständig återvinning av jorden (d. v. s. den behandlade jordmassan efter sanering var mindre än före sanering), förbrukade en stor mängd energi och minskade jordens kvalitet vilket i sin tur begränsar möjlig återanvändning av den behandlade jorden. Den alkaliska extraktionslösning som erhölls efter jordtvätt kunde behandlas vid pH 4 - 5 m. h. a. tillsats av en koagulant. Behandlingen av den alkaliska extraktionslösningen underlättades dessutom genom avskiljning av den fina jordfraktionen före kemisk extraktion. Sur oxalat-citrat extraktionslösning lämpar sig inte för behandling av As förorenade jordar eftersom en behandling med en sådan extraktionslösning är komplicerad p. g. a. hög pH buffrande och komplexbildande kapacitet.

40|$|Plants {{synchronise}} their flowering {{with the}} seasons to maximise reproductive fitness. While plants sense environmental conditions largely through the leaves, the developmental decision to flower occurs in the shoot apex, requiring the transmission of flowering information, sometimes over quite long distances. Interestingly, despite the enormous diversity of reproductive strategies and lifestyles of higher plants, {{a key component of}} this mobile flowering signal, or florigen, is contributed by a highly conserved gene: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). The FT gene encodes a small globular protein that is able to translocate from the leaves to the shoot apex through the phloem. Plants have evolved a variety of regulatory networks that control FT expression in response to diverse environmental signals, enabling flowering and other developmental responses to be seasonally timed. As well as playing a key role in flowering, recent discoveries indicate FT is also involved in other developmental processes in the <b>plant,</b> including <b>dormancy</b> and bud burst...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This multi-year {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate early spring applications of low doses of endothall to selectively control the invasive submersed plant curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.) in Minnesota lakes. BACKGROUND: Curlyleaf pondweed is an invasive submersed plant that infests water bodies in the northern United States. It typically overwinters as a quiescent, but photosynthetically active plant, even under ice cover (Nichols and Shaw 1986). Following spring ice-out, these plants begin accelerated growth under low light, before most native <b>plants</b> break <b>dormancy,</b> forming dense surface canopies in May or June (Wehrmeister and Stuckey 1992). These canopies limit growth of native plants, negatively impact water quality, and interfere with navigation and recreation (Bolduan et al. 1994). Selective removal of exotic plants, like curlyleaf pondweed, can improve recreational use of lakes, stabilize water quality, and increase native plant diversity (Getsinger et al. 1997). The potential for restoring native aquatic plant communities using herbicides in a selective manne...|$|R
