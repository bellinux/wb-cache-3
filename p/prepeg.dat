40|$|A {{modification}} to {{the addition}} polyimide, LaRC- 160, {{was prepared to}} improve tack and drape and increase <b>prepeg</b> out-time. The essentially solventless, high viscosity laminating resin is synthesized from low cost liquid monomers. The modified version takes advantage of a reactive, liquid plasticizer which is used in place of solvent and helps solve a major problem of maintaining good <b>prepeg</b> tack and drape, or {{the ability of the}} <b>prepeg</b> to adhere to adjacent plies and conform to a desired shape during the lay up process. This alternate solventless approach allows both longer life of the polymer <b>prepeg</b> and the processing of low void laminates. This approach appears to be applicable to all addition polyimide systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} {{powder coating}} system {{was developed for}} coating carbon fiber with LaRC-TPI (Langley Research Center-Thermoplastic Polyimide), a high-temperature thermoplastic polymide invented by NASA-Langley. The coating line developed used a pneumatic fiber spreader to separate the individual fibers. The polymer was applied within a recirculating powder coating chamber then melted {{using a combination of}} direct electrical resistance and convective heating to make it adhere to the fiber tow. The tension and speed of the line were controlled with a dancer arm and an electrically driven fiber wind-up and wind-off. The effects of heating during the coating process on the flexibility of the prepreg produced were investigated. The uniformity with which the fiber tow could be coated with polymer also was examined. Composite specimens were fabricated from the prepreg and tested to determine optimum process conditions. The study showed that a very uniform and flexible <b>prepeg</b> with up to 50 percent by volume polymer could be produced with this powder coating system. The coating line minimized powder loss and produced <b>prepeg</b> in lengths of up to 300 m. The fiber spreading was found to have a major effect on the coating uniformity and flexibility.

40|$|Expanded {{graphite}} was {{compressed into}} graphite sheets {{and used as}} a coating for carbon fiber reinforced PMR- 15 composites. BET analysis of the graphite indicated an increase in graphite pore size on compression, however the material was proven {{to be an effective}} barrier to oxygen when <b>prepegged</b> with PMR- 15 resin. Oxygen permeability of the PMR- 15 /graphite was an order of magnitude lower than the compressed graphite sheet. By providing a barrier to oxygen permeation, the rate of oxidative degradation of PMR- 15 was decreased. As a result, the composite thermo-oxidative stability increased by up to 25 %.

40|$|International audienceComposite {{structures}} manufactures {{sometimes have}} to change their material, either {{in an attempt to}} reduce their costs, or because of their provider's policies. If the structure's behavior has to stay constant, some redesign is necessary to compensate for material variations. In tapered composite structures, ply drop positions can be moved for such purpose. The present article describes an application to swimming monofins. The intuitive concepts used by swimmers to characterize monofins are translated here into two criteria: the deflection under static loading and the natural frequencies. The ply drop positions with the thicker <b>prepeg</b> are optimized, so that the deformed configuration and natural frequencies are {{as close as possible to}} those of the reference monofin. Numerical simulations based on the finite element method provide the deflections and natural frequencies of the various models. The optimization problem is solved with the Globalized and Bounded Nelder-Mead (GBNM) algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experimental}} work analyses the impact behaviour of thermosetting composite materials for aeronautic applications. The main {{goal of the}} experimental activity was to identify the energy level in correspondence of which penetration occurs. The initial values of the impact energy were estimated according to analytical correlations found in literature. Tests were performed on three types of composite panels: carbon fibre laminated panels, fibreglass laminated panels and hybrid panels. The technology of lamina is that of <b>prepeg</b> fabric with twill sequence and fibres weaving at 0 ??- 90 ?? and ?? 45 ??. The fixture used for tests is a Charpy impact test machine, which was conveniently equipped to evaluate the angular variation and the acceleration of the impacting mass. Preliminarily, non-destructive ultrasonic controls were performed to check that the specimens were not damaged before impacts tests. The interesting results of the tests were identification of the energy absorbed and the impact force for each specimen. Moreover, for each energy and force level, {{it was possible to}} associate a different fracture state. Comparisons among the results obtained for specimens made up of just one type of reinforcement (glass or carbon) and the results obtained with hybrid specimens were performed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} Composite structures posses ‟ {{high strength}} and stiffness to weight ratios, also exhibits good fatigue resistance, {{and are less}} prone to deterioration caused by corrosion and cracking. Fabrication of these composite structures is highly process dependent. During curing process, the physical, mechanical and chemical properties are imparted to the components, and are generally cured in autoclaves under controlled temperature, pressure and vacuum. Any variation in these parameters leads to change in properties of a composite structure, hence {{there is a need}} to analyse the effects of vacuum failures at during curing on mechanical and Ultrasonic Characteristics. Efforts are also made to analyze the root causes for the vacuum failures during curing process. Laminates made of Hexcel 913 carbon / epoxy <b>prepeg</b> are prepared and cured in the autoclave by varying the vacuum levels at different salient points of cure process during curing. The specimens were prepared as per the DIN 29971 standards to evaluate the DT and NDT characteristics. The Experimental results shows that ILSS will not vary much if the vacuum fails after (Tg) Glass Transition point, hence the vacuum can be maintained up to the Tg point and thereby it can be slowly reduced to zero. This shows that there is a scope to optimize the manufacturers recommended cure cycle so as to reduce the curing cost and time. This research work helps the designers in developing the tools and optimum cure cycles for carbon epoxy composite structures...|$|E
40|$|This article {{concerns}} the on-line {{monitoring of the}} manufacturing of composite materials using an ad-hoc instrumentation (based on electrical impedance measurements) considering the material it-self as a sensor. The material (made of T 700 carbon /M 21 epoxy <b>prepegs)</b> is here used as a sensor but could be also used as an actuator. Furthermore the instrumentation was developed {{to stay in the}} heart of the structure for SHM purpose. It is proposed to measure the changes in the electrical impedance of the composite material during curing. The changes of the resistance Rp and the capacitance Cp during curing are then correlated to rheological parameters linked to the progress of the curing reaction. The present paper exposes the estimation of electrical and rheological properties of the material using the measurements of Rp according to a specific curing cycle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the experimental {{results of a}} set of fatigue tests performed on T 300 carbon fiber / epoxy resin laminates cured in autoclave. The effects of anisotropy in laminates lay up have been investigated, as well as the influence of cir-cular hole notches, for both the case of tensile and compressive loading conditions. Due to the high slenderness of specimens, that have the ASTM D 3039 standard suggested geome-try, a special gripping device has been designed {{in order to avoid the}} axial buckling. Fatigue failure probability of the material has been assessed by means of Maximum Likelihood Es-timates (MLE) of the experimental data, as a function of the lay-up and load conditions. Eventually, the micrographic analysis of fractured surfaces outlined the combined effects of both the geometry and notches towards the damage behaviour of this kind of material.
