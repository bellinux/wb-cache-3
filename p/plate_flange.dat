Spring designer used to think under certain extreme operating conditions, the spring could be lifted off from the ledge because the spring is not stiff enough to prevent the “lift-off”. Therefore, the spring was designed as stiff as it practically can be. However, finite element study indicated that the magnitude of preload is a strong function of friction coefficient. To find {{the magnitude of the}} friction coefficient, a series of tests were conducted on 1 / 10 scale hold down spring samples of three different spring designs. From the test results, {{it was found that the}} friction coefficient increases rapidly as the number of loading cycles increases. This implies that the spring preload would increase rapidly during plant operation. Therefore, it is concluded that, because of the strong frictional effect, not only the current design is more than adequate, but also should be made even softer...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Cementitious Materials (ACM’s) are {{products}} with materials found in conventional concrete (cement, silica fume, sand, superplasticizer, and water) plus distinctive materials like fibers (steel, carbon) and quartz. The superiority of ACM’s {{in terms of}} strength, ductility, and durability marks it as high potential replacement of traditional concrete. The growing expansion of ACM applications and technical experience gained {{in the last two}} decades in counties including Japan, Germany, Austria, Australia, USA, Denmark, Canada, France, and the Netherlands results in new frontier of cement materials used in infrastructure. The economic feasibility of ACM’s has been demonstrated in footbridges, outstanding bridges, and large pre-cast series. Furthermore safety and durability of ACM’s, especially of Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been proven encouraging further research efforts. This research is one part of an ongoing research under the supervision of Professor D. A. Hordijk at the Technical University of Delft on the application of ACM’s in infrastructure. The biggest potential for new infrastructure with ACM’s is in precast girders and thin plates. Throughout utilizing the excellent properties of ACM’s like UHPC, a new lighter- weight, durable, efficient, and adaptable superstructure has been developed in this study to replace the existing traditional design of bridges in the nearby future. One example of the approach taken in this thesis is the benefit of long life-cycle. Due to dense matrix, which prevents the ingress of detrimental substances apply UHPC selectively in the superstructure where it required to sustain high level of durability. Another example of the mindset of this thesis is lightweight design, means material distribution follows the forces distribution. In this thesis the outcome of an extensive material study was an overview of the ACM’s properties, time depended behavior, non-linear behavior, design standards, and field of application. Based on the material study different parameters are analyzed to enhance the understanding of the behavior of structure with ACM. It has been found that structural elements from UHPC are far more efficient then their corresponded traditional concrete structures. The maximum crack size is significantly lower, the slenderness is much higher which result in higher efficiency and reduction of the dead loads. Also the shrinkage and creep of ACM’s is studied. The time-depended imposed deformation of UHPC elements (<b>plate,</b> <b>flange,</b> truss member) with different sizes cause stresses in the model ends up as transverse cracks when the deformation is restrained. Based on the drawn conclusion of the parametric study, the design stage of the new ACM superstructure was initiated complying with requirements & boundaries according to the NEN norms and SETRA (French recommendation for UHPC). The new superstructure is 35 % lighter than traditional solution, with efficient material distribution, built only from concrete, with elegant simple solutions. The low reliability of the fibers as replacement for reinforcement well-thought-out in the design. Some suggestion for future research in the field of modular adaptable superstructure have promising potential as far as applying ACM’s.

40|$|Due to the {{substantial}} increase in oil and gas activities in Polar areas the demand for ice strengthen vessel has increased greatly. This increase in demand has highlighted the importance of designing ice strengthened ship structures that are more producible and maintain adequate safety and integrity. In order to encounter these new challenges, the international association of classification societies (IACS) has developed unified regulations for the designing of ice strengthened ship. In addition to these requirements, most of the classification societies have their regulation for design of polar ships. Stiffened plates are the basic structural building blocks of ships. So, the study mainly explores the plastic response of stiffened plate subject to lateral ice loads. The Non Linear Finite Element Method (NLFEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. The Abaqus non linear finite element program is used in this study. The aims of the study are to investigate {{the validity of the}} limit state equation employed in the IACS new Unified Requirements for Polar Ships [6], investigate the membrane effect at large deformation, determine the ALS design load, and assess limit loads when fracture in plating likely to take place. The study also focuses on the warping effect of unsymmetrical sections and the effect of end brackets on the lateral load carrying capacity of the stiffener. The effect of mid-span tripping bracket on the load deflection behavior of L and T stiffeners is also studied. In particular, the study focuses on the behavior of inclined T and L stiffener. As ships move forward by crushing ice, sides of ships bow come across with ice initially. To design ice strengthen vessel, it s very important to understand the behavior of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. So, this study extensively focuses on the non-linear finite element analysis of ships side structure subjected to ice loads. Normally, ship design rules are based on the behavior of single frame subjected to loads. It s reasonable to consider frames singly under the uniform loading but in case of ice loading which is non uniform, the behavior of the structure obtained from single frame based design does not accurately represent the true behavior of the structure. The load-deflection characteristic of frames in isolation, frames as part of a ½+ 1 +½ frames and frames as part of a grillage subjected to unsymmetrical loading is studied. As, stiffeners in the side structure of ships bow are not normally perpendicular with shell plate, the lateral capacity of frames as part of a ½+ 1 +½ frames and as part of a grillage is obtained for inclined stiffener. The analyses in this study cover the full range of stiffener behavior from elastic, through yield, through the formation of initial mechanisms, through large deformations. The parameters considered for the analyses are: 	frame profile: Angle, Tee 	frame span 	load length: patch (transverse), uniform (longitudinal) 	web thickness 	end brackets: with, without 	Angle of inclination of stiffener web with the <b>plate</b> <b>flange</b> 	Tripping bracket at mid spa...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, an ice-induced {{damage to}} a DNV-GL {{registered}} cargo ship isinvestigated by looking into its damage survey report, and running nonlinearfinite element analyses. The analyses are used for regeneration of the damagedeformations and estimation the damage loading. The results are compared withdesign and capacity ice loads calculated from DNV-GL and IACS' rule requirementsfor the ice class of the ship studied, DNV_ICE, IACS_PC. The Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules (FSICR), which are adopted by DNV-GL, andthe International Association of Classification SocietiesUnified Requirements for Polar Class (IACS UR PC), are derived and explained with focus onplating and framing requirements. From the rules design loads and capacityloads for the frames in the side bow of the case study ship, are calculatedand applied to three different finite element models for analysis. The first model is a single frame with <b>plate</b> <b>flange.</b> The second istwo neighbouring frames with two tripping brackets in between. The third model is the ship side damage area. In addition to the design loads from the rules, five proposed load cases areanalyzed for the ship side model. The resulting model deformations arecompared with deformation measurements from photosgiven in the surveyor report, in order to evaluate the applied load cases. Aresemblance in the deformations indicates a load case that resembles theoriginal damage load. The analyses of the frame models with design and capacity loads form the rulesshow that the frames have {{a considerable amount of}} capacity beyond the rulecalculations. In one of the analyses a frame capacity of 15 MPa is obtained,while the design capacity is 5 MPa. For the ship side model, only one of the five proposed load cases provesto be successful. Measurements of the deformation of the model are done, and they coincide withthe photos where the deformations are large, but give a poor match elsewhere. A pressure of 6. 9 MPa over an area of 5. 8 m^ 2 is neededto reproduce the largest of the deformations seen in the photos. The ship side analysis shows that a force about ten times the FSICRdesign load, or twice the IACS PC design load, is needed to produce thedeformations seen in the photos. The large difference in the ratio for the FSICR and the IACS PCforce originate from the difference {{in the size of the}} load application area. The rules appear to present very conservative design loads, as the finiteelement analyses reveal a considerable amount of load carrying capacity beyondthe design load level. This is because the rules are derived to be conservative, hence,they are not suited for calculation of the actual capacity of a structure. For the ship side model, an ice class 3 - 5 notations higherthan the notation it is classified for is needed to withstand the damageloading, depending on how the numbers are evaluated. This implies that theship in question has been sailing in waters with ice conditions it was not designed for. Due to a lot of uncertainty related to the photo measurements, and the many assumptionsmade for the analyses' input, an uncertainty is related to the output of the analyses,and the conclusions based on these. This thesis is conducted in cooperation with DNV-GL, Tankers and Dry Cargo Section,Høvik, Norway. They supplied survey reports, ship drawings, and supervisionalong the way. The vessel documents are applied anonymously within theproduction of this report.

One of the recent additions to such developments is the I-girders with corrugated web beams. The use of these new generation beams results in a range of benefits, including flexible, free internal spaces and reduced foundation costs. Corrugated web beams are built-up girders with a thin-walled, corrugated web and wide <b>plate</b> <b>flanges.</b> The thin corrugated web affords a significant weight reduction of these beams, compared with hot-rolled or welded ones.

In the optimisation process, besides the thickness of concrete slab and studs, web height and thickness, distance between the peaks of the two curves, the width and thickness of flange are considered as design variables.

Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> to a 10 mm depth.

In addition, there are simplified requirements for the buckling strength of plates and stiffeners/girders.

40|$|During the bending of <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> {{used for}} dapped girders some highway bridge fabricators are {{experiencing}} cracking of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> particularly when heat {{is used in}} assisting the bending process. Due to the extreme strains experienced during the fabrication process, investigating this problem {{requires the use of}} a finite element analysis. The fabrication process was broken down into two parts, first the heating of the plate through the use of either a furnace or an acetylene torch (thermal), and the second was the bending process (structural). The five different temperatures collected during the thermal analysis were a uniform temperature of 75 oF, a 1100 oF uniform temperature as a result of furnace heating, both five and ten minutes of air-cooling after the plate had reached a uniform temperature of 1100 oF, and the temperature gradient after heating the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> to a surface temperature of 1200 oF though the use of an acetylene torch. After the thermal analysis was completed, the resulting temperatures were imported into the structural model. The plate thicknesses analyzed were one, one and a half, and two inches, assuming both 50 and 70 ksi yield strengths. To achieve a 90 degree six-inch radius bend the plate was bent in five separate locations. The result of this analysis showed that with the introduction of temperature gradients into thefabrication process, the strains along the plate??s extreme fibers increased. The model further showed that for both a one and a half and two-inch thick plate the extreme fiber strains exceeded ten percent, which further adds to the increased risk of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> cracking during fabrication. The highest residual stresses through the plate??s thickness occurred during cold bending. The residual stresses through the plate??s thickness decreased when the fabrication process was carried out at elevated temperatures. When steel exceeds a strain of 10 to 16 percent during the fabrication process, the plate becomes susceptible to cracking. This strain limit was exceeded for plate thicknesses of one and a half and two inches...|$|R

The parameters considered were {{the number of}} bolts (8, 6, and 4) and thickness of <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> [25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.), 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) ]. These were analyzed under stiffened and unstiffened conditions. Four, two and four stiffeners, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick, were used with 8 -, 6 - and 4 -bolt arrangements. Each finite element model {{is made up of}} a small diameter (171. 5 mm) circular pipe and a large diameter (327 mm) circular pipe both welded to circular flanges. The outer and inner diameters of the <b>flange</b> <b>plates</b> were 327 mm and 171. 5 mm respectively. Each bolt was 25. 4 mm (1 in.) diameter and was pretensioned to 227 kN (51 kips); and an external load of 45 kN (10 kips) was applied at the free end of the monopole, 1804 mm (71 in.) from the bolted joint, in the Riks analysis load step of ABAQUS (version 6. 3) computer program. From the finite element analysis, it was found that monopoles (8 bolts, 6 bolts and 4 bolts) with unstiffened 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick <b>flange</b> <b>plates</b> experienced a large deformation because of the thin <b>flange</b> <b>plate.</b> Optimum solutions to stiffened and unstiffened connections were found to be among those monopoles with minimal gap, deflection and deformation, i. e., 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick flanges with 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick flanges with 6 bolts for unstiffened case; and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick flanges with 8 bolts, 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick flanges with 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick flanges with 6 bolts for stiffened case. In addition to the parametric study, T-Stub and yield line analytical procedures were also presented with examples; and {{it was found that the}} analytical methods provide good preliminary guidance regarding connection parameters when designing bolted flange connections for circular monopoles.
