50|$|The {{transition}} of ITV companies was never smooth, but Thames' bitterness stayed {{until the very}} end. In June 1992 Carlton and the ITV network centre had backed down over their demands for Thames to relinquish its right to broadcast repeats of its own programmings on rival channels for ten years. Thames believed Carlton's demands were unreasonable and would have forced it to drop most networked programmes on ITV during the autumn of 1992. Thames Chairman Richard Dunn publicly stated that Michael Green (Carlton Chairman), had done everything {{in his power to}} obtain the London weekday franchise since being blocked by the IBA in 1985. Carlton was forced to advertise on LWT to promote its new <b>programme</b> <b>line</b> up, until Christmas 1992, following an acrimonious High Court dispute between Thames and Carlton over the selling of rights of hundreds of films in Thames' library. Carlton settled out of court for £13.1M.|$|E
40|$|The main JET <b>programme</b> <b>line</b> {{over the}} last 7 {{years has been the}} {{development}} of a valid divertor concept for ITER. Installation and exploitation, in a systematic manner, of several divertor structures has been required: successively Mark-I, Mark-IIA and Mark-IIGB. The divertors, particularly Mark-IIA and Mark-IIGB, significantly reduced the plasma volume. In spite of this, the 1997 D/T campaign has produced impressive results: Record fusion yield (16 MW peak) and record fusion energy (22 MJ in steady-state discharges) have been obtained. Alpha-particle heating has been clearly observed with alpha power in the range of a few megawatts. These results represent a significant advance in the physics of fusion plasmas. However, these studies indicate that the full potential of JET has not been fully exploited. The JET performance and operating domain can be much improved by increasing: a) the plasma volume (restoring the volume available before installation of the divertors), b) the plasma triangularity and c) the additional power (up to a total of 40 MW to access the threshold of high performance regimes and 50 MW to access the pressure limits). These enhancements will also benefit from the new toroidal field capability of 4 TeslaSIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC: 4672. 2625 (99 / 12) / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{workplace}} is a suitable setting for health promotion, not least {{due to the}} amount of time employees spend at work. Previous research indicates large variations in employers' handling of workplace health promotion (WHP) efforts. However, more empirical knowledge of how WHP is handled in public sector organizations is needed. The overall aim of the thesis was to explore how WHP is managed and implemented in municipal organizations. The thesis draws on health promotion as the point of departure, further accompanied with concepts related to organizational change and implementation research. The thesis is based on three studies using different empirical materials. Both quantitative and qualitative research designs were used. In the first study, questionnaires were sent to both top managers and employees in a nationwide random sample of 60 of the 290 municipal social care organizations in Sweden. Data were analysed at the organizational level, linking WHP measures provided by the employer to employee health. In the second study, interviews concerning the management of WHP were carried out with senior managers representing various departments in two municipalities. The third study analysed the implementation of a health-promoting leadership programme, and the interviews made, concerned the experiences of line and middle managers participating in the programme. The results show that the provision of individual- and organizational-directed WHP measures was associated to employee health at the organizational level. Furthermore, the senior managers described WHP management as components contributing to the organization's capacity for WHP. However, they mainly described WHP as providing healthy lifestyle activities, and mapping working conditions and employee health. In the study analysing the implementation of the leadership <b>programme,</b> <b>line</b> and middle managers described employee involvement as an enabling factor, whereas high workload and lack of senior management support were barriers described. Recurrent organizational changes and other politically-initiated projects and routines were also pointed out as competing events in the implementation process. From this thesis, it can be concluded that WHP management is dominated by measures directed towards the individual employee and needs to include more of psychosocial and organizational measures. Finally, the varied organizational conditions for municipal managers as well as the support from senior management and human resources staff needs to be considered and ensured as part of an active and continuous WHP practice...|$|E

40|$|POSSIBILITIES WITHOUT BOUNDARIES -a Programme for post gradual {{supervisors}} {{that is a}} symbiosis between {{central and}} faculty specific activities. Background The demand for different activities and possibilities aimed at supporting academic staff engaged in the supervision of postgraduate students has steadily increased over the years. It is taken seriously on all levels within the University. The result so far {{is that there are}} different activities offered within the Faculties and also centrally at the former Centre for Teaching and Learning (UPC). The latter is a course spanning over seven course days, and also including three days for developing a plan for a change at the participants´ departments. The course is open for teachers from all Faculties, and it focuses on general aspects of the Doctoral Programme as a whole and the supervisor's responsibility relative to the Doctoral student's four/five years of studies - not only the research project. Parallel to this a lot of activities are taking place at the different Faculties. Some of it is very specific and strictly related to subjects and subject areas. Other parts are of a more general character. The latter could perhaps be made more effective by crossing the Faculty borders and thereby pooling the resources both financially and on a specialist level. And if this could include the centrally organized activities even more could be won {{in the sense that the}} individual supervisor could build his/hers optimal "programme" that meets both individual needs and is possible to implement within limited resources. The most obvious effect will be that Doctoral students work together with supervisors with a broader perspective and a deeper knowledge about the Doctoral programme as a whole. Aim The aim of the project is to make it possible for the individual teacher to have access to different activities that will form the optimal support for him/her in fulfilling the role as Doctoral supervisor. Expected results of the project The project will result in the development of a series of activities within the different Faculties complementing the already existing ones. All these activities will be gathered in a database to make it possible for all concerned to get an overview. There will be coordination with the aim of avoiding double work, pooling resources and open up these courses for teachers across the Faculty borders. The centrally organized activities will be included. In this way the resources will be used more effectively and the supervisors will have a wider range of offered support. It will also balance the strictly subject area needs to those concerning the more general aspects of doctoral training as a four/five year educational <b>Programme.</b> <b>Line</b> of action As a preparation for the Project a survey was undertaken and activities under development at the different Faculties were identified. Those judged to be examples of new methods and tests of new ideas, and fitting the model, are supported financially and by a special Coordinator. The Coordinator works within the project and is going to construct the database built upon the model besides having a consultative role relative the Faculties. That means listing activities that have a broader aim and is open for teachers from other Departments/Faculties and also relating these activities to the centrally organized activities. The work should also result in recommendations concerning suitable combinations of faculty specific, across faculties and centrally offered activities that would form an optimal preparation and continuous support for teachers fulfilling the role of Doctoral Supervisors...|$|E
40|$|BRIDGE is an {{initiative}} {{funded by the}} Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) that aims to close the “funding gap” between basic and applied research in stand-alone projects with the primary objective of jointly developing the potential of basic and applied research. BRIDGE acts as an umbrella structure under which the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) coordinate two thematically open funding programmes: The FWF’s Translational Research Programme (TR) and the FFG’s bridging programme (BR). The two programmes differ from one another in respect of the research’s potential to lead to specific applications and in respect of their funding intensity, which since the second call {{has resulted in the}} division of BR into two sub-programmes (Bridge 1 and Bridge 2). · The TR programme funds projects that meet high international standards of scientific quality {{while at the same time}} offering innovation potential in terms of the expected application, but for which no commercially-oriented financing partner has been found. Applications may be made by individuals; the approved costs may be funded in full. · In the case of the BR programme, applications may be submitted by research institutes and companies but also by individual researchers. The consortium must include at least two partners (1 from science, 1 from industry). - Bridge 1 supports collaborative research projects where most of the project costs (at least 80 %) are borne by the research institute or the researcher. The enterprises that will potentially implement the results make a financial contribution and also provide material and manpower (maximum 20 %); the maximum amount of funding is 75 %. Applications may be made by institutions. - In the case of Bridge 2 much of the project work is still carried out by the scientific partner (at least 30 %). However, the corporate partner makes a greater contribution to the project in the form of material and manpower; the maximum funding quota here is 60 %. In the years 2004 - 2008 BRIDGE had a budget of EUR 92 million for seven calls, the equivalent of EUR 10 - 11. 6 million per year and <b>programme</b> <b>line</b> with two calls in each year. 7. Total funding of EUR 85 million was approved; EUR 40 million for 187 TR projects and EUR 44 million for 187 B 1 and 72 B 2 projects within the framework of BR. BR has a considerably higher average application approval rate (49 %) than TR (29 %). When the programme was launched it was agreed that BRIDGE would be subjected to a mid-term evaluation after three to five years in accordance with the recommendation made by the Austrian Council for Research and Technology Development. After being hired to carry out this evaluation in October 2008 Technopolis analysed the concept, implementation, processes and organisation, goal achievement, and as far as they could be determined, the impacts of the programme. In comparison with other programme evaluations, two questions are of particular relevance. The first concerns the perceived funding gap: Did it really exist? Was it necessary and appropriate to launch an additional programme? The second question concerns the culture of cooperation initiated between the FFG and FWF, which for the first time are managing research funding programmes under a joint name and with a joint programme advisory committee. Among other things, this evaluation examines the question of how productive this model is and to what extent it should be continued in the future. For this purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were combined, including in particular an analysis of programme documents and material from the BRIDGE advisory committee, interviews with the programme managers and stakeholders, an analysis of the FWF and FFG monitoring data, an online survey of applicants for TR funding and the scientific partners in BR 1 and BR 2 applications (project leaders and partners), as well as four international case studies. Results 1. BRIDGE did close a funding gap, but sometimes also overlapped with other programmes. 2. The BRIDGE advisory committee serves as the bridge between the two funding agencies and is the backbone of the programme. 3. High percentage of new funding recipients at the two funding agencies 4. Mobilisation of new and existing partnerships 5. Importance of BRIDGE for the development of human resource...|$|E

DESIGN: An inductive qualitative approach, using the principles of action research and motivational interviewing were adopted. The results informed the development of the educational <b>programme</b> for <b>line</b> managers. SUBJECTS: Middle grade line managers in a large public services employer in the UK. METHODS: Four discussion groups were conducted over a period of 8 months. Line managers explored the challenges of the return to work interview, analysed their interactions with employees and constructed the content of an educational programme. Multiple methods were used to build engagement with participants, including video and role-play. RESULTS: Nine line managers were recruited across 3 business areas. Managers recognised that their conversations focused on the organisations' policies and procedures and the outcome, rather than the interaction. They recognised the strength of shifting style to shared decision-making and guidance rather than process and instruction. These communication strategies were depicted in the educational programme. CONCLUSION: The content and flow of the return to work discussion is of high importance and influences employee behaviour and return to work outcomes...|$|R
