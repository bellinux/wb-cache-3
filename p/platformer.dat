25|$|Arguably a subgenre of both 3D and 2D <b>platformers,</b> {{isometric}} <b>platformers</b> {{present a}} three-dimensional environment using two-dimensional graphics in isometric projection. Although {{not the first}} isometric games, the earliest examples of isometric platform games are the arcade game Congo Bongo and Ant Attack for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, both released in 1983.|$|R
2500|$|Cinematic <b>platformers</b> are a {{small but}} {{distinct}} subgenre of platform games, usually distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional <b>platformers.</b> [...] These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games. To achieve this realism, many cinematic <b>platformers,</b> beginning with Prince of Persia, have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts. Jumping abilities are typically roughly {{within the confines of}} an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic <b>platformers</b> feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of elevator platforms. Other distinguishing characteristics include step-based control, in which an action is performed after the character completes his current animation, rather than the instant the button is pressed, and multi-screen stages that do not scroll.|$|R
2500|$|Super Mario 64 {{brought a}} change in the goals of some <b>platformers.</b> In most 2D <b>platformers,</b> the player only had to reach a single goal to {{complete}} a level, but in Mario 64 each level contained a mission based structure that rewarded items needed to unlock new areas. Many 3D <b>platformers</b> followed this trend such as Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, and Donkey Kong 64 creating the [...] "collectathon" [...] genre. This allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for thorough exploration of their environment, but also contained less jumping and involved more elements of action-adventure games.|$|R
5|$|Yoshi's Island is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling <b>platformer</b> in which players help friendly dinosaurs known as Yoshis escort Baby Mario safely through 48 levels across six worlds {{in order to}} rescue his brother Luigi, who had been kidnapped by an evil Magikoopa named Kamek.|$|E
5|$|Alien Spidy is a <b>platformer</b> {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network).

Players control an extraterrestrial spider who has crash-landed on Earth, as he seeks to repair his spacecraft and rescue a fellow extraterrestrial spider.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country Returns is a side-scrolling <b>platformer</b> {{video game}} {{developed}} by Retro Studios {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii console. The game was released first in North America in November 2010, and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. A stereoscopic port of the game, titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in May 2013, and in Japan the following month.|$|E

It is the second Super Mario 3D <b>platformer</b> in the series overall, following Super Mario 64 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} video games that are {{loosely based on}} the film: The first video game based on the film was titled Beauty and the Beast and is an action <b>platformer</b> {{developed}} by Probe Software and published by Hudson Soft for the NES. It was released in Europe in 1994. Gaston is the final boss of the game {{because he wants to}} kill the Beast and marry Belle.|$|E
5|$|Croc: Legend of the Gobbos is a third-person 3D <b>platformer</b> {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, a green crocodile named Croc, through several courses taking place on various islands throughout Gobbo Valley. Levels are accessed through a world map, and consist of various different smaller sub-sections taking place both above land and underground (as well as occasionally taking place underwater) that are filled with various enemies and obstacles that try to impede Croc.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog <b>platformer,</b> containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The <b>platformer</b> Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E
5|$|Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the {{developer}} of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums {{to try to}} get his game parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays as a standard <b>platformer</b> and is peppered with inter-level pro-vegetarian messages and facts about meat consumption and the livestock industry.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} <b>platformer</b> with {{role-playing}} elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of a}} level if enough points were collected.|$|E

25|$|<b>Platformers</b> went {{portable}} in {{the late}} 1980s with games such as Super Mario Land, and the genre continued to maintain its popularity, with many titles released for the handheld Game Boy and Game Gear systems. Because of their small size, technical constraints, and blurring associated with early LCD technology, fast-paced action-based <b>platformers</b> {{are more difficult to}} develop for these handheld systems. Because of this, many handheld <b>platformers</b> lean toward slower-paced play styles and a greater emphasis on puzzles. After the transition of home consoles to three-dimensional (3D) displays, handhelds became a bastion for 2D platform games, where they remain popular. New Super Mario Bros. (2006) is a very successful traditional platform game, selling more than five million copies in Japan and North America during its first year of release.|$|R
5|$|Mirror's Edge is a first-person action-adventure <b>platformer</b> {{developed}} by EA DICE {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. The game was announced on July 10, 2007, and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. Mirror's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3, {{with the addition of}} a new lighting solution, {{developed by}} Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. {{received}} {{numerous awards}} and accolades. It was given Game of the Month awards from Game Informer and Electronic Gaming Monthly, and it received Editors' Choice Awards from IGN and GameSpot. The game was voted Best Handheld Game at the 2006 Spike Video Game Awards, Best Nintendo DS Game by GameSpot, and it won Best <b>Platformer</b> awards from X-Play and Nintendo Power. The game was awarded Choice Video Game at the 2006 Teen Choice Awards, and Nintendo Game of the Year at the 2006 Golden Joystick Award.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{for being}} an early example of a 3D {{platform}} game, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos began development as a concept for a 3D <b>platformer</b> in which the player controlled the character Yoshi from Nintendo's Super Mario series. The concept was pitched to Nintendo by Argonaut, but was ultimately rejected by the company, ending Argonaut's relationship with Nintendo and prompting them to design a new character and retool the game as an original property.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{gameplay}} mechanics resemble {{an inferior}} version of Mega Man; like several other <b>platformers</b> released {{near the end}} of the lifetime of the SNES, Incantation was accused of being repetitive and clunky by comparison with some of the system's earlier, better <b>platformers,</b> such as Super Mario World, Disney's Magical Quest and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Reviewers did note that the game's graphics were fairly impressive for the aging SNES hardware, however, resembling the PlayStation video game Rayman.|$|R
5000|$|Edge {{gave the}} game a 9/10 praising it by saying [...] "One {{of the most}} jubilant, vividly {{imagined}} and open-hearted <b>platformers</b> to come along in a long time".|$|R
50|$|Like its predecessor, {{this game}} also {{incorporates}} unique sound effects that are mostly {{different from the}} main Mario <b>platformers.</b> The most noticeable are the Starman sound and the 1-Up fanfare.|$|R
5|$|Sonic 3 is a 2D side-scrolling <b>platformer.</b> At the start, {{players can}} select Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join in {{at any time}} and control Tails separately. Sonic 3 adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by {{spinning}} his twin tails like a propeller; when he gets too tired, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.|$|E
5|$|Spyro: Year of the Dragon is a <b>platformer</b> {{video game}} {{developed}} by Insomniac Games {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 2000. Year of the Dragon is the third installment in the Spyro series and the last Spyro game to be released for the first generation PlayStation. The game was also the last Spyro game Insomniac developed; their next title would be Ratchet & Clank for the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|When Bédard {{joined the}} project, the game {{focused on the}} 2D–3D {{mechanic}} and {{did not yet have}} open world ambitions. He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. His first task, the level editor Fezzer, was coded from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. Bédard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles ("triles") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D <b>platformer.</b> Bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space.|$|E
50|$|Armed {{with good}} intentions, it's an {{original}} production for the Rabbids in {{the genre of}} platforming, the game itself invents nothing, but based on solid rules of old-school <b>platformers,</b> with simple handling.|$|R
