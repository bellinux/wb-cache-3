Carrying out our analysis {{in the framework of}} a symmetric capacity-constrained Bertrand-Edgeworth duopoly game, we prove that the equilibrium prots are the same in case of production in advance and <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order.</b> In addition, advance production results in higher prices than <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> if both games have an equilibrium in nondegenerated mixed strategies...|$|E

40|$|Both ex post <b>{{production}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> and market-oriented ex ante production involve specific costs. With {{consumer goods}} produced "for the market", costs arise for disposal of excess production. Firms advertise, {{in order to}} inform buyers. Conditions for market equilibrium for pure <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> pure market-oriented production and a mixed structure are analysed. As disposal costs rise, the market share of firms producing to order increases, while the volume of advertising and sales fall. When consumers seek for a favourable offer, the advertised range of prices and the advertising coverage are endogenous. As disposal costs rise, advertising coverage decreases. ...|$|E
40|$|In every {{production}} process, suppliers have {{to decide}} whether an item should be produced and stored as inventory before an explicit purchase order is received (production in advance), or whether it should be produced only after such an order is received (<b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order).</b> We study the determinants of this firm-level choice. We present a simple conceptual framework to derive predictions that we subsequently test in the empirical analysis. We argue that an increment in buyers' spatial concentration benefits production in advance more in homogenous industries than in differentiated ones, while the benefits for <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> are larger as product differentiation increases. Consequently, the propensity to adopt one of the two production modes, following {{an increase in the number}} of local downstream buyers, changes according to the degree of product differentiation of the goods. Relying on a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms, we find empirical support to our ideas. <b>Production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Production in advance Downstream spatial clustering Product differentiation Organized exchange markets Supply chain management...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of the firm-level choice to produce following an order placed by a downstream firm (<b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order)</b> or to produce in advance. We rationalize this choice through a simple theoretical model {{and apply it to}} a firm-level empirical analysis. Relying on a large dataset of Italian manufacturing firms, we show that two main variables affect this choice: the extent of spatial clustering of the industry, and the degree of product complexity and relationship-specificity of the goods that are traded. The sign of the impact of clustering on the choice of producing to order crucially depends on product complexity. If product complexity is high, <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> prevails when firms are clustered together. On the contrary, clustering is associated to production in advance for sectors where goods are standardized. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of the firm-level choice to produce following an order placed by a downstream firm (<b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order)</b> or to produce in advance. We rationalize this choice through a simple theoretical model {{and apply it to}} a firm-level empirical analysis. Relying on a large panel of Italian manufacturing firms, we show that two main variables affect this choice: the distance between the supplier and the buyer and the degree of product differentiation in downstream industries where products are sold. The impact of proximity on the choice of producing to order crucially depends on the degree of product differentiation in downstream markets. We find that, in industries where average product differentiation is high, <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> prevails if the supplier is located close to the buyer. On the contrary, proximity is associated to production in advance in homogeneous sectors. We also find that, if suppliers are located in a different country from that of the buyers, they will tend to produce to order if product differentiation in downstream industries is low, and produce in advance if product differentiation is high. We also narrow the scope of our analysis to analyze {{the determinants of}} <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> originating from the same province where the supplier is located.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{infinitely}} repeated oligopoly game, we study (optimal) collusion among firms that have both price and quantity as a strategic choice variable. We consider two modes of production: production in advance and <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order.</b> For both types of industry, we comparea price cartel with a price-quota cartel and analyze if and under what conditions firms prefer the latter to the former. We find three main results. First, when production is in advance of sales and market demand is relatively elastic, an additional agreement on outputs may be required to solve coordination and incentive problems. Second, if production is in advance of sales and market demand is relatively inelastic, then a price-quota cartel is always more profitable than a price cartel. Finally, with <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> collusion may not be sustainable without a quota agreement...|$|E

It is pointed out that unlike the production-to-order case, the equilibrium of the timing game lies at simultaneous moves.

The Λ production in polarised e^+ e^- annihilation where this can be realised is discussed.

This review of the relevant conceptual and empirical research in the field reveals limited and inconclusive evidence {{on the extent to which}} organizations have aligned management control systems with the production environment. The review indicates that new forms of production and inventory control (e. g., just in time) are not always easily captured by the conventional classifications of technology that are commonly used in the empirical literature.

Our argument is {{based on the idea that}} (renegotiable) debt is a credible commitment to end a long-term relationship if information is not revealed. We illustrate our argument by showing how a monopolist that sells a durable good to consumers whose valuation is private information can increase profits by levering up. The strategic value of leverage is shown to increase with good durability and is higher with <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> than with production to market. We briefly address the nancing decision of a regulated firm. We also discuss how our basic insight can be extended to other settings which exhibit dynamic adverse selection problems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{article focuses}} on the {{calculation}} of the optimal stock-out risk when resorting to emergency supplies is allowed. The studied context is a supply chain where several distant mixed-model assembly lines trigger the demand of a component used for assembly. When the cumulated lead time of a component exceeds the frozen horizon of the material requirement planning (MRP) {{of at least one}} of the assembly lines, its demand becomes stochastic. This leads to a mix between production to stock and <b>production</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> for the component of interest. The periodic replenishment policy is designed to address demand uncertainty in consistence with MRP information. To prevent stock-out propagation along the supply chain, the emergency supply is used as a last resort. The calculation of the optimal order-up-to-level and its associated optimal stock-out risk are based on a single-period trade-off between holding cost and emergency supply cost (transportation and production) ...|$|E
