5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, <b>power</b> <b>transmission,</b> power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment.

Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

Windfarms may also pose a threat. Poorly designed <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> lines in east Africa electrocute many wintering vultures.

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric <b>power</b> <b>transmission.</b> For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To extend an {{available}} {{period of}} wireless sensor networks, <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> control {{is regarded as}} one of the promising schemes. In most of the previous studies on the <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> control, it is assumed that a transmitter has power consumption of O(dn), where d and n denote a maximum communication distance and a pass loss factor. This assumption would substantially hold under the condition that the transmission efficiency is always constant at any <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> (efficiency-fixed model). In practice, however, the trans-mission efficiency degrades as the <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> is reduced. We analytically verify that an actual power amplifier with the efficiency degradation has a power consumption of O(dr), where n/ 2. 8 ≤ r ≤ n/ 2 (efficiency-degradation model). The efficiency-degradation model gives the negative impact against the <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> control.

An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes.

Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration.
