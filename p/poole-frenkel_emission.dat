30|$|In {{order to}} get further {{understanding}} of the mechanism of the URS and BRS behaviors, two linear fitting curves of log(I)-log(V) were separately depicted in Figure  3 c,d. At LRS for both URS and BRS, the linearity curves with slopes of almost 1 indicate ohmic conduction behavior, which were typically due {{to the formation of}} conductive filaments in NiO. However, at the HRS state, the I-V characteristic was more complicated and could be divided into two parts. At low voltages, the I-V curve was linear, corresponding to the ohmic mechanism region. At high voltages, the slope was much larger than 1, indicating that the conduction mechanism was dominated by trap-limited space charge-limited current (SCLC) conduction. In addition, by fitting ln(I/V)[*]~[*]I 1 / 2 curve in HRS as shown in the blue lines, it seems to be governed by <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> (PF) <b>emission</b> that involves thermal effect and trap sites such as oxygen vacancies.

Measurements concentrated on the detailed conduction properties, structure and composition of the films at varying stages of the ion implantation doping processes. Aluminium and titanium thin films are implanted with oxygen atoms to ion doses of about 1017 ions cm- 2. During implantation the films' resistivitess change from that of metal to that of a dielectric. Electron microscope and electron diffraction observations show that as the oxygen dose is increased then metal-oxide clusters form and grow eventually reaching 200 - 300 A. in diameter. The film then consists of a metal/metal oxide matrix and the process of electronic conduction is an activated one, with activation energies of about 0. 30 eV for the aluminium/aluminium oxide system and about 0. 25 eV for the titanium/titanium oxide system. Evaporated silicon oxide films are doped with aluminium and titanium atoms by the process termed 'recoil atom implantation. This method of doping thin films is shown by use of radioactive measurements to be an effective and efficient method provided the film thickness is less than about 500 A. As the metal atom concentration in the dielectric is increased the resistivity of the film decreases from that of an insulator to that of a metal showing a positive temperature coefficient of resistance. Electron microscopy and electron diffraction studies show that the metal atoms form clusters within the dielectric matrix producing metal/SiO cermet type structures. The conduction properties of the implanted films are explained at low electric field strengths on a conduction model incorporating thermionic emission and quantum mechanical tunnelling mechanisms between homogeneous arrays of spherical metal particles in a dielectric matrix. This model yields potential barrier values, O°, of 0. 92 eV and 0, 80 eV for the aluminium/aluminium oxide and titanium/titanium oxide material respectively, formed by oxygen ion implantation, and values of 1, 00 eV for the dielectric silicon oxide in the case of metal atom implantation.

Two amorphous semiconductors were selected for the study, these being amorphous arsenic triselenide (a-As 2 Se 3) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-As 2 Se 3 device was a single layered structure of 60 |Um thickness fabricated upon a 2 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. The a-Si:H device was a multi-layered structure of 27. 1 fim overall thickness fabricated upon a 4 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. 20 mm 2 samples were cut from the cylinders, their surface being left free for a xerographic investigation. For a tomographic investigation, semitransparent gold (Au) contacts were sputtered {{onto the surface of}} the devices to produce single contacts or contact arrays. The study comprised of the two fields of xerography and tomography. The xerographic study comprised of the measurement of such parameters as charge acceptance, dark decay, residual potential, and photoinduced discharge. The research project has concurred with other workers in that the dark discharge mechanism in a-As 2 Se 3 proceeds via a xerographic depletion discharge process, and a <b>Poole-Frenkel</b> type <b>emission</b> in a-Si:H. The tomographic investigation involved the study of such parameters as detectivity, responsivity, steady state photocurrent, and photoinduced fatigue. Detectivity has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of applied electric field and level of incident irradiance. Irradiance in the order of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2 for a- fj f As 2 Se 3 and 5. 31 mW/cm to 28. 32 mW/cm for a-Si:H was required in order to produce a clean and repeatable photogenerated current pulse over the range of electric fields specified (0. 66 xl 05 V/cm to 1. 66 xl 05 V/cm). The production of steady state current has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of electric field, the level of irradiance, and the illumination period. Irradiance of 319 mW/cm 2 to 1. 46 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 520 ns was required to produce steady state photocurrent in a-As 2 Se 3, and 693 mW/cm 2 to 2. 62 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 880 ns for a-Si:H. A linear relationship between electric field and responsivity has been observed in both materials over a range of irradiance of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2. Responsivity in the order of 87. 86 |LiAAV to 145. 19 |iA/W for a-As 2 Se 3 and 14. 19 (iAAV to 103. 81) J,AAV for a-Si:H has been demonstrated. An investigation as to the effects of photoinduced fatigue in both a-As 2 Se 3 and a-Si:H has been carried out by the application of pulsed visible light of various flash repetition rate (FRR) under a constant high electric field over a 30 minute illumination period. It has been shown that the rate of fatigue is dependant upon the material, time, electric field, light intensity, and FRR. A maximum operating speed of 20 Hz has been determined for a-As 2 Se 3 and lOOHz for a-Si:H. The maximum operating speed of 20 Hz for a-As 2 Se 3 was deemed unsuitable for OPT application and the a-As 2 Se 3 material was eliminated from further tomographic investigation. Tomographic prototypes were employed to establish the a-Si:H devices ability to produce qualitative and quantitative data. The results of this investigation demonstrated that 1 mm changes in water level and 0. 5...|$|R
