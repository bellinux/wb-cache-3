40|$|International audienceIn this work, an {{experimental}} study of the radiance of liquid and solid uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbides</b> at wavelengths 550 nm â©½ Î" â©½ 920 nm is reported. A fast multi-channel spectro-pyrometer has been employed for the radiance measurements of samples heated up to and beyond their melting point by laser irradiation. The melting temperature of uranium monocarbide, soundly established at 2780 K, has been taken as a radiance reference. Based on it, a wavelength-dependence has been obtained for the high-temperature spectral emissivity of some uranium carbides (1 â©½ C/U â©½ 2). Similarly, the peritectic temperature of plutonium monocarbide (1900 K) {{has been used as}} a reference for plutonium monocarbide and sesquicarbide. The present spectral emissivities of solid uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbides</b> are close to 0. 5 at 650 nm, in agreement with previous literature values. However, their high temperature behaviour, values in the liquid, and carbon-content and wavelength dependencies in the visible-near infrared range have been determined here for the first time. Liquid uranium carbide seems to interact with electromagnetic radiation in a more metallic way than does the solid, whereas a similar effect has not been observed for <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbides.</b> The current emissivity values have also been used to convert the measured radiance spectra into real temperature, and thus perform a thermal analysis of the laser heated samples. Some high-temperature phase boundaries in the systems Uâ€"C and Puâ€"C are shortly discussed on the basis of the current results...|$|R
40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of uranium, plutonium, or their alloys. They were chosen because most existing reactor operating experience had been obtained on metallic fuels and because they provided the highest breeding ratios. Difficulties in obtaining adequate dimensional stability in metallic fuel elements under conditions of high fuel burnup led in the 1960 s to the virtual worldwide choice of ceramic fuels. Although ceramic fuels provide lower breeding performance, this objective {{is no longer an}} important consideration in most national programs. Mixed uranium and plutonium dioxide became the ceramic fuel that has received the widest use. The more advanced ceramic fuels, mixed uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbides</b> and nitrides, continue under development. More recently, metal fuel elements of improved design have joined ceramic fuels in achieving goal burnups of 15 to 20 percent. Low-swelling fuel cladding alloys have also been continuously developed to deal with the unexpected problem of void formation in stainless steels subjected to fast neutron irradiation, a phenomenon first observed in the 1960 s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbides</b> are {{candidate}} fuels for Generation IV nuclear reactors. This {{study is}} focused on the characterization of uranium monocarbide samples. The successive fabrication steps were carried out under atmospheres containing low oxygen and moisture concentrations (typically less than 100 ppm) but sample transfers occurred in air. Six samples were sliced from four pellets elaborated by carbothermic reaction under vacuum. Little presence of UC 2 is expected in these samples. The α-UC 2 phase was indeed detected within one of these UC samples during an XRD experiment performed with synchrotron radiation. Moreover, oxygen content at the surface of these samples was depth profiled using a recently developed nuclear reaction analysis method. Large oxygen concentrations were measured in the first micron below the sample surface and particularly in the first 100 – 150 nm. UC 2 inclusions were found to be more oxidized than the surrounding matrix. This work points out to the fact that more care must be given at each step of UC fabrication since the material readily reacts with oxygen and moisture. A new glovebox facility using a highly purified atmosphere is currently being built in order to obtain single phase UC samples of better purity...|$|R

All the available thermodynamic and phase diagram data of the binary and ternary sub-systems are very well reproduced by our model. For the quaternary system, the calculated phase equilibria in the U 0. 3 PU 0. 7 -C-O region are in good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|The {{available}} data on low-enriched (LEU) fuel particles were reviewed under the United States-Federal Republic of Germany Agreement. The most influential factors controlling the irradiation performance of LEU fuel particles {{were found to}} be plutonium transport, fission product transport, fuel particle mechanical performance, and fuel particle chemical performance. PLUTONIUM TRANSPORT Pu- 238, which is derived from U- 235, represents the dominant radiological hazard. Since the U- 235 inventory in an LEU core is approximately the same as that in an HEU core, plutonium transport is therefore of importance to both LEU and HEU systems. The diffusion coefficient of plutonium in high-temperature-isotropic pyrocarbon is about an order of magnitude higher than that of uranium and two orders of magnitude higher than that of thorium. A BISO coating is not a good barrier for plutonium release, but a TRISO coating retains plutonium. Graphite appears to be an effective trap for plutonium. Thé phase compositions and plutonium vapor pressures over irradiated uranium oxycarbide kernels have been deduced from thermodynamic data. It is concluded that plutonium is present in solid solution in the corresponding uranium-containing phases, and that the vapor pressure is lower than that of <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbide.</b> Experimental confirmation of these conclusions is desirable...|$|E
40|$|The {{second stage}} of Indian nuclear {{programme}} envisages the deployment of fast reactors {{on a large scale}} for the effective use of India’s limited uranium reserves. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Kalpakkam is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor, meant as a test bed for the fuels and structural materials for the Indian fast reactor programme. The reactor was made critical with a unique high <b>plutonium</b> MK-I <b>carbide</b> fuel (70 % PuC+ 30 %UC). Being a unique untested fuel of its kind, it was decided to test it as a driver fuel, with conservative limits on Linear Heat Rating and burn-up, based on out-of-pile studies. FBTR went critical in Oct 1985 with a smal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMixed <b>plutonium</b> and uranium <b>carbide</b> (UPuC) is {{considered}} as a possible fuel material for future nuclear reactors. However, UPuC is pyrophoric and fine powders of UPuC are subject to temperature increase due to oxidation with air and possible ignition during conditioning and handling. In a first approach and to allow easier experimental conditions, this study was undertaken on uranium monocarbide (UC) with the aim to determine safe handling conditions for the production and reprocessing of uranium carbide fuels. The reactivity of uranium monocarbide in oxidizing atmosphere was studied in order to analyze the ignition process. Experimental thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) revealed that UC powder obtained by arc melting and milling is highly reactive in air at about 200 degrees C. The phases formed at the various observed stages of the oxidation process were analyzed by Xray diffraction. At the same time, ignition was analyzed thermodynamically along isothermal sections of the U-C-O ternary diagram and {{the pressure of the}} gas produced by the UC + O- 2 reaction was calculated. Two possible oxidation schemes were identified on the U-C-O phase diagram and assumptions are proposed concerning the overall oxidation and ignition paths. It is particularly important to understand the mechanisms involved since temperatures as high as 2500 degrees C could be reached, leading to CO(g) production and possibly to a blast effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the micro ion source program was to enhance the {{performance}} of thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) for various actinides and fission products. The proposal hypothesized that when ions are created at the ion optic center of the mass spectrometer, ion transmission is significantly increased and the resulting ion beam is more sharply focused. Computer modeling demonstrated this logic. In order to prove this hypothesis it was first necessary to understand the chemistry and physics governing the particular ion production process that concentrates the emission of ions into a small area. This has been achieved for uranium and technetium, as was shown in the original proposal and the improvement of both the beam transmission and sharpness of focus were proven. Significantly improved analytical methods {{have been developed for}} these two elements based upon this research. The iodine portion of the proposal turned out to be impractical due to volatility of iodine and its compounds. We knew this was a possibility prior to research and we proceeded anyway but did not succeed. Plutonium is a potential option, but is not quite up to the performance level of resin beads. Now, we more clearly understand the chemical and physical issues for plutonium, but have not yet translated this knowledge into improved analytical processes. The problems are that plutonium is considerably more difficult to convert to the required intermediate species, <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbide,</b> and the chemical method we developed that works with uranium functions only moderately well with plutonium. We are of the opinion that, with this knowledge, similar progress can be made with plutonium...|$|E
40|$|The fuel {{composition}} of the Generation IV 600 MWth 'efficient' Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) that realizes zero breeding gain without using fertile blankets is determined. The analysis includes all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including irradiation, reprocessing and fuel fabrication. The time-dependent multiplication factor, reactor safety parameters, and decay heat production for different {{fuel composition}}s are simulated using the deterministic SCALE 4. 4 code. The depletion equation and the 1 -D transport equation are solved for multiple timesteps during reactor irradiation. It is seen that adding {{a small percentage of}} minor actinides (MA) to a mixture of uranium- and <b>plutonium</b> <b>carbide</b> favors the creation of a closed fuel cycle with zero breeding gain. Furthermore, addition of MA increases the burnup potential of the fuel, extending its feasible irradiation time from 40 to 90 MWd / kg, due to the transmutation of Np- 237 to fissionable Pu- 238 and Am- 241 to fissionable Am- 242. Mixing MA negatively affects safety parameters by decreasing the delayed neutron fraction, decreasing the negative Doppler feedback and increasing the positive reactivity introduced when the reactor is depressurized. However, the magnitude of the delayed neutron fraction is comparable to existing fast reactors. Worths of individual isotopes are introduced as a value of their contribution to the core reactivity. Throughout the fuel cycle, the time-dependence of the isotopic and total worth of the fuel is determined. Zero breeding gain is achieved when the initial total worth of the fuel stays constant for multiple cycle burnup. The effect of different reprocessing strategies on the closed fuel cycle is shown. Research confirms that when there are no reprocessing losses, depleted uranium can be used during the recycling step to replace fission products and obtain a new critical fuel composition.
