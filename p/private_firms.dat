During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by <b>private</b> <b>firms.</b> The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia.

At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially Vojvodina and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E
5|$|Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's {{management}} of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm {{for the construction of}} new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered loan guarantees to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} the impact of privatization {{on the degree of}} cooperation and competition in a mixed oligopoly market. We consider a duopoly market that comprises one semipublic <b>firm</b> and one <b>private</b> <b>firm.</b> Each firm is assumed to determine the level of two types of effort: the cooperative effort made to enlarge the total market size and the competitive effort made to increase market share. In a contest framework, our results show that the competitive effort level of the semipublic firm is smaller than that of the <b>private</b> <b>firm.</b> The more the semipublic firm is concerned for social welfare, the less it competes. On the basis of average costs, we then analyze the case in which only the semipublic firm undertakes cooperative effort. In this case, the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> behaves as a free rider. Furthermore, we find that the semipublic firm expends more cooperative effort than does the <b>private</b> <b>firm.</b> Coopetition, Mixed oligopoly, Contests, Free rider...|$|R

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Out of the interned fleet, only one battleship, Baden, three light cruisers, and eighteen destroyers were saved from sinking by the British harbor personnel. The Royal Navy, initially opposed to salvage operations, decided to allow <b>private</b> <b>firms</b> to attempt to raise the vessels for scrapping. Cox and Danks, a company founded by Ernest Cox handled most of the salvage operations, {{including those of the}} heaviest vessels raised. After Cox's withdrawal due to financial losses in the early 1930s, Metal Industries Group, Inc. took over the salvage operation for the remaining ships. Five more capital ships were raised, though three—SMS König, , and SMS Markgraf—were too deep to permit raising. They remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow, along with four light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank, then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in <b>private</b> <b>firms,</b> rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), Eurobank (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).|$|E

40|$|A dynamic three-stage game is {{modelled}} {{to analyse}} the capacity choice in a mixed oligopoly with private leaders {{and a public}} follower. To distinguish long-term and short-term market power, I consider two stages of investment, the first by a <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> and the second by a public one, and one stage of production. Even if firms have the same technology, the short-term market power of the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> could prevent the public firm from restoring the long-term optimum. Contrary to usual results on commitment, it is {{the inability of the}} <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> to commit to a given production level that allows it to get strictly positive profits. This paper establishes that, for low demand elasticity and small share of sunk cost, the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> is able to get strictly positive profits. This result is no longer true if the order of moves is modified. Furthermore, the effect of the share of sunk cost on the <b>private</b> <b>firm's</b> profit is not monotonic. When the share of sunk cost increases, the commitment value of sunk investment explains that private profit increases in some cases, but, in other cases the effect of short-term market power implies that its profit decreases. ...|$|R

Specifically, the channel strategy of the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> depends mainly on the vertical contract form: under a two-part tariff contract, the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> always chooses decentralization; under a wholesale-price contract, the <b>private</b> <b>firm</b> chooses integration for most scenarios except for highly substitutable products under Bertrand competition (i. e., under very intense competition).
