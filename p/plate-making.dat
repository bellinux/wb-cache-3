5000|$|After the {{completion}} of Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-imperialism, the Organization established a larger print shop in Boston which included a darkroom and <b>plate-making</b> facilities. Like Prairie Fire, Osawatomie was printed clandestinely. Unlike the apartment print shop where Prairie Fire was printed, the Boston print shop {{was out in the}} open. To prevent the neighbors from discovering {{the true nature of the}} print shop, they were told that the business was a small travel agency that had their own press needs confirmation. [...] Each issue of the magazine was between 28 and 32 pages, cost between 25 and 50 cents (including postage), and was distributed to news organizations, activists, and subscribers. [...] Once the initial distribution was completed, the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee would reprint the magazine for a wider circulation.|$|E
5000|$|The Seed was {{edited for}} several years by Abe Peck. Among the staff writers were Marshall Rosenthal and Eliot Wald. It was notable for its {{colorful}} psychedelic graphics and its eclectic, non-doctrinaire radical politics, {{and was a member}} of the Underground Press Syndicate. It was a real DIY operation: in the Seed office copy was set on an IBM Selectric and pasted up, negatives were made and stripped up for <b>plate-making,</b> and inks were mixed to take to the printer. The Seed, along with the San Francisco Oracle, was one of the first tabloid newspapers to use [...] "split fount" [...] inking on a web press. At its peak it circulated between 30 and 40,000 copies, with national distribution. Important events covered by Seed writers and artists were the trial of the Chicago Eight, Woodstock, and the murder of Fred Hampton. After losing its original printer in 1968 it was printed for a time on the presses of liberal Wisconsin newspaper publisher Bill Schanen, who provided printing services for a large number of Midwestern underground papers that could find no other printer.|$|E
5000|$|At 16, he {{enrolled}} in the University of Denver to study chemistry. His interest in astronomy was aroused through a boyhood friend (Edgar Kettering), through observing the solar eclipse of June 8, 1918, and through observing the eruption of Nova Aquilae 1918 (V603 Aquilae). He graduated from the University of Denver in 1920 with an A.B. degree in chemistry and an A.M. degree in chemistry and mathematics in 1921. He also found summer positions in 1922, 1923, and 1924 as research assistant to Harlow Shapley at the Harvard College Observatory. At Princeton University he acquired a second A.M. degree in astronomy in 1923, and in 1924 a Ph.D. in astrophysics for which his advisor was Henry Norris Russell, who inspired his interest in theoretical astronomy. After teaching two years at the University of Iowa and Ohio State University, in 1926 he was appointed assistant Professor at Lick Observatory in San Jose CA, where he worked for several years. In 1932 he moved to Harvard. During World War II Menzel was asked to join the Navy as Lieut. Commander, to head a division of intelligence, where he used his many-sided talents, including deciphering enemy codes. Even until 1955, he worked with the Navy improving radio-wave propagation by tracking the Sun's emissions and studying {{the effect of the}} aurora on radio propagation for the Department of Defense (Menzel & Boyd, p. 60). Returning to Harvard after the war, he was appointed acting director of the Harvard Observatory in 1952, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966. The term [...] "Menzel Gap" [...] was used to refer to the absence of astronomical photographic plates during a brief period in the 1950s when <b>plate-making</b> operations were temporarily halted by Menzel as a cost-cutting measure. He retired from Harvard in 1971. From 1964 to his death, Menzel was a U.S. State Department consultant for Latin American affairs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth waste {{management}} and cleaner production (CP) {{are playing a}} crucial role in reducing consumption of energy, water and raw materials, in addition to avoiding waste generation. Through investigating one typical gravure <b>plate-making</b> industry in Tianjin, PR China, {{waste management}} and cleaner production audit (CPA) have been used to find important opportunities for cleaner production. In this waste management process, three major technical innovations have been proposed and applied in this company. Through the first-round cleaner production audit, 0. 68 million USD can be saved during one year. By the way, cost-effectiveness of the suggested programs is increased obviously compared with traditional production technology, which is important and conductive to the promotion of these novel technical progresses for other gravure <b>plate-making</b> industry in China...|$|E

40|$|In the {{printing}} process, color proofing {{is done for}} the purpose of checking the color to ensure that it is as desired, before proceeding to the <b>plate-making</b> process. Proofing with digital printers has grown remarkably, because of its advantages of high speed, wide color gamut, and affordable prices for a device. The accuracy of proof-press color matching is affected by the printer, software and substrate involved in digital proofing processes. Therefore, the combination of the right equipment, software and print media is the key to obtaining good proof-press color matching. The main purpose of this experimental study is to examine the color matching capability of digital printers. The color matching capability was evaluated in terms of color difference and process consistency...|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} demonstration {{will present}} a simple and direct approach to combining stone and plate lithography to recreate tinted lithographs common to {{the first half of}} the 19 th century. My approach is an adaptation of methods described in Michael Twyman’s book The Techniques of Drawing on Stone in England and France and Their Application to Works of Typography (Oxford University Press, 1970). The tinted lithograph uses the same principles as the chiaroscuro woodcut, but is capable of achieving a significantly broad range of tones. It is also a very good method to introduce the principles of color lithography to beginning students. Working from a stone that I will prepare in advance, I will show pulling a mylar, methods of drawing a tint run, <b>plate-making,</b> and the first of two runs of printing, and will include a finished example from the demo stone...|$|E
40|$|Plates for pipes with {{strength}} {{level of}} grade X 80 {{can be produced}} nowadays with the same reliability and reproducibility as lower grades. This has {{to be seen as}} a consequence of the application of sophisticated steel- and <b>plate-making</b> route incorporating Thermo-Mechanical Controlled Process (TMCP) and a tight control of all production steps and parameters. Increased thickness or reduced design temperatures, e. g. for very cold regions, or even the combination of both are considered for upcoming linepipe projects. In order to be prepared for such future demands full scale production trials were performed. These optimistic results are shown. Dillinger Huettenwerke developed in subsequent stages plates to produce pipes in grade X 100. The different approaches in respect of steel analysis and cooling conditions resulting in different property profiles are pointed out. Grade X 100 plate material is in principle available in a specific range of thickness, plate width and design temperature. Outlook for progress work to extent the feasibility for steel grade X 100 is also given...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the printing and wear characteristics of a popular laser exposed plate, the DuPont Howson Silverlith plate, by imaging {{one half of the}} plate in an imagesetter and the other half in a contact frame with a halftone film. The purpose of the investigation was to determine whether the method of imaging had an effect on plate durability when run on a press. The comparison between the digital and the film halftones was done at 150 Ipi. The dot areas on the plate were measured twice; once before and once after a press run of 100, 000 impressions. Measurements of the initial sizes of the dots on the plate and the final sizes of the dots on the plate proved that the laser dots did wear faster than the contact exposed dots. The comparison between the measurements of the initial sizes of the printed dots and the final sizes of the printed dots did not demonstrate that either method of <b>plate-making</b> produced a more durable image...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gravure {{printing}} {{has been}} applied widely in flexible packaging, building materials and other fields, and amount of ink transfer {{is an important factor}} to affect the printing quality and depends largely on the volume of the gravure cell. The volume of cell is affected by gravure process parameters such as screen lines, cell angle and engraving needle angle, so the volume of cell is calculated difficulty, and it is difficulty for the optimization of the gravure <b>plate-making</b> process. This paper presents a computing model calculating the volume of gravure cell. The cells for three kind of dot coverage rate are carved with 70 LPC screening lines and 120 ° needle angle, their opening length, width and depth are measured by cell measuring instrument, their relation is been found by MATLAB and the computing model is built to calculate the cell volume model. The results show that the computing model is suitable for different cell angle, and the cell volume depends the screening rules, cell angle, needle angle and the cell depth. If the depth for different dot coverage rate is measured the cell volume will be calculated...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the author}} had the {{opportunity}} to teach one of the practical courses offered by the college: "Painting V: Printmaking," designed for students who become secondary fine art teachers. In addition to teaching pedagogical, it is critical to help students improve their readiness for teaching, since such efforts can lead to the development of their practical teaching ability when teaching fine arts courses in the future. It is desirable, therefore, to not only help students develop technical skills necessary for teaching but also give them practical teaching ability by which they can develop a proactive approach in developing educational materials and instructional methods pertaining to the acquired skills. This study aims to explore how effectively one can provide practical teaching ability to help students achieve readiness for teaching, while helping them improve technical skills required for printing expressions as they teach in art classes. "Painting V: Printmaking" class used silk screens as fine arts teaching materials often employed in art classes at junior and senior high schools. In the beginning of the class, my students were appreciating printing art works, and then to deepen their understanding of characteristics of printing expressions, such as "plurality," "indirectness," and "fortuity. " Photomechanical process was employed so that students were able to deal with the silk screens. In addition, students were able to develop technical skills by experiencing the whole process from designing the draft to <b>plate-making,</b> to printing, and to organizing screen structures. After the course, students had described free-response about "characteristics of printing expressions" and "instructions on printing expressions in junior and senior high school education. " Analyzing the free-response surveys through text-mining, this study con-cluded that efforts at "Painting V: Printmaking" to help students improve their practical teaching ability as part of readiness for teaching had been proven effective...|$|E
40|$|This book {{surveys the}} history of the {{techniques}} of engraving, etching and plate printing - i. e. that of manual intaglio printmaking processes - from its beginning in the 1430 s until today. These developments are observed {{in the light of the}} coherence between the technique of the intaglio print (such as its materials and methods of production); the ‘style’ or outward appearance of the print; the creator of the print; and the fashion typical of a particular social group, place and time. Economic, educational and social aspects are discussed, as well as the dissemination of the trade of intaglio printmaking. The author shows how intaglio printmaking developed steadily from the mid-fifteenth century, with the invention of the roller press and the etching of printing plates. By 1525 intaglio printmaking techniques could be said to have reached maturity and spread east and west following the European trade routes and colonisation. Further developments in <b>plate-making</b> resulted from a series of inventions and reinventions. After the abolition of the guilds on the European continent around 1800, and the introduction of photography and the expansion of the graphic industry, the engraving of images became a mere mechanical procedure. The handcrafted print made way for the large-scale mechanised graphic industry which emerged in the middle of the nineteenth century. Consequently artist-etchers withdrew to an elite position to concentrate on the manual aspects of printmaking, which is the situation today. This comprehensively illustrated study is the first of its kind to cover all elements of the trade of engraving and etching throughout six centuries. Based on an exhaustive number of primary sources it will be an essential resource for collectors, curators, conservators, printmakers and students of technical art history...|$|E
40|$|Background and Significance New {{technologies}} {{within the}} printing industry open new challenges, enable innovative ways of reaching prospective clients and bring ever more stringent demands to both graphic designers and printers. Printers must implement the emerging technologies that best suit their customers and the evolving {{needs of the}} marketplace; designers must acquaint themselves with new technologies and learn to design {{with respect to the}} output device to make best use of the equipment. A short step beyond desktop technology are digital printing systems, 2 ̆ 2 the culmination of many technologies that have been in various stages of development for over 20 years and have finally caught up with each other. 2 ̆ 21 Digital printers are capable of printing 2 ̆ 2 directly from digital information residing in an electronic file on a computer, 2 ̆ 22 2 ̆ 2 bypassing the multiple and time-consuming steps of film output, proofing, imposition and <b>plate-making</b> required by traditional methods. 2 ̆ 23 As of today, digital printing is targeted to the short-run and on-demand segments of the industry. 2 ̆ 2 Eventually, digital approaches will apply to just every facet of graphic communication, whether it has to a run of 1, 000, 000 or just one. 2 ̆ 24 Statement of The Problem The all-time myth roaming in pressrooms that designers know nothing about printing is not entirely untrue. Often, a design is finished and approved in a studio without the minimal consideration for printing and finishing. The consolidation of a digital workflow today in the printing industry increases the need for designers to acknowledge printing in their brainstorming sessions to create designs that can be produced through emerging technologies. By doing so, they can reduce problems associated with file transfer and output such as missing images and typefaces. The ease of operation of digital presses that can receive a file and print much as a desktop printer does makes them highly attractive to designers and entrepreneurs, providing these a means for printing without all the makeready procedures associated with traditional printing processes. Statement of The Project Goals The purpose of this thesis project is to evaluate the color reproduction of digital printing systems most common in industry through the creation of a universal test instrument with respect to which all the systems will be compared. The results of the test will be used to assess the capabilities of the equipment and determine their ideal applications within the graphic communications industry. A file preparation and specification guide for each of the devices tested will be compiled. The audience at which this study is targeted is graphic designers, who could benefit by learning about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various systems and learning to design with these in mind. As a result, particular attention will be paid to the impact these emerging technologies have in designers 2 ̆ 7 approach to producing their work. This thesis project does not suggest the equipment to be tested is the best in the market place. Its results, however, may be used in determining which system is most suitable for implementation. Methodology This thesis project will provide a color reproduction evaluation and comprehensive guides for designers to prepare and expedite files to the following digital presses: Xeikon DCP- 32 D Indigo E-Print 1000 Xerox DocuColor 40 Heidelberg Quickmaster-DI The criterium defining the color reproduction evaluation and the elements used in the test instrument is the following: Graphic designers, the audience at which this thesis project is targeted, think in terms of memory colors; red, green, and blue. As a result, the elements comprising the test instrument will be those which designers deal with: text and images. The printed samples will be measured with a X-Rite 938 spectrodensitometer, and the results will be complemented with a visual evaluation done under standard lighting conditions. Test Instrument The test instrument will be comprised of the following: CMYK patches and bars 4 -color black patches Images of different sources and resolutions Line art Type Overprinting circles Color bars RIT Neutral Balance Target for SWOP RIT 4 -Color Spokes Target Evaluation Tone reproduction Solid ink density Total ink density Gray balance Dot gain Resolution Ghosting The second part to this thesis project will involve the compilation of guides to expedite files to each output device.
