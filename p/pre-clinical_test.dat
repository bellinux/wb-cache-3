40|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{cemented}} total hip replacement (THR), high failure rates are occasionally reported for cemented hip implants that are introduced on the orthopaedic market. Rigorous pre-clinical testing of hip implants could prevent these disasters, by detecting unsafe implant designs at a pre-clinical stage. The failure risk of the implant should be assessed, by testing against the most dominant failure scenarios for cemented reconstructions. At present no dependable pre-clinical tests exist. Failure of the femoral component in THR is often believed to related to the damage accumulation failure scenario. According to this scenario, repetitive loading of the reconstruction produces creep and microcrack accumulation in the cement and along the interfaces. This leads to implant migration, peri-prosthetic osteolysis, and to gross loosening of the implant. This thesis is aimed at developing a validated <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> for cemented hip prostheses against this failure scenario, based on computer finite element (FEA) simulation. An extensive description is given of the FEA simulation developed to simulate the mechanical failure processes involved: creep and microcrack accumulation in the cement. The FEA tool {{can be used to}} predict cement crack formation and implant migration, when applied to models of cemented THR reconstructions. Research is performed to determine the loading conditions in the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test.</b> It is found that the loading configuration should include a hip joint force and an additional set of abductor forces. The forces should represent not only walking, but also stair climbing, as this latter task is shown to be more critical for failure in cemented THR. Finally, the thesis describes the successful validation of the FEA-based <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test,</b> relative to the results of experimental fatigue tests on cemented THR reconstructions and relative to clinical survival data. For the first time, an FEA simulation is able to detect inferior implants, based on accurate predictions of the failure mechanisms occurring in real reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCoronary stents {{are small}} {{scaffolds}} routinely implanted during angioplasty procedures to re-open coronary arteries {{which have become}} narrowed by an atherosclerotic plaque. Despite the advent of drug-eluting stents to reduce restenosis (re-narrowing) after the procedure, complications still arise and mechanical factors may be partly the cause. Stents are being used in increasingly complex cases, so new forms of pre-clinical testing may be helpful in evaluating stent designs and deployment techniques. With this in mind, an in vitro experiment was conducted {{to evaluate the use}} of X-ray micro-tomography to image stents at various stages of deployment. A stent was deployed in an artificial artery while using a synchrotron X-ray source to obtain the tomography scans. A volume element (voxel) size of 5. 3 µm was achieved, with a vertical field of view of 4. 5 mm. The imaging of the stent and artificial artery materials was better than expected, despite some attenuation artifacts and the high monochromatic beam energy used (25 keV).

40|$|Idiopathic {{scoliosis}} is {{the most}} common spinal deformity, and the brace treatment is the fundamental therapy. Brace works on the curve via the pressure they exert on the rib cage, usually on three points, to push against the progressive abnormal curvature of the spine and to reduce the local spasticity. Considering the possibility of the spine collapse, due to the six degrees of freedom of each vertebras with respect to the adjacent one, spine needs more thrusts relating to the curvature extension. This paper is focused on an innovative brace working by a three-dimensional thrusts system. The brace is internally covered by air pocket devices. Design and prototype of air pocket device is described. Air pockets apply the necessary corrective thrusts, at many levels of the spine, by compressed air at the specific pressure required in that area of the rib cage. Thrusts can be modified and checked. The design of the brace is presented together with a basic prototype, the design and the prototype of the air pocket device. First experimental tests on a simplified prototype of brace are also described. Finally, a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> is performed by a healthy volunteer to validate the new brace concept...|$|E
40|$|Ethanol (EtOH), {{the main}} psychoactive {{ingredient}} of alcoholic drinks, {{is widely considered}} {{to be responsible for}} alcohol abuse and alcoholism through its positive motivational properties, which depend, at least partially, on the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. However, acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of EtOH, has been classically considered to be aversive and useful in the pharmacological therapy of alcoholics. Here we show that EtOH-derived ACD is necessary for EtOH-induced place preference, a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> with high predictive validity for reward liability. We also found that ACD is essential for EtOH-increased microdialysate dopamine (DA) levels in the rat nucleus accumbens and that this effect is mimicked by intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) ACD administration. Furthermore, in vitro, ACD enhances VTA DA neuronal firing through action on two ionic currents: reduction of the A-type K+ current and activation of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current. EtOH-stimulating properties on DA neurons are prevented by pharmacological blockade of local catalase, the main metabolic step for biotransformation of EtOH into ACD in the central nervous system. These results provide in-vivo and in-vitro evidence for a key role of ACD in the motivational properties of EtOH and its activation of the mesolimbic DA system. Additionally, these observations suggest that ACD, by increasing VTA DA neuronal activity, would oppose its well-known peripherally originating aversive properties. Careful consideration of these findings could help in devising new effective pharmacological therapies aimed at reducing EtOH intake in alcoholics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe forced swim test (FST) is a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> {{to short}} and long term {{treatment}} with antidepressant drugs (ADT), which requires between-subject designs. Herein a modified protocol of the FST using within-subject design (repeated rat-FST) was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were submitted to 15 min of swimming (Day 1 : pretest) followed by three subsequent 5 min-swimming tests one week apart (Day 2 : test, Day 7 : retest 1, Day 14 : retest 2). To determine the temporal and factorial characteristics of the variables scored in the repeated rat-FST, the protocol was carried out in untreated animals (E 1). To validate the method, daily injections of Fluoxetine (FLX, 2. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) or saline were given over a 2 -week period (E 2). Tests and retests have been videotaped for further register of the latency, frequency and duration of behaviors. Over retesting the latency to immobility decreased whereas duration of immobility tended to increase. Factorial analysis revealed that the test, the retest 1 as well as the retest 2 have variables suitable to detection of antidepressant-like effects of ADT. Compared to saline, FLX chronically administrated reduced duration of immobility whereas increased duration of swimming in retest 2. The data suggest that repeated rat-FST detected the gradual increase in the efficacy of low doses of FLX over time. Therefore, repeated rat-FST seemed suitable to detect {{short and long}} term effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or other ADT, thus reducing the number of animals used in the screenings of this type of compounds...|$|E

40|$|Hip {{arthroplasty}} is {{a successful}} intervention for symptomatic end stage arthritis of the hip. However it remains an imperfect procedure due in many respects to the difficulty in reproducing biomechanics for each individual patient. Reproduction of femoral offset and leg length ensures appropriate muscle balancing which allows for hip biomechanics to be restored. In addition adequate soft tissue balancing {{reduces the risk of}} complications such as dislocations and nerve injuries. Post- operative functional performance may also be affected by the implant technology being used as well as surgical accuracy. However little is known as to what functional performance is to be expected following hip arthroplasty, especially when function is measured at fast speeds and walking inclines. This thesis will explore the gait of patients prospectively through pre to post-operative stages, in an attempt to ascertain what gait changes can be expected following hip arthroplasty. Furthermore the gait assessments will focus on higher end function, when walking at fast speeds. Following this, this thesis aims to assess whether gait differences are evident when different implants are used, and judge whether they may be a functional advantage to using different implants in hip reconstruction.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) carry {{at least one}} allele with the F 508 del mutation, resulting in a CFTR chloride channel protein with a processing, gating and stability defect, but with substantial residual activity when correctly sorted to the apical membranes of epithelial cells. New therapies are therefore aimed at improving the folding and trafficking of F 508 del CFTR, (CFTR correctors) or at enhancing the open probability of the CFTR chloride channel (CFTR potentiators). Preventing premature breakdown of F 508 del CFTR is an alternative or additional strategy, which is investigated in this study. We established an ex vivo assay for murine F 508 del CFTR rescue in native intestinal epithelium {{that can be used}} as a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> for candidate therapeutics. Overnight incubation of muscle stripped ileum in modified William’s E medium at low temperature (26 uC), and 4 h or 6 h incubation at 37 uC with different proteasome inhibitors (PI: ALLN, MG- 132, epoxomicin, PS 341 /bortezomib) resulted in fifty to hundred percent respectively of the wild type CFTR mediated chloride secretion (forskolin induced short-circuit current). The functional rescue was accompanied by enhanced expression of the murine F 508 del CFTR protein at the apical surface of intestinal crypts and a gain in the amount of complex-glycosylated CFTR (band C) up to 20 % of WT levels. Sustained rescue in the presence of brefeldin A shows the involvement of a post-Golgi compartment in murine F 508 del CFTR degradation, as was shown earlier for its human counterpart.

40|$|Cost-benefit {{is rarely}} {{combined}} with nonlinear dynamic models when evaluating control options for infectious diseases.

However, {{this results in}} the removal of many healthy sheep, and a recently developed <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> for scrapie now offers a strategy based on disease detection. We explore the flock level cost-effectiveness of scrapie control using a deterministic transmission model and industry estimates of costs associated with genotype testing, pre-clinical tests {{and the value of}} a sheep culled. Benefit was measured in terms of the {{reduction in the number of}} infected sheep sold on, compared to a baseline strategy of doing nothing, using Incremental Cost Effectiveness analysis to compare across strategies. As market data was not available for pre-clinical testing, a threshold analysis was used to set a unit-cost giving equal costs for CSFS and multiple pre-clinical testing (MT, one test each year for three consecutive years). Assuming a 40 % within-flock proportion of susceptible genotypes and a test sensitivity of 90 %, a single test (ST) was cheaper but less effective than either the CSFS or MT strategies (30 infected-sales-averted over the lifetime of the average epidemic). The MT strategy was slightly less effective than the CSFS and would be a dominated strategy unless preclinical testing was cheaper than the threshold price of (sic) 6. 28, but may be appropriate for flocks with particularly valuable livestock.

40|$|This special Issue of Toxicology in Vitro {{covers the}} most {{relevant}} findings of a large scale integrating Project on ‘‘Profiling the toxicity of new drugs: a non-animal based approach integrating toxicodynamics and biokinetics”, funded by the European Commission (Grant No. 202222, Predict-IV), which started in May 2008 and was finalised in October 2013. To prevent events like the Elixir Sulfanilamide scandal in 1937 in the USA or the Thalidomide disaster in the 1950 s and early 1960 s in Germany, almost all regulatory authorities have introduced safety testing for new or previously untested chemical entities (Limonciel, 2014). The consequence was {{the establishment of a}} battery of animal-based tests for specific toxicological endpoints. However, we now know that there are large species differences in xenobiotic handling and thus there is a drive to use human derived models. New developments in cell culture and molecular biology provide a unique opportunity to meet regulatory requirements while improving on the predictivity of <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> systems, as already suggested by Russell and Burch (1959). In addition to in vitro models the use of in silico predictions of toxicity as well as the use of physiologically-based biokinetics has matured over the last decades (Blaauboer, 2010; Blaauboer et al., 2012). The utilisation and integration of in vitro and in silico techniques promise to increase the speed of drug safety testing, decrease the costs incurred thereby having more drugs on the market. Also by using human-derived models we aim to improve on the predictivity of animal-based models (Jennings, 2015), thus these drugs will likely be safer than ever before. In the Predict-IV project we divided the problem into four main aspects: (1) cell culture models suitable for repeat dose exposures, (2) mechanistic toxicology based on ‘‘omic” analysis, (3) biokinetics, and (4) quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. Here we provide a short overview of the project outcomes, the majority of which are published in this issue. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to delay the {{progression}} of osteoarthritis from an index injury, early intervention via repair of injured musculoskeletal soft tissue has been advocated. Despite {{the development of a}} number of scaffolds intended to treat soft tissue defects, information about their functional performance is lacking. The goal {{of this study was to}} consolidate a suite of in vitro and in vivo models into a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> platform to assess the functional performance of meniscal repair scaffolds. Our objective was to assess the ability of a scaffold (Actifit™; Orteq, UK) to carry load without detrimentally abrading against articular cartilage. Three test modules were used to assess the functional performance of meniscal repair scaffolds. The first module tested the ability of the scaffold to carry load in an in vitro model designed to measure the change in normal contact stress magnitude on the tibial plateau of cadaveric knees after scaffold implantation. The second module assessed the in vitro frictional coefficient of the scaffold against cartilage to assess the likelihood that the scaffold would destructively abrade against articular cartilage in vivo. The third module consisted of an assessment of functional performance in vivo by measuring the structure and composition of articular cartilage across the tibial plateau 12  months after scaffold implantation in an ovine model. In vitro, the scaffold improved contact mechanics relative to a partly meniscectomized knee suggesting that, in vivo, less damage would be seen in the scaffold implanted knees vs. partly meniscectomized knees. However, there was no significant difference in the condition of articular cartilage between the two groups. Moreover, in spite of the high coefficient of friction between the scaffold and articular cartilage, there was no significant damage in the articular cartilage underneath the scaffold. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo models was likely influenced by the abundant tissue generated within the scaffold and the unexpected tissue that regenerated within the site of the partial meniscectomy. We are currently augmenting our suite of tests so that we can pre-clinically evaluate the functional performance at time zero and as a function of time after implantation...|$|E
40|$|PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ELECTROSPUN POLY(D,L-LACTIDE-CO-GLYCOLIDE) SCAFFFOLDS FOR VASCULAR TISSUE ENGINEERING AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF AN IN VITRO BLOOD VESSEL MIMIC Tiffany Richelle Peña Currently, an {{estimated}} 1 in every 3 adult Americans {{are affected by}} one or more cardiovascular complications. The most common complication is coronary artery disease, specifically atherosclerosis. Outcomes of balloon angioplasty treatments have been significantly improved with the addition of drug eluting stents to the process. Although both bare metal and drug eluting stents have greatly increased the effectiveness of angioplasty and decreased the occurrence of restenosis, several complications still exist. For this reason, the stent industry is continually advancing toward better stent and drug-eluting designs, deployment methods, and adjuvant drug therapies, necessitating fast, reliable <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> methods. Recently, advancements in tissue engineering have {{led to the development of}} an in vitro blood vessel mimic (BVM) and the feasibility of evaluating cellular response to intravascular device implantation has been demonstrated. There are several physiological and scalability limitations of the current BVM model that must be addressed before effective use of the model can be initiated. The limiting aspect addressed in this thesis is the use of expanded poly(tetrafluorethylene) [ePTFE] scaffolding for the development of the BVM. There are several disadvantages and limitations to ePTFE including high cost and non-native mechanical properties. The ability to produce and tailor scaffolds in-house would greatly impact the scalability, cost effectiveness, and control over scaffold properties for BVM optimization. Also, in-house fabrication will open up further avenues of research into optimum scaffold design for better cellular responses when cultured in vitro. Electrospinning is a relatively simple and economical method of creating tissue engineering constructs with micro-architecture similar to the native extracellular matrix. Based on the clinical problem and the potential for the BVM, the aim of this thesis is to employ electrospinning for the development of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) [PLGA] vascular scaffolds as a replacement to ePTFE for the BVM. After primary literature review, PLGA was determined an advantageous polymer for tissue engineering vascular scaffolds and electrospinning based on evidence of adequate endothelial cell attachment, mechanical properties similar to the native vessels, controlled degradation, and good biocompatibility. The first phase of this thesis was to develop an acceptable protocol for the fabrication of electrospun PLGA scaffolds by varying solution concentration, flow rate and applied voltage. Electrospun solutions of 15 wt% PLGA in CHCl 3 resulted in continuous un-beaded fibers of 5 - 6 microns and tensile properties (3 - 5 MPa) similar to the native vessel. The optimum protocol for electrospinning 15 wt% PLGA incorporated a flow rate of 5. 5 ml/hr and an applied voltage of 12, 000 V. In the second phase of this thesis, final protocol PLGA scaffolds were cultured in vitro with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) up to 6 days. Fluorescent microscopy and SEM analysis suggest the porous nature of the scaffolds was conducive to sub-luminal cellular penetration. Although results were not optimal for developing an endothelium for the ideal BVM design, the potential of using electrospinning for in-house production of scaffolds for tissue engineering was established. Further optimization of the electrospinning protocol to develop nano-sized structural features could enhance the ability to form an intimal lining of endothelial cells for the next generation BVM design...|$|E

The stress/strain distributions within the reconstruction, produced by the hip-joint contact force, were compared to ones produced after sequentially including the abductors, the iliotibial tract and the adductors and vastii. Inclusion of the abductors had the most pronounced effect. They neutralized lateral bending of the reconstruction at heel-strike and increased medial bending at mid-stance and push-off. Bone strains and stem stresses were changed accordingly. Peak tensile cement stresses were reduced during all gait phases by amounts up to 50 % around a bonded stem and 11 % around a debonded one.

Lack of <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> is a major challenge in getting these promising treatments to clinical trials. The purpose of this research was to develop a platform that can get these products one step closer to clinical trials and hence getting them out in the market as a viable product for treating osteochondral lesions. The aim of this project was to develop and validate a design specification for the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> of natural patello-femoral joint (PFJ). A characterization study was carried out to investigate the suitable animal model required to simulate a human joint that requires osteochondral substitutions. The size of the porcine PFJ was closer to the human PFJ and the material properties of its cartilage were also similar to the human cartilage. Therefore, the porcine PFJ was chosen as the animal model to develop the methodologies for this project. A methodology was developed to investigate wear of the natural porcine PFJ by adapting a single station knee simulator to apply the porcine PFJ gait cycle to the joints. The position of the patella with respect to the femur determined through a contact point study was used to set up the samples in the simulator. A positive (cobalt chrome on natural cartilage) and negative (cartilage on cartilage) control was used to investigate the wear. This study showed the potential of using an Alicona Infinite focus G 5 optical profiler to assess the change in cartilage topography in natural joints. The contact area and pressure in the PFJ was measured using Tekscan pressure sensors. This study showed the change in contact mechanics across a gait cycle and the effect of sample geometry on the contact mechanics of a joint. In-vitro simulation can reduce the need for animal testing and progress the preclinical trials for new tissue substitutions. Developing the methodology in a human knee is not practical. However, by establishing an animal model can bring this a step closer. The methods developed in this thesis can contribute towards creating a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> system that can be used to assess early interventions to the PFJ...|$|R

40|$|A good primary {{stability}} of cementless femoral stems {{is essential for}} the long-term success of total hip arthroplasty. Experimental measurement of implant micromotion with linear variable differential transformers is commonly used to assess implant primary stability in <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing.</b> But these measurements are often limited to a few distinct points at the interface. New techniques based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) have recently been introduced, such as Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) or markers-based approaches. DVC is however limited to measurement around non-metallic implants due to metal-induced imaging artifacts, and markers-based techniques are confined to {{a small portion of the}} implant. In this paper, we present a technique based on micro-CT imaging and radiopaque markers to provide the first full-field micromotion measurement at the entire bone-implant interface of a cementless femoral stem implanted in a cadaveric femur. Micromotion was measured during compression and torsion. Over 300 simultaneous measurement points were obtained. Micromotion amplitude ranged from 0 to 24 µm in compression and from 0 to 49 µm in torsion. Peak micromotion was distal in compression and proximal in torsion. The technique bias was 5. 1 µm and its repeatability standard deviation was 4 µm. The method was thus highly reliable and compared well with results obtained with linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) reported in the literature. These results indicate that this micro-CT based technique is perfectly relevant to observe local variations in primary stability around metallic implants. Possible applications include <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> of implants and validation of patient-specific models for pre-operative planning...|$|R
