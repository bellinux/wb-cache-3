5000|$|Diego Rivera {{completed}} the commission {{in a relatively}} short amount of time, taking just eight months to complete the work. In order for him to have {{completed the}} work in such a short amount of time, Rivera along with his assistants, had an exhausting work schedule, and would routinely work fifteen-hour days. It is also known that they would often have no breaks between work. The rigorous schedule Rivera to lose 100 lbs {{over the course of the}} project. Rivera also had a reputation for paying his assistants poorly, leading them to at one point during the project protest for higher pay. [...] At the time Rivera’s assistants were not the only workers protesting. Rivera started working on the mural in 1932 which overlapped the Great Depression. In Detroit one out of four laborers were unemployed, and at the time the Ford Motor Company was experiencing political/social unrest with their workers. There was even an event were 6,000 workers were on strike, but was sabotaged and ended in five deaths and the wounding of others. Considering Rivera’s reputation as a revolutionary artist, it is apparent that Rivera was most likely inspired by the charged atmosphere of protest against one of the world's most powerful industrial cities. The DIA inner courtyard is ruled by two gigantic murals located on the north and south walls. These two murals are the climax to the narrative that Rivera depicted in his 27 panel mural. The north wall puts the worker at center and depicts the manufacturing process of Ford's famous 1932 V8 engine. The mural also visually composes the relationship between man and the machine as the main theme of the mural. In an age of mechanical reproduction, the boundary between man and the machine was a commonly explored theme. While machine was imitating the abilities of man, and man being forced to operate in a machine-like manner sparked concerns regarding ethical rights for the working class majority. Other qualities that Rivera incorporated into the north wall that commented on mechanical reproduction were: blasting furnaces that are making iron ore, foundries that are making molds for <b>parts,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts carrying the cast parts, machining operations and finally inspections. Rivera depicted the entire manufacturing process on the large north side mural. He also depicts the chemical industry on the right and left side of the northern wall. The imagery consists of a juxtaposition of scientists that are producing poison gas for warfare and scientists that are producing vaccines for medical purposes.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{interaction}} among manufacturing subsystems in a factory. The output of one manufacturing subsystem is usually the input to one or more others in the plant. For example, a production line may provide input to another manufacturing stage, a shipping system, or an automated <b>parts</b> <b>conveyor.</b> In all of these examples, the characteristics of the output from the production line can affect the subsequent process. This paper examines the output process of a serial production line of N machines with general processing time distributions and finite buffer capacities. Simulation is used {{to examine the effects of}} line length, buffer capacity, and buffer placement on the inter-departure distribution and correlation structure (autocorrelation function) of the output process of the production line. Results from this analysis are useful in setting production line design parameters and in determining the extent to which buffer placement can be used to control the variability of the output process, and thereby the amount of work-in-process present in downstream subsystems. Additional insights are provided to help explain why small buffers in production lines are normally adequate and to help us better understand the effects of buffers on tightly coupled production systems. By using a variety of processing time distributions, previously unknown effects attributed to skew of processing time are revealed. Since skew can often be reduced or eliminated by operator training, these effects are of particular interest since they can help to quantify some of the benefits of training. serial production lines, output processes, correlation structure, output variability...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Parts feeding devices or feeders {{are used}} in {{automated}} assembly systems to deliver correctly oriented parts to the assembly station workhead. These devices play an important operational role since feeding {{is one of the}} major operations involved in an automated assembly process. However they account for much of the cost of an automated assembly system because most of the engineering time spent to develop such a system is used to devise a means of feeding the components in the correct orientation for the assembly process. This thesis describes the implementation of an integrated and computer controlled feeding and transfer system. The system consists of a vibratory bowl feeder for selecting, orienting and feeding parts and a flat conveyor belt for transferring parts to a prescribed location. The work focusses mainly on the design and analysis of the bowl feeder, on the mechanical and information interfacing aspects of the integration problem and on the control of the system. Sensing and electronic control circuits were also built to complete the system. The system implemented is to be integrated at a later stage with an industrial robot for handling purposes. Therefore, some issues related to the handling of <b>parts</b> from the <b>conveyor</b> belt by the robot are also discussed. Experimental results show that the recommendable operating frequency for the vibratory feeder is close to the value predicted by theoretical analysis. Several concurrent activities with critical time constraints and different periods were involved in the system, making the control more difficult due to the limited control capabilities of Visual basic, an easy to learn programming language used to implement the control program and the relatively slow speed of the computer used Nevertheless, it was observed that for feed rates close to 3 parts/min, the program developed performs well regarding the random control of the flow rate of <b>parts</b> on the <b>conveyor,</b> <b>parts</b> position and speed profiles obtained compare satisfactorily with the corresponding theoretical profiles. Recommendations for the integration of the robot to the system are made...|$|R
