50|$|One theorized <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanism</b> called “strangulation” keeps cold {{gas from}} {{entering}} the galaxy. Strangulation is likely the main mechanism for quenching star formation in nearby low-mass galaxies. The exact physical explanation for strangulation is still unknown, but it {{may have to do}} with a galaxy’s interactions with other galaxies. As a galaxy falls into a galaxy cluster, gravitational interactions with other galaxies can strangle it by preventing it from accreting more gas. For galaxies with massive dark matter halos, another <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanism</b> called “virial shock heating” may also prevent gas from becoming cool enough to form stars.|$|E

40|$|How can a {{holistic}} model of crime prevention {{be applied to}} crime originating from outlaw motorcycle clubs? The police in different countries and even in different police districts have varied considerably in the ways they have dealt with these outlaw MC clubs and the criminal activities associated with them. Some police forces have mainly applied a repressive criminal justice approach whereas others have put more emphasis on dialogue, prevention and harm reduction. This article will argue for a comprehensive approach which combines “soft” and “hard” measures, based on {{a holistic}} model of crime prevention developed in my previous works (Bjørgo 2013, 2016), based on nine <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Several <b>preventive</b> actors beyond the police possess a variety of measures which can be implemented to activate these <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Such a holistic approach reduces the need to rely on repressive approaches alone.

5000|$|The National Plan of Action on Human Rights 2009-2014 [...] "To Live Well" [...] {{recognised}} {{the absence}} of any preventative or punitative legislation against torture and mistreatment, and established the objective of adopting a policy of prevention, vigilance and sanction of torture and cruel, inhumane, degrading or humiliating punishment and treatment, or any other form of attack on physical, psychological, moral or sexual integrity perpetrated by private persons or public functionaries.

5000|$|In 2007 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bolivia asked ITEI {{to create}} a draft bill against torture and for the {{implementation}} of a National <b>Preventive</b> <b>Mechanism.</b> Delivered {{to the president of the}} Committee of Human Rights in July 2010, ITEI's [...] "Draft Bill against Torture and Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading or Humiliating Treatment" [...] proposes a prison sentence of 12 to 20 years for those convicted of torture as well as [...] "just and adequate compensation" [...] for those affected, including full rehabilitation. ITEI, in its explanation of the motives behind the presentation of the draft bill, insists that the current sentences in the Bolivian Penal Code for those found guilty of torture are not in proportion to the offence. According to ITEI, torture has long-lasting physical and psychological effects and therefore the prison sentence should be no shorter than that imposed for murder.|$|E

On 12 November 2014 the European Union and Kazakhstan held the sixth round of the annual Human Rights Dialogue in Brussels. The Kazakh delegation was led by Mr Yogan Merkel, First Deputy Prosecutor General, who was accompanied by Mr Vyacheslav Kalyuzhnyy, Director of the National Centre for Human Rights, and other senior officials. The EU delegation was led by Mr Silvio Gonzato, Director for Human Rights and Democracy at the European External Action Service. The dialogue was held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. The EU welcomed Kazakhstan's development of a functioning National <b>Preventive</b> <b>Mechanism</b> for the monitoring of places of detention, and encouraged further steps to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Centre for Human Rights. The EU acknowledged Kazakhstan's recent engagement in the second cycle of the Universal Period Review (UPR) process at the UN Human Rights Council, and encouraged the Kazakh authorities to consider accepting a number of UPR recommendations that it initially did not support. The next round of the EU-Kazakhstan Human Rights Dialogue is expected to take place in Astana in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ad hoc {{networks}} mostly operate over open {{environments and}} are hence {{vulnerable to a}} large body of threats. This calls for coupling <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> e. g., firewall, with advanced intrusion detection. To meet this requirement, we introduce IDAR, a signature- and log-based distributed intrusion detector dedicated to ad hoc routing protocols. Contrary to existing systems that observe packets, IDAR analyses logs and identifies patterns of misuse. This detector scopes with the resource-constraints of devices by providing distributed detection. In particular, depending on the level of suspicion/gravity involved, in-depth cooperative investigation is whether launched. Simulation shows limited bandwidth usage, high detection and low false positives. I...|$|R

The test parameters of this study are the rigidity of piles, the geometrical arrangementof piles and the separation distance between piles. The main results obtained in this study are as follows: 1) A kind of arching action takes place in surrounding ground. 2) The zigzag arrangement of piles is more effective than the single line arrangement sinceso-called double arching action is expected...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing (HOLSR) {{protocol}} {{was designed to}} improve scalability of heterogeneous Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). HOLSR {{is derived from the}} OLSR protocol and implements Multipoint Relay (MPR) nodes as a flooding mechanism for distributing control information. Unlike OLSR, nodes are organized in clusters and implement Hierarchical Topology Control (HTC) messages for inter-cluster communications. Nevertheless, HOLSR was designed without security measures. Therefore, a misbehaving node can affect the topology map acquisition process by interrupting the flooding of control information or disturbing the MPR selection process. We present a taxonomy of flooding disruption attacks, that affect the topology map acquisition process in HOLSR networks, and <b>preventive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to mitigate the effect of this kind of attacks...|$|R
