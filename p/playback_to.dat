5|$|More {{money and}} {{resources}} were dedicated to Mermaid {{than any other}} Disney animated film in decades. Aside from its main animation facility in Glendale, California, Disney opened a satellite feature animation facility during the production of Mermaid in Lake Buena Vista, Florida (near Orlando, Florida), within Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park at Walt Disney World. Opening in 1989, the Disney-MGM facility's first projects were to produce an entire Roger Rabbit cartoon short, Roller Coaster Rabbit, and to contribute ink and paint support to Mermaid. Another first for recent years was the filming of live actors and actresses for motion reference material for the animators, a practice used frequently {{for many of the}} Disney animated features produced under Walt Disney's supervision. Sherri Lynn Stoner, a former member of Los Angeles' Groundlings improvisation comedy group, and Joshua Finkel, a Broadway actor, performed key scenes as Ariel and Eric respectively. Jodi Benson had already been cast as Ariel's voice actor by this time, and her recorded dialogue was used as <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> guide these live-action references.|$|E

25|$|The spacecraft's onboard {{computer}} system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), {{a device that}} combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25megahertz main processor, and a 10MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, compressed, and stored data from MESSENGERs instruments for later <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> Earth.|$|E

25|$|Galileo {{arrived at}} Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after a six-year journey from Earth during which it used gravity assists with Venus and Earth to boost its orbit out to Jupiter. Shortly before Galileos Jupiter Orbit Insertion maneuver, the {{spacecraft}} performed the only targeted flyby of Io of its nominal mission. High-resolution images were originally planned during the encounter, but {{problems with the}} spacecraft's tape recorder, used to save data taken during encounters for later <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> Earth, required the elimination of high-data-rate observations from the flyby schedule to ensure the safe recording of Galileo atmospheric probe data. The encounter did yield significant results from lower data rate experiments. Analysis of the Doppler shift of Galileos radio signal showed that Io is differentiated with a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System. Magnetometer data from the encounter, combined {{with the discovery of}} an iron core, suggested that Io might have a magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

500|$|The disc {{reader of}} the Wii does not play DVD-Video, DVD-Audio or Compact Discs. A 2006 {{announcement}} stated that {{a new version of}} the Wii (capable of DVD-Video playback) would be released in 2007; however, Nintendo delayed its release to focus on meeting demand for the original console. Nintendo's initial announcement stated that it [...] "requires more than a firmware upgrade" [...] to implement, and the capability could not be made available as an upgrade option for the existing Wii. Despite this assertion, third parties have used Wii homebrew to add DVD <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> unmodified Wii units. The Wii also can be hacked to enable an owner to use the console for activities unintended by the manufacturer. Several brands of modchips are available for the Wii.|$|E
500|$|The game's audio {{was created}} by Martin Stig Andersen, a {{graduate}} from the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus. Andersen's specialisation was in acousmatic music, non-traditional music created from generated sounds that have no apparent visual source. He was drawn to work with Jensen on the game after seeing the initial trailer, having been drawn in by the expressions of the boy character; Andersen compared the early visuals to his acousmatic music: [...] "you have something recognizable and realistic, {{but at the same}} time it's abstract". Andersen sought to create acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game's environments. Two examples he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon [...] "HOTEL" [...] sign, and silencing the wind sound as the spider approached the boy in the forest. Andersen avoided the use of easily recognizable sounds, distorting them when needed as to allow players to interpret the sounds' meanings for themselves. Andersen constructed most of the game's sounds through a number of [...] "grains" [...] instead of longer sound loops, allowing him to adjust the <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> give better feedback to the player without sounding repetitious; one example he cites was the use of separate sounds for the boy's toe and heel when they make contact with the ground, giving a more realistic sound for movement. Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in Limbo, but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions; the acousmatic music was intended to leave room for interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game's art and story. Andersen noted that this helps with immersion within the game by making no attempt to control the emotional tone; [...] "if [...] scared it will probably make them more scared when there's no music to take them by the hand and tell them how to feel". Due to fans' requests, Playdead released the game's soundtrack on iTunes Store on 11 July 2011.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlaybacks are {{a useful}} tool for {{conducting}} well-controlled and replicated experiments on the effects of anthropogenic noise, particularly for repeated exposures. However, <b>playbacks</b> are unlikely <b>to</b> fully reproduce original sources of anthropogenic noise. Here we examined the sound pressure and particle acceleration of boat noise playbacks in a field experiment and reveal that although there remain recognized limitations, the signal-to-noise ratios of boat <b>playbacks</b> <b>to</b> ambient noise do not exceed those of a real boat. The experimental setup tested is therefore of value for use in experiments on the effects of repeated exposure of aquatic animals to boat noise...|$|R

50|$|Cows, as {{with many}} mammals, use vocal {{communication}} to mediate and strengthen strong mother-infant bonds. Calves often call to their mothers in times of need (hunger, danger), and {{it is believed that}} certain calls are used to solicit nursing. McCowan et al. (2002) found that playback of calf vocalizations caused a statistically significant increase (1-2%) in milk production in dairy cows. The cows most responsive to the vocalizations were those cows whose actual infants were closest in age to the calves used for the recordings (less than 1 week old); therefore, it is possible that milk production within a dairy herd could be increased further if multiple playbacks of calf vocalizations were used, varying by age as appropriate for the cows (McCowan 2002). (Young calf <b>playbacks</b> <b>to</b> cows with young calves; older calf <b>playbacks</b> <b>to</b> cows with older calves, etc.) These results highlight an innovative non-chemical method for increasing milk production in dairy cows, and are especially important findings for use on organic dairy farms, as the demand for organic products grows.|$|R

2500|$|On June 1, 1970, Gaye entered Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. studios {{to record}} [...] "What's Going On". Immediately after {{learning}} about the song, many of Motown's musicians, known as The Funk Brothers noted {{that there was a}} different approach with Gaye's record from that used on other Motown recordings, and Gaye complicated matters by only bringing in a few of the members while bringing his own recruits, including drummer Chet Forest. Longtime Funk Brothers members Jack Ashford, James Jamerson and Eddie Brown participated in the recording. Jamerson was pulled into the recording studio by Gaye after he located Jamerson playing with a local band at a blues bar and Eli Fontaine, the saxophonist behind [...] "Baby, I'm For Real", also participated in the recording. Jamerson, who couldn't sit properly on his seat after arriving to the session drunk, performed his bass riffs, written for him by the album's arranger David Van De Pitte, on the floor. Fontaine's open alto saxophone riff on the song was not originally intended. When Gaye heard the <b>playback</b> <b>to</b> what Fontaine thought was simply a demo, Gaye let him continue. When Fontaine said he was [...] "just goofing around", Gaye replied, [...] "well, you goof off exquisitely. Thank you." ...|$|E
