What has changed, however, is the approach to the calculation of the resistance of such composite structures. First, concrete used to fulfil a reinforcing function only. Later, it was assigned a load-bearing role (acting in compression) and the resistance of a composite structure was determined using the method of <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses.</b> Nowadays, the verification of cross-sectional resistance is based on limit state design principles stipulated by European technical standards – EUROCODES.

Therefore {{it is necessary to}} max out <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> during the design process. In addition, {{there is a need to}} match estimated lifetimes more and more exactly, so it is important to predict accurately the effective stresses on mechanical parts. This paper examines the impact of size and geometric tolerance on stress and long-life fatigue strength. For this purpose an in-house software tool has been developed which makes it possible to generate a CAD model with simultaneous consideration of all geometric tolerances. The resultant model has a stochastically deformed shape but still corresponds to its engineering drawing. In a second step an FE analysis is performed to determine the influence of these tolerances on the long-life fatigue strength of the parts. These results are compared with the results for the model without the geometric tolerances (using only nominal CAD data) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the investigations {{presented in this paper}} is the simplified consideration of mean and residual stresses as well as the complete disregard of the complex failure mechanisms in the common fatigue standards and guidelines. An improved fatigue life assessment for welded components, which includes the crack initiation and propagation phase is the scope of this paper. The crack initiation phase is considered using the strain-life approach. The crack propagation life, starting from a technical crack of a depth of a = 0. 5 mm, is derived by the application of linear-elastic fracture mechanics. In this two-phase approach, the mean and residual stresses are considered by using damage parameters for the initiation phase and effective stress intensity factors for the propagation phase. With this approach, a better understanding can be obtained of the influence of mean- and residual stresses and their influence on the course (slope k and knee point Nk) of the S-N curve. With this information to hand, a more reliable fatigue assessment can be achieved than is possible with the common standards and guidelines.

40|$|This paper {{carries out}} the {{assessment}} of reliability indices of railway prestressed concrete sleepers designed in accordance with Australian Standard: AS 1085. 19. The current design approach of the prestressed concrete sleeper relies on the <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> over crosssectional area. Loading condition acting on railway sleepers is considered from axle burden and dynamic amplification factor. On the basis of Australian design of railway prestressed concrete sleepers, only service limit states are considered; however, the design challenge is to provide adequate resistance of certain cross sections to {{both positive and negative}} bending moments. In this paper, the service limit states functions are formulated taking into account the permissible compressive and tensile stresses at both initial and final stages, and applied positive and negative bending moments at railseat and middle sections. Random variables in the reliability analysis include railway track design parameters, axle load, material and geometrical properties, prestressing force and its losses, and model uncertainties regarded to the structural resistance and load effects. Statistical properties of related parameters are adopted from previous studies. Two analysis methods are used: first-order moment reliability method (FORM) and second-order moment reliability method (SORM). Sensitivity analyses of the reliability indices for flexural capacity according to the requirements of the limit states functions are also investigated, in order to evaluate the major influences of dynamic load factors, strengths of materials, track parameters, and model uncertainties...|$|E

In general, cracking can incur when the bottom fibre stress is larger than tensile strength of concrete. Premature cracking of prestressed concrete sleepers has been detected in railway tracks. The major cause of cracking is the infrequent but high-magnitude wheel loads produced by a small percentage of “out-of-round ” wheels or railhead surface defects, which are crudely accounted for in AS 1085. 14 by a single load factor. Based on the current design method, the cracked sleepers must be replaced by new ones, resulting in a costly maintenance budget each year.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of the fatigue strength or crack initiation life of ship structural details is characterised by wide scattering and uncertainties of several influence factors. Modern approaches {{such as the}} partial safety factor concept can consider them in a rational way, but require information of their frequency distribution. Based on the common method to estimate the fatigue life or permissible stress range using S-N curves and Palmgren-Miner's Rule, several factors are investigated in detail which significantly affect the uncertainties. The fatigue strength or S-N curve of a detail belongs to them, which is defined either for a nominal or a local stress. Depending {{on the type of}} stress, additional uncertainties can arise from the combination of notch cases or imperfections. The uncertainties are substantiated for typical applications. Further uncertainties in connection with variable amplitude loading are caused by the adoption of a damage accumulation hypothesis, which are estimated {{on the basis of a}} literature survey. According to this, high scatter is also related to model uncertainties. Analyses performed in this study show smaller scattering as far as only the type of model and mesh fineness are varied. Assuming usual uncertainties for the loads and maintaining the currently supposed level of reliability, partial safety factors are deduced for the effects mentioned. In addition, the necessity of further safety factors is investigated which consider the importance and redundancy of the structure.

Ballasted rail track {{has been adopted}} for modern railways because of its many superior advantages in design, construction, short- and long-term maintenance, sustainability, financial capital and life cycle cost. An important element of the railway track system, which distributes the wheel load to the formation and holds the rail gauge, is the railway sleeper. Field data has raised concerns about design techniques for prestressed concrete (PC) sleepers. Most current design codes for these rely on allowable stresses and material strength reductions. In contrast, premature cracking of PC sleepers {{has been found in}} railway tracks. The major cause of cracking is the infrequent but high-magnitude wheel loads produced by the small percentage of irregular wheels or rail-head surface defects; both these are crudely accounted for in the allowable stress design method by an over-conservative single load factor. The current design philosophy, outlined in either Australian or American Standard, is based on the assessment of <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> resulting from quasi-static wheel loads and essentially the static response of PC sleepers. To change the conventional methodology to a more rational and economical design method that involves a more realistic dynamic response of PC sleepers and performance-based design concept, comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the dynamic response, and the dynamic resistance of PC sleepers have been conducted.

Because of previous knowledge deficiencies, railway civil and track engineers {{have been aware of}} the conservative design methods for structural components in any railway track that rely on allowable stresses and material strength reductions. In particular, railway sleeper (or railroad tie) is an important component of railway tracks and is commonly made of prestressed concrete. The existing code for designing such components makes use of the <b>permissible</b> <b>stress</b> design concept, whereas the fiber stresses over cross sections at initial and final stages are limited by some empirical values.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the failure of reinforced concrete beams without web reinforcement under the action of bending and shear. A total of 39 singly-reinforced concrete beams of various cross-sections were tested with two concentrated loads. The test specimens and the instrumentation were designed to yield detailed information on shrinkage strains, and the load-induced strains in concrete prior to and after the formation of diagonal tension cracks. The behaviour of the beams up to the failure load was carefully observed and studied. The mode of formation and propagation of cracks, and the failure surfaces were given special attention. The influence of bond between concrete and the tensile reinforcement and the contribution of the "dowel force" to shear resistance was considered. Quantitative analyses show that shear failure is not a bond failure and that the "dowel force" is a variable parameter which can assume any value including zero. From the analysis of the computed strains and the observed phenomena, a simple and rational expression is presented for the failure in shear of reinforced concrete beams subjected to concentrated loads. It is thought that the equation represents more accurately the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams under bending and shear than other available equations. The proposed equation was applied to other test data from different authors and the results are compared with the data obtained from this project. Errors inherent in the determination of diagonal cracking loads and the unreliable nature of visual observations are discussed. It is thought that this investigation and analysis will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the failure of reinforced concrete beam in shear, and therefore to a more rational basis for the design of web reinforcement. The nominal shear stress at the formation of diagonal cracks and at shear failure is compared with the permissible shear stress in beams without web reinforcement, recommended by the British and other Codes of Practice, It was observed that these <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> which are currently in use are too low particularly for beams with shear-span to effective depth ratio of less than 3. It is therefore suggested that the nominal shear stress based on the external diagonal cracking reaction be considered as the permissible stress for beams without web reinforcement.

40|$|Rail {{operators}} are consistently demanding higher axle loads to compete effectively with other modes of transport, particularly for heavy haul freight of minerals. However, high axle loads {{can only be}} achieved by ensuring that the existing rail infrastructure can cope with the greater static and dynamic loads associated with the wheel-rail interactions. Premature cracking of prestressed concrete sleepers is often the result of high-intensity dynamic loading caused by wheel or rail irregularities. The high-magnitude wheel loads produced by {{a small percentage of}} “bad” wheels or rail head surface defects are crudely accounted for in the Australian Standard AS 1085. 14 by a single load amplification factor. In addition, there is a widespread perception within the railway engineering community that the carrying capacity of the existing track infrastructure is not fully utilised, and concrete sleepers possess significant amounts of untapped reserve strength. This {{can be attributed to the}} current design philosophy for concrete sleepers, outlined in AS 1085. 14. This is based on the assessment of <b>permissible</b> <b>stresses</b> resulting from quasi-static wheel loads and essentially the static response of concrete sleepers, making it unduly conservative and very costly for the railway organisations. This thesis addresses the identified deficiencies of the current design method through an in-depth analysis of the dynamic response of concrete sleepers under realistic loading conditions and proposes a more rational design procedure. In order to shift the conventional methodology to a more rational design method that involves more realistic dynamic response of concrete sleepers and performance-based design methodology, a significant research effort within the framework of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Railway Engineering and Technologies has been carried out to perform comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the dynamic response, and the dynamic resistance of prestressed concrete sleepers. The collaborative research between the University of Wollongong (UoW) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has addressed such important issues as the spectrum and amplitudes of dynamic forces applied to the railway track, evaluation of the reserve capacity of typical prestressed concrete sleepers designed to the current code AS 1085. 14, and the development of a new limit states design concept. The comprehensive literature review highlighted the extremely limited research work that previously had been done in this field of research. In order to enhance an understanding of the dynamic performance of railway tracks, the first part of this thesis investigates the dynamic characteristics of the global railway track and its individual components with particular reference to rail pads and prestressed concrete (PC) sleepers. The experimental techniques for extracting dynamic properties of track components, developed in the laboratory, have been successfully applied in field trials. Moreover, this thesis provides an intensive review aimed at predicting wheel impact loads due to the wheel/rail irregularities at different return periods (based on the field data from wheel impact detectors). The experimental and numerical investigations into the dynamic behaviour of prestressed concrete sleepers subjected to severe impact loading are then presented. The impact tests were carried out using the prestressed concrete sleepers manufactured in Australia. A track test bed was simulated in the laboratory and calibrated against the frequency response functions obtained for real tracks. A series of incremental impact loading tests for the prestressed concrete sleepers was performed, ranging from a typical design load to a severe wheel load. The cumulative impact damage and crack propagation in concrete sleepers were identified. The effects of track environment together with the relationship between the bending moment of prestressed concrete sleepers and the applied impact force are also presented. The later part of this thesis identifies the responses of prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under both single and repeated impact loads associated with different probabilities of occurrence. The residual capacities of the damaged prestressed concrete sleepers are studied in order to clarify the notion about the reserve strength of the concrete sleepers. The numerical investigations of the static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under static and dynamic loads were also undertaken to supplement the experimental findings in this thesis. A proposal for the reliability-based design concepts and rationales associated with the development of limit states design procedures for the conversion of AS 1085. 14 to a limit states design format is one of the key outcomes of this thesis. The new limit states design concepts and procedures for railway prestressed concrete sleepers are presented as the design guidelines for the railway engineers. The new methodology is aimed not only to save the material resources to achieve financial gains, but also to reduce the amount of cement production which would otherwise emit carbon dioxide as a contributing factor towards global warming...|$|E
