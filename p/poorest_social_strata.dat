MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram estudadas 1. 035 pessoas com idade entre 20 e 69 anos, residentes na zona urbana do município. A obesidade foi definida a partir do índice de massa corporal (IMC) igual ou superior a 30 kg/m². A análise multivariada foi realizada considerando um modelo hierárquico das variáveis associadas com obesidade em ambos os sexos. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de obesidade foi de 21 % (IC 95 % 18 - 23), sendo de 25 % (IC 95 % 22 - 29) entre as mulheres e 15 % (IC 95 % 12 - 18) entre os homens. A relação entre as variáveis socioeconômicas e a obesidade foi inversa entre as mulheres e direta entre os homens. Entre as mulheres, as variáveis que se mantiveram associadas significativamente com obesidade foram: obesidade dos pais, ocorrência de diabete ou hipertensão, não fumar, menor número de refeições diárias e não ter realizado exercício físico no lazer durante o último ano. Para os homens somente a ocorrência de obesidade nos pais e a hipertensão arterial sistêmica estiveram significativamente associadas, enquanto a proteção do maior número de refeições apresentou uma associação quase significativa (p = 0, 07). CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados indicam que os determinantes de obesidade são diferentes entre os sexos, ocorrendo em maior freqüência entre as mulheres e com o aumento da idade. INTRODUCTION: A population-based {{cross-sectional study}} was conducted in Pelotas, Southern Brazil, with the objective of determining the prevalence of obesity and identify associated, variables as this condition increased markedly in the country between 1974 and 1989. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One thousand and thirty-five adults between 20 and 69 years of age were studied. Obesity was defined as a Body Mass Index - BMI - equal to or over 30 Kg/square meter). The multivariate analyses took into account the hierarchical model of the variables associated with obesity for both men and women. RESULTS: The prevalence for the overall population was of 21 % (CI 18 - 23). It was higher among women - 25 % (CI 22 - 29) than for men - 15 % (CI 12 - 18). Socioeconomic status was positively associated with obesity among men, whereas the opposite situation was reported for women, with those belonging to the <b>poorest</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> presenting increased BMI. Reported obesity in their parents was associated with increased BMI in the subjects, and this association remained statistically significant even after compensating for the effect of possible confounding variables. Self-reported diabetes and arterial hypertension doubled the risk of obesity, whereas non-smoking was associated with obesity only among women. Variables which were not associated with obesity after adjusting for confounders were alcohol consumption, marital status and parity. Women having more daily meals were less prone to obesity, even after controlling for confounders, and this association was not quite significant for men (p = 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of obesity was higher among women, and important differences in risk factors were noticed when the population was considered by sex...|$|E
50|$|As to {{the theory}} of communism, Screpanti {{proposed}} a re-reading of Marx and Engels as libertarian theorists. Freedom is defined as the real capacity of individuals to make choices. Following Gramsci’s approach, enriched with the achievements of current theory on the freedom of choice, this is intended as a magnitude determined by the opportunity sets available to individuals. Freedom of choice is not distributed equally in capitalism: it is practically nil for the workers and at its greatest for capitalists in the production process; it is negligible in the <b>poor</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> and very large for the privileged classes in the consumption sphere. Communism is seen as a conflicting process of historical transformation in which the oppressed and exploited classes struggle for the redistribution of freedom.|$|R

The conditions of primary and secondary education under the influence of this scheme were reported, along with characteristics of the Bengali family living arrangement, the poverty of landless peasants in rural areas, and the population explosion. The relationships of Islamic ideology to education, to the concept of the child, and to ideas about women were also discussed. An educational anthropological model was constructed for the analyses of possible correlates which might affect children's experience in socialization settings. This model, which emphasizes macro-micro links, had three components at the macro level : life maintenance system, cultural meaning systems, and population increase & assistance from overseas. The relationships of these components with socialization were discussed with special reference to the life and education of children and youth in Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Political and {{economic}} changes that {{occurred on the}} territory of Poland {{during the second half}} of the 19 th century contributed to change in social structures of rural and urban populations. Urban populations underwent a profound change due to industrialisation that caused appearance of new social classes, especially the class of wealthy commoners - the middle class. Influence of social stratification on human morphological characters and on growth at adolescence is well documented for recent populations, however, it is much less studied in the past population due to scarcity of appropriate data. Objective. To characterise: 1. body height and body mass of adults and 2. the adolescent growth spurt in various strata/class of Polish people {{during the second half of}} the 19 th century and at the beginning of the 20 th century. Material and Methods. Data on body height and body mass of adults (20 + years) and youths (7 - 20) of privileged and <b>poor</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> living in the Kingdom of Poland and in its capital, Warsaw were derived from published historical sources. Means, and where possible standard deviations, of body height, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) were calculated for various groups. Prevalence of obesity (BMI > = 30 kg/m²) and overweight (BMI > = 25 kg/m²) was assessed separately for nobility, middle class, working class and peasantry. LOESS curves were fitted to annual cross-sectional increments in body height and body weight of youths of different social classes in order to evaluate the presence and magnitude of growth spurts. Results. The largest average values of body height and body mass of males and females were found for nobility, somewhat lower were values for the middle class. In both groups average BMI exceeded 25 kg/m². Peasant males and females were shorter and lighter than those of upper class. Males and females of the urban working class were even shorter and lighter than peasants. BMI averages of peasants and working class were below 25 kg/m². About 30 - 40 % of nobility and rich middle class people were overweight and 12 - 21 % obese. Among lower class 5 - 20 % were overweight. Obesity occurred in 4 - 9 % of peasants, but no working class males were obese at all. Children of privileged classes were taller and heavier than children of the working class. Boys of noble and middle class families experienced adolescent growth spurts at 14 - 15 years with peak height velocity of 7 cm/year and weight velocity of 5 kg/year. Among privileged girls adolescent growth spurts at 11 - 12 years with peak velocities of 6 cm/year and weight velocity of 5 kg/year. Among poor working class boys and girls there were no adolescent growth spurt, Conclusions. Upward social mobility providing better living conditions and nutrition resulted in increases in body height and body mass of children and adults contributing to the occurrence of overweight and obesity. Adolescent growth spurt was not a universal phenomenon. It did not occur among children of <b>poor</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata.</b> Improved living conditions of privileged classes produced accelerated growth in adolescence.

40|$|The Pentecostal {{movement}} {{that has been}} growing rapidly {{over the last few}} decades, claims to offer an experience of a radical life-transformation, spiritual safety and even economic prosperity. It is strongly proselytizing, exhibits charismatic leadership and proclaims a dualistic vision of the world. The major response comes mostly from the <b>poor</b> and marginalized <b>social</b> <b>strata,</b> due to the emphasis on human dignity, certain emancipation of women, freedom from addictions, but also requirements of taking responsibility for one's family. The "born again" members derive mostly from the Catholic Church, whose pastoral practices fail to compete against the market-oriented ones. The attraction and the swiftness of its expansion are the subject of many studies and prognosis regarding the influence of Pentecostalism on the socio-economic changes. Understood as a religious movement proper to the late stage of capitalism, Pentecostalism helps to cease the Latino fatalism, yet stirs some controversies regarding its realism and durability of its proposals.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{problems of}} poverty in the American society classified among affluent societies. Poverty as a social and economic problem can be found everywhere in the world, but in the United States it has special repercussions. The author has made an attempt to answer two questions, which are of primary importance for the analyzed problem: 1) what arc the causes o f poverty? 2) which kind of policy is the most appropriate for elimination of poverty? A starting point or formulating {{answers to these questions}} is a definition of the state of poverty. In order to deľme and estimate the number of economically active persons there are needed criteria referring to characteristics o f economic activity o f individuals and their family situation. Both these issues have to be considered simultaneously wishing to grasp comprehensively the essence of the problem. The second important issue emerging in the course of defining unemployment is the concept of sufficient incomes and small earnings. The third problem is connected with the stan lards of poverty. It is a problem of technical nature and it is connected with measuring the size of households as a basis for estimation of incomes. Finally, the fourth problem connected with the identification of poverty are definitions of income and earnings. The main causes of poverty among population forming manpower resources are considered to be the following: 1) shortage of human capital; 2) insufficient demand for labour in the economy; 3) discrimination; and 4) structure of the labour market. The impact of human capital on employment prospects is explained by the theory of marginal productivity. The more human capital can be offered by an individual the bigger will be their marginal productivity in a given production process. Thus, individuals with a small human capital have a low marginal labour productivity and it is most likely that they will be obtaining a low pay or remain jobless. Possessing an appropriate human capital is not a guarantee of getting a satisfying job in itself. Qualifications and skills are attributes of labour supply. Meanwhile, the nature of market demand for labour is equally important. The third group of poverty causes includes derivatives o f discrimination. As a rule, persons belonging to minority and ethnic groups, women, and generations belonging to <b>poor</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> do not have equal opportunities with others on the labour market. Among different hypotheses concerning causes {{of poverty in}} an affluent society a special role is played by theories voicing a decay of competition forces on the labour market accompanied by an emergence of mutually separated submarkets called segments. Among alternative policies aimed at counteracting poverty, the most efficient is considered the policy of increasing employment opportunities. In relation to persons encountering employment barriers all the lime, there should be sought solutions based on transfer benefits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{substantial}} social inequalities in adult male mortality in many countries. Smoking {{is often more}} prevalent among men of lower social class, education, or income. The contribution of smoking to these social inequalities in mortality remains uncertain. METHODS: The contribution of smoking to adult mortality in a population can be estimated indirectly from disease-specific death rates in that population (using absolute lung cancer rates to indicate proportions due to smoking of mortality from certain other diseases). We applied these methods to 1996 death rates at ages 35 - 69 years in men in three different <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> in four countries, based on a total of 0. 6 million deaths. The highest and lowest <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> were based on social class (professional vs unskilled manual) in England and Wales, neighbourhood income (top vs bottom quintile) in urban Canada, and completed years of education (more than vs less than 12 years) in the USA and Poland. RESULTS: In each country, there was about a two-fold difference between the highest and the lowest <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> in overall risks of dying among men aged 35 - 69 years (England and Wales 21 %vs 43 %, USA 20 %vs 37 %, Canada 21 %vs 34 %, Poland 26 %vs 50 %: four-country mean 22 %vs 41 %, four-country mean absolute difference 19 %). More than half of this difference in mortality between {{the top and bottom}} <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> involved differences in risks of being killed at age 35 - 69 years by smoking (England and Wales 4 %vs 19 %, USA 4 %vs 15 %, Canada 6 %vs 13 %, Poland 5 %vs 22 %: four-country mean 5 %vs 17 %, four-country mean absolute difference 12 %). Smoking-attributed mortality accounted for nearly half of total male mortality in the lowest <b>social</b> <b>stratum</b> of each country.
