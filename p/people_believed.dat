5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{folklore}} {{often associated}} tuberculosis with vampires. When {{one member of}} a family died from it, the other infected members would lose their health slowly. <b>People</b> <b>believed</b> this {{was caused by the}} original person with TB draining the life from the other family members.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge {{in a cave}} outside of the town. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave {{in the town of}} Bethlehem which local <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{evidence}} of prehistoric activity in the area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. The first <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E

5000|$|In some circumstances, {{a person}} may argue {{that the fact that}} Y <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> X to be true implies that X is false. This line of thought is closely related to the appeal to spite fallacy given that it invokes a person's {{contempt}} for the general populace or something about the general populace in order to persuade them that most are wrong about X. This ad populum reversal commits the same logical flaw as the original fallacy given that the idea [...] "X is true" [...] is inherently separate from the idea that [...] "Y <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> X": [...] "Y <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> in X as true, purely because Y <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> in it, and not because of any further considerations. Therefore X must be false." [...] While Y <b>people</b> can <b>believe</b> X to be true for fallacious reasons, X might still be true. Their motivations for believing X do not affect whether X is true or false.|$|R
5|$|Nri <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> {{that the}} sun was the {{dwelling}} place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E
5|$|Plague cases {{continued}} to occur sporadically at a modest rate until {{the summer of}} 1666. On {{the second and third}} of September that year, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the City of London, and some <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> that the fire {{put an end to the}} epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs, and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E

5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E
5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> that he would marry and have children of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Legends of vampires {{have existed}} for millennia; {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood-drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century Southeastern Europe, particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself. Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> to be vampires.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of the}} world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
