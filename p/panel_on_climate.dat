Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as gift-reciprocity relationships and as a model for social relationships. The famous Indigenous artwork Spirit of Haida Gwaii remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting - between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.|$|R

40|$|The cooling {{of solar}} {{photovoltaic}} panels {{is not only}} critical, due to the dropping of cell efficiency with the increased temperature, but also challenging, since the heat transfer enhancement must be accomplished without blocking the sun radiation. Longitudinal vortices can be generated by small geometries and last a long distance, thus it is suitable to be applied <b>on</b> solar photovoltaic <b>panels.</b> Delta winglet {{is one of the}} most effective longitudinal vortex generators. This work presents four papers, one on the importance of cooling solar <b>panels</b> and three <b>on</b> the investigations and optimizations of the delta winglet. In the first paper, the mitigation effect by solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>climate</b> change, as well as the possible beneficial outcomes by employing turbulence generators is discussed. The second paper studies the flow structure of the longitudinal vortex generated by a delta winglet with an aspect ratio of 2 and an attack angle of 30 degrees. It is followed by a paper that investigates the influence of aspect ratio on the flow behavior, and its effect on heat transfer is studied in Appendix A. The final paper presents the impact of attack angle on the heat transfer and correlates the heat transfer with the flow parameters...|$|R

40|$|Navarro-Ortega, Alicia et al. [...] Trabajo presentado en el 6 th SETAC World Congress (2012), celebrado en Berlín del 20 al 24 de mayo de 2012. Water {{resources}} in Spain {{are subjected to}} rising pressures, related to the socioeconomic activities of an increasing human population, expressed by accelerated land use changes, and the specific climate characteristic of Mediterranean countries. The main <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> <b>climate</b> change predict a future scenario of increasing frequency of floods and extended droughts in the Iberian Peninsula, mostly in the Mediterranean basin. This {{will be added to}} the currently existing problems, and will probably affect the available water resources, their quality, the functioning of associated ecosystems, especially rivers and their aquifers, and the ecosystem services they provide. In such context, SCARCE is a project that aims to describe and predict the relevance of global change impacts on water availability, water quality and ecosystem services in Mediterranean river basins of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as their impacts on the human society and economy. Hence, the project has assembled a multidisciplinary team of leading scientists in the fields of hydrology, geomorphology, chemistry, ecology, ecotoxicology, economy, engineering and modelling, in an unknown effort in the CONSOLIDER framework. The project also considers the active involvement of Water Authorities and other relevant agents as stakeholders. SCARCE has two complementary objectives. The first tackles basic research questions and will define the long-term patterns and the mechanisms that operate in the hydrology, water quality, habitat dynamics, and ecosystem structure and function of Mediterranean basins. The second objective is related to the effects of climate and human foot-print (taken both as key elements of global change) that provide on the ecosystem services, rivers and streams, as well as the urgent need to implement and eventually refine the water management policies demanded by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Therefore, the project emphasizes linking basic research and management practices in a single framework. The project has the external support of several Water Authorities and stakeholders. SCARCE is structured across a series of Horizontal and Thematic Work packages that coordinate the various scientific goals, as well as their interactions. These WPs deal with data collection (WP 1), hydrology (WP 2), sediment transport and river channel morphology (WP 3), chemical and biological quality (WP 4), ecosystem processes (WP 5), modelling (WP 6), socioeconomic scenarios (WP 7), ecosystem services (WP 8), river management (WP 9) and coordination (WP 10).

In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming.

Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E

40|$|The US Department of Energy's Office (DOE) of Geothermal Technologies {{conducted}} {{its annual}} Program Review XVII in Berkeley, California, on May 18 [...] 20, 1999. The theme {{this year was}} "Building on 25 Years of Geothermal Partnership with Industry". In 1974, Congress enacted Public Law 93 - 410 which sanctioned the Geothermal Energy Coordination and Management Project, the Federal Government's initial partnering with the US geothermal industry. The annual program review provides a forum to foster this federal partnership with the US geothermal industry through the presentation of DOE-funded research papers from leaders in the field, speakers who are prominent in the industry, topical panel discussions and workshops, planning sessions, {{and the opportunity to}} exchange ideas. Speakers and researchers from both industry and DOE presented an annual update on research in progress, discussed changes in the environment and deregulated energy market, and exchanged ideas to refine the DOE Strategic Plan for research and development of geothermal resources in the new century. A <b>panel</b> discussion <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change and environmental issues and regulations provided insight into the opportunities and challenges that geothermal project developers encounter. This year, a pilot peer review process was integrated with the program review. A team of geothermal industry experts were asked to evaluate the research in progress that was presented. The evaluation was based on the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) criteria and the goals and objectives of the Geothermal Program as set forth in the Strategic Plan. Despite the short timeframe and cursory guidance provided to both the principle investigators and the peer reviewers, the pilot process was successful. Based on post review comments by both presenters and reviewers, the process will be refined for next year's program review...|$|R
