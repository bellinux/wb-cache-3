40|$|First order <b>precaution</b> ” {{directly}} {{affects the}} probability of an accident, such as judging {{the speed of a}} car and stepping on the brakes. Intentions are not always realized, so first order <b>precaution</b> is a draw from a probability distribution. Drawing an uncharacteristically low value is a “lapse. ” “Second order <b>precaution</b> ” reduces {{the probability of}} a lapse. Examples include concentration when driving and preparation before performing a medical operation. The prevailing tort rule holds the injurer liable for harm caused by unreasonable first order <b>precaution,</b> regardless of second order <b>precaution.</b> Unlike the standard model, our model allows injurers to make second order <b>precaution</b> observable at a cost. Modifying the prevailing tort rule to allow a defense of second order reasonableness will cause injurers to satisfy the legal standard and make this fact observable. Three distinct advantages follow. First, the courts can set the legal standard to induce socially efficient second order behavior. Second, this defense reduces the burden of liability on the underlying activity, which is especially desirable to encourage activities that benefit others, such as practicing medicine. Third, this defense reduces the attraction of actors to activities and forms of <b>precaution</b> that decrease the probability of a lapse and increase the overall risk of an accident. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of dire {{forecasts}} for anthropogenic climate change, climate engineering is increasingly discussed as a possible additional set of responses to reduce climate change’s threat.

Under these challenging circumstances of potential catastrophe and risk-risk trade-off, it is initially unclear to what extent <b>precaution</b> is applicable. We examine what <b>precaution</b> is and is not, and make a prima facie case that climate engineering may provide means to reduce climate risks.

40|$|This paper derives {{a simple}} {{economic}} rationale of the precautionary principle, departing from statistical decision theory. A bayesian model underlines that different precautionary behaviours among countries or groups can have very legitimate grounds (different collective preferences) {{as well as}} non-legitimate, such as protectionist concerns or psychological misperceptions. We then sketch a framework in which this principle could be most properly applied, in particular at the WTO. <b>Precaution</b> is, by essence, full of ambiguity – or, to say it differently, {{the search for a}} balance. Absence of <b>precaution</b> may lead to catastrophes; excess of <b>precaution</b> hinders action and progress. At the same time, <b>precaution</b> seems simple: everybody knows what <b>precaution</b> is. Still, when applied to decisionmaking in an uncertain framework, the appropriate use of <b>precaution</b> involves complex insights from science, psychology, law, economics and statistics. One should not be surprised therefore that an issue combining ambiguity and a false sense of simplicity has become the centre of a lively debate. The controversy on the precautionary principle, the core concepts at stake, its status in international law and its role-to-play in international trade, have become now so politically charged, that one wishes there were a scientific, non-controversial description of the principle. Although the precautionary principle appeared two decades ago among environmental concerns (se...|$|R

It distinguishes different versions of the Precautionary Principle, some of which are more sensible than others. It suggests that <b>precaution</b> against one risk may induce other countervailing risks, so that the ideal is a middle ground of 2 ̆ 2 optimal <b>precaution</b> 2 ̆ 2 rather than maximum <b>precaution.</b> It observes that real-world applications of the Precautionary Principle, in both the US and Europe, have often been sensitive to this reality and therefore have moderated the degree of <b>precaution</b> as the legal instrument gains more regulatory teeth and as the countervailing risks rise...|$|R

Moreover, it addresses the positive and negative side-effects of structural <b>precaution</b> for food businesses. The methods which are applied are legal-systematic and empirical. Legal-systematic research shows that the European system of structural <b>precaution</b> may come into conflict with the principles of free trade. Empirical research on the effects of structural <b>precaution</b> shows that the barriers to market access impede food innovations, negatively impact competitiveness, and induce opportunistic strategic responses by food businesses. Among the opportunistic strategic responses that were identified are window-dressing, trespassing and circumventing. These may have adverse effects on food safety.
