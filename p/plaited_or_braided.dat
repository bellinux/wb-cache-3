Slaves adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically <b>plaited</b> <b>or</b> <b>braided</b> their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to moisturize the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving {{the steps}} of the Casa Grimani, and turning the gondola away from the Rialto, we will pass the Casa Businello, and the three houses which succeed it on the right. The fourth is another {{restored}} palace, white and conspicuous, but retaining of its ancient structure only the five windows in its second story, and an ornamental moulding above them which appears to be ancient, though it is inaccessible without scaffolding, and I cannot therefore answer for it. But the five central windows are very valuable; and as their capitals differ from most that we find (except in St. Mark's), in their <b>plaited</b> <b>or</b> <b>braided</b> border and basket-worked sides, I shall call this house, in future, the Braided House.[164] ...|$|E

50|$|Many Pacific {{cultures}} weave, <b>plait,</b> <b>or</b> <b>braid</b> {{the leaves}} of the P. tectorius to create useful items such as baskets, mats and hats.

50|$|<b>Plaiting</b> (<b>or</b> <b>braiding)</b> with {{kangaroo}} leather {{has been}} a widely practiced tradition in rural Australia since pioneering times. It {{is used in the}} production of fine leather belts, hatbands, bridles, dog leads, bullwhips, stockwhips, etc. Other leathers are used for the plaiting of heavier products suitable for everyday use.|$|R
2500|$|Other styles include <b>plaits</b> <b>or</b> <b>braids,</b> the two-strand twist, {{and basic}} twists, {{all of which}} can form into manicured dreadlocks if the hair is allowed to knit {{together}} in the style-pattern. Basic twists include finger-coils and comb-coil twists. Dreadlocks, also called [...] "dreads," [...] "locks" [...] or [...] "locs," [...] can also be formed by allowing the hairs to weave together on their own from an Afro. Another option is the trademarked [...] "Sisterlocks" [...] method, which produces what could be called very neat micro-dreadlocks.|$|R

Its fur is shaggy, and usually cited as being dark green though sometimes white. Its tail is described as being long and either coiled up <b>or</b> <b>plaited</b> (<b>braided).</b> Its paws are described as being the width of a man's hand.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain and moorland ponies {{are shown}} in their [...] "native" [...] state, and are not trimmed <b>or</b> <b>plaited</b> (<b>braided).</b> In reality a little light {{trimming}} is commonplace, for example {{to show off the}} fine head of the Connemara, and Welsh ponies often have their manes pulled to a length of about six inches. In some cases, trimming is necessary - if a small breeds pony's tail was left to grow unchecked it would become matted with mud and the pony could stand on it, potentially causing injury to itself or its rider.|$|R
40|$|In my work I am {{concerned}} with the general concepts of movement and change and specifically with the profoundness {{of the idea that}} we are touched by fiber from the moment of birth until the moment of death. This accessibility of textiles combined with the vast historical foundation of textiles allows for abundant exploration as an artist. In her book, On Weaving, Anni Albers (1965) defines weaving as 2 ̆ 2 the making of a pliable plane 2 ̆ 2 (19). She further describes six structures used to create this pliable plane. They are interlacing (which we normally think of as weaving), <b>plaiting</b> <b>or</b> <b>braiding,</b> looping, knotting, twisting or twining, and matting or felting (Albers, 1965, p. 19). I embrace this definition of weaving because it describes the physicality of the textile itself, the process of making the textile, and the broad focus of weaving. DESCRIPTION OF WORKSUsing structures found in old dishtowels, a series of works titled 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 explores everyday events {{in the life of a}} dishtowel. Because dishtowels are used in many ways other than drying dishes, torn edges, stained areas, and twisted fibers communicate these possibilities. 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Fragment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Towel 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness waffle weave structures; 2 ̆ 2 Twill Towel 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Twill Fragment 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness twill structures, all common structures found in dishtowels. Linen fibers painted with inks before interlacing work to create an integration of surface and structure to enhance the meanings of these humble textiles. 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 1) illustrates these techniques. The series 2 ̆ 2 Deadhead 2 ̆ 7 s Straight Wardrobe 2 ̆ 2 uses the paper making process. This process mats cotton linter fibers and bonds them together with pressure. The paper doll image is used as a vehicle to explore the ordinary man 2 ̆ 7 s shirt and comment on how quickly a personal image can be changed and how superficial that change can be. The paper doll image works as a visual vehicle to facilitate these quick-change possibilities. The male shirt was chosen because it is less commonly thought of as an image maker. Questions are raised and visual comments on gender issues are made. The surface image is literal in that the color and mixed media are visually on the surface of the handmade paper; although structurally, they are part of the paper making process. The matting/felting process is used; cotton linter, dyes, pigments, and mixed media are used to create these works...|$|R

50|$|A lucet {{is a tool}} used in cordmaking <b>or</b> <b>braiding</b> {{which is}} {{believed}} to {{date back to the}} Viking and Medieval periods, when it was used to create cords that were used on clothing, or to hang items from the belt. Lucet cord is square, strong, and slightly springy. It closely resembles knitted I-cord or the cord produced on a knitting spool. Lucet cord is formed by a series of loop like knots, and therefore will not unravel if cut. Unlike other braiding techniques such as kumihimo, finger-loop <b>braiding</b> <b>or</b> <b>plaiting,</b> where the threads are of a finite length, lucetted braids can be created without pre-measuring threads and so it is a technique suited for very long cords.|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is intended}} {{for use as a}} load-bearing device under cryogenic temperatures and/or abrasive conditions (i. e., during missions to the Moon). The innovation consists of small-diameter, ceramic fibers that are woven <b>or</b> <b>braided</b> into devices like ropes, belts, tracks, or cables. The fibers can be formed from a variety of ceramic materials like silicon carbide, carbon, aluminosilicate, or aluminum oxide. The fiber architecture of the weave <b>or</b> <b>braid</b> is determined by both the fiber properties and the mechanical requirements of the application. A variety of weave <b>or</b> <b>braid</b> architectures is possible for this application. Thickness of load-bearing devices can be achieved by using either a 3 D woven structure, or a layered, 2 D structure. For the prototype device, a belt approximately 0. 10 in. (0. 25 cm) thick, and 3. 0 in. (7. 6 cm) wide was formed by layering and stitching a 2 D aluminosilicate fiber weave...|$|R
