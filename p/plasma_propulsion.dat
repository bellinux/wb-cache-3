25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} space drives that need {{little or no}} reaction mass to function. A tether propulsion system employs a long cable with a high tensile strength to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object. Solar sails rely on radiation pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they require a large collection surface to function effectively. The magnetic sail deflects charged particles from the solar wind with a magnetic field, thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An E-sail would use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and may have more controllable directionality.|$|E

Inside of a special vacuum chamber with three performance pumps, an environment similar to the one that prevails in space is created.

The thrust level can be varied over a range 2. 2 to 1 at constant impulse bit amplitude.

40|$|Testing {{to space}} {{environment}} {{is a difficult}} process in which test representativity is always a question. Every time a new experimental array is set up, a trade-off has to be performed to produce an acceptable blend of physical accuracy, versatility, growth capability, and cost efficiency. Coatings are tested to resist UV, electron and proton irradiations and also oxat, in test bed where vacuum is held all along the test. Electronic parts are tested to total doses in far more simple arrays, using Co 60 sources. Sporadic effects such as SEE due to cosmic rays and fast protons and also such as ESD depends strongly on the instantaneous values of space environment affected by solar activity. SEE tests are performed on a few big accelerators. ESD experimental arrays are presently undergoing a great complexity due to the necessity {{to take into account}} the whole spectral of energies from ionospheric <b>plasma</b> (or <b>propulsion</b> <b>plasma)</b> to MeV radiation belt particles. For all the examples quoted, the environment thus simulated depends strongly on the sun activity. Implementation of space weather could contribute to the best definition according three points:-a better definition of worst cases (magnitude, frequency of occurrence…);-a better understanding of mean cases;- a better analysis of in-flight measurements.

40|$|A <b>plasma</b> space <b>propulsion</b> {{thruster}} {{has been}} designed. It {{is classified as}} a Cusped Field Thruster (CFT), which refers to the geometry of the magnetic field that influences the flow of electrons and ions. The thruster was modeled after an original Diverging Cusped Field Thruster (DCFT) developed at MIT's Space Propulsion Laboratory. There are several improvements (including a flat downstream separatrix) that are aimed at increasing performance. In general, plasma thrusters have applications in satellite trajectory adjustment and deep space probes because of their superior fuel efficiency compared to chemical thrusters. by Joseph Richard Conte, III.

50|$|Nuclear pulse {{propulsion}} {{or external}} pulsed <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion,</b> is a hypothetical method of spacecraft propulsion that uses nuclear explosions for thrust.

50|$|Although current orbit {{insertion}} maneuvers require precisely timed burns of conventional chemical rockets, some headway {{has been made}} towards the use of alternative means of stabilizing orbits, such as ion thruster or <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion</b> engine {{to achieve the same}} result using less fuel {{over a longer period of}} time. In addition, research into the use of electrically conducting space tethers to magnetically repel the Earth’s magnetic field has shown some promise, which would virtually eliminate the need for fuel altogether.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{workshop}} was to identify and discuss plasma issues {{that need to be}} resolved during the next 10 to 20 years (circa 2001) to facilitate the development of the advanced space technology that will be required 20 or 30 years into the future. The workshop consisted of 2 days of invited papers and 2 sessions of contributed poster papers. During the third day the meeting broke into 5 working groups, each of which held discussions and then reported back to the conference as a whole. The five panels were: Measurements Technology and Active Experiments Working Group; Advanced High-Voltage, High-Power and Energy-Storage Space Systems Working Group; Large Structures and Tethers Working Group; Plasma Interactions and Surface/Materials Effects Working Group; and Beam <b>Plasmas,</b> Electronic <b>Propulsion</b> and Active Experiments Using Beams Working Group...|$|R

50|$|After an {{international}} conference on advanced propulsion, Petit writes a book, where he proclaims a leading edge science would have secretly emerged inside the US black projects sanctuaries, involving intensive study of aerial <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion</b> with electromagnetic flow control. He suggests such an acceleration of these technological programs would have been undertaken after military forces of the United States would have the proof of existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life forms visiting Earth in the 1940s, in particular with the so-called Roswell UFO crash which he thinks was real.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 Petit creates UFO-Science, a {{non-profit}} organization devoted to scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. Electromagnetic <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion</b> and supersonic flight without shock wave through flow control by MHD force field are studied in a new laboratory running with private funds, called LAMBDA λ (Laboratory for Applications of MHD in Bitemperature Discharges to Aerodynamics). He created this concept of [...] "Citizen Research" [...] because he claims the Establishment represented by official scientific public administration, such as the CNRS and the CNES, failed to concretize his ideas because of military strategic implications.|$|E
50|$|A {{high energy}} pulse {{focused in a}} gas or on a solid surface {{surrounded}} by gas produces breakdown of the gas (usually air). This causes an expanding shock wave which absorbs laser energy at the shock front (a laser sustained detonation wave or LSD wave); expansion of the hot plasma behind the shock front {{during and after the}} pulse transmits momentum to the craft. Pulsed <b>plasma</b> <b>propulsion</b> using air as the working fluid is the simplest form of air-breathing laser propulsion. The record-breaking Lightcraft, developed by Leik Myrabo of RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and Frank Mead, works on this principle.|$|E

50|$|Material is {{directly}} {{removed from a}} solid or liquid surface at high velocities by laser ablation by a pulsed laser. Depending on the laser flux and pulse duration, the material can be simply heated and evaporated, or converted to <b>plasma.</b> Ablative <b>propulsion</b> will work in air or vacuum. Specific impulse values from 200 seconds to several thousand seconds are possible by choosing the propellant and laser pulse characteristics. Variations of ablative propulsion include double-pulse propulsion in which one laser pulse ablates material and a second laser pulse further heats the ablated gas, laser micropropulsion in which a small laser on board a spacecraft ablates very small amounts of propellant for altitude control or maneuvering, and space debris removal, in which the laser ablates material from debris particles in low Earth orbit, changing their orbits and causing them to reenter.|$|R

After being selected as an astronaut in 1980, Chang Díaz served on seven different shuttle missions, a space record that he shares with astronaut Jerry L. Ross. After retiring in 2005 from NASA, Chang Díaz formed Ad Astra Rocket Company to develop and commercialize the VASIMR technology.|$|R
