5|$|The Free Press Clause protects <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and opinions, and {{applies to}} a wide variety of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment {{protected}} against prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E
25|$|The 1987 WQA {{created a}} program for {{management}} of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs. The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors {{to be taken into}} account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.|$|E
2500|$|Anti-abortion {{statutes}} {{began to}} appear in the United States from the 1820s. In 1821, a Connecticut law targeted apothecaries who sold poisons to women for purposes of abortion; and New York made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor eight years later. Criminalization accelerated from the late 1860s, through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and the American Medical Association. In 1873, the Comstock Law prohibited any methods of production or <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> pertaining to the procurement of abortion, the prevention of conception and the prevention of venereal disease, even to students of medicine. By 1909 the penalty for violating these laws became a $5000 fine and up to five years imprisonment. By 1910 nearly every state had anti abortion laws.|$|E

[...] The tribunal has a range of powers to suppress the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> given at the inquiry. [...] For example, the tribunal may prohibit the publication of the names of the witnesses, the complainant or the nurse or midwife concerned. Where a person or organisation breaches this requirement, the person or organisation may be prosecuted for a criminal offence. The chairperson or deputy chairman decides all questions of law or matters of legal principle. Their decision is final on the point.

2500|$|In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all {{payments}} to WikiLeaks due to claims that {{they engage in}} illegal activity. In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves [...] "Anonymous" [...] organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010. On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack {{as part of an}} Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers. However, MasterCard denied this, stating that [...] "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk". WikiLeaks spokesman said: [...] "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks." [...] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks [...] "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".|$|E
2500|$|Second, was the {{relevance}} of Mitchell's reliance on a criminal statute in a civil proceeding seeking prior restraint. There was Supreme Court precedent that lent support {{to the idea that}} bans on the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by the press to be unconstitutional. [...] In 1907 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the [...] "main purpose" [...] of the First Amendment" [...] was [...] "to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments". In 1931 the Court wrote that only the narrowest circumstances—such as publication of the dates of departure of ships during wartime—were permissibly restrained. [...] In 1969 John Marshall Harlan II wrote the Supreme Court [...] "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication". [...] This second line of reasoning made it seem the statute should only be dealt with in passing, making the case a First Amendment one and the relief the government wanted—a bar on publication—unavailable.|$|E
