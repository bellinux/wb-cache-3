Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, <b>procyanidin</b> B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol.

40|$|Peanut skin is a {{rich source}} of polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins. Peanut skin proanthocyanidins mainly consist of a {{subgroup}} called <b>procyanidins.</b> Peanut-based <b>procyanidins</b> contain oligomers of both type A and type B <b>procyanidins.</b> Recent studies have shown that peanut skin extracts exert protection against hepatic steatosis induced on rats fed with a high-fat diet. Studies have shown that proanthocyanidins protect against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The mechanism of CVD protection and hypolipidemic effect of peanut skin <b>procyanidins</b> has been gradually revealed in recent years. Due to the high molecular weight of <b>procyanidins,</b> they are not readily absorbed through the gut barrier.

2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and <b>procyanidin</b> oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

In this study, we isolated and purified dimer to tetramer <b>procyanidins</b> from black soybean seed coat and investigated the anti-hyperglycemic effects {{by focusing on}} glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) translocation and the underlying molecular mechanism in skeletal muscle of mice. The anti-hyperglycemic effects of <b>procyanidins</b> were also {{compared with those of}} monomer (-) -epicatechin (EC) and major anthocyanin, cyanidin- 3 -O-β-glucoside (C 3 G). To investigate GLUT 4 translocation and its related signaling pathways, ICR mice were orally given <b>procyanidins,</b> EC and C 3 G in water at 10 μg/kg body weight. The mice were sacrificed 60 min after the dose of polyphenols, and soleus muscle was extracted from the hind legs. The results showed that trimeric and tetrameric <b>procyanidins</b> activated both insulin- and AMPK-signaling pathways to induce GLUT 4 translocation in muscle of ICR mice. We confirmed that <b>procyanidins</b> suppressed acute hyperglycemia with an oral glucose tolerance test in a dose-dependent manner. Of these beneficial effects, cinnamtannin A 2, one of the tetramers, was the most effective. In conclusion, <b>procyanidins,</b> especially cinnamtannin A 2, significantly ameliorate postprandial hyperglycemia at least in part by promoting GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane by activating both insulin- and AMPK-signaling pathways...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{phenolic}} compounds may act as antioxidants in vitro, {{but because of}} structural modifications during absorption, its role based on concentrations high enough to afford an antioxidant protection needs to be re-evaluated. We have explored the hypothesis that red wine <b>procyanidins</b> interact with low density lipoproteins (LDL) and that, at this location, the {{phenolic compounds}} efficiently protect LDL from oxidation and maintain LDL α-tocopherol at a high steady state concentration by recycling it back from the α-tocopheroxyl radical. To this end, human plasma was supplemented with wine <b>procyanidins</b> and isolated LDL were challenged with a constant flux of peroxyl radicals. As compared with LDL from plasma-free <b>procyanidins,</b> those LDL better resisted lipid oxidation and exhibited longer lag-phases of α-tocopherol consumption. The <b>procyanidins,</b> depending on their structure, were able to reduce the UV-induced α-tocopherol radical in a micellar system, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic ressonance. Mechanistically, the protection of LDL was interpreted in terms of quenching of peroxyl radicals and the recycling of α-tocopherol by the <b>procyanidins</b> bound to the lipoproteins. These results support the notion that, in human plasma, the <b>procyanidins,</b> via binding to LDL, may act as efficient local antioxidants. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Scope: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} urinary excretion andmetabolism of <b>procyanidins</b> a group of secondary plantmetabolites withmany beneficial health effects described in literature. Methods and results: To investigate the metabolism of <b>procyanidins</b> in the absence of flavan- 3 -ols, centrifugal partition chromatography was used for their reduction in a grape seed extract to a level of almost zero. After administration of the monomer reduced grape seed extract (mredGSE) containing <b>procyanidins</b> B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, C 1 to pigs flavan- 3 -ols, their methyl deriva-tives, dimeric and trimeric <b>procyanidins</b> were determined in urine by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Maximal concentrations of pro-cyanidins 6 h after administration vary from 5 to 30 ng/mg creatinine. Total excretion of flavan- 3 -ols and their methyl derivatives indicates an increasing trend for pigs given mredGSE in comparison to pigs of the control group. Flavan- 3 -ols were conjugated and methylated to a great extent in comparison to dimeric and trimeric <b>procyanidins.</b> In the case of low molecular weight metabolites, an increasing trend was observed for hippuric acid, not for phenolic acids. Conclusion: Ratios of total excretion of <b>procyanidins</b> to administrated amounts between 0. 004 % (C 1) and 0. 019 % (B 4) suggest a poor urinary excretion by pigs. A transfer of these results to humans is possible due to their similar gastrointestinal tract. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Lectin-like {{oxidized}} LDL receptor- 1 (LOX- 1) is an endothelial receptor for oxidized LDL (oxLDL) {{and plays}} multiple {{roles in the}} development of cardiovascular diseases. We screened more than 400 foodstuff extracts for identifying materials that inhibit oxLDL binding to LOX- 1. Results showed that 52 extracts inhibited LOX- 1 by more than 70 % in cell-free assays. Subsequent cell-based assays revealed that a variety of foodstuffs known to be rich in <b>procyanidins</b> such as grape seed extracts and apple polyphenols, potently inhibited oxLDL uptake in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing LOX- 1. Indeed, purified <b>procyanidins</b> significantly inhibited oxLDL binding to LOX- 1 while other ingredients of apple polyphenols did not. Moreover, chronic administration of oligomeric <b>procyanidins</b> suppressed lipid accumulation in vascular wall in hypertensive rats fed with high fat diet.

40|$|Catechins and <b>procyanidins,</b> {{together}} with flavonoid glycosides and terpene trilactones, are three important categories of {{components in the}} standard extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb 761). In this research, catechins and proanthocyanidins were found to exist in both the extract of Ginkgo leaves and Ginkgo products. By comparing with reference compounds, six of them were identified as (+) -catechin, (−) -epicatechin, (−) -gallocatechin, (−) -epigallocatechin and <b>procyanidins</b> B 1 and B 3. The activities of these polyphenols in the inhibition of Aβ 42 aggregation and the destabilization of preformed fibrils were evaluated using biochemical assays, which showed that all six of the polyphenols, {{as well as a}} fraction of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb) containing catechins and <b>procyanidins,</b> exerted potent inhibitory activities towards Aβ 42 aggregation and could also destabilize the performed fibrils. Catechins and <b>procyanidins</b> can therefore be regarded as the potent active constituents of EGb 761 in terms of their inhibition of Aβ 42 aggregation and destabilization of the fibrils. Although quantitative mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that the catechins and <b>procyanidins</b> are only present in low concentrations in EGb 761, these components should be studied in greater detail because of their potent inhibitory effects towards Aβ 42 aggregation and their ability to destabilize preformed fibrils, especially during the quality control of Ginkgo leaves and the manufacture of Ginkgo products...|$|R
