40|$|AlGaN plays a {{vital role}} in hetero-structure high {{electron}} mobility transistor by employing a two-dimensional electron gas and as electron blocking layer in the multi quantum well light emitting diodes. Nevertheless, the incorporation of Al in GaN for the formation of AlGaN alloy is limited by the diffusion barrier formed by instant nitridation of Al adatoms by reactive atomic N. Incorporation of Al above the miscibility limit, however can be achieved by ion beam technique. The well known ion beam mixing (IBM) technique was carried out with the help of Ar+ irradiation for different fluences. A novel approach was also adopted for the synthesis of AlGaN by the process of post irradiation diffusion (PID) as a comparative study with the IBM technique. The optical investigations of AlGaN nanowires, synthesized via two different methods of ion beam processing are reported. The effect of irradiation fluence and post irradiation annealing temperature on the random alloy formation were studied by the vibrational and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic studies. Vibrational studies show one-mode phonon behavior corresponding to longitudinal optical (LO) mode of A 1 symmetry (A 1 (LO)) for the wurtzite phase of AlGaN nanowires in the random alloy model.
