Within the last years, the EACP has developed into a permanent partnership between collaborating European aerospace clusters. Although limited to the aerospace industry, the partnership also serves as a benchmark project for other industry sectors. In 2013, the EACP was recognized by the European Commission as one of 13 „European Strategic Cluster Partnerships“ (ESCP). With this acknowledgement, the Commission formally recognizes the EACP’s efforts to improve global competitiveness by supporting pan-European collaboration and implementing joint strategies needed to enter new markets outside of Europe.|$|E

The ADMIRE programme was a 2-year project in the European <b>PRO</b> - <b>INNO</b> programme of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry of the European Commission. The 6.4 million Euro programme addressed the Innovation management agenda of <b>PRO</b> - <b>INNO</b> <b>Europe</b> by raising the awareness of Design Management, in particular amongst European small and medium enterprises, to improve their competitiveness and to boost the European economy in general. It was one of the key project objectives to establish the DME Award. 18 European organisations participated in this programme under the coordination of the City of Eindhoven {{until the end of the}} ADMIRE project in February 2009.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{key issues}} relating to the performance and challenges of publicly funded patent information services in the EU- 27. The results are {{to a large extent}} rooted in a wider benchmarking analysis carried out on behalf of the European Commission as part of its 'PRO <b>INNO</b> <b>Europe</b> activities' the aim of which was to identify and benchmark all available IP-related support services in Europe and a number of overseas countries. For this paper, the relevant findings of the benchmarking study have been amended with an additional literature review and with an outline of the tool of semantic patent analysis. It is found that the competence of the operating staff, easy identification/visibility and timely delivery are among the most significant quality aspects {{from the point of view}} of the SMEs, while the geographical proximity of the SMEs to the service premises is a factor of less importance. Information needs of SMEs extend well beyond technical information on patents, and include interpretative help for search results but also IP management questions for decisions on why to use particular IP protection instruments in specific circumstances. The method of semantic patent analysis is described as one possible future option to extend the service activities of relevant information centres. However, provisions must be made in the governance of the (new and/or extended) services, and the reasoning for the need of the offerings should point to clear cases of market failure in order to avoid conflict with the private service sector.

The intensity and scope of university-industry cooperation support measures varies heavily in Europe. The survey of European University-Business Cooperation, <b>Pro</b> <b>Inno</b> <b>Europe</b> and Erawatch database of policy measures, and Community Innovation Survey reveal that Finnish, German and Austrian support systems are best balanced and provide good university-industry cooperation intensity. The cooperation measures in Estonia are weak and improvement should be made by increasing the Estonian governmental funding, mandatory cooperation in support measures, networking and applied research in universities, on-going application possibilities, reducing the bureaucracy, and improving the timing of measures...|$|E
30|$|Much of {{the extant}} innovativeness work, both {{academic}} and governmental, focuses on firms conducting R&D and therefore equates innovative activities {{with high levels}} of risk (Madrid-Guijarro et al. 2013). However, innovativeness, as an element of firm culture, goes well beyond structured R&D. For example, roughly half of innovating European firms are defined as non-R&D innovators (<b>Pro</b> <b>Inno</b> <b>Europe</b> 2008). Such firms, for example, invest in acquiring new knowledge or new equipment (adoption) rather than creation of new products via an R&D function. Non-R&D innovators tend to persist with their innovativeness even in times of crisis (Sempre-Ripoll and Hervás-Oliver 2014). What this means in practice is that non-R&D innovators can make less risky investments or conduct innovative activities that require little capital outlay. In addition, in times of recession when demand is low, firms may have slack resources in the form of employee time and can therefore pursue some types of innovative efforts at little additional cost. Being a non-R&D innovator is strikingly different than an R&D innovator.|$|E

Throughout Europe, hundreds of policy measures and support schemes aimed at innovation have been implemented or are under preparation. The diversity of these measures and schemes reflects {{the diversity of the}} framework conditions, cultural preferences and political priorities in the Member States. <b>PRO</b> <b>INNO</b> <b>Europe</b> is a new initiative of Directorate General Enterprise and Industry which aims to become the focal point for innovation policy analysis, learning and development in Europe, with a view to learning from the best and contributing to the development of new and better innovation policies in Europe. Run by the Innovation Policy Directorate of DG Enterprise and Industry, it pursues the collection, regular updating and analysis of information on innovation policies at national and European level. The INNO-Policy TrendChart serves the 'open policy coordination approach ' laid down by the Lisbon Council in March 2000. It supports organisation and scheme managers in Europe with summarised and concise information and statistics on innovation policies, performances and trends in the European Union (EU). It is also a European forum for benchmarking and the exchange of good practices in the area of innovation policy...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{multinational}} corporations have increasingly adopted a global approach {{to research and}} development initiatives, offshoring these activities towards {{different parts of the}} world and establishing global R&D networks. By doing so they aim to acquire highly skilled science and engineering talent (Lewin et al. 2009), increase proximity to their customer bases (Trefler, 2005), and respond to mounting cost pressure (<b>Pro</b> <b>Inno</b> <b>Europe,</b> 2007). Most of the units in such global R&D networks tend to be highly specialized in certain tasks, becoming ‘centers of excellence ’ capitalizing on specific talents, product efficiencies, or market knowledge (Bardhan and Jaffee, 2005). Somewhat contrasting to this specialization of globally dispersed R&D units, R&D managers try to integrate knowledge from different units in global R&D networks so as to reap the benefits from specialization in practice. This is in line with the Knowledge-Based View of the firm (Grant, 1996), which argues that effective knowledge creation relies on specialization by individuals or units (leading to a collection of heterogeneous knowledge assets), with the goal of the firm being to establish integration of these knowledge assets. Correspondingly, Singh (2008) argues that the geographical distribution of R&D does not necessarily increase the quality of a company’s innovative output in itself; it is the integration of knowledge of multiple locations which can make specialization valuable. Our study focuses on this paradox of specialization vs. integration. Although specialization can be seen as the motive for global R&D, it is the integration between specializations that makes global R&D successful in practice. In this paper, we explore which factors may have a significant influence on the integration of knowledge between R&D units. In doing so, we regard knowledge (in line with the practice based perspective) as intrinsically linked to practice, subjective, and embedded in people’s practices and social context...|$|E

40|$|Present paper {{present an}} {{approach}} of the Research-Development and Innovation System (RDI) in Europe during the last decade. After a short introduction is presented the European Union formation. Research, development and innovation (RDI) has been studied and analyzed since 2001 by the European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS). Will be presented in the present paper a summary of all the materials from EIS 2001 till IUS 2011. Study concerning RDI system in Europe was done from innobarometers from 2001 till 2010. EIS 2007 presents {{for the first time}} the European innovation leaders. EIS presents innovative performance of Member States based on annual statistical data collected from national statistical sources of each member country of the European Union through the Community Innovation Survey by using Document Analysis on Innovation Community. Were taken into account, after this short presentation, the relevant composite indicators for European Union for the last decade to analyze the Research-Development and Innovation System in Europe. IUS 2011 distinguish between three main types of innovation indicators. The main input factors in the analysis of external innovation performance of firms covers 3 dimensions of innovation. These indicators, based on the IUS 2011, contain as follows: Human Resources with the evolution of new doctorate graduates, population completed tertiary education, youth with upper secondary level education, Research Systems, Finance and Support. All of these indicators belongs to the category of Enablers. Another indicators studied in the present paper are Firm activities, Linkages & entrepreneurship Intellectual Assets. From the category of Outputs there are Innovators and Economic effects. The composite indicators for EU Research Development and Innovation System were study for the period 2006 - 2011.
