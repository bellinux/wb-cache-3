5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effort.|$|E
50|$|During the war, {{approximately}} 70,000 Slovak Jews {{were sent}} to concentration camps to <b>perish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust. <b>In</b> September 1942, a Slovak-German treaty was signed detailing the conditions for the deportation of Slovak Jews.|$|R

A woman in the harbor city of Keelung was struck {{in the head and}} seriously injured by a broken window.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats remains unclear. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war wounds and scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E

In 2007, scientists using DNA analysis identified the body of a small fair-haired toddler, one of the first victims to be recovered by the CS Mackay Bennett, as Frederick's youngest child, 19-month-old Sidney. The Sages, Anderssons and Goodwins all <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sinking.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made {{for the maintenance of}} temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

50|$|Amazing Spider-Man #149, {{the climactic}} {{installment}} of the original Clone Saga, leaves it ambiguous {{whether it is the}} original Spider-Man or his clone who <b>perishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bomb explosion.

Batman flings Batwoman to safety and apparently <b>perishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E
5|$|Since Catarina was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} reliable records, and hence infrastructure and the population were not specifically prepared for it, the damage was quite severe. Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned the public about the approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – <b>perished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict.|$|E
