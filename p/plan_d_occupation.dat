40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{absorption}} edge in Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of manganese oxide compounds shows {{a shift of}} several electronvolts in going from MnO through LaMnO 3 to CaMnO 3. On the other hand, in X-ray photoelectron spectra much smaller shifts are observed. To identify the mechanisms that cause the observed chemical shifts, 1 s ionization as well as 1 s 3 “ 4 p ” transition energies have been determined by electronic structure calculations on embedded Mn ions and embedded MnO 6 clusters. Systematic variation of the cluster geometry and the cluster embedding showed that the chemical shifts are predominantly determined by two effects: {{the changes in the}} Mn 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupation</b> and the changes in the Madelung potential. The large chemical shift in the 1 s 3 4 p transition energies between different materials occurs because the two effects do not compensate each other. The chemical shifts obtained for the embedded MnO 6 clusters agree reasonably with the experimental shifts. The small sensitivity to the material observed for the Mn 1 s ionization energies is explained by the near cancellation {{of the effects of the}} Madelung potential and the 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupation</b> of th...|$|R

40|$|Stoichiometric LiFeAs at ambient {{pressure}} is an 18 K superconductor while isoelectronic MgFeGe is not, despite their extremely similar electronic structures. To investigate possible sources of this distinctively different superconducting behavior, we quantify the differences using first principles density functional theory, establishing first that the Fe total 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupations</b> are identical {{in the two}} compounds. Individual 3 <b>d</b> orbital <b>occupations</b> also differ very little (∼ 0. 01). The differences in Fermi surfaces (FSs) do not seem significant; however a redistribution of bands just above the Fermi level does represent a possibly significant distinction. Because the bands and FSs of LiFeAs are less in agreement with experiment than for other iron-pnictides, we {{study the effects of}} additional exchange-correlations effects beyond GGA (the generalized gradient approximation) by applying the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ) exchange potential, which gives much improved bandgaps in insulators compared to GGA and might be useful for semimetals such as the Fe-based superconductors.

40|$|We have {{performed}} X ray absorption spectroscopy of size selected, free, cationic, transition metal doped Sc, Ti, V, Cr gold clusters in a size range n 1 9. The electronic {{configuration of the}} impurity atom was determined by modeling the X ray absorption spectrum in a charge transfer multiplet framework which {{makes it possible to}} quantify the amount of localization of the impurity 3 d states. Depending on the dopant element and the host cluster size we find a wide variety in the behavior of local electronic structures. ScAun clusters show strong hybridization of the scandium 3 d states with the host electronic states except for ScAu 1 where we find a completely localized 3 d electron. In TiAun clusters a pronounced odd even alternation is present in the local electronic structure of the impurity atom. The 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupation</b> number of the titanium dopant is approximately 2 and 1. 6 electrons in odd and even numbered clusters, respectively. In CrAun clusters the electronic structure of the dopant is governed by shell closure of the gold host which leads to almost unperturbed 3 d states in CrAun n 2, 6, 8 and hybridization of the 3 d states in CrAun n 1, 5, 7. Contrary to the other systems investigated the 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupation</b> of 3. 3 electrons in VAun clusters is independent of the cluster size.

40|$|The polar {{interface}} between LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 has shown promise {{as a field}} effect transistor, with reduced (nanoscale) feature sizes and potentially added functionality over conventional semiconductor systems. However, the mobility of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) is lower than desirable. Therefore to progress, the highly debated origin of the 2 DEG must be understood. Here we present a case for surface redox reactions as {{the origin of the}} 2 DEG, in particular surface O vacancies, using a model supported by first-principles calculations that describes the redox formation. In agreement with recent spectroscopic and transport measurements, we predict a stabilization of such redox processes (and hence Ti 3 <b>d</b> <b>occupation)</b> with film thickness beyond a critical value, which can be smaller than the critical thickness for 2 D electronic conduction, since the surface defects generate trapping potentials that will affect the interface electron mobility.

40|$|The {{incompatibility}} {{of partial}} <b>d</b> <b>occupation</b> on the perovskite B-site {{with the standard}} charge transfer mechanism for ferroelectricity has been a central paradigm in multiferroics research. Nevertheless, it was recently shown by density functional theory calculations that CaMnO_ 3 exhibits a polar instability that even dominates over the octahedral tilting for slightly enlarged unit cell volume. Here, we present similar calculations for LaCrO_ 3, which has the same d^ 3 B-site electron configuration as CaMnO_ 3. We find that LaCrO_ 3 exhibits a very similar, albeit much weaker, polar instability as CaMnO_ 3. In addition, while the Born effective charge (BEC) of the Mn^{ 4 +} cation in CaMnO_ 3 is highly anomalous, the BEC of Cr^{ 3 +} in LaCrO_ 3 is only slightly enhanced. By decomposing the BECs into contributions of individual Wannier functions we show that the ferroelectric instabilities in both systems can {{be understood in terms}} of charge transfer between TM d and O p states, analogously to the standard d^ 0 perovskite ferroelectrics.

The calculations demonstrate that there exists a phase transition from B 4 structure to B 1 phase at the transition pressure of 12. 7 GPa. Analysis of band structures suggests that the B 4 -AlN has a direct gap of 4. 13 eV, while B 1 phase become indirect under high pressure.

We explore whether a satisfactory agreement with experiment {{can be achieved by}} tuning the fraction of Hartree Fock exchange (α) in the density functional. It is found that two branches of locally stable solutions exist for the rutile phase for 12. 5 %≤α≤ 20 %. One is metallic and has the correct stability as compared to the monoclinic phase, the other is insulating with lower energy than the metallic branch. We discuss these observations based on the V 3 <b>d</b> orbital <b>occupations</b> and conclude that α= 10 % is the best possible choice for spin-polarized VO 2 calculations. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.
