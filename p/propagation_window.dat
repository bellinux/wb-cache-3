40|$|Today {{window panes}} are usually coated {{with at least}} one metal or metal oxide layer to prevent heat energy of the light {{spectrum}} from propagating to the other side.

The shielding effectiveness measurements are made in a nested reverberation chamber covering the range 1 – 18 GHz; both before and after high power irradiation at 1. 3 GHz. The results show that the shielding effectiveness of window panes may be severely impaired due to thermal stress effects on the coatings during the irradiation, depending of the type of coating.

40|$|We {{consider}} the gravitational lensing of rays emitted by a compact object (CO) within a distribution of plasma with power-law density ∝ r^-h. For the simplest {{case of a}} cloud of spherically symmetric cold non-magnetized plasma, the diverging effect of the plasma and the converging effect of gravitational lensing compete with one another. When h< 2, the plasma effect dominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the radius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside {{the surface of the}} CO. When this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in which plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the escape window have ω_ 0 < ω≤ω_+ and are free to propagate to infinity from the CO surface. To a distant observer, the visible portion of the CO surface appears to shrink as the observed frequency is reduced, and vanishes entirely at ω_ 0, in excess of the plasma frequency at the CO surface. We define the anomalous <b>propagation</b> <b>window</b> for frequencies ω_-< ω≤ω_ 0. Rays emitted from the CO surface within this frequency range are dominated by optical effects from the plasma and curve back {{to the surface of the}} CO, effectively cloaking the star from distant observers. We conclude with a study of neutron star (NS) compactness ratios for a variety of nuclear matter equations of state (EoS). For h= 1, NSs generated from stiff EoS should display significant frequency dependence in the EW, and lower values of h with softer EoS can also show these effects. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We study {{sequential}} coding of Markov sources {{under an}} error propagation constraint. An encoder sequentially compresses {{a sequence of}} vector-sources that are spatially i. i. d. but temporally correlated according to a first-order Markov process. The channel erases up to B packets in a single burst, but reveals all other packets to the destination. The destination is required to reproduce all the source-vectors instantaneously and in a lossless manner, except those sequences that occur in an error <b>propagation</b> <b>window</b> of length B + W following {{the start of the}} erasure burst. We define the rate-recovery function R(B, W) - the minimum achievable compression rate per source sample in this framework - and develop upper and lower bounds on this function. Our upper bound is obtained using a random binning technique, whereas our lower bound is obtained by drawing connections to multi-terminal source coding. Our upper and lower bounds coincide, yielding R(B, W), in some special cases. More generally, both the upper and lower bounds equal the rate for predictive coding plus a term that decreases as 1 /(W+ 1), thus establishing a scaling behaviour of the rate-recovery function. For a special class of semi-deterministic Markov sources we propose a new optimal coding scheme: prospicient coding. An extension of this coding technique to Gaussian sources is also developed. For the class of symmetric Markov sources and memoryless encoders, we establish the optimality of random binning. When the destination is required to reproduce each source sequence with a fixed delay and when W = 0 we also establish the optimality of binning.

40|$|Solar {{fundamental}} (f) acoustic mode oscillations are investigated analytically in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The model {{consists of}} three layers in planar geometry, representing the solar interior, the magnetic atmosphere, and a transitional layer sandwiched between them. Since {{we focus on the}} fundamental mode here, we assume the plasma is incompressible. A horizontal, canopy-like, magnetic field is introduced to the atmosphere, in which degenerated slow MHD waves can exist. The global (f-mode) oscillations can couple to local atmospheric Alfv?n waves, resulting, e. g., in a frequency shift of the oscillations. The dispersion relation of theglobal oscillation mode is derived, and is solved analytically for the thin-transitional layer approximation and for the weak-field approximation. Analytical formulae are also provided for the frequency shifts due to the presence of a thin transitional layer and a weak atmospheric magnetic field. The analytical results generally indicate that, compared to the fundamental value (?=gk), the mode frequency is reduced by the presence of an atmosphere by a few per cent. A thin transitional layer reduces the eigen-frequencies further by about an additional hundred microhertz. Finally, a weak atmospheric magnetic field can slightly, by a few percent, increase the frequency of the eigen-mode. Stronger magnetic fields, however, can increase the f-mode frequency by even up to ten per cent, which cannot be seen in observed data. The presence of a magnetic atmosphere in the three-layer model also introduces non-permitted <b>propagation</b> <b>windows</b> in the frequency spectrum; here, f-mode oscillations cannot exist with certain values of the harmonic degree. The eigen-frequencies can be sensitive to the background physical parameters, such as an atmospheric density scale-height or the rate of the plasma density drop at the photosphere. Such information, if ever observed with high-resolution instrumentation and inverted, could help to gain further insight into solar magnetic structures by means of solar magneto-seismology, and could provide further insight into the role of magnetism in solar oscillationsPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Computing {{discrete}} {{geodesic distance}} over triangle meshes {{is one of}} the fundamental problems in computational geometry and computer graphics. In this problem, an effective window pruning strategy can significantly affect the actual running time. Due to its importance, we conduct an in-depth study of window pruning operations in this paper, and produce an exhaustive list of scenarios where one window can make another window partially or completely redundant. To identify a maximal number of redundant windows using such pairwise cross checking, we propose a set of procedures to synchronize local <b>window</b> <b>propagation</b> within the same triangle by simultaneously propagating a collection of windows from one triangle edge to its two opposite edges. On the basis of such synchronized <b>window</b> <b>propagation,</b> we design a new geodesic computation algorithm based on a triangle-oriented region growing scheme. Our geodesic algorithm can remove most of the redundant windows at the earliest possible stage, thus significantly reducing computational cost and memory usage at later stages. In addition, by adopting triangles instead of windows as the primitive in propagation management, our algorithm significantly cuts down the data management overhead. As a result, it runs 4 - 15 times faster than MMP and ICH algorithms, 2 - 4 times faster than FWP-MMP and FWP-CH algorithms, and also incurs the least memory usage...|$|R

The time evolution of the system is such that for a range of parameter values a supercritical Hopf bifurcation leads to bulk oscillations.

The passage of target waves through a window induces in the next compartment spiral or target waves. In this case a new bulk frequency appears and quasi-periodic motion is observed.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} distortion modeling for video transmission over burst-loss channels characterized by a finite-state Markov chain. Based on {{a detailed analysis of}} the error propagation and the bursty losses, a distortion trellis model is proposed, enabling us to estimate at the both the frame level and sequence level the expected mean-square error (MSE) distortion caused by Markov-model burst packet losses. The model takes into account the temporal dependencies induced by both the motion-compensated coding scheme and the Markov-model channel losses. The model is applicable to most block-based motion-compensated encoders, and most Markovmodel lossy channels as long as the loss pattern probabilities for that channel is computable. Based on the study of the decaying behavior of the error <b>propagation,</b> a sliding <b>window</b> algorithm is developed to perform the MSE estimation with low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed models are accurate for all tested average loss rates and average burst lengths. Based on the experimental results, the proposed techniques are used to analyze the impact of factors such as average burst length on the average decoded video quality. The proposed model is further extended to a more general form, and the modeled distortion is compared with the data produced from realistic networks loss traces. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is also accurate in estimating the expected distortion for video transmission in real networks.

40|$|In many {{graphics}} applications, the computation of exact {{geodesic distance}} is very important. However, the high computational {{cost of the}} existing geodesic algorithms means {{that they are not}} practi-cal for large-scale models or time-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose the parallel Chen-Han (or PCH) algo-rithm, which extends the classic Chen-Han (CH) discrete geodesic algorithm to the parallel setting. The original CH algorithm and its variant both lack a parallel solution because the windows (a key data structure that carries the shortest distance in the wave-front propagation) are maintained in a strict order or a tightly cou-pled manner, which means that only one window is processed at a time. We propose dividing the CH’s sequential algorithm into four phases, <b>window</b> selection, <b>window</b> <b>propagation,</b> data organi-zation, and events processing so that there is no data dependence or conflicts in each phase and the operations within each phase can be carried out in parallel. The proposed PCH algorithm is able to propagate a large number of windows simultaneously and inde-pendently. We also adopt a simple yet effective strategy to control the total number of windows. We implement the PCH algorithm on modern GPUs (such as Nvidia GTX 580) and analyze the per-formance in detail. The performance improvement (compared to the sequential algorithms) is highly consistent with GPU double-precision performance (GFLOPS).

40|$|International audienceThe {{iterative}} ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS) is a data assimilation method {{meant for}} tracking {{the state of}} nonlinear geophysical models efficiently. It combines an ensemble of model states to estimate the errors similarly to the ensemble square-root Kalman filter, with a four-dimensional variational analysis performed within the ensemble space. As such, {{it belongs to the}} class of four-dimensional ensemble variational methods. It could require the use of localization of the analysis when the state-space dimension is high. However, its localization needs to be defined across time and to be as consistent as possible with the dynamical flow within the data assimilation window where the four-dimensional variational analysis is performed. We show that a Liouville equation governs the time evolution of the localization operator, which is linked to the evolution of the error correlations. It is argued that the time evolution of the localization operator depends strongly on the forecast dynamics. Using either covariance localization or domain localization, we propose and test several localization strategies meant to address the issue: (i) a static and uniform localization, (ii) <b>propagation</b> through the <b>window</b> of a restricted set of dominant modes of the error covariance matrix and (iii) the approximate propagation of the localization operator using covariant local domains that are moved in accordance with the dynamical flow. These schemes are illustrated with the one-dimensional Lorenz 40 variable model and with a two-dimensional barotropic vorticity model. In both cases, local analysis based on the covariant local domains leads to a systematic improvement of the data assimilation performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It is {{a growing}} trend in the modern housing {{construction}} especially in northern parts of Europe and America to use modern windows with selective glasses {{in order to achieve}} the adequate thermal isolation. The idea is to conserve the energy and discourage the excess use of it following the guidelines of European commission, which aims to achieve zero energy buildings by 2020. Even though the use of such windows do address the energy issue at hand, {{but on the other hand}} they cause problems to the radio wave <b>propagation</b> through these <b>windows.</b> The reason for this is the use of metallic coating made of titanium oxide or silver oxide in general on these windows because of their good properties to provide thermal isolation, but are susceptible to deterioration of radio wave propagation through them. Various solutions to this problem have been addressed in this thesis along with their tradeoffs. The previous and current research being carried out to address this issue also have been discussed thoroughly including the research that worked as the motivation to pursue this issue. Amongst others, one solution is the use of passive repeater to achieve the power gain which have been focused on. A prototype repeater antenna developed earlier at CWC and tested through measurements addresses the problem considerably well. Measurements were taken at EMC chamber, University of Oulu, within the frequency range of 700 MHz to 10 GHz, and the results have been compared and analyzed in this thesis.
