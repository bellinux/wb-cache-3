40|$|Background: American Society for Gastrointestinal Endsocopy (ASGE) {{guidelines}} for assessing minimal competence in EUS {{are based on}} expert opinion and retrospective studies. Objective: To prospectively define learning curves in EUS among advanced endoscopy trainees (AETs). Design: Prospective trial. Setting: Three tertiary-care referral centers. Patients: AETs with no prior EUS experience. Intervention: AETs were evaluated by attending endosonographers at intervals of 10 EUS examinations (beginning at the 25 th examination) during a 12 -month training period. A standardized data collection form was used to grade examination of EUS anatomic stations and, when applicable, lesion of interest, accurate uTNM staging, wall layer origin of subepithelial lesions, and technical success with FNA. Main Outcome Measurements: Cumulative sum analysis was applied to assess competency and <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for each trainee for overall performance and for each anatomic station. Acceptable and unacceptable failure rates of 10 % and 20 %, respectively, were used. Results: Five AETs were included, {{with a total of}} 1412 EUS examinations (AET 1 - 225, T 2 - 175, T 3 - 402, T 4 - 315, T 5 - 295). Two AETs crossed the threshold for acceptable performance at cases number 255 and 295, two AETs showed a trend toward acceptable performance after 225 and 196 cases but needed ongoing training, and 1 AET demonstrated the need for ongoing training after 402 cases. Similar variable results were noted for individual stations. Limitations: Results from this study may not be generalizable to other centers’ AETs. Conclusion: We observed substantial variability in achieving competency and a consistent need for more supervision in all AETs than current recommendations (150 cases). Future studies should focus on standardization of trainee performance, definition of competency, and widespread applicability of AET evaluation.

40|$|Background Cumulative sum (CUSUM) {{has been}} used for {{assessing}} competence of trainees <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> new technical skill. One of its disadvantages is the required definition of acceptable and unacceptable success rates. The study explores the development of competence amongst trainees new to obstetric epidural anaesthesia in a large public hospital. Methods Obstetric epidural data were collected prospectively between January 1996 and December 2011. In this study, success rates for inexperienced trainees were calculated retrospectively for (1) the whole database, (2) for each consecutive attempt and (3) each trainee’s individual overall success rate. Acceptable and unacceptable success rates were defined and CUSUM graphs generated for each trainee. Competence was assessed for each trainee and the number of attempts to reach competence recorded. Results Mean success rate for all inexperienced trainees was 76. 8 +/- 0. 1 %, mean +/-SD, range 63. 2 - 90. 0 %. Consecutive attempt success rate <b>produced</b> <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> with mean success rate commencing at 58. 0 % on attempt 1. After attempt 10 the attempt number had no effect on subsequent success rates. From these results, the acceptable and unacceptable success rates were set at 65 and 55 % respectively. CUSUM graphs demonstrated 76 out of 81 trainees competent after a mean of 46. 4 +/- 22. 3, mean +/-SD attempts. Conclusions CUSUM is useful for assessing trainee epidural competence. Trainees require approximately 50 attempts, as defined by CUSUM, to reach competence...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Operation of hip {{resurfacing}} prosthesis is a technically demanding procedure {{accompanied by}} <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> To our knowledge no objective data on this <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> {{are available in}} the literature. METHODS: For the first 40 resurfacing hip prostheses implanted by a single-surgeon radiographic 'learning curve' analysis was performed. Optimal implant positioning on preoperative digital templating was compared with the eventual implant position postoperatively, measured by six establishes radiographic parameters and compared for four chronological cohorts of patients. RESULTS: <b>A</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> was clearly present and an optimal result was established in the last cohort. Pitfalls were a relatively steep cup position initially and a stem position in the posterior 1 / 3 of the collum. Besides marginal medialization a fully anatomic reconstruction of the center of rotation was achieved. CONCLUSION: In total hip resurfacing one should recognize the presence of <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> This <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> appears to be acceptable and a reproducible optimal implant positioning can be achieved quickly...|$|R

40|$|T he {{concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> for {{individuals}} {{has been in}} widespread use in the psychology literature {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Ebbinghaus (1885) famously demonstrated the fi rst <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> by memorizing ever-longer strings of nonsense syllables; Bryan and Harter (1899) studied <b>learning</b> <b>curves</b> exhibited by telegraph operators sending and receiving Morse code; and Book (1908) studied <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> in typing skills. The idea that a phenomenon analogous to the <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> might also apply at the level of the organization took longer to emerge, but it had begun to fi gure prominently in military procurement and scheduling at least a decade before Wright’s (1936) classic paper providing evidence that the cost of <b>producing</b> <b>an</b> airframe declined as cumulative output increased. Wright (1936), who was careful not to describe his empirical results as <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve,</b> proposed three explanations for the relationships between cost and cumulative quantity produced that he observed. The fi rst was the “improvement in profi ciency of a workman with practice ” (p. 124), characterized by the individual <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> The others were “the ability to use less skilled labor as more and more tooling and standardization of procedure is introduced, ” and “the greater spread of machinery and fi xture set up time in large quantity production ” (p. 124). Only the fi rst of these is what we would unambiguously identify as a source of orga-nizational learning; the others are consistent with organizational learning but also with standard static economies of scale...|$|R
30|$|In our patients, {{utilization}} of the ePRP technique (Inoue et al. 2010) provided adequate control of the DVC and contributed to shorten the operative time.

40|$|Background. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and {{perioperative}} intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) {{has been}} recognized as a treatment option for pseudomyxoma peritonei. This study reports the survival outcomes, clinicopathological prognostic factors, and <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> from <b>a</b> single institution's experience. Methods. Patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei underwent CRS and PIC, which was comprised of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and/or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC), according to a standardized treatment protocol in our institution. Clinicopathological factors were analyzed to determine their prognostic value for survival using univariate and multivariate analysis. Time period comparison was performed to study the effect of <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve.</b> Results. <b>A</b> total of 106 patients (43 men and 63 women) were treated. The mortality rate was 3 % and severe morbidity rate was 49 %. The median follow-up was 23 (range, 0 - 140) months. The overall median survival was 104 months with a 5 -year survival rate of 75 %. The progression-free survival was 40 months with a 1 -year progression-free survival rate of 71 %. Factors influencing survival include histopathological type of tumor, use of both HIPEC and EPIC, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and severe morbidity. The results demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>learning</b> <b>curve</b> where patients with a higher peritoneal cancer index (PCI) were treated, reduced amount of blood products required, more patients undergoing HIPEC and the combined HIPEC and EPIC, more redo-procedures performed, and a longer progression-free survival. Conclusions.
