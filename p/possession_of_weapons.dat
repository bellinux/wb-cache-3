5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E

25|$|On 13 October, {{hundreds}} of men, many wearing surgical masks and carrying crowbars and cutting tools, began removing barricades at various sites and attacking suffragists.

Protesters again claimed that the attacks were organised and involved triad groups. Police made three arrests for assault and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> Although police cautioned against reinforcing the existing obstacles or setting up new obstacles to enlarge the occupied area, suffragists later reinstated the barriers overnight.|$|E

The men were tried in Argentina on crimes that included illegal deprivation of freedom, <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> of war, illegal association, piracy, and robbery in the open. The leaders were sentenced {{to three years in}} prison and the others to nine months.|$|E

25|$|After the Ten Years' War, <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> {{by private}} {{individuals}} was prohibited in Cuba. Thus, {{one of the}} most serious and persistent problems for the rebels was a shortage of suitable weapons. This lack of arms forced them to utilise guerrilla tactics, using the environment, the element of surprise, fast horses and simple weapons such as machetes. Most of their firearms were acquired in raids on the Spaniards. Between 11 June 1895 and 30 November 1897, 60 attempts were made to bring weapons and supplies to the rebels from outside Cuba, but only one succeeded, largely due to British naval protection. 28 of these resupply attempts were halted within U.S. territory, five were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, four by the Spanish Navy, two were wrecked, one was driven back to port by a storm, and the fate of another is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In late 2002, during tension over {{suspected}} Iraqi <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction, the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base {{was ordered}} to maintain at least one squadron ready to deploy to the Persian Gulf. During January 2003, the 336th was deployed to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, a total of 24 aircraft being deployed in coordination with planners of the Combined Air Operations Center at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. In late January, the F-15Es began flying in support of Operation Southern Watch, typically performing surveillance and reconnaissance missions, additional missions included simulated combat against potential Iraqi targets and regional familiarization with local procedures and rules of engagement. During OSW, F-15Es attacked a number of targets in southern and western Iraq, including radars, radio communications and relay stations, command and control sites, and air defences. On one night, four F-15Es released multiple GBU-24s on the Iraqi Republican Guard/Baath Party HQ in Basrah while another flight of four destroyed a nearby Air Defense Sector HQ with six GBU-10s.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1993, drug {{trafficking}} charges against Ovidio and Ponce Torres were {{dropped in the}} U.S without a stated reason. On May 3, 1994, Aldrete was sentenced to 62 years in prison. Cult members Elio, Serafín Jr., Martínez Salinas, and Serna Valdez, received 67 years each. In {{an interview with the}} press, Kilroy's parents stated that they were relieved to hear that the cultists were sentenced. The charges were multiple homicide (31 years), possession of narcotics (12 years), involvement in organized crime (5 years), police impersonation (2 years), illegal body desecration (2 years), illegal possession of firearms (10 years), and illegal <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> exclusive to the Mexican Armed Forces (5 years). The Mexican federal judge explained that the reason Aldrete received fewer years in prison than the rest was because she was not charged with using weapons that were military-exclusive, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence. He also stated that the maximum conviction a person in Mexico can receive for capital murder is 50 years. Since Mexico's judicial system does not have parole, it allows for prisoners to file motions at an appeal court to reduce their sentences after several years. If this condition is denied or granted, inmates can then push for a writ of amparo.|$|E
50|$|Criminal <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a <b>weapon</b> is the {{unlawful}} <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a <b>weapon</b> by a citizen. Many societies both {{past and}} present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens (and {{to a lesser extent}} police) are allowed to purchase, own, and carry in public. Such crimes are public order crimes and are considered mala prohibita, in that the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a <b>weapon</b> in and <b>of</b> itself is not evil. Rather, the potential for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a possible need to control them. Some restrictions are strict liability, whereas others require some element of intent to use the weapon for an illegal purpose. Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances. Lawful uses <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> by civilians commonly include hunting, sport, collection and self-preservation.|$|R

500|$|The era saw Libya's {{return to}} the {{international}} arena. In 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to [...] normalize relations. In 2001, Gaddafi condemned the September 11 attacks on the U.S. by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, {{at the same time}} as Gaddafi called for the wider application of sharia law. Libya also cemented connexions with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the U.S. improved as a result, while British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Gaddafi in March 2004; the pair developed close personal ties. The following month, Gaddafi travelled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels, signifying improved relations between Libya and the EU; the latter ended its sanctions in October.|$|E
