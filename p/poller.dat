Its specific epithet derived from the Latin tibicen [...] "flute-player" [...] or [...] "piper" [...] {{in reference to the}} bird's melodious call. An early recorded vernacular name is piping <b>poller,</b> written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter, sometime between 1788 and 1792. Tarra-won-nang, or djarrawunang, wibung, and marriyang were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin. Booroogong and garoogong were Wiradjuri words, and carrak was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria. Among the Kamilaroi, it is burrugaabu, galalu, or guluu. It was known as Warndurla among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara. Other names used include piping crow-shrike, piper, maggie, flute-bird and organ-bird. The term bell-magpie was proposed to help distinguish it from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For sensor {{networks}} {{deployed in}} unattended, harsh environments, {{the knowledge of}} sensor statuses such as liveness, node density and residue energy, is critical for maintaining the normal operation of the network. In this paper, we propose a poller-pollee based architecture to monitor the sensor status, focusing on two important issues: false alarm and energy efficiency. To reduce the false alarm rate, each pollee is monitored by multiple <b>pollers.</b> However, this approach will increase the power and bandwidth consumption. To address this issue, we propose a novel solution where the monitored sensor sends the status reports to different <b>pollers</b> in a round robin manner. In this way, bandwidth and power can be saved, and the false alarm rate can be reduced. We further propose a simple randomized algorithm to select the optimal number of <b>pollers</b> to stochastically minimize the expected total energy consumption due to monitoring. Theoretical analyses and simulations are used to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed techniques. I...|$|R

50|$|NMIS can run in both {{physical}} and virtual environments. Smaller networks can be monitored using workstation PCs. Server hardware with 2GB of RAM is usually sufficient for up to 1000 managed devices (even with 32 ports on each). 1000 managed devices may take 20GB of storage. Large numbers of devices can be managed by implementing NMIS on more powerful machines or by leveraging NMIS distributed polling and setting up multiple NMIS <b>pollers</b> in a master/slave design. Ultimately, NMIS is very efficient but the hardware specification of the required server will vary depending on what is being managed, how often information is collected, and how many devices are managed.|$|R

A 2004 study of workers in Australia showed a trend that satisfaction levels decreased as the numbers of hours worked increased. They also stated that these effect could be lessened for those who enjoyed working extensive hours. These types of workers are more satisfied with their work-life balance.|$|R

30|$|Service-oriented DSMSs aim to {{integrate}} with classical service-oriented architectures, thereby taking {{advantages of the}} existing infrastructure (interaction and discovery protocols, registries, service composition based on orchestration or choreography, etc.). Similarly to database-oriented relational DSMSs, the simplest service-oriented DSMSs are centralized with a unique point of data collection [11],[38],[39], or semi-distributed based {{on a set of}} data collection points [40],[41]. However, these DSMSs focus mainly on the problem of presenting streams as services, without reusing the existing and valuable theoretical work from WSANs. In practice, these approaches are based on well-known Web service technologies. For RESTful services, some studies use specific mechanisms of the HTTP protocol, like Web hooks, long polling and HTTP streaming[11]. As for SOAP services, some work extends the SOAP architecture by adding new message exchange patterns (MEP) designed for stream communication (e.g., the capability for a service to receive multiple requests and produce multiple responses in parallel when invoked) [42]. Usually, sensors are presented as Web resources, identified by URIs [11],[38],[41]. The paradigms used to broadcast streams vary from one solution to another. Stream Feeds[38] uses pull requests to gather historical data and push requests to receive new data issued by the sensors. RMS[11] goes a step further by building upon a topic-based pub/sub infrastructure, while WebPlug[41] uses an infrastructure based on <b>pollers</b> that periodically check the state of resources.|$|R

The circle of the research covers the employees working for Directorate General Of Youth and Sports. The sampling on the other hand is done within 308 administrative employees at the Central Organization, working as; Deputy General Directors, Section Presidents, Presidents of the Federations, General Secretaries of the Federations, Branch Directors, Chiefs and Experts. In the study a poll is carried out to determine the levels of realization of the preaimed objectives within the Turkish Policies of sports. During the preparation of the poll; thoughts of experts have been asked and finalised by a pilot application carried on a pregroup of 30 persons. The first section is saved for personal information and in the second section questions asked regarding the levels of realization of the preaimed objectives within the constituon, laws, development laws and government policies and programmes regarding sports which are the basis of the Turkish Sports Policies. The results of the polls have been tableised and evaluated using SPSS program. As a results of the research, it is determined that the Turkish Sports Policies have not been achieved. Majority of the <b>pollers</b> stated that sports could not be commonised within the society and on the other hand the sports complexes are inadequate regarding to quality and quantity. And the present sports complexes could not be presented to public use efficiently. And the input of private sector could not be increased and efforts regarding olympiads is inadequate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{competition}} {{in the context of}} the most natural and distinct sign of market orientation and implemented enterprise activities on the part of managers, contractors and owners of companies is often stressed as part of the concerned issue. Since routine actions, faith in the repeatability of market phenomena or the loyalty of consumers are not accepted in competitive activities of enterprises, the owners and managers are expected to act in an entrepreneurship-like manner to achieve a competitive position. As part of each market and sector based on the principle of competitiveness, a leader can be distinguished who, by his dynamics, forces other participants to undertake actions aimed at achieving a better market position in the competitive race (Strużycki, 2002). The primary purpose of selecting the research area of this article is, first of all, the desire to present the issues of SME enterprise competitiveness with the simultaneous determination of factors having impact on the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises, as well as on their development. The purpose of the article will be to identify the factors having a direct impact on creating the competitive position and the development of enterprises as well as mutual relations between entrepreneurs and their business partners. The cooperation between business entities affects the proper growth in the whole branch and particular sectors of the economy. Thus, in the process of planning and decision-making in an enterprise, the selection of an appropriate business partner plays an important part. In order to analyze the subject matter, a secondary research was used using the study of literature, research reports from various scientific centers and statistical data as well as an empirical research conducted by means of a questionnaire with participation (supported by <b>pollers)</b> on a random sample of 520 micro, small and medium enterprises. 460 entities were selected from this group, which answered all questions included in the questionnaire.
