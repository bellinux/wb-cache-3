2500|$|In 1501, Maximilian {{fell from}} {{his horse and}} badly injured his leg, causing him pain {{for the rest of}} his life. Some historians have {{suggested}} that Maximilian was [...] "morbidly" [...] depressed: From 1514, he travelled everywhere with his coffin. Maximilian died in Wels, Upper Austria, and was succeeded as Emperor by his grandson Charles V, his son Philip the Handsome having died in 1506. For penitential reasons, Maximilian gave very specific instructions for the treatment of his body after death. He wanted his hair to be cut off and his teeth knocked out, and the body was to be whipped and covered with lime and ash, wrapped in linen, and [...] "publicly displayed to show the <b>perishableness</b> of all earthly glory". Although he is buried in the Castle Chapel at Wiener Neustadt, an extremely elaborate cenotaph tomb for Maximilian is in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, where the tomb is surrounded by statues of heroes from the past. Much of the work was done in his lifetime, but it was not completed until decades later.|$|E
60|$|Sect. 48. And as {{different}} degrees of industry were apt to give men possessions in different proportions, so this invention of money gave {{them the opportunity to}} continue and enlarge them: for supposing an island, separate from all possible commerce {{with the rest of the}} world, wherein there were but an hundred families, but there were sheep, horses and cows, with other useful animals, wholsome fruits, and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the island, either because of its commonness, or <b>perishableness,</b> fit to supply the place of money; what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family, and a plentiful supply to its consumption, either in what their own industry produced, or they could barter for like perishable, useful commodities, with others? Where there is not some thing, both lasting and scarce, and so valuable to be hoarded up, there men will not be apt to enlarge their possessions of land, were it never so rich, never so free for them to take: for I ask, what would a man value ten thousand, or an hundred thousand acres of excellent land, ready cultivated, and well stocked too with cattle, in the middle of the inland parts of America, where he had no hopes of commerce with other parts of the world, to draw money to him by the sale of the product? It would not be worth the enclosing, and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature, whatever was more than would supply the conveniencies of life to be had there for him and his family.|$|E
5000|$|Smit {{is known}} for figurative [...] "enigmatic sculptures" [...] {{depicting}} ceramic animals like dogs, hares or rats. [...] Her sculptures satirically play with the emotions such as hate, love, exuberance, alienation and unresolved emotions, using highly imaginative representations of skeletons, cats or babies. She creates characters with over active sentiment, inspired by themes from classic mythology and biblical tales, such as greed, power and impotence, <b>perishableness</b> and death. [...] Her sculptures are rich in symbolism and she often uses elements familiar to vanities, such as skulls, skeletons, small bones of animals. Much like in the 16th and 17th centuries Dutch Golden Age Vanitas paintings; that were a type of symbolic artworks especially associated with still life painting in Flanders and the Netherlands, her work is meant to symbolize temporary presence but {{with a touch of}} irony.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{first of}} all the connection between vitreous artifacts and their “figures”, their iconography in expression other than the raw material; at the end, it concerns the representation of artifacts on iconographies referred to miniature, frescoes, mosaics and paintings. The high <b>perishableness</b> of glass material and thesherds recycle for reuse makes archaeological data lesser than those coming from ceramic artifacts; with this respect iconographical representation {{is an opportunity to}} help the reconstruction of tipologies, showing the whole artifact and, at the same time, reflects more elaborate artistical and cultural influences. This way allows to compare objects and images realized in medieval time on regional scale, to identify mutualities and origins between different workshops and to get important informations about artifacts and craftsmen movements. Here we tried to consider the relationship between archaeological glass vessels coming from recents medieval excavations in Calabria and their iconographic images, through a methodological approach based around the “object iconography” of glass equipment...|$|E
40|$|The {{habit of}} chewing Khat (Catha edulis) to {{experience}} its euphorizing and psychostimulant effects has prevailed for centuries among {{the inhabitants of}} the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula. In recent years, air transport has removed the major obstacle to the diffusion of Khat, its <b>perishableness.</b> Khat is now air-freighted to Europe {{and we were able to}} buy some in Rome. We report the results of interviews with 20 members of the Somali community in Rome, who had continued their habit of chewing Khat whilst abroad. They asserted that they gathered together whenever possible, but preferably at weekends, to chew moderate quantities of Khat (one bundle, about 400 g). The customary habit of drinking tea or other soft drinks containing methylxantines during Khat sessions was maintained and very few subjects admitted drinking alcohol. In this small study sample, Khat chewing still seems to be a social event, as it is in Somalia...|$|E
