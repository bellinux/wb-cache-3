With a history {{dating back to}} 1800, the breed is named for the Poitou-Charentes region. Poitou goats {{are known for their}} use in goat milk cheese production, though they are an {{endangered}} breed, and at one point were down to just 600 breeding animals. Poitou goats have a distinctive appearance: tall and with long, shaggy hair, they are black-brown with white marks on the head and neck, while the underbelly and legs are white.|$|E
