500|$|McGovern {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on August 10, 1968, in Washington, {{two weeks in}} advance of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, committing himself to [...] "the goals for which Robert Kennedy gave his life". Asked why he was a better choice than McCarthy, he said, [...] "Well – Gene really doesn't want to be <b>President,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do." [...] At the convention in Chicago, Humphrey was the near-certain choice while McGovern became the initial rallying point for around 300 leaderless Kennedy delegates. The chaotic circumstances of the convention found McGovern denouncing the Chicago police tactics against demonstrators as [...] "police brutality". Given the internal politics of the party, it was difficult for McGovern to gain in delegate strength, and black protest candidate Channing E. Phillips drew off some of his support. In the actual roll call, McGovern came in third with 146½ delegates, far behind Humphrey's 1760¼ and McCarthy's 601.|$|E

2500|$|The four {{expelled}} {{board members}} made a final attempt to unseat Rutherford, claiming {{that although he}} had {{the backing of the}} most powerful shareholders, he lacked the support of the Bible Student movement in general.

Rutherford wrote in October, [...] "I did not seek election to the office of <b>President,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am not seeking re-election. The Lord is able to attend to his own business." [...] Then in December 1918, he outmaneuvered his opponents, organizing a referendum of all Bible Students and Watch Tower subscribers, a month before the annual Pittsburgh convention. Although not binding, votes were counted in more than 800 U.S. congregations, giving Rutherford 95 percent of the vote for president. His opposers ranked 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th on the list of prospective directors, with the highest support given to Rutherford's existing six co-directors. On January 5, 1918, Rutherford was returned to office, receiving 194,106 shareholders' votes. Hirsh received 23,198 votesthe highest among the ex-directorsputting him in 10th place.
