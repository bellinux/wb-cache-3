40|$|Abstract – The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} the wireless sensor and actor network (WSAN) applications together with the technological evolution {{of this kind of}} system has allowed higher level programming paradigms to be proposed for these networks. In this paper, a service based programming model for real time WSANs is proposed. It allows us to specify the services and their interaction in order to build applications. The model syntax is platform independent which will facilitate its use by automatic tools in the implementation phase. The real time issue is important in WSANs so the model allows us to specify real time requirements as service <b>priorities,</b> <b>periods</b> of service execution or deadlines. I...|$|R

The proposed architecture is a modified version of Round-Robin architecture which is used for scheduling of tasks in Real-Time operating systems. It is observed that the proposed architecture solves the drawbacks of simple Round-Robin architecture in Real-Time operating system by decreasing the number of context switches waiting time and response time thereby improving the system performance. This paper also explains the development of a new CLI simulation framework: to study and evaluate the performance of various uniporcessor real-time scheduling algorithm for Real-Time system. Task ID, Deadline, <b>Priority,</b> <b>period,</b> Computation time, and Phase are the input task attributes to the scheduler simulator and chronograph imitating the real-time execution of the input task set and computational statistics of the schedule are the output. The proposed framework for the scheduler simulator is mainly developed to be used as a teaching tool.

40|$|Problem statement: A Real-Time System (RTS) is {{one which}} {{controls}} an environment by receiving data, processing it, and returning the results {{quickly enough to}} affect {{the functioning of the}} environment at that time. The main objective of this research was to develop an architectural model for the simulation of real time tasks to implement in distributed environment through web, and to make comparison between various scheduling algorithms. The proposed model can be used for preprogrammed scheduling policies for uniprocessor systems. This model provided user friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). Approach: Though a lot of scheduling algorithms have been developed, just a few of them are available to be implemented in real-time applications. In order to use, test and evaluate a scheduling policy it must be integrated into an operating system, which is a complex task. Simulation is another alternative to evaluate a scheduling policy. Unfortunately, just a few real-time scheduling simulators have been developed to date and most of them require the use of a specific simulation language. Results: Task ID, deadline, <b>priority,</b> <b>period,</b> computation time and phase are the input task attributes to the scheduler simulator and chronograph imitating the real-time execution of the input task set and computational statistics of the schedule are the output. Conclusion: The Web-enabled framework proposed in this study gave the developer to evaluate the schedulability of the real time application. Numerous benefits were quoted in support of the Web-based deployment. The proposed framework can be used as an invaluable teaching tool. Further, the GUI of the framework will allow for easy comparison of the framework of existing scheduling policies and also simulate the behavior and verify the suitability of custom defined schedulers for real-time applications...|$|E

The active portion is sequentially {{divided into three}} portions: the beacon, the contention access period (CAP), and the contention-free period (CFP) as shown in Figure 2. PTS, CAP, and CFP are called <b>priority</b> access <b>period</b> (PAP). The CAP supports contention-based channel access for one-time prompt traffic, such as device association/deassociation, bandwidth request, and some low duty cycle traffics. The CFP supports scheduled channel access for periodical traffics and QoS guaranteed traffics, such as medical waveforms and stream of audio and video. The <b>priority</b> access <b>period</b> (PAP) is immediately after the beacon in the superframe. The PAP is comprised of priority time slot (PTS) which is a physical time period immediately after the beacon, and embedded PAP, which are the unoccupied slots in both CAP and CFP. The PTS in the superframe provides guaranteed channel access only for emergency traffic.|$|R

40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns {{and the ongoing}} economic crisis push ski resorts operators to pay greater attention to water and energy consumptions {{and at the same}} time climate change raises worrying questions about the future of snow industry. Demand for optimization and diagnostics have been growing quickly among professionals and policy makers while paradoxically snow management strategies and impacts on snowpack properties have so far drawn sporadic interest in terms of scientific research. Here we introduce a new numerical tool for snow management analysis and simulation based on the SAFRAN-Crocus model chain. We present the first step of the integration of snow management (snowmaking, grooming) into the detailed snowpack model Crocus. Several ski resorts in the French Alps were interviewed to collect data about machine-made snow production (water volumes, periods of production, snowmaking constraints, etc.) and to assess standard practices (work schedules, <b>priority</b> <b>periods</b> and ex-tra constraints), which we implemented in the model. SAFRAN-Crocus runs provide realistic and consis-tent results when compared to observations by professionals. Machine-made snow production occurs in the model depending on a predefined production scheme and meteorological constraints (wind, wet-bulb temperature). Machine made snow properties are set to commonly observed properties in terms of den-sity and microstructure characteristics, which differ widely from natural fresh snow properties. Simulatio...|$|R

For much of the 1950s, Belsen [...] "was increasingly forgotten {{as a place of}} remembrance". Only after 1957 did large groups of young people visit the place where Anne Frank had died. After anti-Semitic graffiti was scrawled on the Cologne synagogue over Christmas 1959, German chancellor Konrad Adenauer followed a suggestion by Nahum Goldmann, president of the World Jewish Congress, and visited the site of a former concentration camp for the first time. In a speech at the Bergen-Belsen memorial, Adenauer assured the Jews still living in Germany that they would have the same respect and security as everyone else. Afterwards, the German public saw the Belsen memorial as primarily a Jewish place of remembrance. Nevertheless, the memorial was redesigned in 1960-61. In 1966, a document centre was opened which offered a permanent exhibition on the persecution of the Jews, with a focus on events in the nearby Netherlands - where Anne Frank and her family had been arrested in 1944. This was complemented by an overview {{of the history of the}} Bergen-Belsen camp. This was the first ever permanent exhibit anywhere in Germany on the topic of Nazi crimes. However, there was still no scientific personnel at the site, with only a caretaker as permanent staff. Memorial events were only organized by the survivors themselves.|$|R

Resource sharing in such systems potentially leads to priority inversion: processes of high priority {{can be prevented}} from entering a critical section and be delayed by processes of lower priority. Since uncontrolled priority inversion can cause high priority processes to miss their deadlines, a real-time operating system must use resource-sharing mechanisms that limit the effects of priority inversion.
