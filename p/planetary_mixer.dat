This method enables spiral mixers {{to mix the}} same size dough batch much quicker and with less under-mixed dough than a similarly powered <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer.</b> Spiral mixers can mix dough with less agitator friction than planetary mixers.

50|$|A <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer,</b> {{such as a}} stand mixer or {{handheld}} mixer, {{is appropriate}} for a homemade or bakery cake. If the cake is being mass produced, a continuous mixer is preferred. There are three methods in which the cake can be made {{at home or in}} a commercial setting. The first two methods are most commonly used at home or in a small bakery using planetary mixers in various sizes. Large planetary mixers may have a vacuum in order to pressurize the ingredients. This allows for control of the emulsion and temperature.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{dimensional}} analysis {{has been developed}} {{in order to identify}} the ratios governing the foam development network, with mixers combining dual whip revolution speeds. It is first suggested that, for a given <b>planetary</b> whip <b>mixer</b> and foaming solution, the set of dimensionless ratios characterizing the course of gas hold-up can be reduced to modified Froude and revolution numbers, {{as in the case of}} a classical mixing system. This requires the introduction of a characteristic velocity, instead of the two individual rotational speeds of the whip, in the corresponding list of governing parameters. An analytical expression for this characteristic velocity is then proposed, and gas hold-up measurements are made at various whip speed ratios, using a given food model-recipe, containing whole eggs and sugar. Our experimental results were evaluated, in order to validate the proposed dimensional analysis. It is shown that the aeration process requires a very low, modified revolution number to reach steady state values. It is also shown that the asymptotic values of gas hold-up are influenced by the modified Froude number. Depending on the values of the modified Froude number, it is noted that coalescence can occur, which then contributes to a reduction in gas hold-up. It has also been established that the modified Froude number can account for the eccentricity of <b>planetary</b> <b>mixers,</b> and consequently, that this number is a robust indicator for the determination of the optimum gas hold-up value, when air incorporation is produced by various planetary whipping devices. The results described in this paper enable foaming processes using <b>planetary</b> whipping <b>mixers</b> to be optimized, by proposing a framework in which the impeller speed ratio and aeration time can be set in such a way as to control the simultaneous entrainment and disentrainment of gas. Finally, this work can be further extended to other gas/liquid applications in which <b>planetary</b> <b>mixers</b> are used, such as surface aeration in wastewater treatment plants...|$|R
5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A Pan or <b>Planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo.

40|$|International audiencePowder mixing {{is crucial}} to the {{processing}} stages in many industries. However, there is still a paucity of information about the effects of process parameters on mixing efficiency. This paper investigates the homogenization of free flowing granular materials with a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer,</b> TRIAXE (R), examining the effect of the ratio of impeller rotational speeds (N-R/N-G) on the mixing process. First, a dimensional analysis carried out with mixing time and power consumption as target variables, established that both a Froude number and N-R/N-G controlled the process for the given free flowing powder mixture and <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer.</b> A further theoretical approach also suggested that these two dimensionless ratios which control hydrodynamics can be reduced to a modified Froude number providing that the maximum linear velocity achieved (mu(ch)) by the <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> is introduced, replacing the dual impeller rotational speeds (N-R and N-G). Mixing time and power experiments validated the above hypothesis. Homogeneity tests performed in a granular media showed that the length of path achieved by the impeller governs the obtained mixing level. Finally, this work reflected that (i) dimensional analysis was also well suited to model powder homogenization with a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer.</b> (ii) A concise set of dimensionless numbers governing mixing phenomena can be deduced through the introduction of the maximum linear velocity as obtained in previous studies on gas/liquid and miscible liquids mixing processes...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of different processing techniques on dielectric strength of epoxy/SiO 2 nanocomposite. Two processing techniques {{included in this study}} are sonication and Thinky <b>planetary</b> centrifugal <b>mixer.</b> Sonication {{is one of the most}} widely used mixing techniques in nanocomposite preparation and is believed to provide a good dispersion. However, sonication will produce a lot of air bubbles when disperse the fillers into the epoxy resin which will increase the difficulty of the degassing process. These kinds of small air bubbles may not affect the mechanical properties significantly but may have effects on the dielectric properties. Thinky <b>planetary</b> centrifugal <b>mixer</b> is an innovation mixing technique which can achieve a uniform mixing, dispersal and deaeration in a short time. SiO 2 was mixed with epoxy resin directly using either sonication or Thinky mixing with 2 wt% loading and 5 wt% loading respectively. The mixing time is 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes respectively. The same degassing process is applied to both sonication and Thinky mixing specimens. The degassing process includes a vacuum degassing process and a degassing program in Thinky mixer. Breakdown strength tests were then performed to evaluate the effect of processing techniques.

Flowing properties of twenty-three powders have been investigated with different techniques at three scales of measurement and three different states of consolidation in order to link their basic characteristics to their behavior during agitation in a mixer. The macroscopic scale concerns powder stirring experiments in a 48 L <b>planetary</b> pilot <b>mixer.</b> The mesoscopic scale properties have been measured with Erweka® volumenometer and FT 4 Freeman rheometer under three different consolidation states. Their flow ability ranges from free-flowing to cohesive. Microscopic properties, at the scale of particles, have been obtained from LASER granulometry, SEM observations and He-pycnometry. The comparison between macroscopic experiments and mesoscopic characterizations through specific power shows that the consolidation state of the powder is a key parameter to consider, especially for cohesive powders. The macroscopic scale in-mixer rheological measurements show two main patterns: a free-flowing like pattern and a cohesive like pattern, the ranking of the powders between these two being not intuitive. It is found that the power registered when stirring a powder constituted by a free-flowing media filled with a cohesive one reaches a minimum for a specific ratio of the two powders that {{has been linked to}} the microscopic structure of the particle's packing...|$|R

The processed mixture was cured with diethyl toluene diamine. Three complimentary techniques were used to characterize the dispersion of the MWCNTs in cured composite samples: optical microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For sample MF þ PSM, optical micrographs and Raman images showed reduced agglomeration and a homogeneous distribution of MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix. SEM analysis of fractured specimen after tensile testing revealed breakage of nanotubes along the fracture surface of the composite. A comparison of the MWCNT dispersion in the epoxy samples processed using different methods showed that a combination of MF and PSM processing yields a more homogeneous sample than the PSM or US þ PSM processed samples. Mechanical testing of the composites showed about 15 % improvement in the tensile strength of samples processed by the MF þ PSM method over other methods. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed a small decrease in the onset degradation temperature for poorly dispersed samples produced by PSM compared with the well-mixed samples (MF þ PSM).

The porous bioceramics {{are expected to}} have good mechanical properties after sintering at 1200 °C. Reverse thermo-responsive hydrogels of poly[(N-isopropylacrylamide) -co-(methacrylic acid) ] p(NiPAAm–MAA) were synthesized by free-radical cross-linking copolymerization, and their chemical properties were evaluated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogel was determined using turbidity measurements. A thermogravimetric analysis was used to examine the thermal properties. The porous bioceramic properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, bulk density, compressive strength testing and cytotoxicity. The compressive strength and average porosity of the porous bioceramics were examined at approximately 6. 8 MPa and 66 % under 10 wt% p(NiPAAm–MAA) = 99 : 1 condition. The ratio of HAp/β-TCP can adjust two different compositional behaviors during the 1200 °C sintering process without resulting in cell toxicity.

40|$|In this work, the {{recycled}} {{concrete aggregate}} (RCA) friability during mixing was studied {{in order to}} better understand the evolution of this material during the mixing process and improve the recycled aggregate concrete mix-design. The influence of some important materials and process parameters was evaluated: initial abrasion resistance and initial moisture of the aggregates, mixer geometry, mixing time and mixing speed. To assess the mixing process effect on the recycled concrete aggregate friability, three different aspects were evaluated; the mass loss (mass of fraction inferior to 2. 5 mm) the grading and the angularity evolutions with mixing time of an initially 10 - 14 mm aggregate. Tests were carried out in two types of laboratory concrete <b>mixers,</b> a <b>planetary</b> 30 l <b>mixer</b> from Skako and an intensive 5 l Erich mixer. The results revealed that in normal laboratory setting of the mixers configuration, the mass loss for natural aggregate (NA) is less than 1 % of the coarse aggregate. This percentage reach 3 % for good quality recycled concrete aggregate (MDE value of 21) and 5 % for lower quality recycled concrete aggregate (MDE value of 27). The mass loss directly depends on the mixing parameters and the degradation of the recycled concrete aggregate drastically increased when the mixing speed was raised to 500 RPM. By analyzing the grading evolution during mixing, it was shown that both cleavage (creation of intermediate size particles) and attrition (creation of small particles) mechanisms influenced the aggregate degradation. However, the configuration of mixing significantly influenced the proportion of attrition and cleavage mechanisms. To complete this work, the angularity evolution showed that recycled concrete aggregate surface becomes smoother and the edges more rounded after mixing...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that fluid mixing can often be {{improved}} by the introduction of ‘baffles’ into the flow – the problem of baffle placement is examined here for chaotic fluid mixing of a highly viscous fluid. A simple model for a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer,</b> with one stirring element, is modified by the introduction of one or more stationary baffles. Regular regions of poor mixing in the unbaffled flow are shown to be significantly reduced in size if the location of the baffles is chosen so that the flow necessarily generates ‘topological chaos’. By contrast, the positioning of baffles in superficially similar ways that do not generate such ‘topological chaos’ fails to provide a similar improvement. Michael J. Clifford, Stephen M. Co...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the {{combustion}} of nAl/H 2 O propellants has been widely studied, but further progress has been slowed for the following reason: the loosely correlated trends in combustion data are insufficient in guiding further research efforts and they cannot be used to significantly improve the Isp observed in static rocket motor tests. It was assumed that the different mixing techniques (hand, <b>planetary</b> and resonant <b>mixers,</b> duration and temperature) gave rise to the different burning rate measurements, but the influences from pH and rheology on nAl/H 2 O combustion were not considered. ^ In this work it is found that the effects of pH on nAl/H 2 O propellants are profound, and correlate well with viscosity, low pressure deflagration limits, burning rate exponents, rocket motor performance, and result in better correlated burning rate data. In particular, the findings suggest that agglomeration on the length scale of the transition particle diameter between diffusion and kinetic burning can influence the pressure exponent. Agglomeration in mixtures is affected by electrostatic repulsion from charged H+ and OH− ions at the solid/liquid interface, and this is reflected through zeta potential and viscosity measurements at the different pH levels. Additionally, it is observed that pH appears to control the reaction kinetics during ignition as the propellant transitions from low-temperature oxidation (that is still highly exothermic) to combustion. Basic pH values accelerate the low-temperature oxidation rates, and as a result the low pressure deflagration limit decreases with increasing pH. ^ Finally, coatings and surface modifiers are identified that can stabilize pH and yield more uniform dispersions. These coatings can improve mixing safety and prevent coagulation (pre-combustion mixture agglomeration) during the freezing process, unfortunately the best coating option (palmitic acid) is not suitable for efficient nAl/H 2 O propellant combustion because samples produce a hard, dense slug during the combustion. The findings of this work have direct application beyond the aluminum and water system, extending to the research of nano-particle addition to liquid fuels, slurries, gels, and for the aqueous processing of Al based nanothermites. ...|$|R

This paper presents an experimental investigation of mixing in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer,</b> and a comparison with numerical simulations based on a simple mathematical model of the flow. The model allows an exact expression for the velocity field in the Stokes flow regime, apparently the first for a mixer with genuinely moving parts, which permits accurate numerical tracking of material interfaces. Experiments performed at low Reynolds number (Re 1) show good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations, but as the Reynolds number is increased, the agreement between experiments and Stokes-flow numerics worsens, {{in a manner that}} reflects improving experimental mixing quality. Specifically, we find that islands of poor mixing shrink as Re increases. Our results suggest that, while numerical simulations in the Stokes flow regime may be used as a ‘sieve’ to select good mixing protocols at small Re, experiments or computational fluid dynamics simulations are required properly to evaluate mixing protocols operated at finite Reynolds numbers.

Moreover, once this transition has been achieved, mixing power consumption will be related to mixture rheology and then to mixer geometry by means of a simplified hypothesis. This equation can also be obtained via a dimensionless analysis. Lastly, it will be shown that mixture behavior beyond the transition point is well fitted by a hyperbolic equation.

Our major aim is to investigate {{the effect of the}} flow properties of several powders, {{as well as that of}} the set of experimental conditions (engine speeds N-R and N-G), on the power consumption of such a mixer. Thanks to a previous dimensional analysis of the system, this influence is studied through the variations of the power P with a characteristic speed rich, defined from engine speeds and geometrical considerations. Two relationships involving dimensionless numbers are derived to describe the agitation process: N-pG = f (F-rG, Nu(R) /Nu(G)) and N-pM = f(Fr-M). For free flowing powders, a linear relationship is observed when plotting P against u(ch), and he resulting process relationship linking dimensionless numbers is Np-M = 15 Fr(M) (- 1). In the more cohesive case, power values vary around an average value (P = 54 W) and the resulting process relationship is Np-M = 1. 8072 Fr(M) (- 1. 467). It is argued that the exponent in the representation of N-pM against Fr-M may be a useful parameter for powder classification, and should be linked to powder rheometrical considerations.

Mixtures of free flowing and cohesive powders have also, been studied to get a more complete range of powders of different properties.

These dimensionless numbers are built on the basis of a characteristic speed an, a characteristic length d(s), the bulk density rho(b) and the power consumption A. The filling ratio f is also taken in account. For a free flowing powder, of cohesion smaller than 0. 3 kPa, N-pM= a(f) center dot F-rM(- 1) while for a more cohesive powder, of cohesion higher than 0. 6 kPa the correlation N-pM= 6 center dot F-rM(b(f)) is more appropriate.

Ready-to-use {{therapeutic}} food (RUTF) spread {{has been}} shown to be very effective in the rehabili-tation of severely malnourished children and facilitates home-based therapy of these children. Objective. To describe how RUTF spread can be manufactured on a variety of production scales. Principles of production. RUTF spread is an edible lipid-based paste that is energy dense, resists bacterial contamination, and requires no cooking. The primary production principles include grinding all ingredients to a particle size < 200 microns, producing the food without the introduction of water, and embedding the protein and carbohydrate components of the food into the lipid matrix. The most widely used RUTF spread is a mixture of milk powder, sugar, vegetable oil, peanut butter, vita-mins, and minerals. Scale of production. RUTF spread can be produced in quantities sufficient to treat several hundred children using a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> in a clinic. Production of larger quantities of RUTF spread can be achieved in partnership with local food companies. Production sufficient to meet the needs of several thousand children can be achieved with a dedicated production facility using technology appropriate for use in the developing world. Care must be taken to avoid aflatoxin contamination, and quality control testing of the product is essential. Conclusions. RUTF spread can be safely and easily produced in small or large quantities in most settings worldwide. The local availability of the necessary ingre-dients limits its use in some settings, and further inves-tigation of alternative ingredients is needed to overcome this limitation.

40|$|Stabilization traps toxic {{contaminants}} (usually both chemically and physically) in {{a matrix}} {{so that they}} do not leach into the environment. Typical contaminants are metals (mostly transition metals) that exhibit the characteristic of toxicity. The stabilization process routinely uses pozzolanic materials. Portland cement, fly ash-lime mixes, gypsum cements, and clays {{are some of the most}} common materials. In many instances, materials that can pass the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP-the federal leach test) or the Soluble Threshold Leachate Concentration (STLC-the California leach test) must have high concentrations of lime or other caustic material because of the low pH of the leaching media. Both leaching media, California`s and EPA`s, have a pH of 5. 0. California uses citric acid and sodium citrate while EPA uses acetic acid and sodium acetate. These media can form ligands that provide excellent metal leaching. Because of the aggressive nature of the leaching medium, stabilized wastes in many cases will not pass the leaching tests. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, additives such as dithiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, which are pH-insensitive and provide resistance to ligand formation, are used in the waste stabilization process. Attapulgite, montmorillonite, and sepiolite clays are used because they are forgiving (recipe can be adjusted before the matrix hardens). The most frequently used stabilization process consists of a customized recipe involving waste sludge, clay and dithiocarbamate salt, mixed with a double <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> into a pasty consistency.

40|$|Abstract. Geopolymers, {{which are}} {{inorganic}} polymers consisting largely of three-dimensional Al-Si-O network formed by reactions between aluminosilicate solids and concentrated alkali solutions, are gaining recognition as environmentally friendly engineering materials. As {{a replacement for}} ordinary Portland cement (OPC), geopolymer consumes much less energy to produce, and may be synthesized from various solid inorganic waste materials. This work describes the synthesis of geopolymers which combines two waste materials as aluminosilicate precursors: an ASTM Class F coal fly ash from the Paiton power plant, and Fe-rich metallurgical slag from P. T. Kratakau Steel. To {{study the effects of}} the reactant mixture composition, a simplex lattice experiment is undertaken with fly ash and slag as its major components, and level of addition of Sodium silicate as the independent variable. The highest slag to ash mass ratio is set at 50 %. The solid aluminosilicates and sodium silicate are mixed with 10 M KOH solution at a mass ratio of 2. 8. The mixture is processed in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> to form a smooth paste, which is then cast into specimens for the measurement of compressive strength in a universal uniaxial load tester after a 1 -week period of curing at room temperature. The measured compressive strengths of all geopolymer paste samples are lower than that of OPC, and decreases with increasing slag proportions. Addition of Sodium silicate increases the strength. Morphology characterization by SEM suggests that the geopolymerization gel phase formation is less complete when slag is added. This apparent reduction in aluminosilicate raw materials reactivity towards alkali is likely due to the reduced Si/Al ratio when slag replaces a portion of the fly ash. The overall low compressive strength indicates that the curing mechanism in the room temperature does not involve polycondensation, but rather only dissolution and precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} process and {{formulation}} variables on pharmaceutical wet granulation processes using various mixer-processors were studied. The first investigation utilized RSM methods with a central-composite experimental design to study two process variables using a double-paddle <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer.</b> Systematic numerical grid search procedures {{were used to}} locate an optimum combination of mixing speeds and granulating fluid levels which simultaneously satisfied all imposed constraints using multiple response variables. This optimum defined a granulation end-point which was an intermediate between a direct compression blend and a fully granulated product. Mixing speed played only a minor role in the process, which depended chiefly {{on the amount of}} fluid added. In a second investigation, a factorial design approach was used to discriminate between alternative high-shear mixer designs and two comparable pregelatinized starches by using high mixing speeds as a process variable. One mixer, the Ross PowerMix™, was found to have a significantly more intense mixing action than the TK Fielder™ which resulted in enhanced material and tableting properties. It was found that Starch 1500 ™ slightly outperformed Starch 1551 ™ in flow and compactability into tablets for a 90 % acetaminophen-starch powder. A subsequent investigation used the PowerMix™ to study two additional process factors using the same acetaminophen-starch formulation. The interactions between mixing speeds, granulating fluid levels and starch types revealed that mixing speed was the critical variable in the process, followed closely by the amount of granulating fluid added. Differences between the two starches were substantiated. The effects of drying granulations by fluidized-bed techniques or by static oven drying were negligible. A fourth investigation tested the spheronization potential of three grades of microcrystalline cellulose with three grades of theophylline in a novel fluidized-bed rotary granulation technique. The coarsest grade of theophylline was amenable to processing using all three Avicels at drug loading levels of up to 90 %. The finest grade (micronized) formed acceptable spheres only at drug loading levels below 50 %. Larger grades of Avicel performed lightly better than the finest grade. Shape analyses revealed that sphere quality always deteriorated when drug loading levels exceeded 70 %...|$|E
40|$|Pipe jacking is an {{environmentally}} friendly technique for {{the installation of}} services and utilities, which leads to minimum disturbance during installation. It is an important construction method for urban environments where disruption to transport is expensive. The need to tunnel through varying geologies requiring support during tunnelling {{has led to the}} increased use of slurry tunnel boring machines. The slurry is used to stabilise the tunnel face and transport the excavated spoil to the surface. The research detailed in this dissertation assesses the magnitude of soil disaggregation during the excavation and pumping of the arisings within the slurry to the separation plant. The two main objectives were to create a mixing test that would allow the disaggregation of the soil to be predicted prior to specification of the separation plant and to link the results of this test to typical soil properties. In addressing the second objective efforts have also been made to characterise the different mechanisms of disaggregation observed in the mixing tests. The typical soil testing methods used to classify the soil samples were; Atterberg limits, particle size distributions, unconfined compressive strength, mineralogy (XRD) and chemical analysis (XRF). A mixing test has been designed using a Hobart <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> to classify the amount of soil cuttings that disaggregate during mixing with a slurry fluid. This test was found to produce repeatable results using Speswhite Kaolin samples and then used to assess the differences in disaggregation rates of London Clay, Upper Mottled Beds and Fleetwood Silts. In total 71 mixing tests were completed during the development of the test and the classifying of the soils. The test involved mixing distilled water with 10 clay cuttings for varying times. The resulting solid particles were then sized through a series of sieves and sedimentation tests carried out to produce a particle size distribution of the resulting soil. The mixing tests showed the Upper Mottled Beds to have the highest rate of disaggregation, with the Fleetwood Silts displaying the least. This has been attributed to the level of cementing within the soil and the microstructure of the clay and silt sized particles. The liquidity index and initial soil strength were not found to be important factors in the predicting the rate of disaggregation of a particular soil type, but were significant for some soils. The Fleetwood Silts had the lowest unconfined compressive strengths but also produced the least amount of disaggregated soil. The soil macrofabric, although not quantified, also appeared to {{have an effect on the}} rate of disaggregation of a particular soil. An increase in discontinuities within the sample produced more cuttings larger than 4. 75 mm but a lower amount of 63 μm sized fraction disaggregated. In addition to the mixing tests carried out using water, a series of tests were completed using a polymer based slurry, HydroCut CF. This showed mixed results; The polymer prevented any clay or silt sized particles from passing through the 63 μm sieve. However, there was no overall reduction in disaggregation and a significant increase in the time it took to sieve the slurry...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop technology and processes to further beneficiate two southern African bentonites for applications in polymer/clay nanotechnology. The bentonites were from the Koppies mine in South Africa, and the Boane mine in Mozambique. The work was divided into two parts: (i) preparation of organomodified nanoparticulate smectite clays, and (ii) preparation of their poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) nanocomposites. Nanoparticulate organobentonites were prepared using purified bentonites. The conventional organomodification process uses a very low concentration of bentonites at 80 oC. In this study, a novel method was developed: concentrated slurries of naturally occurring Ca-bentonite partially activated with soda ash {{in the presence of}} a proprietary dispersant were contacted at ambient temperature with quaternary ammonium surfactants. A known amount of bentonite dispersion was placed in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> before the mixture. Likewise, a known amount of surfactant, up to 50 % excess, based on the estimated cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the bentonites, was added while mixing the dispersion. The surfactants added were either in solution or in powdered form. The intercalated bentonite was recovered by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with water until halide ions could not be detected using a 1 M silver nitrate solution. The solids were dried at ambient temperature and humidity, and then crushed and milled into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Several instrumental techniques were used to characterise and examine the properties of the bentonite samples before and after organic treatment. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results were consistent with: (i) paraffin-type extended chain intercalation; and (ii) interdigitated monolayer intercalation of the C 12 and C 14 single-chain alkyl surfactants and bilayer intercalation of the single-chain C 16 surfactant and the surfactants with double alkyl chains. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of the organobentonite powders confirmed disordered chain conformations. XRD also detected significant amounts of cristobalite in the samples of Boane bentonite (from Mozambique). This impurity could not be removed cost-effectively. The onset decomposition temperature ofthe present organobentonites was around 200 ºC, which is within the typical range of polymer/organoclay processing temperatures. The thermal stability of the organobentonites was independent of both the number of alkyl chain substituents and their length, and also independent of the degree of clay intercalation. SURFACTANT INTERCALATED KOPPIES AND BOANE BENTONITES FOR POLYMER NANOTECHNOLOGY ii Poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) nanocomposites were prepared with South African Koppies bentonite, organomodified with single-chain C 12 (and polar 2 -hydroxyethyl side chain) and double-chains C 18 alkyl ammonium cationic surfactants. The later surfactant was intercalated both below and above the clay CEC. Nanocomposites were prepared by twin-screw melt compounding. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated the presence of mixed nanoand micron-sized clay morphologies. XRD studies revealed that the crystallinity of the particles improved and that the d-spacing values increased on incorporation of the modified bentonites in the polymer matrix. It is postulated that, rather than indicating polymer co-intercalation, this was caused by further intercalation of either excess surfactants or surfactant residues that were released by shear delamination of the clays during compounding. Improved mechanical properties were realised, especially when using the bentonite containing the longer double-chains surfactant intercalated at levels in excess of the CEC of the clay. The nanocomposites showed improved tensile modulus and elongation at break values at the expense of a reduction in impact strength, while tensile strength was about the same as for the neat polymer.

40|$|No presente trabalho, considerou o estudo do potencial de utilização de sacos de cimento e embalagens de longa vida com o intuito de agregar valor a esses resíduos, mediante a fabricação de painéis de partículas para uso como forro em protótipos de galpões avícolas. Para fabricação desse {{material}} foi utilizado sacos de cimento descartados nas obras civis, embalagens longa vida residuais e resina poliuretana bicomponente à base de óleo de mamona. O estudo foi dividido em quatro etapas: 1) Caracterização da matéria-prima (sacos de cimento); 2) Efeito da densidade e teor de resina nas propriedades físicas, mecânicas e térmicas de painéis de partículas de saco de cimento; 3) Avaliação do desempenho de embalagens longa vida e verniz como revestimentos dos painéis selecionados na etapa anterior; 4) Determinação do desempenho térmico de protótipos de aviários executados em escala reduzida e distorcida com forro de painel de saco de cimento e embalagem longa vida. Os resultados obtidos indicaram: Em razão do painel com 0, 6 g. cm- 3 e 12 % de resina ter apresentado melhor desempenho nas propriedades investigadas, essa combinação foi selecionada para avaliar o desempenho do material (físicas, mecânicas e térmicas) quando revestido com embalagens longa vida, adotando a testemunha e o verniz como um revestimento comparativo. Dentre os revestimentos avaliados, os painéis com embalagens de longa vida, foram superiores aos revestidos com verniz, quando comparados as suas propriedades físicas, mecânicas e térmicas. Dessa maneira, painéis com 0, 6 g. cm- 3 e 12 % de resina revestidos embalagens longa vida, foram testados como forro quanto ao desempenho térmico (primavera, verão, outono e inverno) em protótipos em escala reduzida e distorcida, mediante a determinação de índices de conforto térmico (Entalpia e IAPfc) para aves de corte. A associação do forro sob o protótipo permitiu reduzir a temperatura interna do ar e dos índices de conforto térmico na primavera, verão e outono, enquanto que no inverno não foi constatado eficácia do material. Dentre as estações estudadas, o verão e a primavera, demonstraram serem as épocas mais críticas para criação de aves corte em instalações avícolas que apresentem características semelhantes aos protótipos experimentais. In this study, {{the study}} of the potential use of cement bags and long-life packaging is considered in order to add value to this waste, by manufacturing particleboards as insulating panels in poultry house facilities. For the production of this material cement bags discarded in civil works, long-life packaging discarded by consumers and two-component polyurethane resin based on castor oil base were used. The study was structured in four steps: 1) Characterization of the raw material (cement bags), 2) Effect of the density and the level of resin on the physical, mechanical and thermal properties of cement particles bag panels, 3) Evaluation of long-life packaging and varnish as a coating of selected panels in precedent step and 4) Evaluation of thermal performance of poultry prototypes in reduced and distorted scale with the long-life packaging as a coating material. The cement bags were disintegrated and transformed into particles with the 8 % of moisture content. Subsequently, these particles were mixed with bicomponent polyurethane based on castor oil resin and taken into a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> (MT 120) in order to homogenize the mixture of the particles with the resin. Panels were made for three different densities (0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 g. cm- 3) with two resin levels (12 and 15 %) and their physical, mechanical and thermal properties were evaluated. Because the panel with 0. 6 g. cm- 3 and 12 % resin have shown a better performance in the investigated properties, this combination has been selected to evaluate the performance of the material (physical, mechanical and thermal) when coated with long-life packaging, adopting the control and the varnish as a comparative coating. Among the evaluated coatings, panels with long-life packaging, presented higher performance than those coated with varnish regarding their physical, mechanical and thermal properties. Thus, the combination of 0. 6 g. cm- 3 and 12 % resin coated long-life packages were tested as lining according the thermal performance (spring, summer, autumn and winter) in prototypes and small-distorted scale by determining thermal comfort indices (Enthalpy and IAPfc) for broilers. The association of lining under the prototype reduced indoor air temperature and thermal comfort indices in spring, summer and autumn, while during the winter no effectiveness of the material was observed. Among the studied seasons, the spring and summer, proved to be the most critical time for cut birds breeding in poultry houses that have characteristics similar to experimental prototypes...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{friction}} {{materials for}} applications in disc brake systems are constituted by composite materials, specifically formulated to ensure proper friction and wear performances, under the sliding contact conditions of braking events. The bases of typical friction compound formulations usually include 10 to 30 different components bonded with a polymeric binder cross-linked in situ. Main requests {{to be fulfilled}} during braking are an adequate friction efficiency and enough mechanical resistance to withstand the torque generated by forces acting on the disc brake. Generally, each component confers distinctive properties to the mixture and their primary function can be classified in the following categories: binders confer mechanical strength to friction material guaranteeing pad compactness during use, abrasives increase friction efficiency and improve compound wear resistance, solid lubricants are responsible for stabilizing friction coefficient and contrasting the build-up effect, reinforcements increase mechanical strength improving wear minimization and stabilization. Furthermore, other modifying components such as fillers and functionalizers are involved which are {{not directly related to}} friction efficiency, e. g. cheap materials, pigments, etc. Organic brake pads for disc-brake applications are based on phenolic resin binders, generally it requires three main manufacturing steps: raw material blending, where friction compound components are mixed by blenders. Hot-molding, where blended friction mix is pressed against a metallic support at controlled high pressure (> 2 kN/cm 2), temperature (150 - 200 °C) and pressing time (3 - 10 minutes). Brake pads post-curing, to complete the hardening of polymeric binder. This last step for phenolic resin is usually performed in a batch convective oven at temperature above 150 °C for 4 - 12 h, or alternatively using a continuous process, such as IR in-line tunnel ovens where the process time is 10 - 15 min, the oven heater temperature is between 500 and 700 °C and brake pad superficial temperature is easily above 300 °C. Such kind of formulations and manufacturing process reflects the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards organic friction materials for passenger cars and light trucks. In this panorama the idea of introducing a completely inorganic binder matrix would represent nowadays an extremely appealing topic in the field considering potential improvements of this alternative approach. The complete elimination of the organic binder would reduce emission of phenol-formaldehyde hazardous derivatives generated at high-temperature e. g. volatile organic compounds, highly toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons etc… Nature and toxicity of the organic compounds released at high temperature was investigated on brake pads manufacturing and compared with preliminary studies recently published. Introducing an inorganic hydraulically bonded matrix in place of the traditional organic-based binders would lead to a substantial reduction of the total embodied energy and water of brake pads considering low-temperature manufacturing process and inorganic binders properties. Primary production embodied energy for phenolic resin is estimated in the range of 75 - 83 MJ/kg (cradle to gate), while primary production water usage (embodied water) is in the range of 94 - 282 l/kg. As a matter of comparison, examples of the embodied energy for inorganic binders typically used for concrete construction are: Portland cements 4. 9 MJ/kg, fly ash 9. 3 MJ/kg, metakaolin 1. 4 MJ/kg, silica fume 0. 036 1. 4 MJ/kg. The embodied water for these raw materials usually is less than 0. 048 l/kg. Well-known properties of such peculiar inorganic materials exploiting the hydraulic activity of binders when exposed to water or alkaline environment. The only energy demanding compound was the alkaline solution (e. g. for sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate the embodied energy is respectively of 22 MJ/kg and 16 MJ/kg). New brake pad manufacturing process allowed the substitution of commonly implied highly energy-consuming procedures with low-temperatures steps. Friction material components except binders were blended together with conventional plow-blade blender forming a dry friction-mix, then this dry friction-mix is blended with the inorganic binder and water or alkaline activators in a <b>planetary</b> <b>mixer</b> forming a wet friction-mix. Eventually wet friction mix is cold-pressed onto a metal back-plate without the need for further treatments at high temperature. It immediately emerges the energetic benefit connected to the manufacturing process of this inorganic binder-based brake pads. After brake pad production, the behavior of these inorganic materials was compared to traditional phenolic-based friction materials. Brake pads were tested on a full scale automotive brake dynamometer and on a real vehicle (in terms of performance and particle emission) following custom and international standard procedures. The aim of this work was to produce brake pad prototypes with friction material based on an inorganic hydraulic binder at performance comparable to commercial brake pads with organic-matrix based friction materials. The results obtained so far resulted particularly promising and paved the way to further developments of these novel class of friction materials. ...|$|E
