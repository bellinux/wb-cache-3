5000|$|The Kensington {{underground}} gold mine, {{owned by}} Coeur Mining, is located 45 air {{miles north of}} Juneau and 35 air miles south of Haines, located in the Berners Bay mining district. Access to the mine is by air or sea. The ore deposit consists of multiple mesothermal quartz, carbonate, and pyrite vein swarms and discrete quartz-pyrite veins hosted in Cretaceous diorite. Ore is processed in a flotation mill that produces a gold-bearing concentrate. In 2015 128865 ozt kg of gold were produced from 21,829 tons of concentrate that were shipped to an off-site refinery. The December 2015 Proven and <b>Probable</b> <b>Reserve</b> was 2.8 million tons of ore at 0.198 ounces of gold per ton (6.16 g/t) with 560000 ozt kg of contained gold {{out of a total}} identified resource, inclusive of the Proven and <b>Probable</b> <b>Reserve,</b> of 6.7 million tons at 0.263 ounces of gold per ton (8.18 g/t).

The Bolivian gas reserves are the second largest in South America after Venezuela, and exploration after the privatization of the national oil company YPFB showed that proven natural gas reserves were 600% higher than previously known.

According to the United States Department of Energy, another 10.6% is located within the department of Santa Cruz and 2.5% in the Cochabamba Department.

The price which Bolivia is paid for its natural gas is roughly US$3.25 to Brazil and $US3.18 to Argentina. Other sources state that Brazil pays between US$3.15/MMBtu and US$3.60/MMBtu (not including US$1.50/MMBtu in Petrobras extraction and transportation costs). The price of gas in the US as a whole is between US$5.85/MMBtu (May 21, 2006), US$7.90/MMBtu (April 2006) & US$6.46/MMtu (June 2006), although several years ago the price of natural gas spiked at $14 in California due to lack of pipeline capacity to and within California as well as due to electricity outages. While according to Le Monde, Brazil and Argentina pay US$2 per thousand cubic meter of gas, which costs from $12 to $15 in California.|$|E
