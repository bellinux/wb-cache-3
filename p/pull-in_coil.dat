40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} attachment {{mechanism for}} use as an end effector of a remote manipulator system. A pair of electromagnets 15 A, 15 B, each with a U-shaped magnetic core with a <b>pull-in</b> <b>coil</b> 34 and two holding coils 35, 36 are mounted by a spring suspension system 38, 47 on a base plate 25 of the mechanism housing 30 with end pole pieces 21, 22 adapted to move through openings in the base plate when the attractive force of the electromagnets is exerted on a strike plate 65 of a grapple fixture 20 affixed to a target object 14. The pole pieces are spaced by an air gap from the strike plate when the mechanism first contacts the grapple fixture. An individual control circuit and power source is provided for the <b>pull-in</b> <b>coil</b> and one holding coil of each electromagnet. A back-up control circuit connected to the two power sources and a third power source is provided for the remaining holding coils. When energized, the pull-in coils overcome the suspension system and air gap and are automatically de-energized when the pole pieces move to grapple and impose a preload force across the grapple interface. A battery back-up 89 A, 89 B is a redundant power source for each electromagnet in each individual control circuit and is automatically connected upon failure of the primary power source. A centerline mounted camera 31 and video monitor 70 are used in cooperation with a target pattern 19 on the reflective surface 67 of the strike plate to effect targeting and alignment...|$|E
40|$|A magnetically {{latching}} solenoid {{includes a}} <b>pull-in</b> <b>coil</b> and a delatching coil. Each of the coils is constructed {{with a combination}} of wire materials, including material of low temperature coefficient of resistivity to enable the solenoid to be operated at cryogenic temperatures while maintaining sufficient coil resistance. An armature is spring-based toward a first position, that may extend beyond the field of force of a permanent magnet. When voltage is temporarily applied across the pull-in magnet, the induced electromagnetic forces overcome the spring force and pulls the armature to a second position within the field of the permanent magnet, which latches the armature in the pulled-in position. Application of voltage across the delatching coil induces electromagnetic force which at least partially temporarily nullifies the field of the permanent magnet at the armature, thereby delatching the armature and allowing the spring to move the armature to the first position...|$|E
