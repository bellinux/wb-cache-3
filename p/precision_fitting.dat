40|$|Purpose: Dual tasking is {{a common}} {{practice}} in everyday life for young adults. However, the impacts of dual tasking on performance and prioritization in ecologically-valid paradigms are less well-studied. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the changes in trunk kinematics, arm kinematics, speech, and syntactic complexity in a dual task requiring standing manual <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech. ^ Methods: 15 young adult female participants participated in one experimental session in a one-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) design, with the repeated factor of condition. They were asked to complete eight conditions of the dual task and a control condition of standing and speech (no <b>precision</b> <b>fitting).</b> For the manual <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> task, participants were asked to pick up a block, reach it into a board with an opening, and then hold it in the opening for 40 seconds without hitting the sides. Difficulty was varied by reach distance (near or far), opening size of the fitting board (large or small), and with the addition of speech (with speech or without speech). Kinematic measures included: peak arm velocity, acceleration, straightness of wrist motion, wrist – trunk coordination, and wrist – center of mass coordination. Speech and language measures included the total number of pauses per second, average duration of pauses for each trial, utterance length, sound pressure level, speech rate, and syntactic complexity. ^ Results: Overall, participants were able to successfully complete a dual task of <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech without task failure. Participants generally prioritized precise completion of speech samples over accurate completion of the task. Number of pauses per second were lower for the standing and speech (no reaching) condition compared to any dual task conditions. Sound pressure level was higher for the standing and speech (no reaching) condition compared to the near distance small opening with speech condition. With the addition of speech to the task, maximum trunk velocity while reaching increased, as well as average wrist velocity and standard deviation of the wrist while holding the block in the opening. However, the addition of speech did not impact arm kinematics while reaching. With the large opening, acceleration/deceleration time and average wrist velocity increased. ^ Conclusions: In a dual task of <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech of this type, participants maintained adequate performance on both tasks. They modified kinematic arm and trunk movements to complete the fitting task with little effect on speech, suggesting that young adults can effectively modify their kinematic movements to prioritize speech without compromising performance on the fitting task. Increased pausing was noted in the dual tasks, suggesting that young adults produce shorter utterances when engaged in a dual task. It is possible that this is a result of task switching in which young adults must attend to reaching and speech alternatively as opposed to standing and talking without a dual task. Further research is required to understand the factors which impact prioritization of this dual task and others, particularly those which have different consequences associated with task failure. ...|$|E

However, little research has examined the development of the coordination between posture and manual control throughout childhood. We investigated the coordination between posture and manual control in 7 - and 10 - year-old children, and adults during a <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> task as task constraints became more difficult. Participants fit a block through an opening as arm kinematics, trunk kinematics and center of pressure data were collected. During the fitting task the precision, postural and visual constraints of the task were manipulated. Young children adopted a strategy where they first move their trunk towards the opening and then stabilize their trunk (freeze degrees of freedom) as the precision manual task is being performed. In contrast, adults and older children make compensatory trunk movements as the task is being performed. 10 -year-old children were similar to adults under the less constrained task conditions, but resembled the 7 -year-old children under the more challenging tasks. The ability to either suppress or allow postural fluctuations based on the constraints of a supra-postural task begins to develop at about ten-years-of-age.

40|$|AbstractA pulsed, {{nanosecond}} fibre laser with {{wavelength of}} 1064 nm {{was used to}} texture grade 316 stainless steel and ‘low alloy’ carbon steel in order to generate contacts with high static friction coefficients. High friction contacts have applications in reducing the tightening force required in joints or to easily secure <b>precision</b> <b>fittings,</b> particularly for larger components where standard methods are difficult and expensive. Friction tests performed at normal pressures of 100 MPa and 50 MPa have shown that very high static friction coefficients greater than 1. 25, an increase of 346 % over untextured samples at 100 MPa, can be easily achieved by single pass laser texturing of both contacting surfaces {{with the use of}} low pulse separations. The high static friction coefficients, obtained at 100 MPa normal pressure with textures with up to 62. 5 μm pulse separation (processing speed ∼ 0. 67 cm 2 /s), were found to be associated with a significant amount of plastic deformation caused by the high normal pressures. As a result, higher normal pressures were found to result in higher friction coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Close-in, massive exoplanets raise {{significant}} tides {{in their}} stellar hosts. We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal {{due to this}} fluid motion in the equilibrium tide approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted signal being 30 m/s for WASP- 18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency. If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP- 18 b {{is reported to have}} an eccentric orbit with small e= 0. 009 and pericenter longitude ω=-π/ 2. Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the tidal velocity signature of an e= 0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the reported eccentricity for WASP- 18 b is instead likely a signature of the tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that high <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.

40|$|Environmental {{effects on}} {{population}} growth are often quantified by coupling environmental covariates with population time series, using statistical models that make particular {{assumptions about the}} shape of density dependence. We hypothesized that faulty assumptions about the shape of density dependence can bias estimated effect sizes of temporally autocorrelated covariates. We investigated the presence of bias using Monte Carlo simulations based on three common per capita growth functions with distinct density dependent forms (Î¿-Ricker, Ricker and Gompertz), autocorrelated (coloured) 'known' environmental covariates and uncorrelated (white) 'unknown' noise. Faulty assumptions about the shape of density dependence, combined with overcompensatory intrinsic population dynamics, can lead to strongly biased estimated effects of coloured covariates, associated with lower confidence interval coverage. Effects of negatively autocorrelated (blue) environmental covariates are overestimated, while those of positively autocorrelated (red) covariates can be underestimated, generally to a lesser extent. Prewhitening the focal environmental covariate effectively reduces the bias, {{at the expense of}} the estimate <b>precision.</b> <b>Fitting</b> models with flexible shapes of density dependence can also reduce bias, but increases model complexity and potentially introduces other problems of parameter identifiability. Model selection is a good option if an appropriate model is included in the set of candidate models. Under the specific and identifiable circumstances with high risk of bias, we recommend prewhitening or careful modelling of the shape of density dependence.
