40|$|Cleaning is {{a classic}} example of {{mutualism}} and determining the factors that maintain the balance between the costs and benefits for mutualist partners can assist our understanding of how cleaning relationships are maintained. Optimal foraging theory suggests two factors that might help to maintain the relationship between cleaners and their clients: client ectoparasite load and cleaner hunger levels. The ecological relevance and importance of foraging by cleaner fish in marine systems has been demonstrated repeatedly, yet there is little information available on this behaviour in cleaner shrimp. To determine whether cleaner shrimp base their choice of client fish on food patch quality (i. e. client fish ectoparasite load) we offered the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c a choice of parasitized and unparasitized <b>rock</b> <b>cods,</b> Cephalopholis cyanostigma. To determine whether cleaner shrimp hunger levels influence cleaning time, we manipulated hunger levels in Urocaridella sp. c and examined their behaviour towards parasitized client fish. Cleaner shrimp preferred parasitized to unparasitized client fish and food-deprived cleaner shrimp cleaned parasitized <b>rock</b> <b>cods</b> more frequently than satiated cleaner shrimp did. Therefore, variations in client fish ectoparasite load and cleaner shrimp hunger level are two factors that affect the balance in this mutualism. Finally, our results meet some of the assumptions of biological market theory, a framework used to understand cooperative interactions, and thus this framework is suggested for future studies on this cleaning system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Habitat {{complexity}} and predator avoidance are important factors influencing {{the distribution of}} organisms. Structurally complex habitats offer refuge from predators and potential foraging areas. Artificial reefs increase habitat complexity in the aquatic environment.

In 1999 and 2000, five paired artificial reef and control transects and three additional control transects (each 80 m long) were deployed in Newman Sound, Newfoundland, Canada along the 15 m depth contour. Habitat complexity of substrate along the transects was expressed as fractal dimensions (D) measured at five resolutions (0. 035 - 3. 5 m). Densities of cunners and juvenile cod were measured on each transect during three autumn surveys in 1999 and four summer surveys in 2000 using scuba. Fractal dimensions were between D = 1. 00 and 1. 01 along unmanipulated control transects and D = 1. 16 along reef transects, indicating a significant increase in habitat complexity due to the artificial reefs. During the day, most cunners (159 of 242) and juvenile cod (25 of 29) were observed on reef transects in close association with artificial reefs.

50|$|Fish {{account for}} about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to 10 inches in length, {{including}} minnows, suckers, gizzard shad, <b>rock</b> <b>cod,</b> alewife, northern pike, whitefish, sauger, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, burbot, walleye, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, rainbow smelt, and killifish. Young loons typically eat small minnows, and sometimes insects and fragments of green vegetation. Freshwater diets primarily consist of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; saltwater diets primarily consist of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or an inability to catch fish, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, mollusks, frogs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. It has also been known to forage on ducklings.|$|R
