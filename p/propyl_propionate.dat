50|$|Propyl {{propanoate}} (<b>propyl</b> <b>propionate)</b> is an ester {{formed from}} the esterification of propanol and propanoic acid. It has the molecular formula C6H12O2. Like most esters, propyl propanoate has a distinctly fruity odor {{which may be}} described as a chemically tinged pineapple. It is used in perfumery and as a solvent. The refractive index at 20 °C is 1.393.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the recovery of aroma compounds from aqueous solutions by pervaporation using poly(ether-block-amide) (PEBA) membranes. Three model aroma compounds (i. e., <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> C 6 -aldehyde and benzaldehyde) {{were used in the}} study to represent ester, aldehyde and aromatic aroma compounds, respectively. The effects of process conditions (i. e., feed concentration and operating temperature) on the pervaporation performance (in terms of permeation flux and selectivity) for aroma-water separations were investigated. It was found that both the aroma permeation flux and the selectivity were affected significantly by the feed aroma concentration. The aroma permeability was in the order of <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate</b> > C 6 -aldehyde > benzaldehyde, and the membrane selectivity for aroma/water separation followed the order of C 6 -aldehyde > <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate</b> > benzaldehyde. In general, the aroma flux was found to be proportional to the aroma compound concentration in the solution. In the concentration range (390 - 3, 200 ppm) tested, the effect of temperature on the permeation flux followed an Arrhenius type of relation. The solubility and diffusivity of the aroma compounds in PEBA membrane, which determine their permeabilities through the membrane, were determined from the pervaporation and sorption/desorption data. It was shown that the solubility of the aroma compounds in the PEBA membrane generally followed the Henry’s law where the sorption uptake was proportional to the feed aroma concentration. Among the three aroma compounds studied, benzaldehyde was found to have the highest solubility selectivity in the PEBA membrane, followed by C 6 -aldehyde and <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate.</b> The solubilities of pure <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and water in PEBA membrane were also estimated; the solubility of pure <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate</b> was around 130 times higher than that of pure water. This confirmed that PEBA was an excellent organophilic membrane. The diffusivity of the aroma compounds through PEBA membrane was affected by the feed aroma concentration. From steady state pervaporation and equilibrium sorption data, the diffusivity was calculated on the basis of solution-diffusion model, and the diffusivity was shown to be linearly dependent on the feed aroma concentration. On the other hand, from the sorption kinetics data obtained from the time-dependent sorption experiments, the diffusivity was shown to be affected by the feed aroma concentration exponentially. The main reason may be that the simple form of the solution-diffusion model is unable to precisely describe the mass transport through the membrane during pervaporation. As an alternative to pervaporation where the liquid feed is in contact with the membrane and the mass transport involves permeation and evaporation (thus the word “pervaporation”), evaporation-permeation (or evapermeation, where the feed liquid is not in direct contact with the membrane and the mass transfer involves evaporation and then permeation) was also studied for aroma compound separation from water. It was shown that evapermeation was no better than pervaporation in terms of permeation flux and selectivity. This again demonstrated that the state of the membrane and the location for liquid-vapor phase change were important to the mass transport through the membrane. For aroma recovery from dilute aqueous solutions, batch pervaporation is often preferred. Batch pervaporation coupled with permeate decantation and water phase recycle was studied parametrically. It was demonstrated that compared to the conventional pervaporation, the aroma recovery can be enhanced by recycling the water phase from the permeate decanter to the feed for further recovery. In addition, unlike the conventional batch operation where the product concentration starts to decrease beyond certain time, the modified batch pervaporation allows a longer period of operation without compromising the product purity...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{validated}} method using {{a thermal}} desorber {{combined with a}} gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment {{during a period of}} 6 months. 452 compounds were identified. Among them a human specific marker was sought using principle component analysis. We found a combination of 8 compounds (ethyl propionate, <b>propyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, pyridine, diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio) ethyl disulfide and 3 -methylthio- 1 -propanol) that led to the distinction of human and pig remains from other animal remains. Furthermore, it was possible to separate the pig remains from human remains based on 5 esters (3 -methylbutyl pentanoate, 3 -methylbutyl 3 -methylbutyrate, 3 -methylbutyl 2 -methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate). Further research in the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and search for one or more human specific markers. These markers would allow a more efficiently training of cadaver dogs or portable detection devices could be developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of 51 volatile compounds, among alcohols and esters in Brazilian sugar-cane spirit (cachaça), were investigated by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC). The following alcohols and esters {{were identified and}} quantified: methanol, 1, 4 -butanodiol, 2 -phenylethyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cynamic alcohol, n-decanol, geraniol, isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, menthol, n-butanol, n-dodecanol, n-propanol, n-tetradecanol, amyl propionate, ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, ethyl heptanoate, isoamyl valerate, methyl <b>propionate,</b> <b>propyl</b> butyrate. The average higher alcohols content (262 mg/ 100 mL in anhydrous alcohol a. a.) and total esters content (24 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) in cachaças, are smaller than in other spirits. The average methanol content in cachaças (6 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) {{is the same as}} in rum, but smaller than in wine spirit. No qualitative differences of chemical profile among cachaças have been observed...|$|R
