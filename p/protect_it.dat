5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|After {{scientists}} {{opened a}} portal to the Shadowlands, players found the Source, killing the guardian the Xan had left there to <b>protect</b> <b>it.</b> This prompted an alien race {{known as the}} Kyr'ozch to begin attacking Rubi-Ka.

5|$|All of the castellations {{around and}} near the bridge were built to <b>protect</b> <b>it,</b> {{including}} Cromwell's Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower.

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) – {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon-based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, the Al Khalifas {{used the}} same tactic when the British tried to {{overpower}} Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and Ottomans, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually the Government of British India overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to <b>protect</b> <b>it.</b> Colonel Pelly signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.|$|E

5|$|In 1999 a local {{maritime}} historian, Paul Barnett, commenced a privately-funded {{research project}} which saw the site's 86 vessels recorded and recognised {{as the largest}} ships' graveyard in mainland Britain.

The Sacristy used to house Juan Diego's cloak, upon which the Virgin's image purportedly appears, but after massive flooding in 1629, it {{was removed from the}} Sacristy to better <b>protect</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Porporela {{was built}} in 1873, next to St. John Fortress. The Kase jetty (Kaše Breakwater) {{was built in}} 1485, {{according}} {{to the design of}} Paskoje Miličević, in order to defend the harbour and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from south-eastern winds and waves. The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without binder.|$|E

5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed with {{powerful}} magical symbols to <b>protect</b> <b>it.</b> Before he died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} defuse the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would wipe out the human race.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age.

40|$|Voltammetry {{provides}} quick {{information about}} {{the evolution of the}} iron electrodes subjected to different chemical treatments. Temporarily the dichromate <b>protects</b> <b>it</b> in acid medium whereas the protective action of the diprotonated phenformine is more persistent and efective, as it is observed through Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). Cr (VI) passivates iron in potassium chloride medium and phenformine complexes Fe (II) forming a surface film that <b>protects</b> <b>it</b> from corrosion. The chromate forms the surface film in basic medium. This film makes it impossible to detect by voltammetry the peaks of the Fe (II) + 2 e ↔ Fe (O) system. The phenformine, in basic form, forms insoluble white complexes that settles on the electrode surface <b>protecting</b> <b>it</b> from electrochemical oxidation...|$|R

5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land {{to increase the}} estate and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear {{to indicate that the}} danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
