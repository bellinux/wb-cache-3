5|$|For the album's {{striking}} front-cover image, Wilkes used a Kirlian {{photograph of}} Harrison's hand holding a Hindu medallion. The <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken at UCLA's parapsychology department, {{as was the}} shot used on the back cover, where Harrison instead holds three US coins: a couple of quarters and a silver dollar.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until the <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a photographic plate, at a focal length of 85mm.|$|E
5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that {{the dress was}} white and gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E

50|$|A builder's photo, {{also called}} an {{official}} <b>photo,</b> <b>is</b> {{a specific type}} of photograph that is typically made by rail transport rolling stock manufacturers to show a vehicle that has been newly built or rebuilt. The builder's <b>photo</b> <b>is</b> meant to show an overview of the basic exterior form of a unit of rolling stock. Photographs made by railfans that show similar features to builder's <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> sometimes informally referred to as roster shots. Builder's <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> also made by some automobile manufacturers to show a representative sample of new models they produced.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, two Muslim {{reporters from}} Al-Islam, a small Malaysian magazine, {{participated in a}} Catholic Mass and {{received}} Holy Communion, which they then spat out and photographed. The resulting <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> then published in their May 2009 edition. The magazine, {{which is owned by}} Utusan Karya, part of the Utusan Malaysia Group, sent its reporters including one Muhd Ridwan Abdul Jalil, to two churches in the Klang Valley, as part of a special investigative report. The act of desecration occurred at St Anthony's Church in Jalan Robertson, Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{made the}} door of Jäger-Passage at Wohlwillstrasse 22 famous when he posed {{in front of it}} for a photo which was later used on the covers of the Rock 'n' Roll and Rock 'n' Roll Sessions albums. The <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken by Jürgen Vollmer, during the time The Beatles were playing at the Top Ten club.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
50|$|Winkler's <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> {{featured}} in numerous calendars. Other <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> published in articles for 46er Magazine, Adirondack Life and Adirondac Magazine. He wrote some articles for magazines as well.|$|R
50|$|Matted albums are albums with {{recessed}} frames, {{in which}} each <b>photo</b> <b>is</b> hand-mounted. The <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> digitally or traditionally printed and can also be changed also after completion of the album.|$|R
5000|$|Pre-war <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> {{taken on}} 5" [...] x 4" [...] glass plates, whilst post-war, similar sized roll film was used. This large {{negative}} format meant {{the majority of}} <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> very sharp and detailed.|$|R
5|$|After {{the final}} <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Leave Home is {{the second}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001. Songs on the album were written immediately after the band's first album's writing process, which demonstrated the band's progression. The album had a higher production value than their debut Ramones and featured faster tempos. The front <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken by Moshe Brakha and the back cover, which would become the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting. It was also promoted with several tour dates in the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many early {{reports of}} the riots, {{starting}} with one from Reuters, used a picture purporting to show the previous day's riots. The photo, showing large number of People's Armed Police squares, was one taken of the 2009 Shishou riot and originally published on 26 June by Southern Metropolis Weekly. The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later. In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 July, WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer used the same Shishou photograph to defend the Uyghurs in Ürümqi. A World Uyghur Congress representative later apologised, explaining that the <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> chosen out of hundreds for its image quality.|$|E
50|$|The McMinnville UFO {{photographs}} were {{taken on a}} farm near McMinnville, Oregon, United States, in 1950. The <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> reprinted in Life magazine and in newspapers across the nation, and are often considered {{to be among the}} most famous ever taken of a UFO. Most UFO skeptics have concluded that the <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> a hoax, but many ufologists continue to argue that the <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> genuine, and show an unidentified object in the sky.|$|R

5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to Washing Machine. Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear {{as if they had been}} taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an analysis}} performed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) of photographs showing {{the interior of}} a single shell tank (SST) at the Hanford site. This report shows that in-tank <b>photos</b> can <b>be</b> used to create a plan-view map of the waste surface inside a tank, and that measuring the elevation of the waste surface from the <b>photos</b> <b>is</b> possible, but not accurate enough to be useful at this time. In-tank <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> acquired for Tanks BX 111 and T 111. The BX 111 <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> used to create the waste surface map and to measure the waste surface elevation. T 111 <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> used to measure the waste surface elevation. Uncertainty analyses of the mapping and surface elevation are included to show the accuracy of the calculations for both methods...|$|R
50|$|Thirty years later, in 2013, the {{resulting}} <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> {{published in a}} coffee table book, Madonna NYC 83. In November 2013, the <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> exhibited {{for the first time}} at Milk Gallery in Manhattan, and then at LabArtGalleryLA in Los Angeles, California, in 2014. The <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> also on display in Madonna: A Transformational Exhibition, a traveling global multimedia tour sponsored by the W Hotel.
