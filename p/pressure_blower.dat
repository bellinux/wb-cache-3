40|$|Fans can {{be thought}} of as low {{pressure}} air pumps that utilize power from a motor to output a volumetric flow of air at a given pressure. A propeller converts torque from the motor to increase static pressure across the fan rotor and to increase the kinetic energy of the air particles. The motors are typically permanent split capacitor AC induction motors or brushless DC motors. We shall now look at this system in more detail. Types of Fans and Blowers Air moving devices are generally described as being either a type of fan (Fig. 1 a) or a centrifugal blower (Fig. 1 b). The main difference between fans and blowers is in their flow and pressure characteristics. Fans deliver air in an overall direction that is parallel to the fan blade axis and can be designed to deliver a high flow rate, but tend to work against low <b>pressure.</b> <b>Blowers</b> tend to deliver air in a direction that is perpendicular to the blower axis at a relatively low flow rate, but against high pressure. There are several types of fans, some of the most common being propeller, tube axial and vane axial styles. Propeller fans are the simplest type of fan, consisting of only a motor and propeller. One problem with propeller fans is that tip vortices are produced by the pressure differential across the airfoil section.

When run against a flat carbon face, laboratory tests show that the wavy seal operates in a non-contacting mode in a gas environment at pressures from zero to 600 psig. Higher gas pressures are achievable but have not been tested yet. Typical face temperature rise is two to six degrees Fahrenheit despite seal size or pressure for speeds from 200 to 3600 rpm. Gas leak rates are one fourth to one half that reported for other noncontacting seals based on grooved face technology at the same operating conditions. Tested gas environments ranged from air and nitrogen to low pressure propane. Testing was done in liquids that included high pressure liquid propane, water, synthetic oil, and crude oil. On high pressure liquid applications, the wavy face seal shows excellent containment of the product. Lab testing shows that the seal successfully contains the sudden introduction of 300 psi liquid propane. The wavy feature is bidirectional and {{is less likely to}} clog than other types of liftoff seal designs that employ some form of grooves in the face. Also, because of the smooth wavy shape, the seal can withstand contact without damage to the carbon face. In all test modes there is insignificant face wear. The wavy seal is employed as a safety backup to primary seals operating in flashing or nonflashing hydrocarbons. The wavy secondary seal should have a longer life than the primary seal and will prevent excessive leakage to the environment if the primary seal fails. The wavy seal can also be employed as a primary seal in low <b>pressure</b> <b>blowers</b> and as a dual seal with nitrogen or air barrier fluid at a higher pressure than the process. This ensures zero leakage of the product to the environment. Over 60 seals are in the field in a variety of applications...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The objectives of this research were to develop engineering descriptions of dust control systems currently being used in grain export facilities, to determine the retrofit requirements of the dust control and handling systems to comply with disallowed R/R, and to estimate the equipment, operation, and maintenance costs that would be incurred by the industry as a result of complying with disallowed R/R. Data were collected from seven terminal export elevators, a questionnaire was sent to all 63 export elevators, and manufacturers data for dust control equipment were collected. There were three basic types of dust control systems. Two systems were R/R which either recombined the dust upstream from the pick-up points, or reintroduced the captured dust downstream. The third system, a bin dust system, employed dust motivators (high <b>pressure</b> <b>blowers)</b> to convey the captured dust from the filters to dust storage tanks. Data from the seven elevators revealed that electrical energy costs to operate dust systems ranged from $ 82. 3 to $ 238 per 1000 m 3 ($ 2. 89 to $ 8. 34 per 1000 bu). Also, elevators handling lower volumes of grain per year would pay more for electrical energy per unit volume than those handling larger quantities of grain. Electrical energy costs were higher for elevators with larger percentages of bin dust systems. It was determined, from data from the seven elevators and the questionnaire, that a facility would collect 1. 6 kg of dust per I 000 kg (3. 2 lb per ton) of grain if all captured dust were collected to storage bins. It was estimated that the industry would spend $ 29 million to retrofit and $ 35. 8 million annually to comply with disallowed R/R. Also, elevators handling less then 1. 76 x 106 MI (SOx 106 bu) would pay as much as 13 times more per volume of grain handled in capital costs and 2 times more in annual expenditures than larger, higher volume elevators. Based on a total export volume of 168 million cubic meters (4. 8 x 109 bu) per year, the grain export industry would spend 17 cents per m 3 (0. 6 cents/bu) to retrofit facilities and approximately 23 cents per m 3 (0. 8 cents/bu) annually...|$|R

Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the <b>pressure</b> shock.

40|$|We have {{recently}} proposed a new general concept of macroscopic quantum-type experiment. It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid by {{the application of}} a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary configuration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution. In this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a macroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during the experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The experiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity waves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height, with particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave function with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and the velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is therefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We suggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i) by the action of a force on the surface (wind, <b>blower,</b> <b>pressure,</b> field, etc [...] .); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground profile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum force is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with a macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy. These results may also be relevant to the study of freak waves, which have already been described by nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Blowers {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static <b>pressure</b> across the <b>blower.</b> This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|R

The current gas quenching technologies are adapted to heat treatable metals found in the automotive industry, requesting a minimum heat exchange ratio, also depending on the part geometry. Little has been however investigated concerning the quenched batch, defined as the arrangement of the heated parts onto a single- or multiple-layer charge carrier. The present work, through a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, provides guidelines to adapt the batch to a specific gas flow pattern (spatial fitting), and to adapt the gas flow pattern to the batch structure (temporal fitting). Measurement techniques have been developed to assess the flow patterns inside industrial quenching chambers. Evaluated flow structures have been converted to numerical boundary conditions for extended simulations tools. Simulations have helped implementing technical solutions for flow correction in industrial gas quenching chambers. Furthermore, simulations have served the design of batches of various geometries, to improve both quenching homogeneity and intensity. Both experimental and numerical results confirmed the advantages of gas quenching for the homogeneous heat treatment of automotive steel grades, and demonstrated the potential of various flow correcting devices, such as perforated plates and cylindrical flow ducts. Heat treatment gas and spray quenching has also been integrated into the forging and the turning process chains of single components, successfully optimizing the lean process flow (automation, quality, and time), for various high-performance materials and part geometries...|$|R
50|$|To {{assemble}} the ZMC-2 a skin-riveting machine {{was developed by}} the Aviation Tool Co., a division of the Detroit Aircraft Corporation. The device was invented by Edward J. Hill, who had come to work on the ZMC-2 after leaving the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The machine consisted of an aluminum casting, weighing about 100 pounds, and was supported on springs from a framework that ran on concentric circular rails set into the floor of the hangar. There were two sets of circular rails, one {{at each end of the}} building. Three riveting machines were made, one for each set of tracks, and one for reserve when repairs might be needed. The reason for two sets of tracks was that the hull was built in two sections, front and rear. Each end started from a circular plate suspended from the hangar roof by a cable and free to rotate as each 18 inch wide strip Alclad was added. In this manner, each end of the ship slowly grew as succeeding rows were added, looking like a bulls eye at first and later like a huge inverted teacup. Both sections were under construction continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, once the hull was started. The riveting machine fed three small aluminum wires from large spools to make a seam about a quarter inch wide composed of three rivets, one above the other in a staggered pattern. In theory the machine could sew about 50 feet of seam in an hour, but in practice about 10 or more feet was the average. The sheets of Alclad used were eight to nine thousandths of an inch thick. As the each section of the hull grew internal annular rings were added at appropriate distances to give stiffness and reinforcement to the hull skin. In addition, lightweight longitudinal channels were added between the circular rings, giving the internal structure the appearance of a huge bird cage. The helium gas was contained by the hull only, no fabric was used to contain the helium. Inside the hull were two large airbag cells, called ballonets, made of rubberized fabric and containing air. These cells could be expanded or contracted to control pressure as the helium expanded or contracted with the heating or cooling of the atmosphere or to adapt to changes of atmospheric pressure with altitude, and to control fore and aft trim. In operation the ZMC-2 was susceptible to heating and cooling effects of the sun causing it to pop and buckle in the evenings if <b>pressure</b> from <b>blowers</b> was not applied. During its service life the ZMC-2 was found to have a gas diffusion rate much lower than that of fabric-hulled blimps, meaning that a much longer time would pass before additional helium needed to be added.|$|R
40|$|Every year, twenty-two {{million workers}} {{are exposed to}} {{potentially}} damaging noise at work. Last year, U. S. businesses paid more than 1. 5 million in penalties for not protecting workers from noise. (OSHA, 2016). In the United States ten million people {{have some kind of}} noise related hearing loss (CDC, 2016) and noise damage to the ear may not be detected until it is great enough to cause hearing impairment. Grounds keeper’s functions consist of a variety of activities that require the use of powered tools such as mowers, riding mowers, leaf <b>blowers,</b> <b>pressure</b> washers, trimmers/edgers and chainsaws. OSHA has stated that “noise is a potential hazard for most jobs that involve abrasive or high-power machinery, impact of rapidly moving parts (product or machinery), or power tools”. (OSHA, 2016) in addition to this, their job is mostly outdoors exposing them to the added noise of traffic, construction and people. The purpose of this research study was to obtain occupational noise exposure data for groundskeepers who use powered equipment to do their job. The groundskeepers who participated in this research study were volunteers and worked in a University campus in the State of Florida. Personal noise dosimeters were used to collect the data in this study. Exposure information was collected over 6 days for 8 -hour work shifts during the summer months of the year. Dosimetry was done on a maximum of five groundskeepers per monitoring day, ranging from 1 to 5 employees per day depending on availability. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the highest noise exposures occurred on groundskeepers in charge of mowing by means of a riding mower. Results of this study indicate that the highest 8 -hr TWA noise exposure for the groundskeepers (GK) 1 and 2 occurred the first day of testing which was a Monday. Using the OSHA PEL measurement method GK 1 exposure was 98. 5 dBA, GK 2 was 97. 6 dBA. Using the same measurement method the highest exposure to GK 3 : 89. 2 dBA, occurred on day five of the assessment. For GK 4 the highest exposure occurred on the third day of testing with an exposure measurement of 86. 1 dBA. GK 5 was only assessed one day and his exposure measured at 84. 5 dBA. GK 6 AND GK 7 were evaluated two days and their highest exposures measured at GK 6 : 89. 3 dBA and GK 7 : 85. 7 dBA. Using the OSHA Hearing Conversation Act measurement method, GK 1 was exposed to excessive noise levels (3 ̆e 85 dBA as an 8 -hr TWA) on five days of the six day assessment period. GK 2 was exposed to hazardous noise levels on all four days he was assessed. GK 3 and GK 4 exceeded the OSHA HCA standard one of the two days they were monitored. GK 5 did not have noise exposure levels above 85 dBA on the day he volunteered for monitoring. GK 6 had exposures over 85 dBA on both days he volunteered to be monitored. Finally, GK 7 exceeded the 85 dBA limit on one of the two days they volunteered for this study...|$|R
