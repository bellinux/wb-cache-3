Cooligomerization of unsaturated products present in C 9 fraction was initiated by 2, 2 ’-azo-bis-(5 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpentanonitrile). The amount of the initiator was 0. 50 – 15. 0 mass % relative to raw material. The influence of temperature, process time and the initiator amount on yield and main characteristics of PRHs was examined.

Sugarcane trash undergoes a fast pyrolysis process in PPR- 200 pilot plant to produce Unicamp (Brazil) bio-oil. The process of separation of carboxylic acids from bio-oil, the production of esters of these acids, the process of mixing these esters with gasoline as well as the results of using this mixture in an Otto engine capacity 4 kW - component of a 2 kW and generator - are described. Test tests determined that it is possible to mix up to 14 vol. % In Bioflex with type C gasoline used in Brazil.

30|$|In most {{ethylene}} plants, the caustic sections {{suffer from}} red-oils formation which {{results from the}} polyaldol condensation of some oxygenate species in basic media. These red-oils lead to solid material deposition which is generically referred to as fouling and which can cause severe energy losses or operational issues. This specific red-oil fouling can be successfully mitigated by regularly washing the caustic scrubber with a hydrocarbon washing stream which acts as a solvent. However, such washing streams can be further rerouted to the quench water system, increasing the risk of emulsion formation due to its amphiphilic components, i.e., red-oils, compromising the safe operation of the whole plant. The complexity of red-oil structures renders its analysis and characterization challenging. Consequently, {{there has been no}} study showing the effect of the type of hydrocarbon wash on the red-oils structure and its potential emulsifying properties. This study describes an in-house developed analytical technique based on UPLC-High resolution QTOF which allows characterizing hydrocarbon streams with complex mixtures of oxygenated species. This method has been successfully applied to monitor red-oil structures during a plant trial where <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>Gasoline</b> and Toluene-Xylene hydrocarbon washes were successively applied. The data revealed that reactive compounds from the <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>Gasoline</b> react with the polyaldol species, likely through a Diels–Alder mechanism, thus increasing the diene adduct concentration in the red-oil. It was further found that toluene-xylene washes hindered the emulsifying properties of the red-oils more effectively than <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>Gasoline</b> washes, in that they could best inhibit the formation of polyaldols adducts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There was a {{high rate}} of {{corrosion}} in <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>Gasoline</b> Hydrogenation (PGH) unit of Arak Petrochemical Company (ARPC), and it caused some operational problem in this plant. A commercial chemical had been used as anti-corrosion in the depentanizer column overhead in order to control the corrosion rate. Injection of commercial corrosion inhibitor caused some operational problems such as fouling in some heat exchangers. It was proposed to replace this commercial material with another more effective trouble free, and well-known additive by R&D and operation specialists. At first, the system was simulated by commercial simulation software in electrolytic system to specify low pH points inside the plant. After a very comprehensive study of the situation and technical investigations,ammonia / monoethanol amine solution was proposed as neutralizer or corrosion inhibitor to be injected in a suitable point of the plant. For this purpose, the depentanizer column and its accessories system was simulated again in case of this solution injection. According to the simulation results, injection of new anticorrosion substance has no any side effect on C 5 cut product and operating conditions of the column. The corrosion rate will be cotrolled, if the pH remains at the range of 6. 5 to 8. Aactual plant test run was also carried out by injection of ammonia / monoethanol amine solution at the rate of 0. 6 Kg/hr and the results of iron content of water samples and corrosion test coupons confirmed the simulation results. Now, ammonia / monoethanol amine solution is injected to a suitable pint inside the plant and corrosion rate has decreased significantly.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of olefinic plants, various environmental pollutants exist such as NOx, CO 2, Tar Water, and most importantly Spent Caustic. In this paper, instead of investigating ways of treating this pollutant, we evaluated the production in relation to plant’s variable items. We primarily discussed the factors affecting the quality of the output spent caustic such as impurities in the feed of olefin plant, the amount of injected dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in furnaces, variation in feed composition, differences among gas temperatures and the concentration of caustic solution {{at the bottom of the}} tower. The results of the laboratory proved that in the formation of Red Oil, 1, 3 butadiene and acetaldehyde followed free radical and aldol condensation mechanism respectively. By increasing the injection rate of DMDS, Mercaptide amount increases in the effluent. In addition, <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>gasoline</b> accumulation is directly related to caustic concentration in the tower.

In addition, the catalysts were characterized by variety of techniques (XRD, N 2 adsorption-desorption, TPD-H 2, TPD-NH 3, CO chemisorption, TPR, XPS, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, TGA-DTA). It was found that the monometallic Ni/ASA catalyst with 24 wt. % of Ni was the most active among the catalysts studied in both benzene hydrogenation (+S) and hydroconversion of PyGas. The data of catalyst characterization suggests that the concentration of both metal and acid sites govern catalytic activity in both activity tests being the catalyst ability for hydrogen adsorption {{one of the most important}} factors to be taken into account. In general, it was found that the S-poisoning of the catalysts increased with an increase of the catalyst reactivity and diminished when "refractory-type" coke deposited on the metal sites inhibited the S-compound adsorption.

30|$|Two common {{methods can}} be used to {{mitigate}} red-oil from formation and accumulation: (1) carbonyl traps to reduce the rate of aldol formation [2]; and (2) aromatic solvent washes [1, 4]. Carbonyl traps are often effective in reducing the rate of aldol condensation and in removing aldols through the caustic purges, but they do not suppress the Diels–Alder type oligomerization mechanism. Additional use of dispersants on top of the carbonyl trapping agent (and even a radical scavenger) are thus often proposed by chemical vendors to cover all possible mechanisms, leading to costly treatments [9]. Within our company, the “aromatic solvent washes” option proved to be a very efficient and cheap alternative and was achieved by rerouting a plant stream containing high amounts of aromatic compounds with low unsaturated hydrocarbons content (e.g., a Toluene–Xylene cut: “TX-cut”). This aromatic wash acts as a solvent, which efficiently displaces the oligomeric red-oils from the water phase into the aromatic phase avoiding their further oligomerization and precipitation. Since aromatic solvents are often of commercial value in the industry, a cheaper gasoline stream, i.e. <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>gasoline</b> (PyGas) from the quench water tower (QWT) of the plant, was used instead. This stream contains a high amount of reactive compounds (about of 7  % of indene, styrene, cyclopentadiene,…), which might have the potential of enhancing the mass of red-oil type of fouling through pathways A or C shown in Fig.  1.|$|E
