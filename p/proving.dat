5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma <b>Proving</b> Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma <b>Proving</b> Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{historical}} conjectures {{were finally}} <b>proven.</b> In 1976, Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel used {{a computer to}} <b>prove</b> the four color theorem. Andrew Wiles, building {{on the work of}} others, <b>proved</b> Fermat's Last Theorem in 1995. Paul Cohen and Kurt Gödel <b>proved</b> that the continuum hypothesis is independent of (could neither be <b>proved</b> nor disproved from) the standard axioms of set theory. In 1998 Thomas Callister Hales <b>proved</b> the Kepler conjecture.|$|R
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of <b>proving</b> a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby <b>proving</b> the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores.

In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
