50|$|Parentheses {{can be used}} in the expressions, {{but only}} to {{override}} the default operator precedence, for example, in 1024 = (4 − 2)10. Allowing <b>parentheses</b> without <b>operators</b> would result in trivial Friedman numbers such as 24 = (24). Leading zeros cannot be used, since that would also result in trivial Friedman numbers, such as 001729 = 1700 + 29.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{approach}} is to first fully parenthesize the expression, inserting a number of <b>parentheses</b> around each <b>operator,</b> such that they lead to the correct precedence even when parsed with a linear, left-to-right parser. This algorithm {{was used in the}} early FORTRAN I compiler: ...|$|R
5000|$|Predicates can be {{enclosed}} in parentheses if desired. The keywords [...] and [...] {{can be used}} to combine two predicates into a new one. If multiple combinations are applied, parentheses {{can be used to}} group combinations to indicate the order of evaluation.

50|$|Böhm's work {{described}} the first complete meta-circular compiler. The code for the compiler was remarkably precise, {{and consisted of}} only 114 lines of code. Since the language accepted only two kinds of expressions: fully parenthesized or without <b>parenthesis,</b> but with <b>operator</b> precedence, therefore the code of the compiler split into two parts. 59 lines were used to handle formulas with parenthesis, 51 to handle operator precedence expressions and 4 to decide between those two cases.|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{definition of}} the grammatical inference problem {{is to find a}} grammar for a language, given a finite sample from that language. We discuss a solution to the closely related problem of developing a program which can be taught a language. The method is highly interactive and attempts to make maximum use of negative information. It has proved to be efficacious on context-free languages such as the one of expressions over the alphabet of letters, digits, <b>parentheses,</b> and arithmetic <b>operators.</b> We believe it is capable of handling problems of the order of typical programming languages...|$|R
