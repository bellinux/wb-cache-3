40|$|Food {{security}} includes {{elements of}} food availability, access and use. In the complex {{system that is}} our global food system, many variables influence an individual’s ability to achieve food security, but given that many people access food through economic markets food <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> come to be a vital component of food security. Food prices are influenced by many factors, but among these are fuel prices. For the last decade trends in food <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> tracked those of fuel prices consistently, and just as fuel <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> generally increased since 2005 food <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> done the same. Rising and increasingly volatile food <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> hampered the access to food {{for millions of people}} worldwide, and led to food riots and social unrest the world over. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|The {{events leading}} up to the 72% {{increase}} in customer's rates has been referred to by BGE executives, state commissioners, and state legislators as [...] "the perfect storm". In the years since rates were capped, fuel <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen dramatically. Natural gas <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen about 125%, regular gasoline <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen over 150%, and heating oil <b>prices</b> <b>had</b> risen almost 200%. Maryland region’s fuel prices are tied greatly to natural gas prices. Subsequently, when Hurricane Katrina and Rita caused major natural gas pipelines to shut down for a short period, natural gas prices skyrocketed. Therefore, when BGE went to the market to procure power, prices for power were abnormally high.|$|R

5|$|NBC used several {{forms of}} {{advertising}} {{to promote the}} series, airing several promos on sister channels like E! and Bravo. There were also several ads for the series during Super Bowl XLVI, which aired on NBC. Due to the already positive buzz surrounding the show, NBC offered early viewings of the pilot on different platforms. For example, from January 15 through January 30, 2012, it was screened on select flights of American Airlines. Also, from January 23 to February 6, 2012, it was also streamed online at NBC.com and hulu.

In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Rudi's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> hoaxed the photograph. SPR member Anita Gregory suggested that <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Rudi's reputation. However, a photographic expert testified that the photograph was genuine. SPR member John L. Randall reviewed the Price and Schneider case and came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine, <b>Price</b> <b>had</b> caught Rudi in fraud.|$|R
5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising <b>price</b> <b>has</b> led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its <b>price</b> <b>has</b> steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast dairy farming increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period, overtaking wool exports {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
