40|$|O experimento foi realizado em área de pequeno produtor fornecedor da Maguari (Kraft Foods do Brasil) em Araguari - MG, e teve por objetivo avaliar o desenvolvimento de maracujazeiro-amarelo propagado por enxertia hipocotiledonar, sobre cinco porta-enxertos de <b>passifloráceas</b> nativas. Os tratamentos utilizados foram cinco porta-enxertos: P. edulis f. flavicarpa, P. caerulea, P. alata, P. gibertii e P. cincinnata, e o maracujazeiro-amarelo de pé-franco como controle, totalizando seis tratamentos. Para todos os tratamentos, a variedade-copa utilizada foi o maracujazeiro-amarelo Cv. FB 200. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso, com três repetições. A parcela foi constituída de uma fileira de 20 metros de comprimento contendo quatro plantas. A condução foi realizada conforme os tratos culturais recomendados para a cultura. As características avaliadas foram: altura das plantas, número de folhas, diâmetro da região da enxertia, diâmetro do enxerto, diâmetro do porta-enxerto, relação enxerto/porta-enxerto. As plantas de P. edulis f. flavicarpa, P. caerulea e pé-franco apresentaram melhor desenvolvimento. Já as plantas sobre o porta-enxerto P. alata não desenvolveram bem. Embora as plantas de pé-franco tenham superado numericamente o desenvolvimento das enxertadas sobre P. cincinnata e P. gibertii, não houve diferenças significativas entre eles. O porta-enxerto P. alata influenciou negativamente na altura das plantas, número de folhas, diâmetro da região da enxertia, diâmetro do enxerto, diâmetro do porta-enxerto e na relação enxerto/porta-enxerto. The {{experiment was}} carried out in an area of a small producer supplier of Maguari (Kraft Foods of Brazil) in Araguari-MG, and aimed to assess the development of yellow passion fruit plant grafted on five rootstocks of native <b>passifloraceas</b> using the hypocotyledonary grafting method. The treatments used as rootstocks were P. edulis f. flavicarpa, P. caerulea, P. alata, P. gibertii and P. cincinnata. The yellow passion fruit non-grafted seedlings were used as control, completing six treatments. For all treatments, the yellow passion plant FB 200 was used as canopy crown variety. It was used the experimental design randomized blocks with three repetitions. The plot was formed by a line of 20 meters long containing four plants. The passion fruit planting was done according to cultural treatments recommended for this culture. The characteristics evaluated were plant height, number of leaves, diameter of the region of grafting, the scion diameter, diameter of the rootstock, relation between scion and rootstock. The plants of P. edulis f. flavicarpa, P. caerulea and the non-grafted seedlings showed better development. Plants of the rootstock P. alata had the worst development. Although the non-grafted seedlings have exceeded the development of grafted with P. cincinnata e P. gibertii, they did not differ significantly from them, and the rootstock P. alata negatively influenced on the plant height, number of leaves, diameter of the region of grafting, the graft diameter, diameter of the rootstock, relation between scion and rootstock...|$|R
40|$|Na Universidade Estadual Paulista, Câmpus de Jaboticabal-SP, estudou-se o comportamento de <b>Passifloráceas</b> quanto à morte prematura de plantas, cultivadas em local com histórico da doença. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o comportamento de diversos "acessos" de populações e espécies de maracujazeiros em relação a esta doença, sendo que as plantas resistentes deverão ser utilizadas como porta-enxertos de formas comerciais de maracujá-amarelo (Passiflora edulis Sims f. flavicarpa) e em programas de melhoramento genético. As espécies utilizadas foram P. edulis Sims, P. edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Degener, P. nitida H. B. K., P. cincinnata, P. giberti, P. laurifolia, P. morifolia, P. foetida e P. capsularis. Em local com histórico da doença, plantaram-se mudas em número variável e em épocas distintas. A condução das plantas e os tratos culturais foram os recomendados para o maracujá-amarelo. A morte prematura das plantas ocorreu entre dois meses e dois anos da cultura no campo. P. giberti e P. nitida mostraram-se resistente à doença, independentemente do local de origem. Entre os demais "acessos", não se encontraram fontes promissoras de resistência. Entretanto, novos "acessos" e novas espécies deverão ser estudadas na busca da resistência. The {{behavior}} of passionfruit, cultivated in sites with disease history, as to premature death, was researched at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Campus of Jaboticabal, SP. The {{purpose of the}} research was to evaluate the {{behavior of}} acesses and passionfruit species related to this disease, whereas resistant plants are {{to be used as}} yellow passionfruit rootstocks, as well as in breeding programs. The species P. edulis Sims, P. edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Degener, P. nitida H. B. K., P. cincinnata, P. giberti, P. laurifolia, P. morifolia, P. foetida, P. capsularis were used. In a site with a known record of the disease, the plants were planted in a variable number and at distinct times. Plant conduction was done as recommended for yellow passionfruit. The premature death of the plants ocurred somewhere between two months and two years of field culture. P. giberti, P. nitida were resistant to the disease despite its place of origin. No other promising resistance sources were found among the remaining "acesses". However, new "acesses" and new species should be researched in search of resistance...|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of host plants for gulf fritillaries come from Lantana and Passiflora, two genuses of flowering {{plants in the}} Verbenaceae and <b>Passifloraceae</b> families, respectively. Many of the adult butterflies use Lantana plants as their main nectar and food source whereas the Passiflora plants serve as the main resource and foodplants for the larvae. The Passiflora host plants are frequently called passion vines; in some Texan counties where this butterfly's population is high, gulf fritillaries will feed on specific species such as Passiflora lutea and Passiflora affinis. These passion vine plants are suitable host plants as they provide a good structure for larval host habitats which enables young populations of gulf fritillaries to be sufficiently nurtured and protected. The role of host plants is also integral to the oviposition of gulf fritillaries, as the female butterflies lay their eggs {{on or near the}} host plant.|$|E
2500|$|The taxon {{was largely}} presaged by Hans Hallier in 1912 {{in an article}} in the Archiv. Néerl. Sci. Exact. Nat. titled [...] "L'Origine et le système phylétique des angiospermes", in which his Passionales and Polygalinae were derived from Linaceae (in Guttales), with Passionales {{containing}} seven (of eight) families that also appear in the current Malpighiales, namely <b>Passifloraceae,</b> Salicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Achariaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Malesherbiaceae, and Turneraceae, and [...] Polygalinae containing four (of 10) families that also appear in the current Malpighiales, namely Malpighiaceae, Violaceae, Dichapetalaceae, and Trigoniaceae.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group is}} {{difficult}} to characterize phenotypically, although members often have dentate leaves, with the teeth having [...] a single vein running into a congested and often deciduous apex (i.e., violoid, salicoid, or theoid). Also, zeylanol [...] has recently been discovered in Balanops and Dichapetalum [...] which are in the balanops clade (so-called Chrysobalanaceae s. l.). The so-called parietal suborder (the clusioid clade and Ochnaceae s. l. were also part of Parietales) corresponds with the traditional Violales as 8 (Achariaceae, Violaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lacistemataceae, Scyphostegiaceae, Turneraceae, Malesherbiaceae, and <b>Passifloraceae)</b> of the order's 10 families along with Salicaceae, which have usually been assigned as a related order or suborder, are in this most derived malpighian suborder, so that eight of the 10 families of this suborder are Violales. The Flacourtiaceae family {{has proven to be}} polyphyletic as the cyanogenic members have been placed in Achariaceae and the ones with salicoid teeth were transferred to Salicaceae.|$|E

60|$|VITACEAE.--In {{this family}} {{and in the}} two following, namely, the Sapindaceae and <b>Passifloraceae,</b> the tendrils are {{modified}} flower- peduncles; and are therefore axial in their nature. In this respect they differ from all those previously described, with the exception, perhaps, of the Cucurbitaceae. The homological nature, however, of a tendril seems to make no difference in its action.|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that the tendrils {{in the last three}} families, namely, the Vitaceae, Sapindaceae and <b>Passifloraceae,</b> are {{modified}} flower- peduncles. This is likewise the case, according to De Candolle (as quoted by Mohl), with the tendrils of Brunnichia, one of the Polygonaceae. In two or three species of Modecca, one of the Papayaceae, the tendrils, as I hear from Prof. Oliver, occasionally bear flowers and fruit; so that they are axial in their nature.|$|E
6000|$|... {30} 'Gardeners' Chronicle,' 1864, p. 721. From the {{affinity}} of the Cucurbitaceae to the <b>Passifloraceae,</b> {{it might}} be argued that the tendrils of the former are modified flower-peduncles, as is certainly the case with those of Passion flowers. Mr. R. Holland (Hardwicke's 'Science-Gossip,' 1865, p. 105) states that [...] "a cucumber grew, a few years ago in my own garden, where one of the short prickles upon the fruit had grown out into a long, curled tendril." ...|$|E
60|$|The affinities of {{the flora}} {{generally}} are very wide. Although {{there are many}} Polynesian groups, yet Australian, New Zealand, and American forms are equally represented. Dr. Pickering notes the total absence {{of a large number}} of families found in Southern Polynesia, such as Dilleniceæa, Anonaceæ, Olacaceæ, Aurantiaceæ, Guttiferæ, Malpighiaceæ, Meliaceæ, Combretaceæ, Rhizophoraceæ, Melastomaceæ, <b>Passifloraceæ,</b> Cunoniaceæ, Jasminaceæ, Acanthaceæ, Myristicaceæ, and Casuaraceæ, as well as the genera Clerodendron, Ficus, and epidendric orchids. Australian affinities are shown by the genera Exocarpus, Cyathodes, Melicope, Pittosporum, and by a phyllodinous Acacia. New Zealand is represented by Ascarina, Coprosma, Acæna, and several Cyperaceæ; while America is represented by the genera Nama, Gunnera, Phyllostegia, Sisyrinchium, and by a red-flowered Rubus and a yellow-flowered Sanicula allied to Oregon species.|$|E
6000|$|By tendrils I mean {{filamentary}} organs, {{sensitive to}} contact and used exclusively for climbing. By this definition, spines, hooks and rootlets, {{all of which}} are used for climbing, are excluded. True tendrils are formed by the modification of leaves with their petioles, of flower-peduncles, branches, {24} and perhaps stipules. Mohl, who includes under the name of tendrils various organs having a similar external appearance, classes them according to their homological nature, as being modified leaves, flower-peduncles, &c. This would be an excellent scheme; but I observe that botanists are by no means unanimous on the homological nature of certain tendrils. Consequently I will describe tendril-bearing plants by natural families, following Lindley's classification; and this will in most cases keep those of the same nature together. The species to be described belong to ten families, and will be given in the following order: --Bignoniaceae, Polemoniaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Smilaceae, Fumariaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Vitaceae, Sapindaceae, <b>Passifloraceae.</b> {25} ...|$|E
60|$|From {{analogous}} reasons, it {{is probable}} that all tendril-bearers were primordially twiners, that is, are the descendants of plants having this power and habit. For the internodes of the majority revolve; and, in a few species, the flexible stem still retains the capacity of spirally twining round an upright stick. Tendril-bearers have undergone much more modification than leaf-climbers; hence {{it is not surprising that}} their supposed primordial habits of revolving and twining have been more frequently lost or modified than in the case of leaf-climbers. The three great tendril-bearing families in which this loss has occurred in the most marked manner, are the Cucurbitaceae, <b>Passifloraceae,</b> and Vitaceae. In the first, the internodes revolve; but I have heard of no twining form, with the exception (according to Palm, p. 29. 52) of Momordica balsamina, and this is only an imperfect twiner. In the two other families I can hear of no twiners; and the internodes rarely have the power of revolving, this power being confined to the tendrils. The internodes, however, of Passiflora gracilis have the power in a perfect manner, and those of the common Vine in an imperfect degree: so that at least a trace of the supposed primordial habit has been retained by some members of all the larger tendril-bearing groups.|$|E
