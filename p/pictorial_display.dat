40|$|Recent {{investigators}} {{have proposed that}} modal completion is a sequential process requiring a prefiminary mosaic stage. Results of 6 studies of {{the time course of}} completion processes show support for this mosaic-first view with <b>pictorial</b> <b>displays,</b> but not with displays involving occlusion specified by binocular parallax or when <b>pictorial</b> <b>displays</b> were observed monocu-larly.

Results indicated that the VI+P condition, in which subjects were instructed to make pictures in their mind and were shown a <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> that illustrated the temporal-spatial sequence of the reading text, was particularly effective in facilitating disabled readers ' comprehension performance.

40|$|This paper reports an in-simulator {{assessment}} of the trade-offs arising from the mixture of color cueing and monocular, binoptic, and stereoscopic cueing information in peripheral monitoring displays as encountered in HMD systems. The accompanying effect of stereoscopic cueing in the tracking information in the central region of the display was also assessed. Five operationally experienced rotorcraft pilots participated in the study. The pilot's task for {{the study was to}} fly at a prescribed height above an undulating pathway in the sky while monitoring a dynamic bar chart displayed in the periphery of their field of view. Control of the simulated rotorcraft was limited to the longitudinal and vertical degrees of freedom to ensure the lateral separation of the viewing conditions of the concurrent tasks. The results of the experiment indicate that binoptic display of monitoring information in the peripheral region, with color cueing as an alerting function to such information, and stereopscopic cueing in the central region of the display were the most effective display conditions examined, as determined from the objective measures and subjective comments of the pilots. 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{focusing}} {{of public}} {{attention on the}} practices of forest managers {{has resulted in the}} need for new tools to help explain the results of these practices. The traditional tools of tables and graphs of numerical values require a significant investment in learning the forestry profession. Once the investment is made it isn't always easy to transfer the experience gained in one ecosystem to other forest ecosystems. A tool that can bridge the gap in understanding is a <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> of forest components. A <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> won't provide the exactitude of traditional methods, but it can provide a basis for promoting the understanding of traditional forms of ecosystem quantification. The VIZ 4 ST program is such a tool. VIZ 4 ST uses L-systems to render forest trees. The L-systems are calibrated to existing architectural relationships to eliminate user bias. VIZ 4 ST uses an inhibition process to generate coordinates for forest trees. This method is validated with Ripley's K(d) function in nine mapped forest stands and is found to replicate the detected spatial patterns well...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on the {{aforementioned}} experiment whose objective was to assess pilots' situation awareness and workload while monitoring autoland operations, under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), utilizing three advanced display concepts: two enhanced electronic flight information system (EFIS) -type display concepts and one totally synthetic, integrated <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> concept. The hypothesis to be tested was that large-screen, pictorial displays offer enhanced performance and safety through increased situational awareness (without incrementing pilot workload) over conventional and advanced EFIS-type displays. Situation awareness was operationally defined as the pilot's knowledge of ownship position relative to its desired flight route, the runway and other traffic as well as the pilot's comprehension of ownship systems information. All display concepts were presented on a heads-down, projection-based display system. The EFIS-type display concepts also incorporated a simulated monochrome head-up display (HUD) presented in an over-the-glareshield fashion. The basic instrument arrangement for the EFIS-type displays was a conventional T-arrangement of instruments with a Boeing 757 duplicate of a PFD over a ND. The three advanced display concepts incorporated visual enhancements consisting of a sensor-derived wireframe runway and iconic depictions of sensor-detected obstacles (other traffic) in different locations on the display media. The first enhanced EFIS-type display concept incorporated the sensor-based wireframe runway and icon obstacles into it's monochrome HUD; while, the second enhanced EFIS-type display concept incorporated the sensor-based information into it's primary flight display (PFD). The advanced <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> concept incorporated [...] ...|$|E

Evidence from a re-analysis of an earlier study is presented that suggests <b>pictorial</b> <b>displays</b> can exert opposite effects on perceptual size judgements and grip scaling, perhaps because the two-dimensional elements surrounding the target for a grasp are treated as potential obstacles. This interpretation was supported by the results of an experiment in which the relative position and distance of two-dimensional elements flanking a target had differential effects on perceptual judgements of size and the scaling of grip aperture...|$|R

Display conditions included the effects of collimation and scale (head-up versus head-down presentation), horizon symbology (simple line versus white-black sky-ground surfaces), and ground plane realism (computer generated perspective versus a TV picture of a realistic model). The number of control reversals was moderately high on all displays. Control reversals to roll disturbances occurred nearly twice as frequently as reversals to either pitch or lateral rate disturbances. Though {{there were no significant differences}} among the numbers of small control reversals for the different displays, there was some evidence that this conclusion may not apply to large control reversals...|$|E

The linguistic information supplemented by the facial expressions in signing is categorized into syllabic, lexical and syntactic components. In order to control the facial expressions for this linguistic information, the timing and duration of the symbols are specified, and, by applying a set of concatenation rules, the control commands are generated. The adequacy of the symbolic descriptive system and its control rules have been examined through a computer synthesis of artificial facial expression, taking the example of transmitting syntactic information in traditional Japanese sign language.

We investigated redundant <b>pictorial</b> <b>display</b> of datablock information. Four experiments tested different schemes for depicting altitude. The performance measure was the time to find a target aircraft whose altitude was within 1000 feet of a cued aircraft. Color-coding of altitude (either discrete bands or continuously varying hues) substantially improved performance. A variety of achromatic pictorial codes for altitude (including size, intensity and micro-texture pattern) produced modest improvement or none at all.
