5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, {{at the beginning of}} each <b>parliamentary</b> <b>year,</b> the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.|$|E
25|$|With the Lords and Commons {{unable to}} come to {{agreement}} {{by the end of}} the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>year</b> the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached. The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions. The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation; however other newspapers and broadcasters condemned Tony Blair's Labour administration for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.|$|E

500|$|Overton {{surveyed}} a {{new line}} that avoided Darlington's estate and agreement was reached with Eldon, but another application was deferred early in 1820, as the death of King George III had made it unlikely a bill would pass that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>year.</b> The promoters lodged a bill on 30 September 1820, the route having changed again as agreement had not been reached with Viscount Barrington about the line passing over his land. The railway was unopposed this time, but the bill nearly failed to enter the committee stage as the required four-fifths of shares had not been sold. Pease subscribed £7,000; from that time he had considerable influence over the railway and it became known as [...] "the Quaker line". The Act that received royal assent on 19 April 1821 allowed for a railway {{that could be used}} by anyone with suitably built vehicles on payment of a toll, that was closed at night, and with which land owners within [...] could build branches and make junctions; no mention was made of steam locomotives. This new railway initiated the construction of more railway lines, causing significant developments in railway mapping and cartography, iron and steel manufacturing, as well as in any industries requiring more efficient transportation.|$|E
