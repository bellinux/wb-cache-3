According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type-token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word [...] "green" [...] contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter e along with one each of the others.The idea of token identity is that only <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences</b> of mental events are identical with <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences</b> or tokenings of physical events.

The next day, the children were required to recall what happened in the final occurrence. Compared to children whose biasing interview was not focused on any <b>particular</b> <b>occurrence</b> of the repeated event, linking the biasing interview to the final occurrence increased the number of suggested details that were reported. Interestingly, the children whose biasing interview was not focused on any occurrence were also less likely to report the false suggestions than another group of children who had only experienced the event once and whose biasing interview was linked to that single occurrence. These findings have implications for how lawyers and investigative interviewers question children about multiple incidents...|$|R

The framework is applied to five synthetic data sets and one real world application. The experimental results show that working on raw data even with a dimensionality as high as 140 x 80, genetic programming can achieve superior performance to conventional methods operating on pre-defined features. Furthermore, analysis of the evolved event detectors shows that they have captured the regularities inserted into the synthetic data sets and some individuals can be readily understood by humans...|$|E
40|$|We study four {{problems}} in the dynamics of a body moving about a fixed point, providing a non-complex, analytical solution for all of them. For the first two, we will work on the motion first integrals. For the symmetrical heavy body, that is the Lagrange-Poisson case, we compute {{the second and third}} Euler angles in explicit and real forms by means of multiple hypergeometric functions (Lauricella, functions). Releasing the weight load but adding the complication of the asymmetry, by means of elliptic integrals of third kind, we provide the precession angle completing some previous treatments of the Euler-Poinsot case. Integrating then the relevant differential equation, we reach the finite polar equation of a special trajectory named the herpolhode. In the last problem we keep the symmetry of the first problem, but without the weight, and take into account a viscous dissipation. The approach of first integrals is no longer practicable in this situation and the Euler equations are faced directly leading to dumped goniometric functions obtained as <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences</b> of Bessel functions of order - 1 / 2.

40|$|A bad Newspoll result {{suggests}} that Malcolm Turnbull has provoked the economic anxieties of the electorate. The question is: why? NEWSPOLL has shifted two points in two-party-preferred terms {{over the past}} fortnight, putting Labor slightly ahead, at 51 – 49, {{for the first time}} since Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister. Within Australia’s version of the beltway, this has set off several clanging bells. As a general rule, attempting to identify the drivers of fluctuations in individual opinion polls is a mug’s game. Surveys bob up and down for no real reason, or they’re pushed by deeper underlying dynamics or events from weeks or months ago. I’ve noted here before that Newspoll’s preference flows are probably overly generous to Labor; today’s primary vote numbers (Coalition on 41, Labor on 36, Greens 11 and others 12) would at most elections produce a likely 50 – 50 after preferences. And if this were a move from 57 to 55 rather than 51 to 49, no one would be flicking the drama switch. But sometimes, on rare occasions, poll shifts can reasonably be assigned to <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences,</b> and this is very likely one of them.

40|$|Kant has {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that human beings}} have their own vocation collectively. This {{can be understood as}} the actualization of reason, which can be divided into two aspects. First, on the idealistic level, this can be understood as the actualization of the "kingdom of ends", in which all actions done by human being are based on moral ground. Second, on the realistic level, this can be understood as the actualization of "republic" or "eternal peace", in which the concentration is not morality but legality. These two aspects combining together is the vocation of mankind as a whole. Individual human beings are not indifferent. Every one of us is unique by having our own situation. In our situations, we make unique and personal decisions. In short, we have on the one side the need of actualizing of the human vocation; on the other side the uniqueness of existential situation. If they are not compatible to each other completely, which of the two should be put in the first place is the most important question to be answered. Kant scholars have debated over the compatibility between individuality and universality of Kant's philosophy in different forms. Most of them thought that these two sides are not compatible at all. However, in order to make sense of Kant's philosophy, and to understand it as being philosophy in sensu eminenti, as Kant himself has claimed, we must solve this problem and see whether Kant has provided any solution to this dilemma. Kant's philosophy from the outset is about mankind as a whole, yet in its core individuality has never been neglected. The main purpose of this dissertation is twofold: first, to unfold the individuality in Kant's philosophy by the discussion of "history" and second to discuss the relationship between situation and vocation in Kant's philosophy. Since <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences</b> are basic to the construction of "history", and individuals must be involved in these <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences,</b> "history" thus is a very proper locus for the unfolding of individuality. The individual (particular) and universal, as a pair of contrary concepts, have been struggling since {{the very beginning of the}} history of western philosophy. The traditional reading to Kant's major works suggests that his philosophy concerns the universal more than the individual. I am not going to refute this interpretation, yet I do not agree with it totally. Kant's philosophy concentrates indeed more on the universality of humanity; but the individuality of human beings plays a certain role as a hidden element in Kant's philosophy. Enlightened by the development of phenomenology, if differences among individuals are eliminated or simply neglected, the significance of discussing collective human vocation should be put into doubt.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to advance}} the {{argument}} that the process of wealth creation predominantly originates from the economic system of democracy. It seeks to put forth the concept of economic democracy and understand as the process enabling the opportunities for welfare gains to multiply in favour of ever-larger parts of population. Design/methodology/approach – The paper questions the main insight of the conventional view on the benefits of specialisation according to which a nation's prosperity becomes inevitable under the circumstances of efficient allocation of available resources. It takes instead account of how economic interests intertwine with political processes and proposes an analytical deconstruction of the economic influence of political decisions with extensive consideration to Olson's perspective on collective action. Findings – The argument is that the conventional prediction is necessarily limited by several <b>particular</b> <b>occurrences</b> that make the process of wealth creation take a course dependent on the democratic organization of economic activities. The set of policy actions, as well as its underlying principles rest on the understanding that diversification of sources of economic gains should stand as option number 1 on any governmental priority list in order to achieve a better standard of living. Originality/value – The paper sheds light on a different perspective, which does not take for granted the principles of free market and open society as determinants of a country's prosperity and proposes instead an understanding of the sources of prosperity based on occupational diversification as a practical consequence of the economic democracy.

The literature highlights questions of engagement and interactivity that are entailed in the use of these simulations.
