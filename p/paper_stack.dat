The smoldering phase of stacks made up by various paper elements was investigated, using heptane poured {{on the top of the}} stack as the ignition source. The following parameters were varied: size and grammage of the paper sheets; height of the <b>paper</b> <b>stack.</b> Several thermocouples and a scale were used to log data during each test whose duration was on a typical timescale of a day. Among the outcome, two issues of paramount importance for the smoldering phase under analysis were highlighted: the identification of a constant mass loss rate phase and, provided the ignition source is of sufficient strength, the total involvement of the <b>paper</b> <b>stack</b> if sufficient time is allowed for the smoldering combustion to proceed. A regression model based on the test results was then developed that could take into account the behavior of the smoldering combustion representative of the different paper format under investigation.

Analysis shows that back biasing is very effective in reducing leakage with a quite limited speed penalty in sub- 45 nm FinFET. On the other hand, stack forcing is rather ineffective and strongly degrades speed. Hence, BB is certainly the first option to consider in FinFET circuits, whereas stack forcing makes sense only if used jointly with BB when leakage has to be further reduced compared to pure BB...|$|E
40|$|Residential {{highrise}} {{building fire}} of height above 200 m {{is now a}} concern in the Far East. Long-term survey study on fire load density indicated that high amount of combustibles over the local upper limit of 1135 M Jm- 2 used to be stored in residential flats. Wind-induced air-flow rates through openings at upper levels of those tall buildings can be very high. Stack effect in areas with large indoor and outdoor temperature differences (such as 14 °C indoor and - 30 °C outdoor at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China) will also give high ventilation rate through leakage areas. Adequate oxygen is then supplied to burn up all stored combustibles to give a big fire. In applying performance-based design to determine the fire safety provisions, heat release rate of the design fire is the first parameter to decide. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>stack</b> effect and wind action on possible increase in the heat release rate for fires in supertall residential buildings will be explored. Air intake rates through openings to rooms at high levels due to stack effect and wind action are estimated by simple empirical formula. The maximum heat release rates for well-developed room fires in these tall buildings under different stack and wind conditions are determined by varying two parameters. Air flow rate through openings in an 800 m tall building induced by wind gust can be over 20 times the value at ground level. Consequently, heat release rate can be much higher, confirming experimental studies on building fires under wind action. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Early in {{the systems}} {{engineering}} process many {{decisions are made}}. When these decisions are made well, they strongly contribute to success, {{but only if they}} are carried through in detailed design and transition to production. It is therefore necessary to work out the implications of the critical early decisions on myriad detailed decisions. Critical Parameter Management (CPM) is an engineering practice specifically aimed at maintaining the robustness of the system through detailed design and manufacturing. In the early development, ideally during technology development, the critical parameters have their values optimized to achieve robust performance of the system. Subsequently during detailed design of the product system, production development and operation, and field-service development and operation it is all too easy to lose the optimized values of the critical parameters. When that happens, the system no longer has robust performance, and the development is delayed, with great risk of excessive warranty costs once the system reaches the field. The first distinction to be made is between a critical parameter and a critical specification. Critical parameters are the functional variables that control the physics (and chemistry and biology) of the system. Many of them never appear on the production drawings. For example, a force between a feed belt and a <b>paper</b> <b>stack</b> is critical to the physics of paper handling. This force is therefore a critical parameter of the paper feeder system. This force is determined by a spring constant and some geometric parameters of the design. These parameters do appear on drawings (or are implied by part numbers on a bill of materials). The details on the drawing and bill of materials are called critical specifications. Table 1 shows how critical parameters are transformed during multiple phases of systems engineering. During detailed design, engineers mapping from critical parameters to critical specifications. During this mapping it is important to maintain the needed nominal values of the parameters and manage the associated variations. Similarly, subsequent transformations must carry the implications {{all the way to the}} factory floor...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to deeply {{investigate}} the mechanical behavior of paper materials in the out-of-plane direction, especially, the compressive behavior of a single sheet or multiple sheets. In this dissertation, the mechanical behavior of <b>paper</b> and <b>paper</b> <b>stacks</b> was detailed discussed from three different research perspectives. The surface roughness plays a very important role in the compressive behavior of paper materials. The first goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of the surface topography in calculating the stress-strain curve of paper. The difference between the actual and the nominal contact area was compared and a new experimental method by using carbon papers was proposed to measure the actual contact areas. With the aid of the image processing technology, the actual stress-strain curve of paper was calculated and compared with the nominal stress-strain curve. As indicated, there is an obvious difference between the actual and nominal stress-strain curves. A second goal of this study is to establish the mathematical model for describing the force-deformation behavior of multiple sheets. Two different methods with and without considering the paper structures were selected for building the paper models. With considering the structure, the paper can be regarded as an elastic material, the body of which can be divided into two rough surfaces and one internal structure. On the basis of Hooke’s law or Paetow’s method, the relationship between the total deformation and surface deformation can be calculated by using the Newton-Raphson method. Then, the force-deformation relation of a single sheet was derived according to the relationship between the surface and total deformation, the model of a single sheet was extended to calculate the force-deformation curves of multiple sheets. Without considering the structure, the loading and unloading stress-strain curve of paper were expressed by using a sextic polynomial equation and a modified exponential equation, respectively. Based on the hypothesis that when the force is the same, the deformations of the <b>paper</b> <b>stacks</b> are directly proportional to the sheet numbers, the force-deformation relation of multiple sheets was derived. By comparing with the experimental results, it shows that the maximum number of sheets which can be calculated by both of the proposed models is about 140 sheets, especially, when the numbers are between 20 and 140. In addition, without considering the effect of the surface roughness, the stress-strain curve of paper is a typical J-shaped curve. So, in this dissertation, a much easier way to simulate the paper material by using a gasket model was proposed. The material property was defined based on the experimental stress-deformation data under 100 N, then, some simulations under 20 N, 40 N, 60 N and 80 N were implemented based on the model established above. The findings indicated that, this method can be used with high confidence for the simulation of paper under different forces...|$|R
