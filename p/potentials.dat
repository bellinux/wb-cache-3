5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of <b>potentials.</b> This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic <b>potentials</b> between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic <b>potentials.</b>|$|E

Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action <b>potentials</b> and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action <b>potentials.</b> However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action <b>potentials.</b> This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E

5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action <b>potentials,</b> which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action <b>potentials</b> constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action <b>potentials.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{inhibitory}} postsynaptic <b>potential</b> (IPSP) {{is a kind}} of synaptic <b>potential</b> {{that makes}} a postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate an action <b>potential.</b> The opposite of an inhibitory postsynaptic <b>potential</b> is an excitatory postsynaptic <b>potential</b> (EPSP), which is a synaptic <b>potential</b> that makes a postsynaptic neuron more likely to generate an action <b>potential.</b> IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses, which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell to cell signalling. Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions. An electric current that changes the postsynaptic membrane <b>potential</b> to create a more negative postsynaptic <b>potential</b> is generated, i.e. the postsynaptic membrane <b>potential</b> becomes more negative than the resting membrane <b>potential,</b> and this is called hyperpolarisation. In order for an action <b>potential</b> to be generated, depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane needs to occur, where the membrane <b>potential</b> becomes more positive than resting membrane <b>potential.</b> Therefore, hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action <b>potential</b> in the postsynaptic neurone.|$|R
