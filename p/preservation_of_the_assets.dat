40|$|Today, {{more and}} more {{information}} is being produced in a digital form. In addition to this so-called born-digital content, material that was produced to exist in an analogue form is now being digitised both for preservation and for easier access. This digital information comes in an ever greater variety of formats, {{many of which are}} relatively short-lived. Newer versions of the same software are often unable to render files produced with older versions of that software, let alone files produced with similar software from other vendors. Soft- and hardware environments change constantly and after only a few years can older files often no longer be rendered with up-to-date systems. While large scientific organisations and memory institutions (museums, libraries and archives) have in recent years invested significant effort and activity towards digital preservation, the commercial world does not currently have the means to preserve their digital information for the long term. This paper sets out to determine what would be needed to make modern Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Systems ready for long-term <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> stored within them. For this aim both the general Model of an ECM and the “Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) ” have been described, and the special needs of an enterprise system identified. A special focus lies on the Electronic Records Management (ERM) component of ECMs, which already provides simple preservation functionalities, but lacks those aspects of the OAIS that would make it truly long-term preservation capable. A truly long-term preservation capable ERM would have to add these while retaining capabilities of compliance (the retention or destruction of certain documents in accordance to legal requirements) ...|$|E

Introduced in June 1999, this provision recommends that governmental agencies report <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> their infrastructure assets in their financial statements. GASB recommends that government agencies use a historical cost approach for capitalizing long-lived capital assets; however, if historical information is not available, guidance is provided for an alternate approach based on the current replacement cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets.</b> A method <b>of</b> representing <b>the</b> costs associated with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> must also be selected, and two methods are allowed by GASB. One approach is to depreciate <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> over time. <b>The</b> modified approach, on the other hand, provides an agency more flexibility in reporting <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> its <b>assets</b> based upon <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a systematic, defensible approach that accounts for <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset.</b> Pavement management and pavement management systems provide agencies with the tools necessary to evaluate their pavement <b>assets</b> and meet <b>the</b> GASB34 requirements under the modified depreciation approach.|$|R

40|$|CULTURAL TOURISM 2008 3 ABSTRACT Europe the old {{continent}} {{is having}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> richest and diverse culture {{and it is}} considered to be an important destination for holiday-makers and for those especially interested in culture. Thorburn (1986) considers <b>the</b> cultural heritage <b>of</b> Europe to be the oldest and the most important producer of tourism. Romania as part of this wealthy civilization and culture has potential to develop and offer high quality cultural tourism based on its heritage and history. This thesis examined <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> tourism and cultural tourism in Romania and explored <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> developing sustainable cultural tourism in a rural region of Romania, called Maramure based on the region heritage such as wooden churches declared by UNESCO world heritage sites, the Merry Cemetery, historic monuments and museums, {{as an alternative to the}} actual plans and developments. The rich cultural heritage is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key factors when debating <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> cultural tourism and Maramure as it is established in the dissertations is wealthy in heritage and culture and above all it still has authenticity, reflected in <b>the</b> rural life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locals, authenticity that is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main factors in cultural tourism. (Dallen and Boyd 2003) Nevertheless, developing cultural tourism does not come without any challenges regarding <b>the</b> sustainability and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>assets,</b> challenges that are debated in <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> this dissertation and as it is presented in a later part Maramures has to overcome different issues from weak relations, collaboration and partnership between stakeholders to infrastructural problems. The researched pointed out that cultural tourism is a better alternative to actual development plans that regard Maramure and if this type of development is approached based on sustainability principles, it would bring benefits for the destination from economic to cultural and what is the most important its heritage would be passed on to future generations...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{intrinsic}} scenery, many tourism destinations {{are located}} {{in areas that are}} exposed to various natural hazards such as tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and high winds. In particular, coastal tourism presents numerous risks unique to the tourism sector due to differences in <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> vulnerabilities faced by tourists compared to other types of communities. Tourists are transient, may lack knowledge of local hazards, perceive risks differently, and may present various communication barriers. Physical mitigation may also be limited as local communities rely on <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area’s natural <b>assets.</b> Research on <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> disasters in tourism destinations have generally fallen into <b>the</b> categories <b>of</b> emergency management, which is focused on the preparedness and response phases, or solutions, adopting a structural engineering approach. Long-term solutions that utilize non-structural approaches have been acknowledged as vital towards mitigation in various literatures, but in reality, have been scarcely applied. As disasters can constitute a wicked rather than tame problem, long-term solutions should include <b>the</b> input <b>of</b> multiple stakeholders striving towards a working solution that is constantly updated through feedback loops. Urban planning can provide such theoretical backgrounds that are missing from tourism planning studies, but have thus far, been limited to <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permanent communities and not the transient community. This paper examines literature on disaster management planning in coastal destinations and bridges the gap between <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> urban planning, disaster management and tourism planning, by suggesting <b>the</b> utilization <b>of</b> social learning to address disaster management gaps found in existing literature...|$|R
40|$|The European Working Group on EU Directives and Cultural Heritage {{was born}} in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 2003 around <b>the</b> common kernel <b>of</b> {{different}} working groups related to monument conservation and management, some <b>of</b> them in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> Eurocare some just cooperating on voluntary basis. The activity in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> planned conservation and risk evaluation carried out at extended Europe basis outlined the potential relevant impact due to EU directives on cultural heritage <b>preservation</b> and management. <b>Of</b> course negative impact is not due to <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> legislators but sometimes it is real and may jeopardise <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>assets.</b> <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> directives creating problems for the sector are increasing. It is therefore important for the cultural heritage sector {{to be able to}} influence the Directives process at an early stage. Only in this manner can we influence and counter negative effect of such directives. It is true that cultural heritage is <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual member nations. But Directives related to other sectors increasingly impact on <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Cultural Heritage. In many cases such Directives have consequences that are in contradiction to the obligations the members countries have as signatories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Granada Convention.

Prologue Cultural heritage has always been an interdisciplinary sector, a wide range of application involved from investigation to restoration, conservation, exploitation, education and communication each of them enjoying a different mix of expertises: art history, anthropology, social science, science of materials, chemistry, art, structural engineering, etc and more recently economy and marketing plus more and more high technology from lasers, to ICT and bio-tech.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{considerable}} improvements {{have been achieved}} in <b>the</b> seismic design <b>of</b> buildings thanks to <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> concepts such as ductility and energy dissipation. Consequently, new structures are not only able to perform better during seismic events, but are also more efficient in terms of balance between life safety and costs. Conversely, historic centres are still considerably affected by earthquakes. To understand <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> seismic-related damage in historic centres, it may suffice {{to think that the}} ICOMOS World Report 2008 - 2010 on Monuments and Sites in Danger reports no less than five earthquakes, Chile 2010, Sichuan 2008, Haiti 2010, L’Aquila 2009 and Christchurch 2010, all of which impacted and endangered heritage buildings and <b>assets.</b> <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> good quality connections among structural elements greatly affects <b>the</b> dynamic performance <b>of</b> heritage masonry structures and is <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> out-of-plane failures of masonry panels, which are most frequently recurring, most dangerous in terms of human lives and most damaging from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view of conservation. Although it is recognised that <b>the</b> strengthening <b>of</b> connections is of capital importance for damage reduction and prevention, ad-hoc solutions are missing from the technical literature. Furthermore, design codes are vague when it comes to define the assessment and design procedures to be followed when implementing innovative strengthening system in historic structures. This dissertation aims to tackle such technical gaps by developing a new strengthening system and compiling a draft protocol for its validation and design. Two typologies of dissipative devices are designed to address <b>the</b> out-of-plane mechanisms <b>of</b> wall panels and limit cracking in the historic substratum, in accordance with both <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> multilevel performance design and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> historic <b>assets.</b> <b>The</b> prototypes are validated through experimental assessment, on-site application to a case study and computational modelling. The recurring structural features and issues surveyed in <b>the</b> aftermaths <b>of</b> major seismic events feed into the validation process; <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> historic structural connections, <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> original materials, traditional construction techniques as much as current practice are all taken in due consideration. Throughout the validation process, great importance is given to <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> experimental and computational results to <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> creating a systematic process, which can provide guidance to those facing <b>the</b> challenge <b>of</b> creating and implementing innovative structural solutions through a broad variety <b>of</b> methodologies. <b>The</b> research project contributes to <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> quantitative data and, even more importantly, it amounts to a first step towards <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> validation and design procedures. These, although not exhaustive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad variety <b>of</b> scenarios typical of heritage structures, constitute the basis for further developments and research challenges, as highlighted in the conclusions. Ultimately the thesis aims to address the missing link between research, market and practice. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peculiarities and limits of each case, research should indeed strive to provide targeted, yet flexible solutions that end users will be able to apply in compliance with <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> current codes...|$|R

For assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postoperative sternocleidomastoid function to evaluate its degree of atrophy, electromyography (EMG) was recorded. Patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M.

Compared to patients without neck dissection as control group, patients without <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M. SCM showed significant limitation in head inclination and rotation. Patients with <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M. SCM showed significant limitation only in head rotation.
