40|$|<b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive myopathy. The characteristic lysosomal storage of glycogen {{is caused by}} acid et-glucosidase deficiency. Patients with late-onset <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> present with progressive muscle weakness also affecting pulmonary function. In search of a treatment, we investigated the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from rabbit milk. Three patients (aged 11, 16, and 32 years) {{were enrolled in the}} study. They were all wheelchair-bound and two of them were ventilator dependent with a history of deteriorating pulmonary function. After 3 years of treatment with weekly infusions of alpha-glucosidase, the patients had stabilized pulmonary function and reported less fatigue. The youngest and least affected patient showed an impressive improvement of skeletal muscle strength and function. After 72 weeks of treatment, he could walk without support and finally abandoned his wheelchair. Our findings demonstrate that recombinant human ot-glucosidase from rabbit milk has a therapeutic effect in late-onset <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease.</b> There is good reason to continue the development of enzyme replacement therapy for <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> and to explore further the production of human therapeutic proteins in the milk of mammals...|$|R

40|$|Adding acid {{alpha-glucosidase}} to {{cultures of}} <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> muscle {{has resulted in}} enzyme uptake and reduction in concentration of glycogen.

One natural and three sets of twins produced by embryo transfer were studied in <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> cattle. Chimerism persisted throughout life and the situation was analogous to a transplant of histocompatible bone marrow stem cells. The activity of acid alpha-glucosidase in leucocytes and in biopsies of the semitendinosus muscle and the mean activity in diaphragm, spleen and lymph node obtained after death from affected twins were significantly higher than in single affected calves. Glycogen concentration was lowered in liver, spleen and lymph node but not in muscles. The affected twins showed clinical signs and changes in muscle similar to those seen in affected single calves.

40|$|<b>Pompe’s</b> <b>disease</b> (acid maltase deficiency, {{glycogen}} {{storage disease}} type II) is an autosomal recessive disorder {{caused by a}} deficiency of lysosomal acid α- 1, 4 -glucosidase, resulting in excessive accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes and cytoplasm of all tissues, most notably in skeletal muscles. We present a case of adult-onset <b>Pompe’s</b> <b>disease</b> with progressive proximal muscles weakness over 5 years and respiratory failure on admission, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Electromyography showed evidence of myopathic process with small amplitudes, polyphasic motor unit action potentials, and presence of pseudomyotonic discharges. Muscle biopsy showed glycogen-containing vacuoles in the muscle fibers consistent with glycogen storage disease. Genetic analysis revealed two compound heterozygous mutations at c. 444 C>G (p. Tyr 148 *) in exon 2 and c. 2238 G>C (p. Trp 746 Cys) in exon 16, with the former being a novel mutation. This mutation has not been reported before, to our knowledge.

40|$|<b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease,</b> glycogen-storage disease type II, {{and acid}} maltase {{deficiency}} are alternative names for the same metabolic disorder. It is a pan-ethnic autosomal recessive trait characterised by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency leading to lysosomal glycogen storage. <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> is also regarded as a muscular disorder, but the generalised storage of glycogen causes more than mobility and respiratory problems. The clinical spectrum is continuous and broad. First symptoms can present in infants, children, and adults. Cardiac hypertrophy is a key feature of classic infantile <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease.</b> For a long time, there was no means to stop disease progression, but the approval of enzyme replacement therapy has substantially changed the prospects for patients.

50|$|A new {{treatment}} option for this disease is called Lumizyme. Lumizyme and Myozyme {{have the same}} generic ingredient (Alglucosidase Alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation).

Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different. Moreover, Lumizyme is FDA approved as replacement therapy for late-onset (noninfantile) <b>Pompe</b> <b>disease</b> without evidence of cardiac hypertrophy in patients 8 years and older.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Infantile <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a lethal}} cardiac and muscular disorder. Current {{developments}} toward enzyme replacement therapy are promising. The aim {{of our study}} is to delineate the natural course of the disease to verify endpoints of clinical studies. METHODS: A total of 20 infantile patients diagnosed by the collaborative Dutch centers and 133 cases reported in literature {{were included in the}} study. Information on clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic parameters was collected. RESULTS: The course of <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> is essentially the same in the Dutch and the general patient population. Symptoms start at a median age of 1. 6 months in both groups. The median age of death is 7. 7 and 6 months, respectively. Five percent of the Dutch patients and 8 % of all reported patients survive beyond 1 year of age. Only 2 patients from literature became older than 18 months. A progressive cardiac hypertrophy is characteristic for infantile <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease.</b> The diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall and cardiac weight at autopsy increase significantly with age. Motor development is severely delayed and major developmental milestones are generally not achieved. For the Dutch patient group, growth deviates significantly from normal despite start of nasogastric tube feeding. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, or creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme are typically elevated, although aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase increase significantly with age. The patients have fully deleterious mutations. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity is severely deficient. CONCLUSIONS: Survival, decrease of the diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and achievement of major milestones are valid endpoints for therapeutic studies of infantile <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease.</b> Mutation analysis and measurement of the alpha-glucosidase activity {{should be part of the}} enrollment program...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> (PD) is a {{metabolic}} myopathy {{caused by}} the accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, secondary to acid &# 945;-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency.

In this study were analyzed affected siblings with <b>Pompe's</b> <b>disease</b> (PD) and their distinct clinical and pathological presentations. METHOD: Diagnosis was performed by the clinical presentation of limb-girdle dystrophies and respiratory compromise. Confirmatory diagnoses were conducted by muscle biopsy, GAA activity measurement and by GAA gene genotyping. RESULTS: The findings suggested muscular involvement due to GAA deficiency. GAA genotyping showed they are homozygous for the c. - 32 - 3 C>A mutation. CONCLUSION: Herein we reported a family where three out of five siblings were diagnosed with late-onset PD, although it is a rare metabolic disease inherited in an autossomal recessive manner. We emphasize the importance of including this presentation within the differential diagnoses of the limb-girdle dystrophies once enzyme replacement therapy is available...|$|R
