40|$|Introduction: Transcranial {{alternating}} current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation method in which {{alternating current}} is passed through scalp electrodes to stimulate cortical areas. However, current {{passing through the}} skin stimulates pain nerves, necessitating the use of low amplitudes and large surface area electrodes to decrease current density. These factors lead to relatively weak and spatially broad neuromodulation, which causes side-effects. Research has shown therapeutic tACS effects {{for a range of}} neurological disorders, but translation to the clinic is hampered by these limitations. We propose a novel subcutaneous tACS method for clinical applications and use an MRI based computational model to show how subcutaneous tACS can increase neuromodulation strength and focality. Methods: A human head computational model with segmented tissues was used to simulate the electrical field distribution for three different electrodes configurations: conventional square scalp electrodes; a configuration of four disk return-electrodes arranged around a central disk stimulating-electrode and placed on the scalp; the same configuration of disk electrodes placed subcutaneously and with the addition of an insulating back layer. The magnitudes of the electric field and the current density were calculated by solving Laplace’s equation with 2 mA distributed evenly across the stimulating and return-electrodes for each configuration. Results: The subcutaneous disks produced a cortical electric field around 10 times stronger than the scalp based electrodes, in addition to a much lower electrical field in the skin. Both disk electrode configurations produced more focused electric fields than conventional square electrodes. Discussion: Subcutaneous disk electrodes were shown to increase the cortical electric field and to decrease the skin electric field in addition to providing a more focused stimulation compared to conventional square electrodes. For some clinical applications, the benefits of <b>permanently</b> <b>implanting</b> a subcutaneous tACS electrode may outweigh the risks associated the minimally invasive nature of this novel approach. status: accepte...|$|R

This study aims to describe the planning and the process of opening the core of Ilha Solteira, through non participant observation field work and research literature on the topic of its conversion into town and the attempt to create a pole of development for the region through their characteristic urban design plan: linear city and radio concentric city. However, the transformation of Ilha Solteira on a city in the early 1980 s happened in the crisis of developmentalism and authoritarianism, in a time when the CESP no longer wished to transform Ilha Solteira in pole of regional development, but in a city able to stand alone, because their maintenance costs become prohibitive...|$|R
40|$|In the {{management}} of shunt infection, the use of ventricular catheters made of silicone rubber for the temporary external drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is general practice. However, the eradication of {{the primary source of}} infection may be hindered by the affinity of bacteria to silicone-based material. Compared to silicone catheters, a metal drainage device for temporary ventriculostomy appears to offer more favourable conditions for successful eradication of the infection. Since metal needles cannot be <b>implanted</b> <b>permanently</b> and since their screw-type fixation precludes attachment to the skulls of infants or small children, we developed a flexible metal catheter. This catheter was used exclusively for the treatment of particularly serious or chronic infections of the CSF spaces. The catheter is made of implantation steel and consists of a corrugated tube that renders it flexible. Cerebrospinal fluid drains into a receptable bulb {{at the tip of the}} tube. Tubing of other materials may be connected to the end of the metal catheter for either external or internal drainage. It was implanted as a temporary and Later permanent CSF drainage in 7 male patients aged from 4 to 60 years, who suffered from chronic, recurrent ventriculitis (n = 5) with an average of 7 previous surgical revisions, as well as from complex infections (n = 2; basal tuberculous meningitis, brain abscess). The infections were successfully eliminated in 6 patients. In the remaining patient, the metal catheter for external ventriculostomy had to be removed after 4 days due a leakage of CSF; it was replaced by a silicone catheter and later on by a needle drainage. Other complications, such as secondary infection or intracerebral haemorrhage, did not occur. The average duration of external CSF drainage via the flexible metal catheter was 27 days (range 4 - 50 days). In 4 patients, the CSF drainage was converted to a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt using a new flexible metal catheter. At the time of post-operative follow-up examination (average = 34 weeks), all shunts were functioning and there was no evidence of infection. In cases of especially complicated and protracted CSF infections, the flexible metal ventricular catheter is a promising device for treatment...|$|R
40|$|Seed implant {{brachytherapy}} {{has been}} widely accepted as a treatment option for localised T 1 -T 2 prostate tumours, a technique in which radioactive sources (seeds) are <b>implanted</b> <b>permanently</b> in the prostate gland. Apart from some patient-related factors such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage, implant quality {{has been identified as}} a crucial factor affecting tumour control and complication rates. Implant quality can be measured by performing a dosimetric post-implant evaluation (postplanning), in which the delivered dose (which never equals the intended prescription dose) to the prostate and organs at risk is assessed. For this, post-implant images are acquired on which the implanted seeds and the OAR are identified, and on which the dose is calculated using a dedicated TPS. Accurate dosimetry provides feedback to the brachytherapy team, fostering technical changes to improve implant quality and providing information to correlate dose to treatment outcome. Currently, the relationship between dose (with D 90 being the most important parameter) and tumour response is not clear. To a large extent, this may be attributed to the uncertainties related to post-implant dosimetry. The calculated dose depends on the accuracy of seed localisation and prostate delineation. CT is the most widely used technique for postplanning, with adequate seed imaging properties, but with poor soft tissue contrast for prostate delineation. MRI provides superior prostate visualisation (especially T 2 -weighted MRI), but the seeds are not well depicted. To solve this conundrum, fusion techniques have been proposed, combining e. g. CT with MRI-T 2, or matching an MRI sequence optimised for seed imaging with MRI-T 2. However, each of these postplan techniques comes with specific dosimetric uncertainties, which are currently unknown. In this thesis we aimed at improving the quality of post-implant evaluation in order to obtain more consistent and reliable dosimetric postplan data for evaluation of implant quality and for determination of dose-response relationships. In the first two chapters of this project, we evaluated seed imaging quality and reconstruction accuracy using prostate simulating phantoms. In chapter 2, a solid PMMA phantom implanted with a set of inactive seeds was used to test CT based seed reconstruction accuracy in function of seed type and various scanning parameters. It was found that seed type, CT tube current, FOV and CT scanning mode (axial versus spiral) had no influence on seed reconstruction accuracy. Slice thickness was the only parameter affecting seed localisation precision: a larger slice thickness (> 4 mm) was associated with increased seed reconstruction uncertainty. In the current study there was no improvement in reconstruction accuracy by decreasing slice thickness below 3 mm. These results were confirmed in a mailed multi-centric study involving six European centres. The results were neither dependent on the TPS used nor on the scanning parameters, regardless of the CT scanner and practitioner performing the seed localisationprocedure. In chapter 3, we designed and constructed a gel-based phantom to investigate and compare seed reconstruction accuracy based on MRI and CT images. The gel core was prepared {{in such a way that}} the imaging properties were comparable to those of prostate tissue (and hence the seeds) on both CT and MRI. With this phantom, a suitable T 1 -weighted GE MRI scan sequence was developed for seed visualisation. Consequently, phantom images with 3, 4 and 5 mm slice thickness were acquired on CT and MRI. For CT, seed reconstruction deviations increased with slice thickness, with a mean reconstruction error of 0. 8 mm for 3 mm slice spacing to 2. 1 mm for 5 mm spacing. This trend was in agreement with our findings for the solid CT phantom. Surprisingly, on MRI the largest reconstruction uncertainties were observed for 3 mm slice thickness (mean of 2. 1 mm), while 4 mm and 5 mm spacing yielded better results. This could be attributed to the typical seed (void) display, which was longer than the actual seed dimension and not always related to signal (void) intensity. This complicated MRI seed detection in longitudinal direction, especially on 3 mmsets where seeds were depicted on multiple slices. Due to this larger longitudinal uncertainty, the reconstruction deviations were in general larger for MRI than CT. Although phantoms are valuable tools for accurate assessment of seed reconstruction accuracy, they do not provide anatomical information necessary to calculate the effect on the dose-volume parameters. Therefore, in the second part of this project, postplan uncertainties were further investigated using patient images. We set up three interobserver variability studies to quantify post-implant uncertainties introduced by seed reconstruction, contouring and image fusion. In chapter 4, we assessed and compared the seed reconstruction uncertainty on post-implant CT and MRI-T 1 images of three patients in terms of interobserver variability. The seeds were localised in the TPS by seven experienced physicists and compared to a reference seed set. A Matlab program was written to (a) assign the observers seeds to the reference seeds, and (b) to calculate interobserver variability, i. e. the mean deviation between the observer and reference positions of the assigned seed pairs. For CT, on average 98 % of the reconstructed seeds could be assigned to a reference seed, with a mean interobserver deviation of 1. 1 mm (1 SDref). This corresponded well with the results of the phantom studies. For MRI-T 1, the mean seeds assignment rate was 93 %, with a mean interobserver variability of 3. 0 mm (1 SDref). This deviation was slightly larger than the value measured with the gel phantom study. This was plausible given the additional presence of anatomical impurities in prostate tissue. The effect of seed reconstruction variability on prostate dosimetry was calculated for three postplan techniques: (a) CT only, (b) CT fused with MRI-T 2 (denoted as CT+T 2), and (c) MRI-T 1 fused with MRI-T 2 (denoted as T 1 +T 2), using fixed CT and MRI-T 2 prostate contours. For CT and CT+T 2, the D 90 interobserver variability (1 SDref) was 1. 5 % and 1. 3 %, respectively. For T 1 +T 2, the D 90 variability was 6. 6 %, which was notably larger than the uncertainties in the other postplan techniques. In chapter 5, we quantified the impact of the interobserver variability in post-implant contouring and image fusion and compared it to seed reconstruction for the postplan techniques described above. For each technique, reference plans were defined, consisting of a reference seed geometry, a reference prostate contour, and a reference fusion. For the interobserver study on contouring, eight physicians delineated the CTV-P(rostate) according to the ESTRO/EAU/EORTC recommendations on prostate brachytherapy. The resulting prostate structures showed a large variability in volume. For CT, this could be attributed to the poor soft tissue contrast, enhanced by the obscuring presence of seed metal artefacts. The unexpected large contouring uncertainty on MRI showed however that there was also no uniformity in the interpretation and application of the CTV-P definition. The contouring variability in CT and T 2 resulted in a considerable interobserver variability in D 90, with SD values of 23 % for CT and 17  19 % for the other techniques using T 2 for contouring. For the interobserver variability study on image fusion six physicists performed a manual image registration for the multi-modality techniques T 1 +T 2 and CT+T 2. The impact of fusion variability on D 90 was relatively small for T 1 +T 2 (6 %, 1 SDref), and larger for CT+T 2 (16 %, 1 SDref). CT+T 2 fusion uncertainty could be reduced to 7 % (1 SDref) by using an intermediate registration step using T 1 int images, making use of the better depicted seeds for registration. In general, we found that dosimetric parameters for prostate post-implant evaluation showed a large technique-dependent interobserver variability, with contouring and image fusion being the weak links in the procedure. In order to obtain more reliable dosimetric postplan evaluation data, future prostate dosimetry research should focus mainly on these two aspects. This can be approached by establishing widespread training. Image fusion uncertainties could additionally be tackled with improved fusion procedures or software. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|LDR {{prostate}} brachytherapy (seed or {{line source}} implantation) is a proven treatment for low to high risk localized prostate cancer (when the cancer is {{contained within the}} prostate). Under a general anaesthetic, the radioactive seeds are injected through fine needles directly into the prostate, so that the radiotherapy can destroy the cancer cells. The seeds are <b>permanently</b> <b>implanted,</b> so they remain in place but gradually become inactive as the radioactivity decays naturally and safely over time. Unlike traditional surgery, LDR brachytherapy requires no incisions and is normally carried out as a day case procedure. Sometimes a single overnight stay in hospital is required. Patients usually recover quickly from LDR brachytherapy, which means that most men can return to work or normal daily activities within a few days. As described below, LDR brachytherapy has a good side-effect profile with less risk of incontinence or impotence than other treatment options, and is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to major surgery (conventional radical prostatectomy or laparoscopic (keyhole surgery) radical prostatectomy).|$|E
