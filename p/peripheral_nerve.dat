5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerve</b> system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerve</b> lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E

However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves.</b> This article reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite {{intrinsic}} {{capacity of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> to regenerate, functional outcomes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> injury remain poor. Nerve ischemia, intra-/perineurial fibrosis and neuroma formation contribute {{a lot to}} that. Several authors demonstrated beneficial effects of increased vascularization {{at the site of}} injury on <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> regeneration. The use of highly vascularized autologous tissues (greater omentum) as a source of <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> neovascularization shows promising re-sults. We proposed a surgical technique in which injured <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> anastomosis was wrapped in a pedicled muscular flap and performed morphological assessment of the efficacy of such technique with the aid of immunohistochemistry. 14 rats (which underwent sciatic nerve transection) were operated according to proposed technique. Another 14 rats, in which only end-to-end nerve anastomosis (without muscular wrapping) was performed served as controls. Morphological changes were evaluated at 3 weeks and 3 months periods. Higher blood vessel and axon counts were observed in experimental groups at both checkpoints. There was also an increase in Schwann cells and macrophages counts, and less collagen content in pe-ripheral nerves of experimental groups. Axons in neuromas of experimental groups showed a higher degree of arrangement. We conclude that proposed surgical technique provides better vascularisation of injured <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves,</b> which is beneficial for nerve regeneration...|$|R
40|$|During sonographic {{examination}} of the extremities using high frequency "small-parts" equipment, <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> may be identified in virtually all patients. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> have a typical ultrasonographic pattern that correlates well with histologic structure and facilitates differentiation between nerves and tendons. The ability of this technique to depict <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> makes it possible, in many instances, to study nerve abnormalities in trauma, entrapment syndromes and tumors. Ultrasound can enable differentiation of an endoneural from an extraneural space-occupying lesion and evaluation of the extent and consistency of the lesion, {{as well as the}} integrity and dynamic behavior of the nerve involved at follow-up study. The purpose of this review article is to describe the normal ultrasonographic appearance of <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> and to discuss the potential role of this technique to image nerve lesions noninvasively. A series of paradigmatic ultrasound images of diverse pathologic processes involving <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> is presented. Although the ultrasound study of <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerves</b> remains in its infancy, with further refinement of ultrasound technology and a more precise knowledge of the ultrasound appearance of the extremities we may be optimistic to the future impact of this technique on diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in patients clinically suspected to have a nerve lesion...|$|R

25|$|Schwann cells (SC) {{are crucial}} to <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerve</b> regeneration; they play both {{structural}} and functional roles. Schwann cells are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a <b>peripheral</b> <b>nerve</b> is damaged, Schwann cells alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation {{to become involved in}} Wallerian degeneration and Bungner bands. In Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release neurotrophic factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using Schwann cells in neural tissue engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate Schwann cells and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.|$|E
