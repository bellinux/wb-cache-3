30|$|Thoracic metastases {{in breast}} cancer can involve {{pulmonary}} parenchyma, airways, pleura and thoracic lymph nodes [23]. Imaging patterns of lung parenchymal metastases from breast cancer include solitary or multiple lung nodules, endobronchial nodules, lymphangitic carcinomatosis and air–space consolidation. Pleural disease from breast cancer usually manifests as <b>pleural</b> nodularity, <b>thickening</b> and effusions. Metastatic parenchymal nodules are generally solid, spheric or ovoid in shape, sharply marginated, and located mostly in {{the periphery of the}} lung in contrast to other aetiologies such as infection or inflammation [23]. However, a solitary pulmonary nodule appearing in a patient with breast cancer is not always suggestive of metastatic disease, as more than 50  % of the nodules may have aetiologies such as primary lung tumour or other benign lesions, and histological confirmation is necessary [24]. Pulmonary nodules respond to systemic treatment with a reduction in size. Cavitation of pulmonary nodules is uncommonly seen as secondary to both cytotoxic chemotherapy and newer anti-angiogenic agents. To prevent misclassification as disease progression, alternative methods of measuring cavitary lesions (i.e. exclusion of the air component during measurement) have been described in the primary lung cancer literature [25].|$|R

5000|$|Diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>{{thickening}}</b> (DPT) is non-circumscribed fibrous thickening of the visceral pleura with {{areas of}} {{adherence to the}} parietal pleura and obliteration of the pleural space. It often extends over the area of an entire lobe or lung, with fibrotic areas involving costophrenic angles, apices, lung bases, and interlobar fissures. The thickness ranges from less than 1 mm up to 1 cm or more and may extend for a few millimeters into the lung parenchyma. Fibrous strands (“crow's feet”) extending from the thickened pleura into the lung parenchyma can be often detected on CT scan. Diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> develops 20 to 40 years after first exposure. [...] All types of asbestos can cause diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> and a dose-related relationship has been described. It is thought that asbestos fibres that reach the pleura induce subpleural fibroblasts and mesothelial cells to produce scar tissue and collagen deposition, resulting in subpleural thickening. Pleural plaques often coexist with DPT although the latter is rare compared with pleural plaques. According to the Australian Surveillance of Australian Workplace Based Respiratory Events (SABRE) scheme, DPT accounted for 22% of all asbestos-related diseases. [...] It usually begins with an inflammation of the pleura that {{is accompanied by a}} pleural effusion. Most patients complain of exertional breathlessness, however, chest pain has been also associated with this disorder. DPT has a significant impact on pulmonary function, causing a decrease in forced vital capacity, reducing total lung capacity and diffusing capacity. The restrictive impairment is a result of adhesions of the parietal with the visceral pleura as well as possible diaphragmatic involvement. Medical imaging is needed for diagnosis of diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening.</b> The appearance on a postero-anterior chest radiograph is of a continuous, irregular pleural shadowing. In accordance with the International Labour Organization (2000) classification, diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> is considered to be present if there is obliteration of the costophrenic angle in continuity with ≥3 mm <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening.</b> CT scanning is more sensitive than chest radiography and can detect early <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> (i.e. 1-2mm in thickness). The most commonly used classification system defines diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> as a continuous sheet of <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> more than 5 cm wide, more than 8 cm in craniocaudal extent, and more than 3 mm thick. Most patients are only mildly impaired by diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening.</b> Treatment options are limited but any new onset or severe pain should be investigated to exclude malignancy. In most compensation systems, patients are eligible for compensation which corresponds to the severity of disability.|$|E
40|$|Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{discusses}} {{the role of}} chest ultrasound in diagnosis and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) {{and the most recent}} technical progresses in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinically, suspected ARDS can be easily confirmed by lung ultrasonography through the recognition of a typical pattern characterized by B-lines, spared areas, <b>pleural</b> line <b>thickening,</b> and subpleural consolidations. A visual score based on number and thickness of B-lines permits a semiquantitative evaluation of the amount of extravascular lung water and lung density. Recently, a quantitative lung ultrasound method has been proposed. The heart may be also involved in ARDS either primarily or by the application of positive pressure ventilation. The incidence of acute cor pulmonale during ARDS is, even if under protective ventilation, not negligible. The use of echocardiography combined with lung ultrasound is important for early detection of cor pulmonale, identification of the best ventilator strategy to preserve heart-to-lung interaction, and prediction of weaning success. SUMMARY: An ultrasound-integrated approach combining lung ultrasound and echocardiography should be recommended as a suitable technique to manage ARDS during diagnosis, mechanical ventilation setting, and weanin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} is a rare, invasive and often fatal neoplasm that develops {{in the thin}} layer of tissue surrounding the lungs known as the pleura. Although rare, mesotheliomas do occur in the young; their characteristics are distinct from those of older patients. Case presentation: This is a case report of a 17 -year-old boy who had moderate dyspnea, cough, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, fever, headache and no weight loss. Physical examination showed a right pleural effusion and chest roentgenograms revealed a homogenous opacity on lower right hemithorax. Biochemical analysis of pleural fluid showed hemorrhagic/turbid effusion compatible with exudate. It was initially treated as an empyema. The pleural fluid culture was negative. Adenosine deaminase level was 34. 3 U/L (admission) and 19. 02 U/L (two weeks after). Pleural fluid smear and culture for Mtb were negative. During the open <b>pleural</b> biopsy, <b>thickened</b> pleura and multiple pale yellow nodules in the lung were observed. The histopathological report was compatible with malignant {{pleural mesothelioma}}. With this diagnosis, a chemotherapy regimen with cisplatin was initiated. After two cycles, the patient had no clinical and radiological improvement. The patient is currently under regular follow up. Conclusion: MPM is rare in young adults and its clinical presentation makes it different from mesothelioma in elderly patients, {{so it will be}} necessary to identify the new risk factors that can identify these patients...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn a {{clinical}} setting the chest radiograph is the reference standard {{in establishing the}} diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to assess interobserver reliability (IR) of radiographic findings and the relationship to different causative pathogens in CAP. Chest radiographs of 192 patients with pneumonia, obtained from a database, were reviewed by 2 radiologists and 1 respiratory physician without specific clinical information. Main pattern of infiltrate, extent of pneumonia, presence of <b>pleural</b> fluid, <b>thickened</b> bronchial walls, lymphadenopathy and air bronchogram were scored. Also, the involved lobes were identified. Sputum cultures, blood cultures and serological tests were performed to identify the causative pathogen. IR was poor (kappa 0. 7) for determining the presence of pleural effusion, the extent of pneumonia and for identifying the lobes involved. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was associated more often with patchy alveolar opacities than Streptococcus pneumoniae (P= 0. 05). Chlamydia spp. were associated with unilobar involvement (86 %), especially when compared to M. Pneumoniae (P= 0. 03) and S. pneumoniae (P= 0. 004). In conclusion, simple features such as presence of pleural fluid, the extent of pneumonia and identifying the involved lobes show fair to excellent IR. Other features such as main pattern of infiltrate are difficult to assess and show poor IR. Hardly any relation between different pathogens and radiological features was found. Therefore, chest radiographs are of limited value in predicting the causative pathogen, but are of good use {{to determine the extent}} of pneumonia and to detect complications such as parapneumonic effusion...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{claims for}} {{injuries}} from asbestos involve more plaintiffs, more defendants, and higher costs {{than any other}} type of personal injury litigation in U. S. history. As of the beginning of 2001, 600, 000 individuals had filed lawsuits against more than 6, 000 defendants and the total amount that defendants and insurers had spent on resolving claims—including all legal costs—was estimated to be $ 54 billion (Carroll et al., 2002) [...] Eighty-five corporations have filed for bankruptcy due to asbestos liabilities and several insurance companies have either failed or are in financial distress (White, 2002 b). Estimates {{of the total number of}} people who will eventually file claims range from 1. 1 million to 3. 0 million and estimates of the eventual cost of asbestos litigation range from $ 200 to $ 265 billion (Carroll et al., 2002). Asbestos was once referred to as the “miracle mineral ” for its ability to withstand heat. It was heavily used as a fireproofing and insulating material in ships, buildings and consumer products, including wallboard, roofing, flooring, cement, insulation, drinking water pipes, automobiles, clothing, paper, hair dryers, garden products, home appliances, artificial firelogs, and children’s toys. Estimates of the number of Americans exposed to asbestos range from 27 million to 100 million (Biggs et al, 2001). Breathing asbestos fibers—which can be microscopic – causes a variety of diseases. Two of these diseases, asbestosis and mesothelioma, are uniquely associated with asbestos exposure. Asbestosis is scarring of the lungs that reduces breathing capacity; it can range from non-disabling to fatal. Mesothelioma is cancer of the pleural lining around the chest and abdomen and is quickly fatal.

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} role of lung {{ultrasound}} (LUS) {{in the evaluation of}} bronchiolitis in infants. Patients and methods: 25 hospitalized infants, their mean age (6. 94  ±  4. 48  months), 7 males and 18 females. All patients underwent chest X-ray (CXR) and lung ultrasound after full clinical examination with suspicion of bronchiolitis and evaluation for corresponding findings. Results: In 25 infants suspected clinically to have bronchiolitis, 11 patients had mild degree of bronchiolitis, other 11 patients had moderate degree and only 3 cases had severe form of bronchiolitis. The chest X-ray and lung ultrasound were done for all patients; the chest X-ray findings were non-specific including lung plethora in 6 patients, hyperinflation in 3 patients and peribronchial thickenings in 1 patient. The lung ultrasound findings were significant and variable ranged from subpleural lung consolidation in 3 cases, compact B-lines in 6 cases, <b>pleural</b> line abnormalities (<b>thickening</b> and irregularity) in 8 cases and small isolated B-lines in 11 cases.

50|$|Previously it was {{possible}} to claim compensation for pleural plaques caused by negligent exposure to asbestos, on the grounds that although it is in itself asymptomatic, it is linked to development of diffuse <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening,</b> which causes lung impairment. It has been highly contentious, however, as to the probability of pleural plaques developing into <b>pleural</b> <b>thickening</b> or other asbestos-related illnesses. On October 17, 2007 this point was clarified by the Law Lords' ruling that workers who have pleural plaques as a result of asbestos exposure will {{no longer be able to}} seek compensation as it does not in itself constitute a disease. This ruling was, however, superseded, so far as sufferers of pleural plaques in Scotland are concerned, by the passing of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)(Scotland) Act 2009, which provides that in Scots law pleural plaques are to be considered an actionable type of personal injury.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Tumor {{necrosis}} factor α (TNF-α) {{has been}} implicated {{as a key}} cytokine in many inflammatory lung diseases. These effects are currently unclear, because a transgenic mouse overexpressing TNF-α in the lung {{has been shown in}} separate studies to produce elements of both emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Objectives: We sought to elucidate the phenotypic effects of TNF-α overexpression in a mouse model. Measurements: We established the phenotype by measuring lung impedance and thoracic gas volume, and using micro–computed tomography and histology. Main Results: We found that airways resistance in this mouse was not different to control mice, but that lung tissue dampening, elastance, and hysteresivity were significantly elevated. Major heterogeneous abnormalities of the parenchyma were also apparent in histologic sections and in micro–computed tomography images of the lung. These changes included airspace enlargement, loss of small airspaces, increased collagen, and <b>thickened</b> <b>pleural</b> septa. We also found significant increases in lung and chest cavity volumes in the TNF-α–overexpressing mice. Conclusions: We conclude that TNF-α overexpression causes pathologic changes consistent with both emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis combined with a general lung inflammation, and consequently does not model any single human disease. Our study thus confirms the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α, which has been implicated in multiple inflammatory disorders, and underscores the necessity of using a wide range of investigative techniques to link gene expression and phenotype in animal models of disease...|$|R

It accounts for 20 – 30 % of all mesothelioma type cancers. There is great interest in this disease entity amongst the medical community and indeed the general population due to the well-substantiated link between asbestos related exposure and mesothelioma. Case presentationIn this article we report {{a case of a}} 77 year old man who presented with a one week history of breathlessness and a right pleural effusion. An incidental right upper quadrant abdominal mass was noted leading to ultrasound and subsequent CT scans. A large subhepatic mass was identified, in addition to <b>pleural</b> calcification and <b>thickening.</b> Biopsy and histological examination of the abdominal mass suggested a spindle cell tumour, most likely a mesothelioma.
