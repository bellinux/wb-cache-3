5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (<b>petroleum</b> <b>coke)</b> {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E

The results showed that the coke–pitch interactions are related to both pitch and coke chemical compositions. The contact angle of different coke–pitch systems decreased with increasing time and temperature. At high temperatures, decreasing the pitch viscosity facilitated the spreading of pitch and its penetration into the coke bed. The chemical behavior of <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> and coal tar pitches were studied using the FT-IR spectroscopy and XPS.

Positive, negative, and neutral effects were identified on the concentration of fluid material. Small positive effects (ca. 5 - 6 %) were caused by blending the coal with <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes.</b> Charcoal, wood, and active carbon all exerted negative effects on concentration (18 - 27 % reduction) and mobility (12 - 25 % reduction in T- 2) of the fluid phase, which have been associated with the inert character and high surface areas of these additives that adsorb the fluid phase of the coal. One of the anthracites and the low-temperature coke breeze caused deleterious effects to a lesser extent on the concentration (7 - 12 %) and mobility (13 - 17 %) of the fluid material, possibly due to the high concentration of metals in these additives (ca. 11 % ash). Despite the high fluid character of tyre crumb at the temperature of maximum fluidity of the coal (73 %), the mobility of the fluid phase of the blend was lower than expected. The comparison of H- 1 NMR and rheometry results indicated that to account for the variations in minimum complex viscosity (eta(*)) for all the blends, both the maximum concentration of fluid phase and the maximum mobility of the fluid material (T- 2 L) had to be considered.

40|$|The {{properties}} of calcined <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> (CPC), {{used in the}} anodes in the Hall-Héroult process, are important for the electrochemical behaviour of the anodes. CPCs from different sources vary not only in impurity level but also in microstructure.

Hence, {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of these materials during electrolysis is essential for optimizing performance. In previous studies, different anode cokes were characterized with respect to anode overpotential and the gas evolution during polarization. Present work focuses on investigation of the interfacial contact between the anode and the molten salt electrolyte. The interfacial contact is important for the electrochemically active area of the porous electrodes, which is different from the geometric area. The focus is on the assessment of electroactive area by measurements of the double layer capacitance, which may be performed during electrolysis. This is a great advantage as the active surface area is known to depend on the polarization.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} the air reactivity of <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes</b> measured at temperatures between 400 and 600 degrees C {{using a combination of}} characterization techniques and reactivity measurements. The microstructure of the coke was found to comprise an essentially inaccessible pore system at low temperatures of 77 - 273 K used in characterization, and it is more accessible to oxygen at higher temperatures of about 773 K used in oxidation. The correlation of reactivity data using the random pore model suggests that the true micropore area is significantly larger than that measured using physical gas adsorption methods. The difference in surface area {{can be attributed to the}} low kinetic energy of gas molecules at the lower temperatures of characterization; as a result, they are unable to overcome the pore mouth energy barrier. By examining the variation of coke structure with burnoff level, we find that most of the internal reaction occurs in pores in the narrow pore width range 1 - 2 nm. For pores greater than 2 nm, however, the surface areas remains essentially constant with burnoff level. The apparent activation energy of the coke-air reaction derived from the extracted rate constants falls in the range 145 - 160 kJ/mol...|$|R
40|$|Rotary Kilns {{has been}} widely used for {{processing}} minerals, producing cement, calcining <b>petroleum</b> <b>cokes,</b> or drying biomass and wastes. Most of rotary kilns consume energy intensively. Therefore it is desired to assess the thermal losses from the kiln surface {{and find a way}} to reduce the energy losses. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of energy savings by painting the kiln outer surface with a low-emissivity paint. However, it must be careful to evaluate the insulation effect of the paint because good insulation will increase the metal shell temperature. Too much temperature increase could result in structural problems induced by differential thermal expansion between the shell metal and the refractory bricks. A detailed heat transfer analysis is conducted to help make a decision concerning paint selection and the potential consequence of painting the kiln surface. The results show that the thermal losses depend largely on the surface temperature. Every 25 ?C increase in the surface temperature will increase the thermal loss by approximately 17 % with the same surface emissivity at 0. 9. The paint emissivity has a significant effect on the kiln surface heat transfer. Lower emissivity paint decreases thermal losses but increases the kiln surface temperature. A commercial available paint with the emissivity of 0. 65 is selected to achieve the optimum result of an energy saving of 133 kW (0. 46 MMBtu/hr) without imposing detrimental destruction to the refractory brick's integrity inside the kiln...|$|R

The existing literature reveals {{that most of these}} research efforts are essentially focused on the image analysis of coke structure, optical texture (Das et al. 2009), porosity determination methods, model prediction to develop correlation etc. as aforesaid. It has been shown that total porosity and pore structure are significant factors affecting coke strength (Donskoi et al. 2013; Grant and Chaklader 1991; Johnson et al. 2013; Karacan and Badger 2003; Xing et al. 2013). It was observed that coke strength is mainly determined by pores and cracks that cause fracturing of coke (Kubota et al. 2011). Moreover, connected pores can cause coke fractures and that coke strength {{is directly related to the}} concentration of low roundness pores. It was concluded that the amount of low roundness pores is one of the factors determining coke strength. The coke pore and pore wall micro structure was quantified using image analysis (Andriopoulos et al. 2003; Radlinski et al. 2004). The micro structural features of a good coke included a relatively thick coke wall and a pore size distribution. The reason for cracks in anodes was investigated, as it was important for the quality of the baked anode (Bhattacharyay et al. 2013). In this article, an image analysis technique was described and analyzed as well as quantified the area percentage of pores/cracks and weight percentages of pitch and coke. The microstructure of coke particles can be considered to consist of their optical texture and porosity.
