5|$|When the {{luminosity}} of a TypeII supernova is plotted over {{a period}} of time, it shows a characteristic rise to a peak brightness followed by a decline. These light curves have an average decay rate of 0.008magnitudes per day; much lower than the decay rate for TypeIa supernovae. Type II are sub-divided into two classes, depending on the shape of the light curve. The light curve for a TypeII-L supernova shows a steady (linear) decline following the peak brightness. By contrast, the light curve of a TypeII-P supernova has a distinctive flat stretch (called a plateau) during the decline; representing a period where the luminosity decays at a slower rate. The net luminosity decay rate is lower, at 0.0075magnitudes <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> TypeII-P, compared to 0.012magnitudes <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> TypeII-L.|$|E

5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> their work.

5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be the first to get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E

5|$|To preempt the {{traditional}} wet season offensive in 1969, the Air Force approved a major offensive bombing campaign within Barrel Roll named Operation Raindance.

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
