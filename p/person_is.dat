5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a <b>person</b> <b>is</b> guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of John Locke's discussion of <b>persons</b> <b>is</b> undeniable. Locke never explicitly tells us whether he thinks <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> substances or modes, however. We are thus {{left in the}} dark about a fundamental aspect of Locke's view. Many commentators have recently claimed that Lockean <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> modes. In this paper I swim against the current tide in the secondary literature and argue that Lockean <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> substances. Specifically I argue that what Locke says about substance, power, and agency commits him to the claim that <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> substances. I consider the passages mode interpreters cite and show why these passages do not imply that Lockean <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> modes. I also respond to two objections anyone who thinks Lockean <b>persons</b> <b>are</b> substances must address. I show that a substance reading of Locke on <b>persons</b> can <b>be</b> sympathetic and viable. I contend that with a clearer understanding of the ontological status of Lockean persons we can gain a firmer grasp of what Locke's picture of persons looks like. Finally, once we are armed with a better understanding of Locke on substance, mode, and personhood, we can pave the way toward a more nuanced description of the early modern debate over personal identit...|$|R
