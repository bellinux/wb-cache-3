[...] In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.|$|E

There are often several independent modes in which the same phenomenon could have originated.

5000|$|At {{the outset}} of the 20th century, {{homosexual}} acts were punishable offenses in these countries. The prevailing public attitude was that homosexuality was a moral failing that should be punished, as exemplified by Oscar Wilde's 1895 trial and imprisonment for [...] "gross indecency". But even then, there were dissenting views. Sigmund Freud publicly expressed his opinion that homosexuality was [...] "assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> arrest of sexual development". According to Charles Kaiser's The Gay Metropolis, there were already semi-public gay-themed gatherings by the mid-1930s in the United States (such as the annual drag balls held during the Harlem Renaissance). There were also bars and bathhouses that catered to gay clientele and adopted warning procedures (similar to those used by Prohibition-era speakeasies) to warn customers of police raids. But homosexuality was typically subsumed into bohemian culture, and was not a significant movement in itself.|$|E
50|$|Herbivores are {{insects that}} feed on living plant matter or the {{products}} of a plant. These insects may eat essential parts of the plant, such as the leaves or sap, or they may survive on the pollen and nectar <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> the plant. Herbivorous insects often use olfactory or visual cues to determine a potential host plant. A visual cue could simply be the outline of <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> type of leaf, or the high contrast between the petals of a flower and the leaves surrounding it. These are typically associated with the olfactory signal an insect may receive from their intended meal. The olfactory que could be {{the scent of the}} nectar <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> flower, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> chemical excreted to repel unwanted predators, or the exposed sap of a cherry tree. either of these two senses could be the driving force behind an insect choosing to consume <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> plant, but it is only after it takes the first bite, and the confirmation of this food is made by its sense of taste, that it truly feeds. After a herbivorous insect is finished feeding on a plant, it will either wait there until hungry again, or move on to another task, be it finding more food, a mate, or shelter. Herbivorous insects bring significantly more danger to a plant than simply that of consumption, they are among the most prominent disease carrying creatures in the insect world. There are numerous diseases, fungi, and parasites that can be carried by nearly any herbivorous insect many of which fatal to the plant infected. Some diseases even produce a sweet smelling, sticky secretion from the infected plant to attract more insects and spread farther.|$|R

50|$|Behaviorism (or behaviourism) is a {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} understanding of human and animal behavior. It assumes that all behaviors are either reflexes <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> response to <b>certain</b> stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli. Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors. Behaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged {{in the late nineteenth century}} as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 1800s where Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect (a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of reinforcement).|$|R

60|$|That {{different}} {{qualities of}} voice accompany different mental states, and that under states of excitement the tones are more sonorous than usual, is another general fact admitting of a parallel explanation. The sounds of common conversation have but little resonance; those of strong feeling have much more. Under rising ill temper the voice acquires a metallic ring. In accordance with her constant mood, the ordinary speech of a virago has a piercing quality quite opposite to that softness indicative of placidity. A ringing laugh marks an especially joyous temperament. Grief unburdening itself uses tones approaching in timbre {{to those of}} chanting: and in his most pathetic passages an eloquent speaker similarly falls into tones more vibratory than those common to him. Now any one may readily convince himself that resonant vocal sounds can be <b>produced</b> only <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> muscular effort additional to that ordinarily needed. If after uttering a word in his speaking voice, the reader, without changing the pitch or the loudness, will sing this word, he will perceive that before he can sing it, he has to alter the adjustment of the vocal organs; to do which <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> force must be used; and by putting his fingers on that external prominence marking {{the top of the}} larynx, he will have further evidence that to produce a sonorous tone the organs must be drawn out of their usual position. Thus, then, the fact that the tones of excited feeling are more vibratory than those of common conversation is another instance of the connection between mental excitement and muscular excitement. The speaking voice, the recitative voice, and the singing voice, severally exemplify one general principle.|$|R

Photometric testing involves measuring the illuminance <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lamp at <b>certain</b> points in its beam distribution. Headlamp performance is best represented <b>by</b> <b>an</b> iso-lux diagram, showing illuminance contours, produced from a two-dimensional array of data. Conventionally, {{the tens of thousands of}} measurements required are made using a single stationary photodetector and a two-dimensional mechanical scanning system which enables a lamp's horizontal and vertical orientation relative to the photodetector to be changed. Even using motorised scanning and computerised data-logging, the data acquisition time for a typical iso-lux test is about twenty minutes. A detailed study was made of the concept of using a video camera and a digital image processing system to scan and measure a lamp's beam without the need for the time-consuming mechanical movement. Although the concept was shown to be theoretically feasible, and a prototype system designed, it could not be implemented because of the technical limitations of commercially-available equipment. An alternative high-speed approach was developed, however, and a second prototype syqtem designed. The proposed arrangement again uses an image processing system, but in conjunction with a one-dimensional array of photodetectors and a one-dimensional mechanical scanning system in place of a video camera. This system can be implemented using commercially-available equipment and, although not entirely eliminating the need for mechanical movement, greatly reduces the amount required, resulting in a predicted data acquisiton time of about twenty seconds for a typical iso-lux test.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that perceiving objects automatically activates the representation of their affordances. For example, the experiments on compatibility effects show that the reaction time needed to categorise <b>an</b> object <b>by</b> <b>producing</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> hand grip is faster if the requested response {{is compatible with the}} affordance elicited {{by the size of the}} object (e. g., a small or a large grip). The article presents a neural-network architecture that provides a general framework to account for this kind of effects. The model was designed with a methodological approach that aims to provide increasingly general accounts of brain and behaviour (the approach uses four sources of constraints: neuroscientific data, behavioural data, functioning within embodied systems, and reproduction of learning processes). The model is based on four principles of brain organisation that underlie most compatibility effects. First, visual perception and action are organised in the brain along a dorsal neural pathway, which encodes affordances, and a ventral pathway, which encodes goals. Second, the prefrontal cortex within the ventral pathway gives a top-down bias to action selection by integrating information on stimuli, context, and goals. Third, reaction times depend on dynamic neural competitions for action selection, which integrate bottom-up and top-down sources of information. The congruence/incongruence between the information related to affordances and current goals explains the different reaction times found in the experiments. Fourth, because words referring to objects trigger "internal simulations" of their referents, they can cause compatibility effects similarly to objects. We validated the model by reproducing and explaining three types of compatibility effects and showed its heuristic power <b>by</b> <b>producing</b> two testable predictions. We also assessed the explicative power of the model on the basis of a critical comparison with related models and showed how it could be extended to account for other compatibility effects by relying on the aforementioned four principles...|$|R

Science Fiction Forum and Skandinavisk Förening för Science Fiction were founded in 1959 and are a part of swedish science fiction fandom, where the object of fandom is literary science fiction [...] The primary focus of this thesis is the meta discussion on science fiction and science fiction fandom in Science Fiction Forum. The examination is organized around five different questions; what were the conceptual ideas of science fiction in the fanzine, how was the genre defined by the writers of the fanzine, what were the conceptual ideas of fandom, how did the writers of the fanzine view the status of the genre outside fandom and how did the writers of the fanzine answer the critics of the genre. The analysis shows that the discussion on science fiction and fandom in Science Fiction Forum functioned as a way to interpretate and produce meaning to the reading of science fiction and fan identity. The result is supported by other research on fandom, which shows that there is an ongoing discussion between fans within fandom about the reading and understanding of the object of fandom.

For those other simple ideas, being appearances of sensations <b>produced</b> in us, <b>by</b> the size, figure, number, and motion of minute corpuscles singly insensible; their different degrees also depend upon the variation of some or of all those causes: which, since it cannot be observed by us, in particles of matter whereof each is too subtile to be perceived, {{it is impossible for}} us to have any exact measures of the different degrees of these simple ideas. For, supposing the sensation or idea we name whiteness be <b>produced</b> in us <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> number of globules, which, having a verticity about their own centres, strike upon the retina of the eye, with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree of rotation, as well as progressive swiftness; it will hence easily follow, that the more the superficial parts of any body are so ordered as to reflect the greater number of globules of light, and to give them the proper rotation, which is fit to produce this sensation of white in us, the more white will that body appear, that from an equal space sends to the retina the greater number of such corpuscles, with that peculiar sort of motion. I do not say that the nature of light consists in very small round globules; nor of whiteness in such a texture of parts as gives <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> rotation to these globules when it reflects them: for I am not now treating physically of light or colours. But this I think I may say, that I cannot (and I would be glad any one would make intelligible that he did) conceive how bodies without us can any ways affect our senses, but by the immediate contact of the sensible bodies themselves, as in tasting and feeling, or the impulse of some sensible particles coming from them, as in seeing, hearing, and smelling; by the different impulse of which parts, caused by their different size, figure, and motion, the variety of sensations is produced in us.|$|R
