5|$|Heublein {{promoted}} Michael A. Miles to run {{the chain}} in 1977 and Miles is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back-to-basics formula. Miles refurbished the stores, and introduced indoor seating and drive-thru windows. Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories and profit and loss statements, so that <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business. Subsequent changes resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980.|$|E

While Sauber were able to place Felipe Nasr in a new car in time for qualifying following his accident in practice, Jenson Button's <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> not be sorted out and he missed the session, meaning that his participation in the race would be left to a decision by the race stewards.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over the contract between the MWAA and Dulles Transit Partners, which consists of Bechtel and Washington Group International. The $2.7 billion project was originally awarded by VDOT under the Virginia Public-Private Partnership Act, rather than by using conventional competitive bidding based upon a detailed specification. As a result, the contractor is allowed to both design and build the project with no upper cap on its cost. <b>Problems</b> <b>could</b> arise from the arrangement where MWAA is supervising the design and construction but ultimately WMATA must operate the Silver Line. The contract provides for price escalation of $3 million to $6 million a month for delays. VDOT transferred the contract to MWAA when MWAA took over the project in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, Prinz Eugen rendezvoused {{with the}} supply ship Spichern to refill her nearly empty fuel tanks. She had by then only some 160 tons fuel left, {{enough for a}} day. Afterwards the ship {{continued}} further south on a mission against shipping lines. However, before any merchant ship was found, defects in her engines showed and on 27 May, the day Bismarck herself was sunk, she was ordered {{to give up her}} mission and make for a port in occupied France. On 28 May Prinz Eugen refuelled from the tanker Esso Hamburg. The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her speed to maximum 28 knots. The screw <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area, at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship's radio crew, Prinz Eugen reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E

25|$|Already in the 1930s it {{was found}} that the 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT had some shortcomings. The recoil of the guns tended to cause muzzle climb during shooting, {{resulting}} in poor accuracy. During Winter War further problems were found: the mount was heavy and cumbersome, and calibre of the weapon was not powerful enough. This last problem was exacerbated by the fact that the design of a domestic heavy 13.2mm anti-aircraft machine gun had not proceeded beoynd prototype stage; further development of this weapon was stopped soon after. The calibre problem could not be helped, but some of the other <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be solved and testing of different improvements began already in summer 1939.|$|E
25|$|Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-GMO activist, {{argued the}} problem was not the plant per se, but {{potential}} problems with poverty and loss of biodiversity. Shiva claimed these <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be amplified by the corporate control of agriculture. By focusing on a narrow problem (vitamin A deficiency), Shiva argued, golden rice proponents were obscuring the limited availability of diverse and nutritionally adequate food. Other groups argued that a varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, leaf vegetables and fruit would provide children with sufficient vitamin A. Keith West of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has stated that foodstuffs containing vitamin A are often unavailable, only available at certain seasons, or too expensive for poor families in underdeveloped countries.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Aurora began a 103-day world cruise {{with more}} than 1,700 {{passengers}} on board.

During the ship's time waiting in Southampton, passengers were offered free drinks in the onboard bars and were able to exit the ship at any time. Passengers were also permitted to cancel their booking for a full refund. After P Cruises cancelled the cruise, the company donated all of the food purchased for the trip to local charities around Southampton. Aurora set sail for a dry dock in Bremerhaven, Germany, where her damaged motor would be removed and replaced.|$|E
