25|$|Some pubs {{disguise}} keg beer {{by having}} an imitation <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> on the bar. If the bar staff have merely {{turned on a}} tap, or are just resting their hand on a very small handle with no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use electric pumps or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E

25|$|As the {{diaphragm}} contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the intercostal muscles {{as shown in}} Fig.4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig.4); but the lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig.5). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased {{in the same way}} as the antero-posterior diameter is increase by the so-called <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> movement shown in Fig.4.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{discovery}} of an infectious cause, the symptoms of cholera {{were thought to be}} caused by an excess of bile in the patient; the disease cholera gets its name from the Greek word choler meaning bile. This theory was consistent with humorism, and led to such medical practices as bloodletting. The bacterium was first reported in 1849 by Gabriel Pouchet, who discovered it in stools from patients with cholera, but he did not appreciate the significance of this presence. [...] The first scientist to understand the significance of Vibrio cholerae was the Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini, who published detailed drawings of the organism in [...] "Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera" [...] in 1854. He published further papers in 1866, 1871, 1876 and 1880, which were ignored by the scientific community. [...] He correctly described how the bacteria caused diarrhea, and developed treatments that were found to be effective. Whilst John Snow's edpidemiology maps were well recognised, and led to the removal of the Broad Street <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> e.g. 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. In 1874, scientific representatives from 21 countries voted unanimously to resolve that cholera was caused by environmental toxins from miasmatas, or clouds of unhealthy substances which float in the air. [...] In 1884, Robert Koch re-discovered Vibrio cholerae as a causal element in cholera. Some scientists opposed the new theory, and even drank cholera cultures to disprove it: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{air-lift}} pump is a well-established method for vertical transport of liquids and solid– liquid mixtures. The {{objectives of the}} present study are to evaluate the performance of a pump under predetermined operating conditions and to optimize the related parameters {{for the use of the}} pump for two-phase mixtures of air and water when a compressor is readily available. This paper is focused on the general mathematical functions applicable to {{air-lift pump}} installations. The effect of various design parameters on the performance of air-lift pump is presented. A user-friendly computer program is developed on the basis of the optimization of influencing variables. This program will be useful for the design and installation of an air-lift <b>pump</b> <b>handling</b> air–water mixtures. A comparative study of an air-lift pump with a centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>handling</b> two-phase mixtures is also discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 49 More {{stringent}} regulatory {{limits are}} {{being placed on}} gaseous emissions from <b>pumps</b> <b>handling</b> hydrocarbon fluids. For example, new pumps in the Los Angeles Basin are required to have ear zero emissions. The EPA is proposing a pump emission category of no detectable emissions (NDE), defined as being less than 50 ppm. Single seals have been developed that result in emission levels below 1, 000 ppm, sufficient to meet regulations for existing equipment but not those for new pumps in the Los Angeles area. In response to these emission regulations, laboratory testing has been conducted on tandem mechanical seal arrangements in which the primary seal operated on propane and the secondary seal on various barrier fluids. Secondary seal emission rates of volatile organic compounds, on optimized seal designs, were determined to be well below 50 ppm. These results demonstrate that tandem mechanical seals provide an effective alternative to double seals and sealless pumps in the drive to achieve near zero emission rates for <b>pumps</b> <b>handling</b> light hydrocarbons...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{disagreement}} about whether [...] "pikuach nefesh overrides" [...] {{would apply to}} halting a specific, identifiable, immediate, and well-known ongoing threat in a well-identified community, given the advent of public health, like the disablement of the Broad Street pump in the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, as reported by John Snow. The Broad Street Pump posed an immediate risk to many lives, with no specific individual identified as at threat. Instead, everyone living {{close enough to the}} Broad Street pump to draw water from the infective source was in life-threatening danger any time they grew thirsty and craved a drink of water. John Snow identified the Broad Street pump as problematic on a Thursday (September 7, 1854), and the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> was removed on a Friday (September 8, 1854) by members of the community. To definitively disable the pump as the Broad Street community did that Friday after Shabbat began, an observant Jew, whether acting on confirmed conscience alone or short-handed, would have to suspend Shabbat under pikuach nefesh, remove the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> surround, cordon off, and/or by some other means prevent use of the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> without interruption through the night and following day to guarantee that no further water was drawn from the deadly and infectious Broad Street Pump, as an immediate, ongoing threat to life. Under the narrowest interpretation of pikuach nefesh, an observant Jew must wait until a passerby makes contact with the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> and clearly expresses an intention to pump, in order to suspend Shabbat on a pikuach nefesh (PN) override. (Historically, it is not known whether the community removed the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> before or after sunset, and the beginning of Shabbat. [...] ) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: As to the {{centrifugal}} pump for slurry, {{the effects of}} solids particles {{on the performance of}} the pump have been extensively researched. It is essential to understand the effects of solids on the pump performance well in order to obtain the performance of centrifugal <b>pump</b> for <b>handling</b> slurries. Some existing correlation equations to predict the performance are analyzed and summarized in this paper. A new simple correlation equation to predict the head ratio for <b>pumps</b> <b>handling</b> solids has been developed. The simple equation has been validated by the experiment data published in the related literature. The results by the simple equation are compared with ones available in the literature. The result shows that the simple equation is in good agreement with the experimental data, and {{it can be used to}} predict the performance of {{centrifugal pump}} for slurry...|$|R
40|$|The {{change in}} {{performance}} characteristics of centrifugal <b>pumps</b> when <b>handling</b> $ne granular or homogeneous type non-Newtonian slurries {{has been investigated}} using two diferent slurry <b>pumps</b> <b>handling</b> mixtures of coallwater and kaolinlwater. A test loop was used which allowed pump performance to be determined at various pump speeds, with many different mixture concentrations and rheologies. The test work indicated two main changes in the pump performance compared to the water characteristics: (i) a large drop in pump developed head at low,flowrates (creating an unstable curve), and; (ii) {{a reduction in the}} pump eficiency at,flowrates near the best efficiency point. The results show that the pump performance is dependent on the slurry’s rheological properties, with pump Reynolds number giving generally good Correlation with the change in performance. Methods of performance correlation used for Newtonian,fluids were found to give good results provided that a suitable value for the viscosity could be chosen...|$|R

50|$|The pump's primary {{components}} {{consist of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> the riser main which carries {{the water to}} the surface, the pump cylinder which pushes water up the riser main, and the connecting rod which connects the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> to the pump cylinder {{at the bottom of}} the well. After a borehole is drilled, a well casing is inserted into the hole to prevent the erosion of the borehole walls. The India Mark II needs a borehole with a minimum diameter of 10 cm. The casing has a well screen to allow water to pass into the casing but keeps rocks and dirt out. A pump cylinder is attached to the bottom of a series of pipes call riser mains or riser pipes and sits below the water surface in the well once installed. The riser main will carry the water from the pump cylinder to the surface. Inside the riser main, a series of rods connect the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> to the top of the pump cylinder {{at the bottom of the}} well. The reciprocating up and down movement of the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> raises and lowers the connecting rod thus raising and lowering the plunger of the pump cylinder. Two one-way water valves inside the cylinder suck water into the cylinder on the upstroke and force the water into the riser main on the down stroke. Water flows up the riser main and out of the spout at the top of the well head assembly.|$|E
