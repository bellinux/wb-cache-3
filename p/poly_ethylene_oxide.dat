40|$|A {{group of}} <b>poly</b> (lactide <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> fumarate) (PLEOF) {{polymers}} have been synthesized {{that can be}} used for hydrogel fabrication with desirable mechanical properties suitable for bone tissue engineering. The major issues in the synthesis and purification of this class of polymers are the large amount of organic solvents used and the production of TEA complexes that are difficult to remove and may impede the biocompatibility of the material. The aim of this project was to investigate the feasibility of using high pressure carbon dioxide as a benign solvent for the synthesis of PLEOF. The effect of process parameters on the properties of polymers and methods for removing chemical residues that are cytotoxic were also examined. Finally, it was attempted to enhance the biological activity of PLEOF by developing a composite of this polymer with a cost effective biopolymer such as gelatin. This study demonstrated that high pressure CO 2 gas expanded solution can be used as the alternative media for the synthesis of PLLA and PLEOF, respectively. The resultant PLEOF hydrogel and its hybrid with natural polymers exhibit promising potential for musculoskeletal tissue engineering due to favourable gelation behaviour, mechanical strength, porosity and biological properties.

40|$|Fujiwara's {{oriented}} crystallization {{method was}} applied to <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> to obtain a uniform texture composed of parallel fibrils which correspond {{to the structure of}} a radial direction of spherulites.

A reasonable interpretation was given for these two ways of spherulitic crystallization, based on the growth features of lamellar crystals of <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide).</b> That is, it is concluded that a second order transition in <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> lamellar crystals near the temperature of 50 ℃ is responsible for the change of the rotation axis in spherulite radius...|$|E
30|$|Recently, a triblock {{amphiphilic}} copolymer, <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene <b>oxide)</b> F 127 (known as Pluronic F 127), {{has been}} demonstrated to enhance the stability and activity of free OPHs through {{the interaction between the}} hydrophobic segments of polymers and the hydrophobic regions of enzyme surface (Suthiwangcharoen and Nagarajan 2014; Kim et al. 2014 b). In addition to OPHs, various enzymes can be modified by direct conjugation or covalent binding with Pluronic F 127 (Wu et al. 2014, 2015; Zhang et al. 2013). Although advances in the conjugation of Pluronic F 127 and free enzymes have been made so far, the application of Pluronic F 127 in immobilized enzymes has not been achieved. One possible reason is that the current methods of preparing enzyme-polymer conjugates are performed in aqueous phase (Suthiwangcharoen and Nagarajan 2014; Kim et al. 2014 b) and the carrier-immobilized enzymes are not soluble in aqueous solution. More importantly, the improving effect of Pluronic F 127 in the catalytic properties of free OPH has not been demonstrated in immobilized OPH yet. Thus, it is of interest to develop a simple method of preparing immobilized OPH-Pluronic F 127 conjugates with the expectation of maintaining the high stability and activity of OPH with Pluronic F 127 simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work nanogels and hydrogels {{composed}} of functional hydrophilic polymers or proteins crosslinked with degradable crosslinkers are prepared and characterized. The nanogels and hydrogel systems could be modified with targeting molecules for {{the delivery of}} peptides or proteins. As building blocks shaped <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> oxide-stat-propylene <b>oxide)</b> (sP(EO-stat-PO)), linear poly(glycidol) (PG) and Alpha-Elastin polypeptide are used. Linear PG was synthesised via anionic polymerization and then functionalizated with thiol groups. sP(EO-stat-PO)) was received from Dow chemicals and was functionalised with thiol and acrylate end groups. While Alpha-Elastin was used as recived. Bulk hydrogels were prepared by crosslinking of HS-sP(EO-stat-PO) and HS-PG via oxidation of thiol groups to disulfide bonds {{as well as by}} Michael addition with PEG-diacrylate. The disulfide bonds formed in the process are known to be cleaved in the reductive environment of the cytosol and the ester bonds formed in the Michael addition process can be hydrolyzed {{over a period of several}} days or weeks depending on pH. Thus the presence of these two segments ensures the biodergadability of such hydrogels. To show the biodegrability and use of such hydrogels, HS-sP(EO-stat-PO) hydrogel crosslinked by oxidation and Micheal addition was loaded with engineered chemokines. Under the cytosolic condition the hydrogels showed triggered release of chemokines which to a considerable extent could prevent injury extension after myocardial infarction. The oxidation in air normally takes several hours which in many cases is too slow in order to maintain stable miniemulsion for the production of nanogels. Therefore hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidizing agent and studies were performed in order to optimise the parameters for the synthesis of nanogels in the inverse miniemulsion. The formed gels were characterized for their size, dipersity, degradation behaviour, in vitro cytotoxicity and hemocmpatibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) in the water solution and scanning force microscopy (SFM) in the dry state were used to characterize the gels size and polydispersity. The stability of nanogels was monitored by DLS measurements. The live/dead viability/cytotoxicity assay was used to examine the cytotoxicity of nanogels and hemocompatibility tests were performed according to 1 SO 10993 - 4. Further different formulation strategies were used to control the particle size and polydisperstiy of crosslinked PG nanogel prepared via inverse miniemulsion. Comparative investigation of the use of alloxan, a mild oxidation catalyst, and hydrogen peroxide is discussed. Going a step further horseradish peroxidase (HRP) one of the most studied oxidation-catalyzing enzymes was used for synthesis of hydrogel and nanogels from HS-PG polymers. Nanogels were shown to entrap two different enzymes HRP and Beta-Galactosidase without affecting the enzyme activity and cells were successfully encapsulated in the hydrogel. Biohybrid nanogels were constructed by immobilization of protein ovalbumin by crosslinking acrylate functionalized star shaped <b>poly</b> (<b>ethylene</b> oxide-stat-propylene <b>oxide)</b> (Acrylate-sP(EO-stat-PO)) resulting in the formation of biohybrid nanogel. Biohybrid nanogels systems based on soluble Alpha-elastin polypeptides were also prepared by using two different amine-reactive cross-linkers; poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEG-DGE) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS 3). Thermo- and pH responsivity of such nanogels was explored. An elastase-triggered degradation profile of such nanogels was monitored by DLS measurements against time, while the colloidal stability was investigated by sedimentation analysis. Texas Red conjugated dextran was used as a model drug to load the nanogels and its loading and release kinetics was studied. In the last part of the thesis synthesis of radiolabeled nanogels for nuclear molecular imaging is reported using HS-sP(EO-stat-PO). Simple and efficient 68 Ga-labeling procedure was used to radiolabel the nanogels containing chelating groups for 68 Ga with high radio chemical yield and in vitro studies were performed to study the biocompatibility of the nanogels...|$|R

40|$|Context. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> (c-C 2 H 4 O), and its isomer {{acetaldehyde}} (CH 3 CHO), {{are important}} complex organic molecules {{because of their}} potential role {{in the formation of}} amino acids. The discovery of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in hot cores suggests the presence of ring-shaped molecules with more than 3 carbon atoms such as furan (c-C 4 H 4 O), to which ribose, the sugar found in DNA, is closely related. Aims. Despite the fact that acetaldehyde is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> has not yet been detected in cold sources. We aim to understand the chemistry of the formation and loss of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in hot and cold interstellar objects (i) by including in a revised gas-grain network some recent experimental results on grain surfaces and (ii) by comparison with the chemical behaviour of its isomer, acetaldehyde. Methods. We introduce a complete chemical network for <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> using a revised gas-grain chemical model. We test the code for the case of a hot core. The model allows us to predict the gaseous and solid <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> abundances during a cooling-down phase prior to star formation and during the subsequent warm-up phase. We can therefore predict at what temperatures <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> forms on grain surfaces and at what temperature it starts to desorb into the gas phase. Results. The model reproduces the observed gaseous abundances of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> and acetaldehyde towards high-mass star-forming regions. In addition, our results show that <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> may be present in outer and cooler regions of hot cores where its isomer has already been detected. Our new results are compared with previous results, which focused on the formation of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> only. Conclusions.

Since 1940, almost all industrial production of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> has relied on this process. Sterilization by <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> for the preservation of spices was patented in 1938 by the American chemist Lloyd Hall. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> achieved industrial importance during World War I as a precursor to both the coolant ethylene glycol and the chemical weapon mustard gas.|$|R
50|$|Wurtz {{measured}} {{the boiling point}} of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> as 13.5 °C, slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> to react with acids and salts of metals. Wurtz mistakenly assumed that <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896 when Georg Bredig found that <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> is not an electrolyte. That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long {{been a matter of}} debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> was proposed by 1868 or earlier.|$|R
