In young dogs with spontaneously arising and experimentally induced (androstanediol plus estradiol treatment) prostatic hyperplasia, nuclear, but not cytosolic, prostatic androgen-receptor content was significantly greater than that determined in the normal <b>prostates</b> of age-matched dogs (3, 452 ± 222 and 4, 035 ± 274 fmol/mg DNA vs. 2, 096 ± 364 fmol/mg DNA, respectively).

25|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the causes of <b>prostate</b> cancer remains elusive. The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. <b>Prostate</b> cancer is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. However, many men never know they have <b>prostate</b> cancer. Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found <b>prostate</b> cancer in 30% of men in their fifties, and in 80% of men in their seventies. Men who have first-degree family members with <b>prostate</b> cancer appear to have double the risk of getting the disease compared to men without <b>prostate</b> cancer in the family. This risk appears to be greater for men with an affected brother than for men with an affected father. In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of <b>prostate</b> cancer and 30,000 deaths due to <b>prostate</b> cancer. Men with high blood pressure are more likely to develop <b>prostate</b> cancer. There is a small increased risk of <b>prostate</b> cancer associated with lack of exercise. A 2010 study found that <b>prostate</b> basal cells were the most common site of origin for <b>prostate</b> cancers.|$|E
25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and <b>prostate</b> cancer is poor. In light of this the rate of <b>prostate</b> cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of <b>prostate</b> cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing <b>prostate</b> cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of <b>prostate</b> cancer, although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced <b>prostate</b> cancer. Consuming fish may lower <b>prostate</b> cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of <b>prostate</b> cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of <b>prostate</b> cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>prostate</b> {{is a part}} of {{the male}} {{reproductive}} system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical <b>prostate</b> is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The <b>prostate</b> surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, <b>prostate</b> diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The <b>prostate</b> contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In <b>prostate</b> cancer, the cells of these <b>prostate</b> glands mutate into cancer cells. The <b>prostate</b> glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the <b>prostate</b> itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E

40|$|BPH {{remains one}} of the most common {{diseases}} that the urologist has to manage. The last decade brought numerous new techniques, aiming to improve the minimally invasive approach to BPH, but, for the moment, none had changed the place of TURP as the gold standard treatment for medium sized <b>prostates.</b> Based on a large personal experience, the authors present a study in which TURP is used for <b>prostates</b> over 80 ml, the cutoff point set by the guidelines of the European Association of Urology. The rationale for this study is that many situations require minimally invasive treatment, based on the express request of the patient, other conditions that makes open surgery very difficult or impossible, or the need for a quick discharge in an overcrowded service. The aim of the study was to prove that TURP is safe and effective even in larger <b>prostates.</b> The technique used is basically the classic one, with minor tactical alterations in some cases. Some cases required a two-stage approach, but offered good functional results after the first stage.
