5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} {{his place in}} modern music you <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside {{what remained of the}} psychedelic 1960s.

500|$|Plans {{have been}} made that would either double or triple the {{frequency}} on all the services on the existing commuter rail network. However, increased frequency south of Sandnes will require double track. Should the frequency be doubled, double track {{would have to be}} built to where the current service to Nærbø terminates. Plans call for these trains to possibly be extended to either Varhaug or Vigrestad. Should the frequency be tripled, double track would be needed all the way to Egersund. Parts of the Jæren Line is straight enough to permit speeds between [...] However, several shorter parts need to be rebuilt to allow this, particularly between Egersund and Ogna, and from Bryne to Ganddal. In particular, the section from Ogna to Egersund would <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow an all-new route, should it be rebuilt to double track. The effect of higher maximum speeds is greatest for intercity trains, as the commuter trains have so frequent stops they have little to gain from the increased speeds.|$|E
500|$|M. cerebralis {{was first}} {{recorded}} in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, whirling disease {{was considered a}} manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout. In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, [...] "the Montana Whirling Disease Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that M. cerebralis infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. [...] For reasons that are poorly understood, but <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in California, Michigan, and New York.|$|E
500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E
