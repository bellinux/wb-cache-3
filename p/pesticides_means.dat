40|$|Experiment was {{conducted}} on fish, Oreochromis mossambicus to study the effect of acetamiprid on tissue biomarker lactate dehydrogenase. Acetamiprid is a neonicotinoid pesticide and it {{is used by the}} farmers to protect their crops. This pesticide residue reaches to the aquatic ecosystem by many ways and affects the aquatic fauna. Lethal Concentration (LC 50) of acetamiprid for O. mossambicus has been calculated by probit analysis and recorded as 5. 99 ppm at 96 h. Chronic exposure shows increased activity of LDH in liver, brain and gill tissues during all the exposure periods when compared with the control. This significant increase in enzyme activity was observed due to toxic effect of acetamiprid. Long term exposure of organisms to <b>pesticides</b> <b>means</b> a continuous health hazard for the fish population and it is on high risk by consuming these toxicated fishes...|$|E

30|$|The {{substitution}} {{principle is}} a new element of the legislation on plant protection products (PPPs) in the European Union (EU). It was introduced with the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [[1]], in the following shortly denoted as the PPP Regulation. This replaced the old Directive 91 / 414 /EEC on PPPs [[2]] in June 2011. In parallel, the substitution principle was {{also included in the}} new Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012 on biocidal products [[3]], which came into force in September 2013. PPPs and biocidal products are collectively denoted as ‘pesticides’ under EU law, as has been defined in Article 3 of Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides in the European Community (EC) [[4]]. As a common rule, pesticides shall not be placed on the market or used unless they have been authorised in accordance with the applicable regulations. In general, ‘substitution’ of <b>pesticides</b> <b>means</b> that an authorisation is refused or withdrawn in favour of an alternative product or a non-chemical control or prevention method which presents a ‘significantly lower risk’, according to Annex IV of the PPP Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 and Article 23 of the biocidal products Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012, respectively. In detail, the conditions, rules, and criteria for applying the substitution principle differ for PPPs and for biocidal products. In this paper, we focus on substitution under the Regulation for PPPs.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the French Ecophyto Plan, the development of potato varieties resistant to biotic stresses is now an absolute need {{in order to reduce the}} use of pesticides. Indeed, potato crops require a considerable use of <b>pesticides</b> (<b>mean</b> Treatment Frequency Index = 16. 6), because of their susceptibility to numerous pathogens, including Phytophthora infestans (late blight agent) and cyst nematodes. This document highlights the work that has been achieved by INRA since the 1980 s in order to find and use appropriate resistance genes present in different wild accessions of Solanum tuberous species. During the past 20 years, this research activity has generated 729 innovative pre‐breeding lines, 80 % of which carry new resistance genes to various pathogens. Since 1995, these lines have been released to French potato breeders, who can now develop new resistant varieties using this innovative germplasm. The potential environmental impact of such varieties is considerable, because they may enable reductions in very heavy chemical applications to soils contaminated by nematodes, speed the recovery of fields placed under quarantine control and assist in the control of potato late blight using only half the amount of pesticides compared to susceptible genotypes...|$|R

The levels of pesticide residues in food are often determined {{as a means}} of assessing appropriate use as well as the level of human exposure to these chemicals and hence their potential human health hazards. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the concentration of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in beans samples collected from markets in Lagos State and compare these values with established safety values. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) samples purchased from different markets in Lagos State were analyzed for residues of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. Analysis was done using gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS) after careful extraction and cleanup. It was found that all the beans samples contained residues of one or more organophosphate or carbamate <b>pesticides.</b> <b>Mean</b> concentrations ranged from 19. 4 to 455. 9 μg/kg. Maximum residue limits (MRL) of the various pesticides (except for parathion) were exceeded in up to 10 % of samples. The estimated total diet intake (ETDI) for dichlorvos exceeded its maximum permissible intake (MPI) by 131 %. Organophosphate and carbamate pesticide residues are present in beans sold in Lagos markets and maximum residue limits for most of the pesticides are exceeded.

In this study, we assess {{the effectiveness of}} a three-stage on-farm biobed for treating pesticide contaminated waste water from a large (20 km 2) commercial arable estate. The facility consisted of an enclosed machinery wash-down unit (stage 1), a 49 m 2 lined compost-straw-topsoil biobed (stage 2), and a 200 m 2 drainage field with a trickle irrigation system (stage 3). Pesticide concentrations were analysed in water samples collected fortnightly between November 2013 and November 2015 from the biobed input and output sumps and from 20 porous pots buried at 45 cm and 90 cm depth within the drainage field. The results revealed that the biobed removed 68 – 98 % of individual pesticides within the contaminated washings, with <b>mean</b> total <b>pesticide</b> concentrations reducing by 91. 6 % between the biobed input and output sumps. Drainage field irrigation removed a further 68 – 99 % of individual <b>pesticides,</b> with total <b>mean</b> <b>pesticide</b> concentrations reducing by 98. 4 % and 97. 2 % in the 45 cm and 90 cm depth porous pots, respectively. The average total pesticide concentration at 45 cm depth in the drainage field (57 µg L- 1) was 760 times lower than the mean concentration recorded in the input sump (43, 334 µg L- 1).

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess cost {{dominance}} in direct inputs between arable crop-based systems using low or high pesticide levels per hectare.

Our only objective is to compare two optimal cost benchmarks for systems respectively defined with high or low pesticide levels per hectare by varying their scale and output mix. A robust approach frontier is introduced to control the influence of potential outliers and unobserved heterogeneity. Based on 707 French crop farms observed in 2008, our simulations show that agricultural practices using less pesticide per hectare are unambiguously more cost-competitive in terms of direct inputs while inducing no other substitution costs. This cost dominance is a robust phenomenon regardless of the size and scope of crop activities, which supports more ecofriendly practices...|$|R
40|$|Background: Information {{on cancer}} {{causation}} {{has come from}} investigation of the patterns of cancer in human populations and the induction of tumours in experimental animals following treatment with cancer-causing agents. It has been proven that genetic susceptibility may significantly alter the risk from environmental exposures. The most important human carcinogens include tobacco, asbestos, aflatoxins and ultraviolet light. Almost 20 % of cancers are associated with chronic infections, the most significant ones being hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV), papillomaviruses (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori. Pollution of air, water and soil is estimated to account for 4 – 7 % of all cancers in developed world. A small proportion of lung cancer (< 5 %) is attributable to outdoor air pollution by industrial effluent, engine exhaust products and other toxins. Chlorofluorocarbons cause destruction {{of the ozone layer}} and enhance the risk of skin cancer through increased ultraviolet radiation. Contamination of drinking water is not a general carcinogenic hazard, but high levels of arsenic and chlorination by-products in some communities carry a risk. Food may be contaminated by natural or man-made toxins, including substances shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals and, in some cases, in humans. Naturallyoccurring carcinogens include mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins, which contribute to causation of liver cancer. Food can be contaminated by residual <b>pesticides.</b> Conclusions: <b>Means</b> to reduce and, in some cases, eliminate risk of cancer include elimination of carcinogenic factor (asbestos) enforced by regulation and reduction of exposure or use of preventive and prophylactic measures (Hepatitis B, HPV vaccination, avoiding of sun). </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} pesticide leaching model, PEARL, {{in combination}} with a geographical information system was {{used to calculate the}} leaching potential of pesticides into local surface waters and the regional groundwater. Calculations were performed for 6405 plots, which are unique combinations of spatially distributed model inputs. To have the seepage and drainage fluxes correctly described, the model was loosely coupled with a regional groundwater model. Simulations were carried out for four pesticides with different properties. Results showed that, generally, the average fluxes of pesticide into local surface waters were higher than the average fluxes of pesticide into the regional groundwater. Discharge by rapid drainage mechanisms (i. e. tube drainage and surface drainage) dominated. For the four pesticides, different spatial patterns of leaching and discharge by drainage water were predicted. It was shown that the spatial pattern was affected by a large number of interacting processes, and that the relative importance of these processes differed between the four example pesticides. This should be kept in mind when applying the USES system, which describes the leaching of pesticides {{on the basis of a}} limited number of pesticide parameters. Frequency distributions of the leaching concentration were compared with results from the first tier of the Dutch pesticide registration procedure, which comes down to the application of a single standard scenario. For two pesticides, the first tier was not strict enough.
