40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> initial velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> initial velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> velocities compared to random initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> the use of initial velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the initial <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> initial velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R

Three types of <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> navigation systems can not only be used as navigational aids for the underground miners in the daily production, they also can provide safe routes of evacuation for the miners when disaster strikes. The <b>positioning</b> <b>and</b> navigation system based on Wireless Ethernet in those three types system has the best function and so it well require further investigation.

These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth <b>position,</b> <b>and</b> Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33.|$|E
