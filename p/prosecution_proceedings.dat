40|$|On September 30, 2013, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board {{issued a}} troubling {{decision}} in In re Bottega Veneta Int’l S. a. r. l. Viewed {{in a broader}} context, the decision reflects the Board’s growing reluctance to apply the doctrine of “aesthetic functionality” in ex parte <b>prosecution</b> <b>proceedings</b> to bar the issuance of potentially anticompetitive trade-dress registrations. The TTAB gives its imprimatur to the dubious “trade dress” at issue in Bottega Veneta through procedural tactics whose novelty and import have gone largely unacknowledged — specifically, (1) the Board’s declaration of its intention to resolve “doubts” as to aesthetic functionality in favor of applicants, and (2) the Board’s disposal of concerns about product-design monopolization through reliance on supposedly limiting conditions agreed to by the applicant, but which the federal courts will not observe or enforce. As such, In re Bottega Veneta — despite its technical status as a mere “non-precedential” decision by an agency whose determination can theoretically be revisited by the federal courts — will improperly hinder marketplace competition and restrict creative freedom among designers.

[...] "Process," [...] as used in this context, includes not only the [...] "service of process," [...] i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court.
