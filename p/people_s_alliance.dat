S. military spending reduction by the sequestration. The research question of this thesis is this: How has U. S. military spending affected the cohesion of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> since 1953 ? No studies have researched the cohesion of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> through robust empirical analysis. To answer this question empirically, this thesis examines three indicators for measuring the cohesion of the ROK-U. S. alliance: institutionalization, capacity of the USFK, and the ROK-U. S. combined exercises. In addition, this thesis analyzes three categories of the U. S. military spending to determine whether a certain relation exists between the cohesion of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> and U. <b>S.</b> military spending. Through empirical analysis, this thesis concludes that there is no certain relationship between the cohesion of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> and U. <b>S.</b> military spending. Comparing two variables, the cohesion of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> and U. <b>S.</b> military spending, this thesis found a striking difference between the Cold War and the Post-Cold War. Based on the variable findings, this thesis explores the implications for future tasks for the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> under new security circumstances.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the viability of}} the South Korean balancer policy in terms of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> and suggests directions in which the alliance should proceed. The balancer policy announced by President Roh in March 2005 implies that, if it is adopted, South Korea will play the role of a balancer between the regional powers in Northeast Asia. The so-called balancer policy {{has been a source of}} controversy since its announcement, as the pros and cons of South Korea's balancer policy have been debated both at home and abroad. The balancer policy announced by the president as a national foreign sttrategy is worth consideration because it has provided South Korea with an opportunity to think about its future foreign policies in terms of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance.</b> Considering that the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> has been a linchpin of South Korean foreign policy for the last half century and that the alliance has not only deterred North Korean aggression but has also helped create a stable environment for economic development and democratic consolidation in South Korea, it is clear that any policy options which may deteriorate the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> should be avoided. Whatever policy option that is adopted should contribute to the strengthening of the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> by overcoming currently emerging frictions and mistrust between the two countries.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between R. O. K. -U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> became indifferent {{by the end}} of Cold War due to the goals of alliance were uncertain. In the credit of the corporation dealing with North Korea issues again between Washinton and Seoul after the mid of 1990 s, it alleviated the relationship of alliance. Since Washinton and Seoul have different thoughts toward Pyongyang, the relationship and cohesion of R. O. K. -U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> have transformed during Kim Dae-jung, Roh Moo-hyung, and Lee Myung-bak. From the perspective of Patricia Weitsman's alliance cohesion, the R. O. K. -U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> cohesion will be examed from both of external threat and internal threat aspects. The evaluation of these aspects will be carried out by four variables: comprehensive ability, aggressive intention, security commitment, and joint operation. In conclusion, the development of R. O. K. -U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> cohesion attributes from the recognitions towards Pyongyang, the strategies and operations between Washinton and Seoul. The future of R. O. K. -U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> will be influenced by these variables. 冷戰時期美國圍堵政策下所建立的韓美同盟，伴隨著冷戰的結束，出現同盟目標不明確的過渡時期，韓美同盟在 90 年代初期雙方互動趨於冷淡。在 90 年代中期後，韓美同盟再度攜手合作處理北韓問題，同盟關係出現緩和現象。從南韓總統金大中於 1998 年上台後，繼任總統盧武鉉，直到李明博上台為止等，在三任南韓總統任期中，韓美同盟運作出現關係和緩、冰點和增溫等狀況。韓美同盟面對著同樣的北韓威脅，卻出現不一樣的思維，導致同盟關係及同盟內聚力程度的轉變。 本文藉由Patricia Weitsman同盟內聚力觀點，以同盟「外在威脅」層面和「內在威脅」層面；及其同盟中「綜合能力」、「侵略意圖」、「安全承諾」與「聯合行動」等四項指標，評估同盟兩大層面的程度高低，藉以解析同盟內聚力程度與同盟類型。最後，本文發現韓美同盟在南韓三任總統期間，面對北韓威脅認知的變化，及同盟內部盟國的政策、實際行動等因素，造成同盟內聚力的轉變，進而影響到韓美同盟的運作。未來觀察韓美同盟發展的重點，仍端賴於兩國對於威脅國的認知與目標，及同盟之間的實際合作而定。第一章 緒論 [...] 1 第一節 研究動機與目的 [...] 1 第二節 文獻探討 [...] 5 第三節 研究途徑、架構與方法 [...] . 13 第四節 研究範圍與限制 [...] . 20 第五節 章節安排 [...] . 22 第二章 同盟理論回顧 [...] . 24 第一節 同盟理論回顧 [...] . 24 第二節 Patricia Weitsman同盟內聚力觀點 [...] 36 第三章 韓美同盟內聚力檢視－金大中時期 [...] . 47 第一節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：綜合能力 [...] . 47 第二節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：意圖認知 [...] . 61 第三節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：安全承諾 [...] . 72 第四節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：聯合行動 [...] . 82 第五節 韓美同盟內聚力分析－防範同盟 [...] . 92 第四章 韓美同盟內聚力檢視－盧武鉉時期 [...] . 98 第一節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：綜合能力 [...] . 98 第二節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：意圖認知 [...] 107 第三節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：安全承諾 [...] 116 第四節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：聯合行動 [...] 125 第五節 韓美同盟內聚力分析－限制同盟 [...] 134 第五章 韓美同盟內聚力檢視－李明博時期 [...] 140 第一節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：綜合能力 [...] 140 第二節 檢視韓美同盟外在威脅：意圖認知 [...] 142 第三節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：安全承諾 [...] 148 第四節 檢視韓美同盟內在威脅：聯合行動 [...] 152 第五節 小結 [...] 155 第六章 結論 [...] 158 第一節 研究發現 [...] 158 第二節 未來發展不確定因素 [...] 166 參考書目 [...] . 170 壹、中文部份 [...] . 170 貳、西文部份 [...] . 17...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the U. <b>S.</b> -Japan security <b>alliance.</b> The strategic and security {{environment of the}} Northeast Asia region is currently undergoing a rapid change. The strong position of the United States in this region is challenged by China, whose ongoing territorial disputes with Japan may test the resilience of the U. <b>S.</b> -Japan <b>alliance.</b> Although the U. S. -Japan partnership is commonly denominated as an <b>alliance</b> (U. <b>S.</b> -Japan <b>Alliance,</b> Pacific Alliance), it might not fulfil all the basic attributes {{of the concept of}} military alliance. This thesis analyses the U. <b>S.</b> -Japan <b>alliance</b> in terms of the concept of military alliance and its essential elements. The concept of alliance as understood by this paper is defined in the first chapter. The second chapter applies this concept {{to the nature of the}} U. <b>S.</b> -Japan <b>alliance</b> and subsequently discusses to what degree each of the parties of the alliance meets the requirements of the essential elements of the concept. By investigating how the reality of the U. <b>S.</b> -Japan <b>alliance</b> corresponds with the concept of military alliance, this thesis offers the basis for further research of the U.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn 2010, North Korea launched an artillery bombardment of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, killing four, wounding 18, and damaging over 100 buildings. Despite conventional military superiority, the Republic of Korea-United States (ROK-U. <b>S.)</b> <b>alliance</b> failed to deter this significant North Korean low-intensity provocation (LIP). This thesis examines the Yeonpyeong deterrence failure {{to ask how}} the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> can deter North Korean LIP in the future. It examines the requirements for conventional deterrence, identifies traits that distinguish conventional and nuclear deterrence, and develops an original matrix of conventional deterrence criteria {{that can be applied}} to specific cases. The thesis then utilizes this matrix for a structured case study of the Yeonpyeong bombardment. The thesis finds that most of the criteria for successful conventional deterrence were absent prior to the Yeonpyeong bombardment, indicating multiple reasons for deterrence failure. Among other factors, the alliance ignored intelligence regarding increased North Korean military deployments near the island, and had not demonstrated a likelihood of response in similar incidents in the past. The conclusions provide numerous lessons applying to both future studies of conventional deterrence effectiveness and the policy requirements for the ROK-U. <b>S.</b> <b>alliance</b> to successfully deter LIP by an increasingly dangerous North Korean regime.
