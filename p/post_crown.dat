40|$|The {{introduction}} of an intraradicular composite reinforcing technique, {{in conjunction with}} the reestablishment of matching post canal spaces, has allowed compromised, root-filled teeth to be restored with functional, esthetic <b>post</b> <b>crowns.</b> This clinical case report suggests that reconstituted post canals, in accurately adapting to passive, parallel-sided, matching, and well-fitting posts, can enhance the retention of <b>post</b> <b>crowns.</b> Other factors of clinical importance relating to the resin-reinforced technique are discussed, including fracture resistance, depth of polymerization, dentin adhesion, polymerization shrinkage, and coronal microleakage...|$|R

50|$|Timber framing is {{a general}} term for {{building}} with wooden posts and beams. The term post is the namesake of other general names for timber framing such as post-and-beam, post-and-girt construction and more specific types of timber framing such as Post and lintel, post-frame, post in ground, and ridge-post construction. In roof construction such as king post, queen <b>post,</b> <b>crown</b> post framing.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} if immediate {{reconstruction of}} fresh extraction sockets ’ lost buccal wall {{would reduce the}} possibilities of implant surface exposure and improve the treatment predictability. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of Healthy patients harboring periodontally compromised anterior teeth that were planned for extraction and subsequent implant therapy were the target of our study. All the sockets included witnessed loss of the buccal bone plate. Seventy-two anterior sockets were grafted with xenogenic grafts to reconstruct such defects immediately after the extractions. 9 to 13 months later, the alveolar ridges were surgically exposed and implants were placed. Results: All the surgical sites did not show any labial plate thinning, dehiscence, or fenestration {{at the time of}} implant placement. Moreover, no gingival recession and implant metal show was noticed up to 39 months <b>post</b> <b>crown</b> placement. Conclusion: Immediate reconstructions of lost buccal plate in fresh extraction sockets reduces the chances of implant surface exposure up to two years <b>post</b> <b>crown</b> placement. </p...|$|E

40|$|Root {{fractures}} {{that occur}} at the cervical margin do not always heal predictably, even following a period of splinting. This often leaves margins either sub-gingival or sub-crestal. This provides an unsatisfactory situation for restoring the remaining root as restorations will impinge on the biological width. Provided a root is long enough to support a <b>post</b> <b>crown,</b> then orthodontic extrusion to provide sufficient supra-gingival tooth tissue is a useful treatment option to consider. A {{review of the literature}} on orthodontic extrusion is considered in conjunction with a case report of the management of a young male who fractured a canine and lateral incisor whilst playing cricket. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Trauma to upper anterior teeth is frequently seen in practice. One treatment option in the management of sub-crestal cervical root fractures is orthodontic extrusion, rather than removal of the tooth. [References: 27...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the association between periapical health status with the quality of the root filling and was the coronal restoration and identify the predictors of periapical lesion. Subjects and Methods: It was conducted among 197 adult patients who visited Kuwait University. Periapical status was measured by periapical index. The presence or absence of periapical lesions was evaluated using panoramic radiographs. Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Chi-square tests were performed to assess associations between categorical variables. Results: Of the 4, 841 teeth examined, 2. 7 % were root-filled (n = 130). Thirty-four percent of the root-filled teeth (n = 44), and 3 % of the nonroot-filled teeth (n = 141 of 4711) exhibited periapical radiolucency. Of the root filled teeth, 49 % were judged to be inadequate (n = 64) and 91 % of the inadequate ones had short root filling (n = 58). The presence of periapical lesion was significantly predicted by inadequate coronal restoration, dental caries, periodontal bone loss, and the presence of <b>post</b> <b>crown.</b> Conclusion: This study demonstrated a large number of untreated teeth with periapical pathology. The quality of root fillings in this population appeared to be poor and was significantly associated with a high prevalence of apical periodontitis...|$|E

Methods: This study is a pre and post test experimental research. Research subjects were 9 patients who experience gingivitis <b>post</b> acrylic <b>crown</b> insertion and divided in three groups (treatment with roselle gel, negative control, and positive control).

The change of MMP- 8 mRNA expression is tested using Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method. The results then statistically tested using paired T test to see the effect of rosella extract toward MMP- 8 activity. Result: The MMP - 8 mRNA expression in gingivitis <b>post</b> acrylic <b>crown</b> insertion crown in the experimental group is significantly decreased after application of roselle extract gel 10 %, which also seen in the positive control group, but no changes observed in the negative control group.

40|$|Abstract: Due to an {{increasing}} interest in esthetics {{and concerns about}} toxic and allergic reactions to certain alloys, zirconia was proposed as a new ceramic material in the later part of 20 th century. It has become a popular alternative to alumina as biomaterial and is being used in dental applications for fabricating endodontic <b>posts,</b> <b>crown</b> and bridge restorations and implant abutments. It has also been applied for the fabrication of esthetic orthodontic brackets. This article presents a brief history, dental applications and new methods for fabrication of zirconia improving its mechanical properties. Additionally, the bonding between zirconia and resin cements as well as conventional cementation has been discussed. The methods of {{the improvement of the}} bonding strength have also been highlighted...|$|R
