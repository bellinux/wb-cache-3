For example, the decibel is a unit quantifying signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in <b>psychophysics,</b> and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E

25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} <b>psychophysics</b> {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of <b>Psychophysics</b> challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Psychoacoustics is the {{scientific}} study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of <b>psychophysics.</b> Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.|$|E
25|$|It {{is claimed}} that, {{on the morning}} of 22 October 1850, Fechner awoke with a sudden new insight into how to study the mind. Moving away from Wundtarian introspection and basing his work on that of Weber, he {{developed}} his psychophysical Fechner scale. Each year, psychophysicists celebrate 22 October as the anniversary of Fechner's new insight as Fechner Day. Celebrations to mark Fechner Day were organized by the International Society for <b>Psychophysics</b> and held in Fechner's home city of Leipzig in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, ROC curves were {{employed}} in <b>psychophysics</b> to assess human (and occasionally non-human animal) detection of weak signals. In medicine, ROC analysis has been extensively used {{in the evaluation of}} diagnostic tests. ROC curves are also used extensively in epidemiology and medical research and are frequently mentioned in conjunction with evidence-based medicine. In radiology, ROC analysis is a common technique to evaluate new radiology techniques. In the social sciences, ROC analysis is often called the ROC Accuracy Ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models.|$|E
25|$|Psychoacoustics is the {{scientific}} study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). Topics of study include perception of the pitch, timbre, loudness and duration of musical sounds and the relevance of such studies for music cognition or the perceived structure of music; and auditory illusions and how humans localize sound, which can have relevance for musical composition and the design of venues for music performance. Psychoacoustics is a branch of <b>psychophysics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual areas, like V1, is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of <b>psychophysics</b> and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, <b>psychophysics</b> has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of form perception. Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' akinetopsia patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or color perception, making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are functionally independent. Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|E
25|$|Contrasted with Germany and the United States, {{psychology}} had a slow {{birth in}} the UK. The idea that human behaviour is follows repeatable patterns, {{and that it}} is possible to discover these patterns or laws by the use of scientific methods, is capable of producing deep passion. In 1877 James Ward proposed that a laboratory should be established in Cambridge to study <b>psychophysics</b> (the relation between the physical properties of stimuli and experienced sensations). This proposal was rejected by the Cambridge Senate on the grounds that it `would insult religion by putting the human soul in a pair of scales’. Psychology of a philosophic type in the tradition of British Empiricism has been taught at UCL since the appointment of George Croom Robertson to the Grote Chair of Mind and Logic in 1866.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, and the United States soon {{followed}} Wundt {{in setting up}} laboratories. G. Stanley Hall who studied with Wundt, formed a psychology lab at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, which became internationally influential. Hall, in turn, trained Yujiro Motora, who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing <b>psychophysics,</b> to the Imperial University of Tokyo. Wundt assistant Hugo Münsterberg taught psychology at Harvard to students such as Narendra Nath Sen Gupta—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and laboratory at the University of Calcutta. Wundt students Walter Dill Scott, Lightner Witmer, and James McKeen Cattell worked on developing tests for mental ability. Catell, who also studied with eugenicist Francis Galton, went on to found the Psychological Corporation. Wittmer focused on mental testing of children; Scott, on selection of employees.|$|E

Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of <b>psychophysics</b> by Lionel Robbins, George Stigler, and Friedrich Hayek, though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of [...] "behavioral economics".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{dissertation}} research, Boas' methodology included investigating how different intensities of light created different colors when interacting with {{different types of}} water, however he encountered difficulty {{in being able to}} objectively perceive slight differences in the color of water and as a result became intrigued by this problem of perception and its influence on quantitative measurements. Boas, due to tone deafness, encountered difficulties studying tonal languages such as Laguna. Boas had already been interested in Kantian philosophy since taking a course on aesthetics with Kuno Fischer at Heidelberg. These factors led Boas to consider pursuing research in <b>psychophysics,</b> which explores the relationship between the psychological and the physical, after completing his doctorate, but he had no training in psychology. [...] Boas did publish six articles on <b>psychophysics</b> during his year of military service (1882-1883), but ultimately he decided to focus on geography, primarily so he could receive sponsorship for his planned Baffin Island expedition.|$|E

50|$|Stevens's {{power law}} is a {{proposed}} relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and its perceived intensity or strength. It is often considered to supersede the Weber-Fechner law {{on the basis that}} it describes a wider range of sensations, although critics argue that the validity of the law is contingent on the virtue of approaches to the measurement of perceived intensity that are employed in relevant experiments. In addition, a distinction has been made between local <b>psychophysics,</b> where stimuli are discriminated only with a certain probability, and global <b>psychophysics,</b> where the stimuli would be discriminated correctly with near certainty (Luce & Krumhansl, 1988).
