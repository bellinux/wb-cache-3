50|$|Scholarly {{interest}} {{in the history of}} the evolution of the bowl of the clay tobacco pipe, extends as far back as 1863. In the 1860s antiquaries attempted to date clay <b>pipe</b> <b>bowls</b> by their evolving shapes and sizes.|$|R
50|$|The {{trade of}} Ghotki was chiefly in wheat, Cotton, Rice, juar, bajri, grain, indigo, sugar-cane, wool, oil, and ghee. The Lobars {{of this town}} were famous for their {{manufacture}} of <b>pipe</b> <b>bowls,</b> rings, and pots of various kinds. Wood-carving and colouring were also carried on.|$|R
60|$|They were seven. A grizzled rustic {{sat in the}} far corner; {{his empty}} <b>pipe,</b> <b>bowl</b> downwards, jutted like a handle from his face, all bleared with the smear of nothingness that grows on those who pass {{their lives in the}} current of hard facts. Next to him, a ruddy, heavy-shouldered man was {{discussing}} with a grey-haired, hatchet-visaged person the condition of their gardens; and Shelton watched their eyes till it occurred to him how curious a look was in them--a watchful friendliness, an allied distrust--and that their voices, cheerful, even jovial, seemed to be cautious all the time. His glance strayed off, and almost rebounded from the semi-Roman, slightly cross, and wholly self-complacent face of a stout lady in a black-and-white costume, who was reading the Strand Magazine, while her other, sleek, plump hand, freed from its black glove, and ornamented with a thick watch-bracelet, rested on her lap. A younger, bright-cheeked, and self-conscious female was sitting next her, looking at the pale girl who had just got in.|$|E
6000|$|But pretty Polly Gookin felt not thus. The pair {{were now}} promenading the room: Feathertop with his dainty stride {{and no less}} dainty grimace, the girl with a native maidenly grace, just touched, not spoiled, by a {{slightly}} affected manner, which seemed caught from the perfect artifice of her companion. The longer the interview continued, the more charmed was pretty Polly, until, within {{the first quarter of}} an hour (as the old magistrate noted by his watch), she was evidently beginning to be in love. Nor need it have been witchcraft that subdued her in such a hurry; the poor child's heart, it may be, was so very fervent that it melted her with its own warmth as reflected from the hollow semblance of a lover. No matter what Feathertop said, his words found depth and reverberation in her ear; no matter what he did, his action was heroic to her eye. And by this time it is to be supposed there was a blush on Polly's cheek, a tender smile about her mouth and a liquid softness in her glance; while the star kept coruscating on Feathertop's breast, and the little demons careered with more frantic merriment than ever about the circumference of his <b>pipe</b> <b>bowl.</b> O pretty Polly Gookin, why should these imps rejoice so madly that a silly maiden's heart was about to be given to a shadow! Is it so unusual a misfortune, so rare a triumph? ...|$|E
60|$|After {{these few}} words of introduction, the worshipful {{magistrate}} immediately quitted the room. But, even in that brief moment, had the fair Polly glanced aside at her father instead of devoting herself wholly to the brilliant guest, she might have taken warning of some mischief nigh at hand. The old man was nervous, fidgety, and very pale. Purposing a smile of courtesy, he had deformed {{his face with a}} sort of galvanic grin, which, when Feathertop's back was turned, he exchanged for a scowl, at the same time shaking his fist and stamping his gouty foot--an incivility which brought its retribution along with it. The truth appears to have been that Mother Rigby's word of introduction, whatever it might be, had operated far more on the rich merchant's fears than on his good will. Moreover, being a man of wonderfully acute observation, he had noticed that these painted figures on the bowl of Feathertop's pipe were in motion. Looking more closely he became convinced that these figures were a party of little demons, each duly provided with horns and a tail, and dancing hand in hand, with gestures of diabolical merriment, round the circumference of the <b>pipe</b> <b>bowl.</b> As if to confirm his suspicions, while Master Gookin ushered his guest along a dusky passage from his private room to the parlor, the star on Feathertop's breast had scintillated actual flames, and threw a flickering gleam upon the wall, the ceiling, and the floor.|$|E

It {{can be found}} in a typical Amsterdam canal house along the Prinsengracht, between the Leidseplein and the National Museum (the Rijksmuseum).

50|$|Bowl {{parks are}} {{designed}} to emulate and improve upon the pool skating experience. Skaters in bowl parks can move around the park without taking their feet off the board to push.

50|$|The <b>bowls</b> {{of tobacco}} <b>pipes</b> are {{commonly}} made of briar wood, meerschaum, corncob or clay. Less common are other dense-grained woods such as cherry, olive, maple, mesquite, oak, and bog-wood.

50|$|The {{wood of the}} {{mountain}} laurel is heavy and strong but brittle, with a close, straight grain.

50|$|The stone {{implements}} found include arrowheads, knives, {{and scraping}} tools of chipped flint and axes of a hard, granular stone.

There were also other, generally smaller copper beads, conical decorations, and copper plaques, as well as shell beads and pendants. Carved stone <b>pipe</b> <b>bowls</b> were also found, as well as animal skins and pottery.|$|R

Social, economic and political activity was most likely centered in the souq. The discovery of numerous ceramic tobacco <b>pipe</b> <b>bowls</b> indicate a reluctant acceptance and growing social addiction to smoking tobacco.
