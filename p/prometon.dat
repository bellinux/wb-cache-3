40|$|Abstract—Prometon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consistently}} detected herbicides in the U. S. environment. However, no previous assessment of the potential for <b>prometon</b> or related methoxytriazine herbicides to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been conducted. This study used an array of in vitro bioassays to assess whether <b>prometon,</b> atraton, terbumeton, or secbumeton might act as potent (ant) agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen, androgen, or glucocorticoid receptors or as aromatase inhibitors or inducers in vitro. Potential effects of <b>prometon</b> were also evaluated using a 21 -d fathead minnow reproduction assay. Concentrations of methoxytriazines, as great as 1 mg/L (4. 4 �M), did not induce significant dioxin-like responses in H 4 IIE-luc cells, estrogenic responses in MVLN cells, or androgen or glucocorticoid receptor–mediated responses in MDA-kb 2 cells, nor did the methoxytriazines significantly affect aromatase activity in vitro. In the fathead minnow assay, exposure to 20, 200, or 1, 000 �g prometon/L significantly reduced the weight of the male fat pad (an androgen-responsive tissue) relative to body weight.

40|$|Abstract. An {{electrochemical}} DNA-biosensor {{has been}} used to investigate the interactions between DNA and members of a group of ten derivatives of 1, 3, 5 -triazine herbicides: chloro-s-triazines (atrazine, propazine, terbutylazin, and cyanazin), thiomethyl-s-triazines (ametryn, prometryn, terbutryn, and simetryn), and methoxy-s-triazines (<b>prometon</b> and terbumeton). A UV spectrophotometric study of this group of herbicides was also undertaken. Of this group only cyanazin could be oxidized in aqueous solution using a glassy carbon electrode. Use of the electrochemical DNA-biosensor revealed the occurrence of a time-dependent interaction of all the herbicides with DNA, via the appearance of guanine, guanosine, and adenosine oxidation signals that correspond to DNA damage.

40|$|To improve {{understanding}} of the factors affecting pesticide occurrence in ground water, patterns of detection were examined for selected herbicides, based primarily on results from the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program. The NAWQA data were derived from 2227 sites (wells and springs) sampled in 20 major hydro- logic basins across the USA from 1993 to 1995. Results are presented for six high-use herbicides—atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -iso-propylamino- s-triazine), cyanazine (2 -[4 -chloro- 6 -ethylamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl]amino]- 2 -methylpropionitrile), simazine (2 -chloro- 4, 6 -bis- [ethylamino]-s-triazine), alachlor (2 -chloro-N-[2, 6 -diethylphenyl]-N- [methoxymethyl]acetamide), acetochlor (2 -chloro-N-[ethoxymethyl]- N-[2 -ethyl- 6 -methylphenyl]acetamide), and metolachlor (2 -chloro-N- [2 -ethyl- 6 -methylphenyl]-N-[2 -methoxy- 1 -methylethyl]acetamide) — {{as well as for}} <b>prometon</b> (2, 4 -bis[isopropylamino]- 6 -methoxy-s-triazine), a nonagricultural herbicide detected frequently during the study.

Well selection was based on soil type, pounds of imidacloprid applied, depth to water, and well location. From February to March 2009, the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) sampled thirty-four wells in Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties for imidacloprid and other herbicides on the “triazine screen ” (hexazinone, tebuthiuron, simazine, bromacil, <b>prometon,</b> atrazine, norflurazon, and diuron). Monitoring for these other herbicides allows DPR to assess the performance of our ground water protection program. No residues of imidacloprid, imidacloprid degradates, or herbicides on the “triazine screen ” were detected {{in any of the}} wells tested. These results are similar to a 2004 imidacloprid monitoring study that also yielded no detections of the parent or its degradates. If the use of imidacloprid increases or is applied in a way that facilitates leaching to ground water, the DPR may conduct further monitoring of imidacloprid in the future...|$|E
40|$|Oryzalin, {{an active}} {{ingredient}} on the Ground Water Protection List (GWPL), {{was selected for}} well monitoring because of its threat to ground water as predicted by a prioritization scheme {{that is based on}} use intensity and modeling results simulating movement of pesticides to ground water. Well selection was focused on the heaviest oryzalin use in sections of land that were considered vulnerable to offsite movement of pesticide residues. From December 2010 to April 2011, the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) sampled 41 wells in Fresno, Kern, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, and Tulare counties for oryzalin and several other herbicides previously found in California ground water by DPR (hexazinone, tebuthiuron, simazine, bromacil, <b>prometon,</b> atrazine, norflurazon, and diuron). DPR did not detect oryzalin in the sampled wells, yet several of the other monitored pesticides were detected in 18 wells. Oryzalin use in most of the sections containing these 18 wells and in the sections containing the remaining 23 wells was substantially heavier than the use of the pesticides that were detected. Furthermore, compared to the detected pesticides, there were no unique oryzalin use patterns that could account for its lack of detection in ground water. This suggested that it was oryzalin’...|$|E
40|$|A {{selective}} extraction technique {{based on the}} combination of membrane assisted solvent extraction and molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction for triazine herbicides in food samples was developed. Simazine, atrazine, <b>prometon,</b> terbumeton, terbuthylazine and prometryn were extracted from aqueous food samples into a hydrophobic polypropylene membrane bag containing 1000 mu L of toluene as the acceptor phase along with 100 mg of MIP particles. In the acceptor phase, the compounds were re-extracted onto MIP particles. The extraction technique was optimised {{for the type of}} organic acceptor solvent, amount of molecularly imprinted polymers particles in the organic acceptor phase, extraction time and addition of salt. Toluene as the acceptor phase was found to give higher triazine binding onto MIP particles compared to hexane and cyclohexane. Extraction time of 120 min and 100 mg of MIP were found to be optimum parameters. Addition of salt increased the extraction efficiency for more polar triazines. The selectivity of the technique was demonstrated by extracting spiked cow pea and corn extracts where clean chromatograms were obtained compared to only membrane assisted solvent extraction or only molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction. The study revealed that this combination may be a simple way of selectively extracting compounds in complex samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Except for the thiocarbamate herbicides (molinate and EPTC), all other CCL chemicals (linuron, diuron, <b>prometon,</b> RDX, 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene, 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene and nitrobenzene) show low reactivity toward ozone. The general magnitude of ozone reactivity of the CCL chemicals {{can be explained by}} their structures and the electrophilic nature of ozone reactions. The CCL chemicals (except RDX) are highly reactive toward OH radicals as demonstrated by their high kOH,M values. Ozonation at low pH, which involves mainly the direct ozone reaction, is only efficient for the removal of the thiocarbamates. Ozonation at high pH and O 3 /H 2 O 2 AOP will be highly efficient for the treatment of all chemicals in this study except RDX, which shows the lowest OH radical reactivity. Removal of a contaminant does not mean complete mineralization and reaction byproducts may be a problem if they are recalcitrant and are likely to cause health concerns...|$|E

Th e data analysis evaluated samples collected from {{a total of}} 362 wells located in 12 local well networks characterizing shallow ground water in agricultural areas and six local well networks characterizing the drinking water resource in areas of variable land use. Each well network was sampled once during 1993 – 1995 and once during 2001 – 2003. Th e networks {{provide an overview of}} conditions across a wide range of hydrogeologic settings and in major agricultural areas that vary in dominant crop type and pesticide use. Of about 80 pesticide compounds analyzed, only six compounds were detected in ground water from at least 10 wells during both sampling events. Th ese compounds were the triazine herbicides atrazine, simazine, and prometon; the acetanilide herbicide metolachlor; the urea herbicide tebuthiuron; and an atrazine degradate, deethylatrazine (DEA). Observed concentrations of these compounds generally were < 0. 12 μg L− 1. At individual wells, changes in concentrations typically were < 0. 02 μg L− 1. Data analysis incorporated adjustments for changes in laboratory recovery as assessed through laboratory spikes. In wells yielding detectable concentrations of atrazine, DEA, and <b>prometon,</b> concentrations were signifi cantly lower (α = 0. 1) in 2001 – 2003 than in 1993 – 1995, whereas detection frequency of these compounds did not change signifi cantly.

40|$|Evaluating {{long-term}} temporal {{trends in}} regional ground-water quality {{is complicated by}} variable hydrogeologic conditions and typically slow fl ow, and such trends have rarely been directly measured. Ground-water samples were collected over near-decadal and annual intervals from unconfi ned aquifers in agricultural areas of the Mid-Atlantic region, including fractured carbonate rocks in the Great Valley, Potomac River Basin, and unconsolidated sediments on the Delmarva Peninsula. Concentrations of nitrate and selected pesticides and degradates were compared among sampling events and to apparent recharge dates. Observed temporal trends are related to changes in land use and chemical applications, and to hydrogeology and climate. Insignifi cant diff erences in nitrate concentrations in the Great Valley between 1993 and 2002 are consistent with relatively steady fertilizer application during respective recharge periods and are likely related to drought conditions in the later sampling period. Detecting trends in Great Valley ground water is complicated by long open boreholes characteristic of wells sampled in this setting which facilitate signifi cant ground-water mixing. Decreasing atrazine and <b>prometon</b> concentrations, however, refl ect reported changes in usage. On the Delmarva Peninsula between 1988 and 2001, median nitrate concentrations increased 2 mg per liter in aerobic ground water, refl ecting increasing fertilizer applications. Correlations between selected pesticide compounds and apparent recharge date are similarly related to changing land use and chemical application. Observed trends in the two settings demonstrate the importance of considering hydrogeology and recharge date along with changing land and chemical uses when interpreting trends in regional ground-water quality...|$|E
40|$|Leaching, the {{movement}} of water and chemicals into deeper soil layers and groundwater is a subject of worldwide interest because {{a high percentage of}} drinking water is extracted from groundwater. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential leaching and persistence of sixteen pesticides (one fungicide, three nematicides/insecticides, and twelve herbicides) for three Mediterranean agricultural soils with similar texture (clay loam) but different organic matter content (1. 2 - 3. 1 %). Adsorption was studied in batch experiments and leaching was tested using disturbed soil columns (40 cm length × 4 cm i. d.). Degradation studies were carried out during 120 days under laboratory conditions. Mobility experiments showed that pesticides can be grouped according to their potential leaching. Thus, pesticides showing medium leachability were included in group 1 (referred as G 1) while those with high leachability were termed as G 2. The differences observed in the leachability can be attributed to the different organic carbon (OC) content in the soils (0. 7 - 1. 8 %). Values of log K OC were higher in the order: soil C > soil B > soil A, which agrees with the OC content in each soil. The calculated half-lives ranged from 4. 2 days for carbofuran in soil A to 330 days for <b>prometon</b> in soil C. As a general rule, when higher OC content in the soil the greater persistence of the pesticide was observed as a consequence of the increased adsorption. The first order kinetics model satisfactorily explains the disappearance of the studied pesticides in the soil. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{first phase}} of {{intensive}} data collection for the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) was completed during 1993 - 1995 in 20 major hydrologic basins of the United States. Groundwater land-use studies, designed to sample recently recharged groundwater (generally within 10 years) beneath specific land-use and hydrogeologic settings, are {{a major component of}} the groundwater quality assessment for NAWQA. Pesticide results from the 41 land use studies conducted during 1993 - 1995 indicate that pesticides were commonly detected in shallow groundwater, having been found at 54. 4 % of the 1034 sites sampled in agricultural and urban settings across the United States. Pesticide concentrations were generally low, with over 95 % of the detections at concentrations less than 1 μg/L. Of the 46 pesticide compounds examined, 39 were detected. The compounds detected most frequently were atrazine (38. 2 %), deethylatrazine (34. 2 %), simazine (18. 0 %), metolachlor (14. 6 %), and <b>prometon</b> (13. 9 %). Statistically significant relations were observed between frequencies of detection and the use, mobility, and persistence of these compounds. Pesticides were commonly detected in both agricultural (56. 4 %; 813 sites) and urban (46. 6 %; 221 sites) settings. Frequent detections of pesticides in urban areas indicate that, {{as is the case with}} agricultural pesticide use in agricultural areas, urban and suburban pesticide use significantly contribute to pesticide occurrence in shallow groundwater. Although pesticides were detected in groundwater sampled in urban areas and all nine of the agricultural land-use categories examined, significant variations in occurrence were observed among these categories. Maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water were exceeded for only one pesticide (atrazine, 3 μg/L) at a single location. However, MCLs have been established for only 25 of the 46 pesticide compounds examined, do not cover pesticide degradates, and, at present, do not take into account additive or synergistic effects of combinations of pesticide compounds or potential effects on nearby aquatic ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Nearly all rural {{inhabitants}} {{and livestock}} in the Upper Republican Natural Resources District (URNRD) in southwestern Nebraska use ground water {{that can be}} affected by elevated nitrate concentrations. The development of ground-water irrigation in this area has increased the vulnerability of ground water {{to the introduction of}} fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals. In 1998, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Upper Republican Natural Resources District, began a study to characterize the quality of ground water in the Upper Republican Natural Resources District area with respect to physical properties and concentrations of major ions, coliform bacteria, nitrate, and pesticides, and to assess the presence of nitrogen concentrations in the unsaturated zone. At selected well sites, the ground-water characterization also included tritium and nitrogen-isotope analyses to provide information about the approximate age of the ground water and potential sources of nitrogen detected in ground-water samples, respectively. In 1998, ground-water samples were collected from 101 randomly selected domestic-well sites. Of the 101 samples collected, 26 tested positive for total coliform bacteria, exceeding the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of zero colonies. In 1999, ground-water samples were collected from 31 of the 101 well sites, and 16 tested positive for coliform bacteria. Nitrates were detected in ground water from all domestic-well samples and from all but four of the irrigation-well samples collected from 1998 to 2001. Eight percent of the domestic-well samples and 3 percent of the irrigation-well samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s MCL for drinking water of 10 milligrams per liter. Areas with nitrate concentrations exceeding 6 milligrams per liter, the URNRD’s ground-water management-plan action level, were found predominantly in north-central Chase, western and south-central Dundy, and south-central Perkins Counties. Generally, these concentrations were detected in samples from wells located in upland areas with permeable soils and a high percentage of cropland. In 1999, 31 of the ground-water samples collected from irrigation wells were analyzed for pesticides, and 14 samples (45 percent) had detectable concentrations of at least one pesticide compound. In 2000, all of the 23 irrigation-well samples analyzed had one or more pesticides present at detectable concentrations. In 2001, 12 of 26 domestic-well samples (46 percent) had detectable concentrations. Although the analytical method used during the study was changed {{to increase the number of}} pesticides included in the analyses, the pesticides detected in the ground-water samples from domestic and irrigation wells were limited to the commonly used herbicide compounds acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, <b>prometon,</b> propachlor, propazine, trifluralin, and the atrazine degradation product deethylatrazine. Of the compounds detected, only atrazine (3. 0 micrograms per liter) and alachlor (2. 0 micrograms per liter) have MCLs established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. None of the ground-water samples from the URNRD study area had concentrations that exceeded either MCL. Tritium age-dating analyses indicate water from about one-third of the sites entered the ground-water system prior to 1952. Because the increase in agricultural practices occurred during the 1950 s and 1960 s, it can be assumed that this water was not influenced by agricultural practices. Nitrogen-isotope speciation analyses for samples from three irrigation wells indicated that the source of nitrates in the ground water probably is synthetic fertilizer; however, the source at most irrigation wells probably is either naturally occurring or a mixture of water from various anthropogenic sources (such as synthetic fertilizer and animal waste) ...|$|E
