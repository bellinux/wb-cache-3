5|$|Each award {{consists}} of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the <b>plexiglass</b> itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is met through individual donations and fundraising events.|$|E
5|$|The DVD was {{released}} on March 9, 2004 in widescreen and fullscreen editions, on a double-sided disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg. Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled Schindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a <b>plexiglass</b> case. The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet. As part of its 20th anniversary, the movie {{was released}} on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a <b>plexiglass</b> rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost three}} years of touring to promote the album Metallica, {{including}} a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus {{in the summer of}} 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of <b>plexiglass.</b> The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of <b>plexiglass</b> on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured <b>plexiglass</b> next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear <b>Plexiglass</b> with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E

25|$|Using {{acoustic}} barriers (known as gobos); {{for live}} sound, <b>plexiglass</b> screens are sometimes used for drums and brass.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{astronaut}} Theodore Freeman {{was killed}} in 1964 when a goose shattered the <b>plexiglass</b> cockpit canopy of his Northrop T-38 Talon. Shards were ingested by the engines, leading to a fatal crash.|$|E
25|$|Painting-By-Numbers (2001), a {{do-it-yourself}} painting kit comprising a stamped canvas, brushes, and 90 paint tins in <b>plexiglass</b> {{designed to}} make one infamous 'dot' painting. Part of the exhibition was binned by a gallery cleaner who mistook it for trash.|$|E
25|$|Murphy {{opened a}} second Florida {{restaurant}} in Deerfield Beach, Fla. around 1970. As in Fort Lauderdale, the Deerfield Beach Candlelight included gardens. An artificial brook flowed through the dining room, and the bar’s tall <b>plexiglass</b> windows looked {{out onto a}} moat.|$|E
25|$|Plastic flat plates {{started to}} be offered since 1987 in a printed plastic plates coming in white on {{different}} colours as red, blue, green, black and later pink, orange. Due to premature cracking of the original plastic, the manufacture changed it to <b>plexiglass</b> as of 1999. Comes in 12-345, AB-123, YAB-123 or YAB-12D formats.|$|E
25|$|The SB-5 is a {{cantilever}} shoulder-wing monoplane with a plywood monocoque fuselage {{which has}} an outer fibre glass skin, a single spar wooden wing with plywood skinning, and a V-tail. Its wing, with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels, has 2.50° of dihedral and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes at 50% chord. The pilot has an enclosed cockpit with a <b>Plexiglass</b> canopy and the landing gear is a non-retractable, unsprung monowheel with a tailskid.|$|E
25|$|The Bell 209 {{design was}} {{modified}} for production. The retractable skids {{were replaced by}} simpler fixed skids. A new wide-blade rotor was featured. For production, a <b>plexiglass</b> canopy replaced the 209's armored glass canopy which was heavy enough to harm performance. Other changes were incorporated after entering service. The main one of these was moving the tail rotor from the helicopter's left side to the right for improved effectiveness of the rotor.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{mounted a}} pair of Allison V-1710-125 liquid-cooled V-12 engines behind the crew's cabin, each driving one of the twin propellers. Air intakes were in the wing leading edge. The landing gear was tricycle and a full, four surface cruciform tail was fitted, whose ventral fin/rudder unit prevented the coaxial propellers from striking the ground. The pilot and co-pilot sat under twin bubble canopies, and the bombardier sat in the extreme front behind a <b>plexiglass</b> nose.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, Gynning {{declared}} {{to the media}} that she would remove and sell her breast implants, as she wished to downsize her breasts. In early February 2007, she underwent surgery to remove the implants and Elisabeth Ohlson Wallin took photos of them. The implants were placed in a <b>plexiglass</b> box and sold on the auction site eBay; revenues from the sale were given to a charity that works with victims {{of the war in}} Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|A {{renovation}} {{is expected}} of the Plains of East Africa Exhibit {{in the next few}} years. The planned renovations include replacing many of the old post railings and putting in <b>plexiglass</b> so it is easier for small children and wheelchair-bound guests to see the animals. The boardwalk will be lowered in some spots to provide up-close encounters with the animals. The cheetah and white rhino exhibits will be reconfigured, allowing for a new hippo exhibit between them.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s Riverside High school, {{like many}} older urban schools, {{was in a}} state of rapid decay. The windows leaked water and snow, and the building's heating system was unable to keep the staff and {{students}} warm. Nearly all aspects of the building were in disrepair. It was decided that a second addition and a renovation were in order. After a careful review, the building was retrofitted with new <b>Plexiglass</b> windows. Unfortunately the new windows yellowed over time and blocked much of the sunlight, as well as covered most of the window frame.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pigments}} and dyes absorb UV {{and change}} colour, so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs, two common sources of UV radiation. Window glass absorbs some harmful UV, but valuable artifacts need extra shielding. Many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles, for example. Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels, they need extra protection from UV. Various forms of picture framing glass, including acrylics (<b>plexiglass),</b> laminates, and coatings, offer {{different degrees of}} UV (and visible light) protection.|$|E
25|$|Fast-flying pucks are {{potentially}} dangerous to players and spectators. Puck-related injuries at hockey games are not uncommon. This {{led to the}} evolution of various types of protective gear for players, most notably the goaltender mask. The most serious incident involving a spectator took place on March 18, 2002, when a 13-year-old girl, Brittanie Cecil, died two days after being struck on the head by a hockey puck deflected into the crowd at a NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus. This is the only known incident of this type to have occurred {{in the history of the}} league. Partly as a result of this event, the glass or <b>plexiglass</b> panels that sit atop the boards of hockey rinks to protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above the upper edge of the glass.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} 1951 {{subsequently}} returned the statue to the college, where she remained for over 20 years, until students staged a high-profile heist in 1977. In June 1977 the statue {{was displayed at}} the 25th reunion {{of the class of}} 1952 in order to raise donations for the college. The class required that the statue be placed on display, however, so she was mounted behind <b>plexiglass</b> in Converse Hall. In the early hours of October 13, three masked students entered the hall, tied up the switchboard operator, and pried the statue loose. At the last minute the students enlisted Prince Albert Grimaldi (then a student at the college) so they could claim diplomatic immunity if necessary. They were apprehended less than a month later, when campus police, having learned of their plan to fly the statue over a football game, staked out the local airports.|$|E
25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional rapid prototyping technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an intermediate position rather than returning to the stable equilibrium. The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various metals and alloys, plastics such as <b>Plexiglass,</b> stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. The balancing properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory the balancing properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E
25|$|At Cyber Sunday, Show faced John Cena and King Booker in a Champion of Champions match. The fans {{voted for}} King Booker's World Heavyweight Championship {{to be on}} the line. Booker won the match {{following}} interference from Kevin Federline, who was just beginning a feud with Cena at the time. At Survivor Series, Cena wrestled Big Show in a traditional 10-man Survivor Series tag team match, with Cena and Bobby Lashley left as the survivors of the match after Cena pinned Big Show. Big Show then began a feud with Lashley, who left SmackDown! to join the ECW brand to participate in the Extreme Elimination Chamber match at December to Dismember for the ECW Championship. After busting Big Show open by breaking one of the <b>plexiglass</b> pods with his face, Lashley defeated him to win the title. On December 6, 2006 following an unsuccessful rematch, Big Show took time off from the ring to heal injuries he had sustained on ECW. After two months of inactivity, Wight's contract expired on February 8, 2007.|$|E
25|$|After 1966, McWilliams's artworks and {{performances}} were often realized {{in collaboration with}} Moorman. He composed numerous works for her, including Ice Music (1972), in which she used a file, a saw, a long strip of <b>plexiglass,</b> and other tools to play a cello made of ice until it melted; Candy (1973), in which she and her instrument were covered with chocolate fudge while seated in a gallery whose floor was covered with Easter grass and jelly beans; and C. Moorman in Drag (1973), in which she wore a tuxedo and Pablo Casals mask while miming a performance of a Bach suite for solo cello. During the 1970s, the pieces he wrote for her became increasingly spectacular. In A Water Cello for Charlotte Moorman (1972), she and her cello were submerged in a tank of water pumped in from the Hudson River. Flying Cello (1974) had Moorman attempt {{to make contact with}} her cello as they swung on separate trapezes, and in Cambridge Special for Charlotte, Elephant, and Cello (1978) she rode through the streets of Cambridge on the back of an elephant while dressed as Cleopatra. In 2001, the cellist Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of the Kronos Quartet, revived Ice Music for performances at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Each award {{consists}} of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo of the Gaylactic Network.

500|$|While {{maintaining}} its original all-wood construction and overall fuselage and empennage dimensions, the Mk II incorporated a [...] modified fuselage which included altering the cockpit enclosure and a [...] "deeper" [...] canopy. Instead {{of using the}} [...] "lid" [...] (where the two pilots still boarded via the hinged <b>Plexiglass</b> canopy), two side doors were added from which troops would enter and depart. The seating was re-arranged, and a braking parachute added to the rear. Its other dimensions remained the same, however, with a length of [...] and a gross weight of approximately , with eight airborne troops and some [...] of equipment.|$|E
500|$|The Earth Spacedock was {{a design}} {{intended}} {{to expand the}} scope of Star Trek. After approving a small three-dimensional maquette of the final design, the effects team created an exterior Spacedock model measuring [...] tall. Rather than painstakingly wiring thousands of small lights, ILM made the model out of clear <b>Plexiglass</b> and painted it; scratching off the finish created windows, and an inner core of neon lights illuminated the resulting holes. The inside of the dock was simulated by an additional model, [...] long, with a removable center section. The interior illumination was generated by outside fiber optics and 2,000–5,000watt lights.|$|E
500|$|In {{a larger}} event in 1966 in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and transvestites {{were sitting in}} Compton's Cafeteria when the police arrived to arrest men dressed as women. A riot ensued, with the patrons of the {{cafeteria}} slinging cups, plates, and saucers, and breaking the <b>plexiglass</b> windows {{in the front of}} the restaurant, and returning several days later to smash the windows again after they were replaced. Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an [...] "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" [...] and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|The first Avrocar, S/N 58-7055 (marked AV-7055), after {{tethered}} testing, {{became the}} [...] "wind tunnel" [...] test model at NASA Ames, where it remained in storage from 1961 until 1966, {{when it was}} donated to the National Air and Space Museum, in Suitland, Maryland. There it continued gathering dust for the next forty years. The Museum finally scheduled it for restoration and display at their newly constructed Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Instead the Avrocar has been loaned to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, arriving in November, 2007. After a full restoration, which included fabrication of both missing <b>plexiglass</b> bubbles, it was put on display in June 2008 in the Museum's Cold War Gallery. [...] It has since been moved to the Presidential Aircraft Gallery.|$|E
500|$|After he {{read the}} script, Connery {{realised}} {{the risk of the}} sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a Plexiglas partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack. Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian, [...] "We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the Disco Volante, was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a <b>plexiglass</b> corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough <b>plexiglass</b> and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water." [...] When special-effects coordinator John Stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.|$|E
500|$|Awards {{are given}} in {{categories}} for novels, short fiction and best other work, although in some years the award for short fiction has not been presented {{due to lack of}} sufficient nominees or no nominee of high enough quality. Other categories have also been added and removed in intervening years, and works produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the [...] "Hall of Fame". Each award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo of the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the <b>plexiglass</b> itself. No cash award is associated with the other work award, and the cost of the awards is paid for through individual donations and fundraising events.|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2009, {{both the}} {{acoustic}} and normal version of [...] "Poker Face" [...] was performed live on Fox's American Idol. The performance started with Gaga {{sitting at a}} <b>Plexiglass</b> piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink light. She started singing the second verse of [...] "Poker Face" [...] in a Bette Midler style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her seat and proceeded to perform the song {{in the middle of}} the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violinist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an [...] "alien-disco performance art." [...] Cortney Harding of Billboard wrote, [...] " [...] Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show middle America that she was a bona fide pop star." ...|$|E
500|$|William Abler {{observed}} in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble {{a crack in}} the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, [...] "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" [...] to wood they work. The use of a drill to create an [...] "ampulla" [...] of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a <b>plexiglass</b> bar with incisions called [...] "kerfs" [...] and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like phytosaurs and Dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.|$|E
