5|$|Somerset was invaded {{from the}} {{south-east}} by the Second Legion Augusta, under the future emperor Vespasian. The hillforts of the Durotriges at Ham Hill and Cadbury Castle were captured. Ham Hill <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a temporary Roman occupation.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{accretion}} disks of their own, {{in the first}} meaning of the word. The clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas {{onto the surface of}} each giant protoplanet, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean {{ships were}} shallow-draught vessels {{and could be}} beached on sandy bays. There were vessels of various sizes {{containing}} different numbers of oarsmen. The largest ship <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a crew of 42–46 oarsmen, with one steering oar, a captain, two attendants and a complement of warriors.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{the power to}} command the governors {{in the organization of}} border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E
5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, which <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a similar history.|$|E

5|$|The {{impacting}} object <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a mass {{comparable to}} that of Mars, and the impact probably occurred {{near the end of the}} period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon. The impact was probably the last in the series of mergers that formed the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity. Both modern crocodilians and birds, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|Þorgerðr <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{the stone}} made {{as soon as}} she had learnt that Özurr, the last of her uncles, had died in Greece, and she likely did this to ensure her right of inheritance. The {{inscription}} on the reverse side of the stone, relating how her other uncles died, is in fornyrðislag.|$|E

25|$|In {{children}} {{meeting the}} strict criteria for surgery, short term benefit means that without tonsillectomy {{a child who}} meets these strict criteria will <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> 6 sore throats {{in the next two}} years while one who <b>has</b> surgery will <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> 3 sore throats. After two years there is little difference in the frequency of sore throats.|$|R

5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a warehouseman. In 1999, after a medical examination for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed at the time of the murder. In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E
5|$|By the 1780s, {{the brewery}} <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> an annual output of around 1,500 barrels, {{similar to the}} rival breweries of Benjamin Wilson and Michael Bass. Throughout the eighteenth century, Worthington sales were mostly of porter, {{directed}} towards the Baltic market, which was transported via narrowboat through the River Trent to the Port of Hull. Largely {{as a result of}} this trade, by the time of Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington & Co. ranked among the largest of the provincial breweries.|$|E
5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> little choice in the decision he made.|$|E

5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman would <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{either a}} long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207. He was the eldest son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was {{initially}} looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen {{in the south of}} England, away from John's itinerant court, and <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> close ties to his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.|$|E
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a goddess figure that was stolen. The lintel of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E

5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> more numerous treasures.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{was only}} 12 {{years old at}} the time of her wedding, young by the {{standards}} of the period, and Edward <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a {{profound}} impact on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
