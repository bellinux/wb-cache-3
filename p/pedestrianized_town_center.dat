40|$|Virtually all new towns {{built in}} the past 20 years in Australia have been linked with mining {{activities}} in remote, climactically harsh locations. Most are small, company towns, situated close to the mine site, and with a finite life {{closely linked to the}} extent of one particular mineral resource and the economics of its extraction. Constrasts exist between the new mining towns developed to date in relation to the concepts employed in developing the urban form or layout, eg ranging from conventional car-oriented grid designs to innovatory schemes such as a totally <b>pedestrianized</b> <b>town,</b> and the type and style of housing provided. Most of the new mining towns, however, are replications of the familiar [...] -or transplanted [...] -suburbia.
