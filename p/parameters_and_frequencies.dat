50|$|Plasmas {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} values in both {{temperature}} and density; plasma temperatures range from close to absolute zero and to well beyond 109 kelvins (for comparison, tungsten melts at 3700 kelvins), and plasma may contain less than one particle per cubic metre, or be denser than lead. Electron temperature is usually expressed as electronvolt (eV), and 1 eV is equivalent to 11,604 K. Common plasmas temperature and density in fluorescent light tubes and semiconductor manufacturing processes are around several eV and 109-12per cm3. For a wide range of <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies,</b> plasma is electrically conductive, and its response to low-frequency electromagnetic waves {{is similar to that of}} a metal: a plasma simply reflects incident low-frequency radiation. Low-frequency means it is lower than the characteristic electron plasma frequency. The use of plasmas to control the reflected electromagnetic radiation from an object (Plasma stealth) is feasible at suitable frequency where the conductivity of the plasma allows it to interact strongly with the incoming radio wave, and the wave can either be absorbed and converted into thermal energy, or reflected, or transmitted depending on the relationship between the radio wave frequency and the characteristic plasma frequency. If the frequency of the radio wave is lower than the plasma frequency, it is reflected. if it is higher, it transmit. If these two are equal, then resonance occurs. There are also another mechanism where reflection can be reduced. If the electromagnetic wave passes through the plasma, and is reflected by the metal, and the reflected wave and incoming wave are roughly equal in power, then they may form two phasors. When these two phasors are of opposite phase they can cancel each other out. In order to obtain substantial attenuation of radar signal, the plasma slab needs adequate thickness and density.|$|E

The analyses suggest that the results could be explained by the hypothesis of genetic predisposition, provided a large difference exists in the susceptibility of resistant and susceptible hosts, and explore the range of genotypic <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> consistent with the limited currently available data.

40|$|Pressure {{suppression}} {{systems in}} boiling water reactors are designed to condense {{a large amount of}} steam very rapidly by injecting it into a pool of water. It transpires that such condensing flows are unstable and can lead to large oscillatory pressures {{on the walls of the}} containment system. This paper presents a theoretical model whose purpose is to attempt to understand why these flows are unstable and to extract the important <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> pertaining to the instability. A simple linear dynamic model is constructed comprising linear transfer function for (i) the unsteady steam flow in the vent (ii) the condensation interface and (iii) the pool hydrodynamics. The analysis demonstrates the existence of both stable and unstable regions of operation defined by several non-dimensional parameters including the ratio of the steam flow rate to the effective thermal diffusivity in the water just downstream of the condensation interface and the frictional losses in the vent. Instability frequencies are in the vicinity of the vent acoustic frequencies or the pool manometer frequency depending on the conditions. Though the qualitative dynamic behavior of the model is consistent with the experimental observations, quantitative comparison is hindered by difficulties in accurately assessing the effective thermal diffusivity in the water. Nevertheless the model provides insight into the nature of the instability...|$|E

40|$|Revisiting the {{classical}} acoustics problem of rectangular side-branch cavities in a two-dimensional duct of infinite length {{we use the}} finite element method to numerically compute the acoustic resonances {{as well as the}} sound transmission and reflection for an incoming fundamental duct mode. To satisfy the requirement of outgoing waves in the far field we use two different forms of absorbing boundary conditions, namely the complex scaling method and the Hardy space method. In general the resonances are damped due to radiation losses, but there also exist various types of localized trapped modes with nominally zero radiation loss. The most common type of trapped mode is antisymmetric about the duct axis and becomes quasi-trapped with very low damping if the symmetry about the duct axis is broken. In this case a Fano resonance results with resonance and antiresonance features and drastic changes in the sound transmission and reflection coefficient. Two other types of trapped modes, termed embedded trapped modes, result from the interaction of neighbouring modes or Fabry–P´erot interference in multi-cavity systems. These embedded trapped modes occur only for very particular geometry <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> and become highly localized quasi-trapped modes as soon as the geometry is perturbed. We show that all three types of trapped modes are possible in duct-cavity systems and that embedded trapped modes continue to exist when a cavity is moved off centre. If several cavities interact the single-cavity trapped mode splits into several trapped supermodes which might be useful for the design of low-frequency acoustic filters. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of CoRoT, Kepler, Gaia, TESS, and PLATO, precise and {{accurate}} stellar ages, masses and radii are of paramount importance. They are crucial to constrain scenarii of planetary formation and evolution. We aim at quantifying how detailed stellar modeling improves the accuracy and precision on age and mass of individual stars. We adopt a multifaceted approach where we examine how the number of observational constraints {{as well as the}} uncertainties on observations and on model input physics impact the age-dating and weighing. We modelled the exoplanet host-star HD 52265, a MS, solar-like oscillator observed by CoRoT. We considered different sets of observational constraints (HR data, metallicity, seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties of HD 52265 inferred from models, and quantified the impact of the models inputs. Our seismic analysis provides an age A= 2. 10 - 2. 54 Gyr, a mass M= 1. 14 - 1. 32 Msun, and a radius R= 1. 30 - 1. 34 Rsun, which corresponds to uncertainties of 10, 7, and 1. 5 % respectively. Our seismic study provides constraints on surface convection, through the mixing-length found to be 12 - 15 % smaller than the solar one. Because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial He abundance is determined modulo the mass. The seismic mass of the exoplanet is found to be Mp sin i= 1. 17 - 1. 26 MJup, much more precise than what can be derived by HR diagram inversion. We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows to improve the age accuracy compared to other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of oscillations -as the large frequency separation- is not enough for deriving accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to narrow the age scatter due to model uncertainties. This strengthen the case for precise classical stellar <b>parameters</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> as will be obtained by Gaia and PLATO.
