40|$|Temporohyoid osteoarthropathy is a {{disorder}} of horses affecting {{the bones of}} the temporohyoid joint (stylohyoid and <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bones).</b> Bony proliferation at the articulation of the stylohyoid <b>bone</b> with the <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> can result from multiple etiologies including otitis media/interna, gutteral pouch infection or as a primary degenerative joint disease. Eventually, ankylosis of the temporohyoid joint occurs, predisposing the <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> to fracture. Subsequent fracture can result in acute onset of neurological signs ranging from facial and/or vestibulocochlear deficits to grand mal seizure and death.

Objective: To describe a rare case of a severe displaced transverse <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> fracture with impending intra-operative exsanguination, treated with fracture reduction and lateral plating in order to achieve hemostasis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of a patient admitted to the neurosurgical department with a hyperacute epidural hematoma (EDH) secondary to a transverse <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> fracture with venous sinus and petrous ICA injuries. Results: A 22  year old male was admitted for a severe traumatic brain injury leading to a left displaced transverse <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> fracture and a hyperacute EDH. Given the location of the fractures, injury to the venous sinus (at the area of the transverse-sigmoid junction) and petrous ICA was suspected. Intra-operatively, significant blood loss from both the venous sinus and petrous ICA was encountered. Given the displaced temporal bone fracture, packing of the areas was impaired. We performed a manual reduction of the temporal fracture, followed by lateral plating in order to achieve hemostasis from the petrous ICA and aid with packing of the venous sinus injury. Conclusions: Reduction and lateral plating of displaced transverse <b>petrous</b> temporal <b>bone</b> fractures can aid significantly with intra-operative hemostasis in the extreme case of venous sinus and/or petrous ICA injuries.

We performed a retrospective analysis on 28 patients with <b>petrous</b> <b>bone</b> cholesteatoma who underwent surgery between 1991 and 2008 at Lariboisiere Hospital, Paris, France. Main outcome measures included age of patients, surgical approaches, complications, and recurrence. The mean age was 47 years. Five were congenital cholesteatomas and 23 were acquired ones. Seventeen patients had undergone previous mastoid surgery elsewhere. Ninety-six percent of patients presented with hearing loss and 37. 5 % with facial nerve palsy. The surgical approaches varied according to the classification. Postoperatively, four patients developed facial nerve palsy; two patients, XII nerve paresis; one patient, X nerve paresis; and eight patients, deafness. The mean follow-up was 5 years. Twenty patients had no long-term recurrence. Two cases of petrous apex cholesteatoma presenting with double vision were removed by an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the utilizing value {{of virtual reality}} technique for microanatomy of <b>petrous</b> <b>bone</b> by comparing the anatomic characteristics and data measurement between virtual reality and cadaveric head specimens in subtemporal approach. Methods CT scan data of 15 adult cadaveric heads were inputted into the Dextroscope virtual reality system to build three-dimensional model of <b>petrous</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>Petrous</b> <b>bone</b> drilling was performed on cadaveric heads and virtual reality models respectively to expose anatomic structures step by step, and the distance and angle was measured based on selected mark points. Bland-Altman method {{was used for the}} uniformity of checking. Results Visibility effect of simulation of <b>petrous</b> <b>bone</b> drilling in virtual reality system was good. The anatomical structure of facial nerve in <b>petrous</b> <b>bone,</b> greater superficial petrosal nerve, cochlea, semicircular canal, internal carotid artery and glomus jugulare, were displayed clearly. Comparative analysis between cadaveric head and virtual reality by Bland-Altman method showed that bias for distance between geniculate ganglion and start point of common osseus crus of semicircular canal bony, geniculate ganglion and vertex of cochlea, and vertex of cochlea and start point of horizontal segment of internal carotid artery in <b>petrous</b> <b>bone,</b> were 0. 020, 0. 020, and - 0. 010 respectively, and 95 % confidence intervals were - 0. 240 - 0. 270, - 0. 190 - 0. 220, and - 0. 170 - 0. 150, respectively. Good consistency was demonstrated in scatter diagram. For the limitation of visual angle in cadaveric head, the angle between internal acoustic meatus and groove of great superficial petrosal nerve and the distance between start point of common osseus crus of semicircular canal and superior margin of glomus jugulare could not be measured, while data measurement of <b>petrous</b> <b>bone</b> model in virtual reality system was convenient and quick, without limitation of visual angle. The distance between start point of common osseus crus of semicircular canal and superior margin of glomus jugulare was measured as (4. 74 ± 0. 20) mm, and the angle between internal acoustic meatus and groove of greater superficial petrosal nerve was (51. 34 ± 3. 29) °.
