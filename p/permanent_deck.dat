25|$|The RN {{was thus}} faced with {{designing}} a carrier {{that would be}} survivable under the conditions to be expected in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Oceans, and before the development of effective naval radar; these conflicting demands resulted {{in the development of}} aircraft carriers whose decks were armoured against 500lb Armour Piercing bombs and 1000lb General Purpose bombs. The RN considered that an unarmoured carrier would be unlikely to be able fly off more than one deck load of strike aircraft prior to being attacked so the armoured flight deck carriers accepted a reduction in hangar capacity to the equivalent to one deck load of aircraft. USN, IJN some RN Fleet carriers such as Ark Royal had sufficient aircraft capacity to allow for two ranges, each equal to a full deck load of strike aircraft. The RN and IJN limited their aircraft carrier's aircraft capacity to the capacity of their hangars, and struck down all aircraft between operations.

Although metal formwork in the building industry is routinely relied on for stability bracing, the forms are not permitted for bracing in the bridge industry, despite the large in-plane stiffness. The forms in bridge applications are typically supported on cold-formed angles, which allow the contractor to adjust the form elevation to account for changes in flange thickness and differential camber between adjacent girders. Although the support angles are beneficial toward the constructability of the bridge, they lead to eccentric connections that substantially reduce the in-plane stiffness of the PMDF systems, {{which is one of}} the reasons the forms are not relied on for bracing in bridge applications. This paper documents the results of an investigation focused on improving the bracing potential of bridge deck forms. Modifications to the connection details were developed to improve the stiffness and strength of the forming system.

In addition, twin-girder tests were also used to validate computer models of the bracing systems that were used for parametric finite-element analytical studies.

40|$|Abstract: Composite slab {{construction}} using <b>permanent</b> cold-formed steel <b>decking</b> {{has become}} one of the most economical and industrialized forms of flooring systems in modern building structures. Structural performance of the composite slab is affected directly by the horizontal shear bond phenomenon at steel-concrete interface layer. This study utilizes 3 D nonlinear finite element quasi-static analysis technique to analyze the shear bond damage and fracture mechanics of the composite slabs. Fracture by opening and sliding modes of the plain concrete over the corrugated steel decking had been modeled with concrete damaged plasticity model available in ABAQUS/Explicit module. The horizontal shear bond was simulated with cohesive element. Cohesive fracture properties such as fracture energy and initiation stress were derived from horizontal shear bond stress versus end slip curves. These curves were extracted from bending tests of narrow width composite slab specimens. Results of the numerical analyses match the experimental results accurately. This study demonstrated that the proposed finite element model and analysis procedure can predict the behavior of composite slabs accurately. The procedure can be used as a cheaper alternative to experimental work for investigating the ultimate strength and actual fracture and damage behavior of steel-concrete composite slab systems...|$|R
5000|$|When {{aircraft}} carriers supplanted battleships {{as the primary}} fleet capital ship, there were two schools of thought {{on the question of}} armor protection being included into the flight deck. The United States Navy (USN) initially favored unarmored flight decks because they maximized aircraft carrier hangar and flight deck size, which in turn maximized aircraft capacity in the hangar, and on the flight deck, {{in the form of a}} permanent [...] "deck park" [...] for a large proportion of the aircraft carried. In 1936 the Royal Navy developed the armored flight deck aircraft carrier which also enclosed the hangar sides and ends with armor. The addition of armor to the flight deck offered aircraft below some protection against aerial bombs while the armored hangar sides and ends helped to minimize damage and casualties from explosions or fires within or outside the hangar. The addition of armor to the hangar forced a reduction in top-weight, so the hangar height was reduced, and this restricted the types of aircraft that these ships could carry, although the Royal Navy's armored carriers did carry spare aircraft in the hangar overheads. The armor also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armored flight deck aircraft carrier. Additionally, Royal Navy {{aircraft carriers}} did not use a <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> park until approximately 1943; before then the aircraft capacity of RN aircraft carriers was limited to their hangar capacity. The 23,000 ton British Illustrious-class had a hangar capacity for 36 Swordfish sized aircraft and a single 458 x 62 x 16 ft hangar, but carried up to 57 aircraft with a <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> park while the 23,400 ton [...] featured increased hangar capacity with a 458 x 62 x 14 ft upper hangar and the addition of a 208 x 62 x 14 ft lower hangar, forward of the after elevator, which had a total capacity of 52 Swordfish sized aircraft or a mix of 48 late war aircraft in the hangar plus 24 aircraft in a <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> park, but carried up to 81 aircraft with a deck park. The 27,500 ton USN Essex class had a 654 x 70 x 17.5 ft hangar that was designed to handle a mix of 72 prewar USN aircraft. but carried up to 104 late war aircraft using both the hangar and a <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> park. [...] The experience of World War II caused the USN to change their design policy in favor of armored flight decks on much larger ships: [...] "The main armor carried on Enterprise is the heavy armored flight deck. This was to prove a significant factor in the catastrophic fire and explosions that occurred on Enterprises flight deck in 1969. The US Navy learned its lesson the hard way during World War II when all its carriers had only armored hangar decks. All attack carriers built since the [...] have had armored flight decks." ...|$|E

5000|$|British naval {{historian}} D.K. Brown put {{the practical}} difference between American and British design philosophies {{in no uncertain}} terms: [...] "More fighters {{would have been better}} protection than armour," [...] but that British designs were good for the circumstances in which they were meant to be used. Yet, even , Britain's newest carrier prior to World War II, never operated close to her theoretical aircraft capacity. Prior to the development of effective radar and high speed monoplane fighters, a successful fighter defence was extremely unlikely for any navy thus calling into doubt D.K. Brown's conclusions. The benefits of flight deck armour were intended to counter these issues. Fewer aircraft meant a lower priority to attack than the more heavily armed American carriers and the RN's operational doctrine dictated smaller airgroups, and the armoured hangar carriers had smaller Avgas and ammunition supplies to match. However, RN carriers carried far more aircraft later in the war, making use of the deck park when they adopted USN style operational doctrine. The 2nd generation RN armoured carriers, Indomitable and the Implacable class which had an additional half length lower hangar, were considerably less outmatched by their USN counterparts in the numbers of aircraft operated. The RN operating in harsher weather protected their aircraft from the elements and did not use a <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> park in the earlier part of the war. US carriers and their fighters shot down more than 1,900 suicide aircraft during Operation Kikusui (the last and largest Kamikaze attack in the Okinawa campaign), versus a mere 75 for the British, yet both forces suffered the same number of serious hits (four), on their carriers. However the kamikazes made 173 strikes against other USN targets and the 4 USN carriers suffered a massive death toll, in contrast to the relatively light casualties on the RN carriers. The kamikaze threat overall was serious, but Allied defences neutralised it, and many kamikaze strikes missed the deck armour entirely, or bounced off the decks of both British or American carriers. In some cases, kamikazes either struck glancing blows that did only superficial damage that was fixed within minutes or hours, or missed entirely, due to the poor training and poorer flight experience of their pilots. The majority of kamikazes that did inflict harm caused no more damage than they would have against smaller ships. After a successful kamikaze hit, the British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts often could do the same, but not always; in some cases repairs took a few days or even months. The USN liaison officer on [...] commented: [...] "When a kamikaze hits a U.S. carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl Harbor.

Static and seismic loading scenarios explore the potential benefits and limitations of under-designed rocking foundations in comparison to conventional alternatives. (II) A validated nonlinear numerical method is developed to provide further insights on the different shallow foundation response mechanisms with emphasis on soil failure. The methodology of Anastasopoulos et al. [2010] is incorporated and extended to account for scale effects in cohesionless soil. (III) For a realistic modelling of the nonlinear response of the superstructure, the novel small-scale physical model of Knappett et al [2011] is utilized and further developed to fabricate 1 : 50 scaled replicas of well-confined modern RC bridge piers. A total of 26 such piers were constructed. The validity of their response was verified by a number of 4 -point bending tests. (IV) Four shaking table centrifuge tests investigate and compare the performance of two RC model bridge piers, having the same structural section in each case, but with two different foundation designs — a conventional design and a rocking isolation design. Each alternative is tested under two different seismic loading scenarios, where the sequence of real ground motions was imposed at the soil model base in such an order as to allow also investigation of the effect of the exact seismic history. (V) To improve rocking isolation design so as to avoid large foundation settlements, an additional set of 9 centrifuge tests (4 static and 5 dynamic) are conducted involving several hybrid foundation schemes. In these schemes the shallow rocking footing is suitably “strengthened” by geometrical modifications or various means of soil improvement: (i) a variable–geometry foundation, whose small rocking stiffness and capacity increase with foundation rotation after some threshold angle; (ii) a rocking-isolated footing standing on top of an appropriately designed “cofferdam”, which provokes uplifting by hindering the formation of bearing capacity failure mechanisms under the footing; (iii) combined densification with a 2 x 2 group of unconnected piles (one under each foundation corner); and (iv) a grid of micro-pile inclusions. The results demonstrate the virtues of rocking-isolation shallow foundations, which stem from: (i) reducing accelerations transmitted onto the deck; (ii) increasing system ductility; (iii) limiting <b>permanent</b> <b>deck</b> drifts; and (iv) increasing resistance against damage accumulation in successive earthquakes. Yet, these tests also highlight the main drawback of rocking isolation. That is, the so called “sinking response”, or in other words the gradual accumulation of settlement caused by strongly inelastic soil behaviour. The four new concepts for improving the performance of rocking foundations that were introduced and tested in this dissertation prove capable of ameliorating this drawback while retaining the benefits of rocking isolation...|$|E
