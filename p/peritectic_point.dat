An up-to-date realization of these fixed points is based on cells containing metals of ultra-high purity (6 N or better) and should include a correction for the influence of relevant impurities. Still, chemical analyses of the fixed-point material can show large amounts of oxygen, which had to be neglected so far, {{because of the lack of}} detailed knowledge about it, presuming it could be removed from the cell by applying a vacuum (less than 1 Pa) for a few hours. In this paper we discuss an equilibrium of several forms of oxygen in a fixed-point cell, gaseous in the cell 2 ̆ 019 s atmosphere, dissolved in the fixed-point metal and as oxide in a separate (solid) phase. We will conclude that in many fixed points most of the oxygen is not dissolved in the metal, but bound in oxides of the fixed-point metal as well as oxides of some impurities. To demonstrate the impact that the precipitation of impurity oxides has on thermometry, two indium fixed-point cells were doped with magnesium and chromium, which leave the fixed-point temperature unchanged. Further evidence is drawn from earlier work. All these results support the presumed existence of (at least one) persistent separate oxide phase in the fixed points of indium, tin, zinc and aluminium, which renders them eutectic or <b>peritectic</b> <b>points</b> and is a more likely reason why the oxygen content of a cell does not influence the fixed-point temperature. To complement these studies, thermodynamic calculations show how to treat the equilibrium in the cell quantitatively. Using available chemical data, a list is provided that indicates for each fixed-point metal (including the other metal fixed points of the ITS- 90 : mercury, gold, copper) the impurities that probably build oxides. Due to the agreement of the calculated values with the presented experimental results, we suggest excluding those impurities from the correction of a fixed-point temperature (e. g. the SIE method), unless there is strong evidence of their dissolution.

The biotite to phengite reaction occurs at pressures between 2 · 4 and 2 · 6 GPa for temperatures of 750 - 850 °C, and the amphibole to clinopyroxene reaction from 2 · 0 GPa, 875 °C to 2 · 5 GPa, 740 °C. Dolomite is the carbonate phase stable at subsolidus conditions. The biotite to phengite reaction preserves K 2 O, but is not H 2 O conservative, as a fluid is produced from the decomposition of zoisite. Phengite + quartz control fluid-saturated melting at a pressure (P) > 2 · 6 GPa, whereas biotite + quartz dominate at P < 2 · 4 GPa. Incongruent melting occurs through the reactions phengite or biotite + zoisite + quartz/coesite + fluid = silicate melt + clinopyroxene + kyanite. Overstepping of the solidus, located at 850 - 950 °C, results in 7 - 24 wt % metaluminous K-rich granitic melts. The experiments define the melting surface of the model system, projected from kyanite + quartz/coesite + fluid onto the K 2 O-CaO-MgO plane. The solidus melts in the studied system occur at a <b>peritectic</b> <b>point</b> consuming mica + zoisite and forming clinopyroxene. With increasing temperature (T), carbonated pelites then evolve along a peritectic curve along which further clinopyroxene is produced until zoisite is exhausted. This is then followed by a peritectic curve consuming clinopyroxene and producing garnet. A comparison of CO 2 -bearing with CO 2 -free experiments from the literature suggests that {{the main effect of}} adding calcite to a continental sediment is not the minor shift of typically 20 - 30 °C of reactions involving fluid, but the change in bulk Ca/(Mg + Fe) ratio stabilizing calcic phases at the expense of ferromagnesian phases. The experiments suggest that in most subduction zones, CO 2, H 2 O and K 2 O will be carried to depths in excess of 120 - 150 km through carbonates and K-micas, as partial melting occurs only at temperatures at the uppermost end of thermal models of subduction zones. Nevertheless, the release of fluid through P-induced decomposition of amphibole and zoisite provides some H 2 O for arc magma formation. Melting at higher temperatures (e. g. resulting from slower burial rates or from incorporation of subducted crust into the mantle) will produce potassic granitic melts and provide a substantial volatile and K source for the formation of arc magma...|$|E

Currently, there is great concern about biodieseldiesel blends at low temperatures. While the diesel has its cloud point (CP) around - 16 °C, in case biodiesel this transition may occur in a temperature range between 0 °C and 16 °C. Therefore, the addition of biodiesel can cause problems as the formation of sludge in storage tanks, transport, to impair performance in engines, among others. This project aims to evaluate the cloud point of mixtures of biodiesel with diesel by means of curves of solid-liquid equilibrium (ESL) obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). To this, were determined T-x phase diagrams of solid-liquid equilibrium of binary systems, pseudo-binary and ternary involving majority saturated esters found in biodiesel, ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate and representative alkane of diesel, n-hexadecane. Samples of the each mixture are prepared in weight using the micro analytical balance (Perkin-Elmer AD 6). The cloud point of mixtures was characterized by DSC 8500 with auto samp A escaldagem é uma das principais etapas do abate de suínos com o objetivo de reduzir grandes quantidades de micro-organismos patogênicos, como a Salmonella. Conhecer os fatores que afetam a sobrevivência da Salmonella na escaldagem é essencial para garantir a menor passagem deste micro-organismo para as etapas posteriores de abate. O objetivo desta dissertação foi avaliar a resistência térmica de Salmonella Typhimurium e Derby em condições similares à escaldagem de abate de suínos e com diferentes pH e concentrações de matéria-orgânica. Amostras de água de escaldagem foram coletadas antes do início, no meio e ao final do abate de um matadouro frigorífico. Foram realizadas análises físico-químicas para quantificação de matéria-orgânica, cloro, turbidez e pH. O pH das amostras foi ajustado em 4, 7 e 10 e divididas em tubos de ensaio para os testes de letalidade térmica que foram realizados em banho-maria a 62 °C por 5 minutos. Houve elevação constante na concentração de matéria-orgânica durante o abate. Não foi observada diferença no tempo de redução decimal (valor-D) entre as concentrações de matéria orgânica. Em pH alcalino Salmonella foi mais sensível com valor-D cerca de 17 % menor que em neutro. O sorotipo Derby foi mais resistente que o Typhimurium inicialmente, porém, no final de cinco minutos foram equivalentes. Houve uma redução média de aproximadamente 3, 19 log UFC/mL de Salmonella e valor-D de 1, 65 minutos. Conclui-se que a adoção de escaldagem com temperatura de 62 °C por 5 minutos é eficaz, e a definição do parâmetro de renovação de água não foi relevante para melhorar a eficiência na eliminação de Salmonella.

Abstract: The scalding is one the main steps of swine slaughtering in order to reduce great quantities of pathogenic microorganisms, like Salmonella. To know the factors that affect the Salmonella survival in scalding is essential to guarantee the smallest passage of this microorganism to further slaughtering steps. This paper's objective was to avail the thermic resistance of the Salmonella Typhimurium and Derby in similar condition to scalding of swine slaughtering and with different pH levels and organic matter concentration. Samples of scalding water were collected before the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the slaughter in a slaughterhouse. Physicochemical analyses were made to quantify the organic matter, chlorine, turbidity and pH. The sample's pH was adjusted to 4, 7, 10 and divided test-tubes to thermic lethality tests that were made in water-bath at 62 ºC for 5 minutes. There was constant rising in the organic matter concentration during the slaughter. It was not observed difference in the decimal reduction time (D-value) in the different levels of organic matter concentrations during the slaughter. In alkaline pH Salmonella was more sensible with approximately 17 % lower D-value than when in neutral pH level. The serotype Derby was initially more resistant than the Typhimurium, however, by 5 minutes they were equivalent. There was an average reduction of approximately 3. 19 log CFU/mL of Salmonella and D-value of 1. 65 minutes. It was concluded that the adoption of scalding in temperatures of 62 ºC by 5 minutes is effective, and the definition of the water renovation parameter was not relevant to enhance the Salmonella elimination efficiency.
