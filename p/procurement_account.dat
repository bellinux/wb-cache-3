40|$|Congressional micromanagement of {{the defense}} budget is a crucial, element of the {{struggle}} between the legislative and executive branches to shape military spending. By altering presidential funding requests, Congress can impose its own preferences on the defense budget, and thus guide the restructuring of U. S. armed forces. Congressional micromanagement has drawn enormous criticism from academics and Department of Defense officials. This thesis uses documents provided by the DOD Comptroller to conduct two studies. The first is a multi year (FY 1989 - 1994) analysis of the <b>procurement</b> <b>account,</b> to examine how {{the end of the}} Cold War affected micromanagement. The second study examines all defense budget categories for one year (FY 1994) to compare micromanagement between accounts. This thesis argues that the percentage of budget line items for procurement altered by congressional appropriators remained nearly constant (20 to 23 percent) from FY 1989 - 1994. Congress subtracted from more line items that it added to, however line item subtractions were smaller on average than additions. A cross service analysis revealed no particular service or procurement programs as the prime target of Congressional micromanagement. The single year cross sectional analysis revealed that activity in DoD procurement is indicative of legislative change in operations and research accounts, but not in construction and housing. NANAU.

40|$|Abstract: The public {{procurement}} system enabled {{economic growth and}} delivery of infrastructure in South Africa for many decades and has assisted {{the growth of the}} construction sector. Through {{public procurement}} top infrastructure and successful projects in SA has been delivered with the assistance of contractors and professionals in the construction sector managing {{to improve the quality of}} life for many South Africans. The public procurement system forms an important part of the construction industry in SA and forms a strategic tool of government to deliver services and infrastructure to communities. Public sector <b>procurement</b> <b>account</b> for major spending in construction and development of infrastructure, and is responsible for the growth of the sector in SA. Construction sector is seen as a major economic contributor through employment and delivery of infrastructure, and is a major source of the South African economic growth. Despite successful delivery of infrastructure and projects through public procurement, the system continues to be plagued by challenges that have resulted in South Africans questioning its authenticity and has affected the construction industry in a negative way. The challenges associated with the award of construction projects include corruption, bid rigging, price fixing and collusion with procurement staff. The state of affairs prompted the researcher to conduct the research to investigate challenges in the current procurement system in the public sector with the aim to determine the best practices and international bench marks with the hope to provide ways of improving procurement processes to improve the South African system to ensure optimal value. The study focuses on national departments procurement in Gauteng Province of SA. The study commences with an introduction, which outlines the problem statement, research outcomes and objectives, significance of the study and its limitations. The literature review comprised a review of academic journals, textbooks and articles on similar studies to ascertain their findings and assess contributions to the public procurement system in SA and around the world in relation to the construction industry. In addition, best practices and bench marks are reviewed and the procurement systems in Malaysia and Australia are examined to draw a comparison with the South African system and to identify procurement aspects which will optimise the performance of the system in SA. The literature review reveals that lack of education and experience in procurement staff, procurement management issues, non-compliance and lack of understanding of SCM, failure to [...] . M. Ing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of the standards for access to external product libraries in relation to procurement and product data exchange. <b>Procurement</b> <b>accounts</b> for 70 - 85 % of the value of a building project and hence it is vitally important for the data exchange required to support these processes to be streamlined. Product data exchange between applications is equally important for streamlining the specification, design and construction and maintenance of a building facility. A considerable amount of effort within the Architecture/Engineering/Construction and Facilities Management (A/E/C/FM) has gone into developing standards for product data exchange. Manufacturers and suppliers have supported {{the development of}} procurement related standards. With the developments in XML-based standards the technology is now available for developing cost-effective solutions that meet the requirements of both procurement and product data exchange. The paper evaluates the existing and emerging standards and discusses the issues arising from the development of standards for access to product libraries and possible ways forward. ...|$|R

A well-functioning immunisation programme is essential to reducing child mortality and morbidity from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). In 2002 a review of immunisation programmes in Ireland identified fragmented structures and a lack of standardised processes as key challenges to improving immunisation uptake rates. As a result the Health Service Executive (HSE) established the National Immunisation Office (NIO) in 2005 as a coordinating unit for immunisation to ensure high quality standardised implementation of all publicly funded immunisation programmes (primary childhood, schools, seasonal influenza and others as required). The NIO has a current complement of seven full time staff members who are responsible for the coordination of immunisation programmes through collaboration with all all those involved in their delivery and support. In addition the NIO is also responsible for managing vaccine procurement and distribution, developing training and communication materials for health professionals and the general public and controlling a budget of over € 38 million in 2011.

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} factors shaping policy {{diffusion}} of effective, liberal public procurement regimes. Policy diffusion and {{the analysis of}} policy diffusion is less developed in public procurement than other policy areas such as investment.

The article first provides {{an introduction to the}} issue of public procurement and discusses the nature of procurement regimes, the dependent variable. It then assesses the impact of key variables identified in the literature on policy diffusion, such as competition, coercion and norm emulation. It is argued that issue linkage in bilateral free trade agreements (FTA) appears to have brought about common laws – and in some cases – rules for procurement. But this stops short of a genuine diffusion of liberal procurement regimes due to negotiations being framed by reciprocity rather than efficiency considerations, the costs and complexity of implementation, as well as opposition from vested sector interests and politicians at all levels of government favoring the short term political utility of ‘buy local’ policies...|$|R

40|$|Public <b>procurement</b> <b>accounts</b> for a {{significant}} proportion of overall demand for goods and services and is increasingly seen as an attractive and feasible instrument for furthering the goals of innovation policy. However, public procurement is already expected to address a wide range of social goals. Much of the current debate about harnessing procurement to promote innovation draws upon a limited set of examples which are not representative of the bulk of public purchasing and tend to downplay diversity in procurement practices and in the types of goods and services procured. They also downplay diversity in the nature of innovations and in the range of ways that procurement can impact upon innovation. A one-size-fits-all model is unlikely to work across all procurement contexts yet all types of public procurement are likely to have impacts upon innovation by shaping the demand environment in which suppliers innovate and compete. We propose a framework and typology based {{on the nature of the}} goods and services procured in order to explore the potential impacts upon markets and innovation of each.
