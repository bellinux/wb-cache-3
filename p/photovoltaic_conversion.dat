The proposed system makes use of single stage power conversion with {{maximum power point tracking}} and modeling of the <b>Photovoltaic</b> Power <b>Conversion</b> using Modular Multilevel Converter (PPCMMC) as interfacing unit into the grid. In this paper, perturb & observe method of maximum power point algorithm is used to regulate the DC link voltage of the MMC and to synchronize the grid utility voltage with the current for attaining near unity power factor operation under varying environmental conditions. Recently renewable energy power supplied into the utility grid has been paid much attention due to increase in fossil fuel prices, environmental pollution and energy demand boom. Among various renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, biomass etc., the solar photovoltaic system being more attractive and promising green resource because of its abundant availability, safe resource, cost free and eco-friendly. The solar photovoltaic (PV) modules directly converts the light energy into the electrical energy, but energy obtained from the PV module acts as low voltage DC source and has relatively low conversion efficiency. In order to improve the efficiency and convert low voltage DC source into usable AC source, the power electronics converters are used to transform DC into AC. The simulation results presented in this paper verifies the operation of proposed MMC topology such that the AC output is free from the higher order harmonics and grid voltage and current are in phase.
