40|$|Video capsule {{endoscopy}} (VCE) is a noninvasive {{diagnostic tool}} used {{to observe the}} small intestinal mucosa. We report {{a case of a}} 57 -year-old woman with T 2 DM, treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using second-generation OmniPod <b>patch</b> <b>pump,</b> undergoing VCE (Given M 2 A; VCE Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) for melena and anemia. During VCE, an abnormal interruption of communication between video capsule and its receiver occurred. Two hours after capsule ingestion, the patient activated the insulin pump infusion through the Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM) because she drank a sugary beverage for the first time after ingestion. Due to this, we decided to repeat VCE after the removal of the insulin pump and PDM: at this time, the capsule recorded for more than 10 h without any interruption. The video capsule and second-generation OmniPod <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> use the same radio frequency and this may cause interference between these two devices. In patients using second-generation OmniPod <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> undergoing VCE, we suggest to switch to intravenous insulin infusion or multiple daily injection or to use a different model of VCE, as MiRoCam (Intromedic, Seoul, Korea) ...|$|E
40|$|This review {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the candidates for an improved basal insulin in the pharmaceutical pipeline. The first new basal insulin to enter the market is most likely insulin degludec (IDeg), currently reporting in phase 3 of development, from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). IDeg has a longer duration of action than currently available analogs. Phase 2 studies show comparable efficacy and safety outcomes compared with insulin glargine once daily with less hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes. The final results of phase 3 studies seem to confirm this, also in type 2 diabetes. Biodel (Danbury, CT) has two long-acting basal insulin formulations in the pipeline, both in the preclinical phase of development: BIOD-Adjustable Basal, a modified formulation of insulin glargine, is available in long-, medium-, and short-acting forms and could be mixed, and BIOD-Smart Basal releases insulin proportional to the subcutaneous glucose concentration. Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN) is also developing a basal insulin. Phase 2 trials have been completed, but no results are published yet. Clinical trials with the new <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> from CeQur (Montreux, Switzerland) have recently started in Europe. This <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> delivers both basal and bolus doses subcutaneously and is intended for people with type 2 diabetes who need multiple daily injection insulin therap...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} of novel “patch”-type insulin infusion pump (IIP) technologies {{has created an}} opportunity {{to improve the quality}} of life for a broader type 2 diabetes patient demographic. At first glance, type 2 diabetes patients represent a large percentage of the total diabetes patient population; however, adoption of traditional IIP products and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy has remained limited amongst this patient segment. With an insulin reservoir, delivery system, and cannula integrated into a small, wearable, disposable or semidisposable device, <b>patch</b> <b>pumps</b> simplify traditional IIP therapy, while potentially offering therapeutic benefits over traditional MDI therapy.

40|$|The first {{manufactured}} insulin pump {{was introduced}} in the 1970 s and the first insulin pens in 1985; since then, many improvements have been made to both devices. The advantages of pens over syringes have been confirmed in numerous studies and include greater accuracy, ease of use, patient satisfaction, quality of life, and adherence. United States claims database analyses indicate that the improved adherence made possible by use of an insulin pen has the potential to reduce diabetes care costs when compared with using a vial and syringe. Features of certain advanced pump models include the ability to connect wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or to a subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor for semicontinuous glucose-driven insulin rate adjustment. A new trend in the design of insulin pumps is the tubing-free <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> that adheres directly to the skin.

40|$|Insulin pump therapy [continuous {{subcutaneous}} insulin infusion (CSII) ] requires regular {{change of}} infusion sets every 2 - 3 days {{in order to}} minimize the risk of skin irritations or other adverse events. This has been discussed to be a potential burden to the environment. The purpose of this analysis was to perform an environmental assessment of insulin pump infusion sets based on loss of resources occurring during incineration of the discarded products and by means of a lifecycle concept used to weight a material in relation to its rareness on earth and its consumption. In addition to five infusion sets (Inset 30, InsetII, Comfort, Quick-set, and Cleo), a <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> (Omnipod) was also included in this analysis. The annual loss in waste of the so called “person reserve” of 3 days of catheter use was compared with daily consumption of {{a cup of coffee in}} a disposable paper cup and to a soft drink in an aluminum can. The weight-based loss in resources through waste for the infusion sets (except for Cleo) corresponded to 70 - 200 % of the loss of resources for a coffee cup (Cleo, 320 %; Omnipod, 1, 821, 600 %) and to 1 - 3 % of the loss from an aluminum soft drink can (Cleo, 5 %; Omnipod, 31, 200 %). The loss or resources by use of infusion sets used in insulin pump therapy appears to be low and is similar to the burden induced by the uptake of one cup of coffee per day. The loss or resources with regular CSII is considerably lower than the loss or resources induced by patch pumps...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare blood glucose and plasma insulin {{profiles}} after bolus insulin infusion by a <b>patch</b> <b>pump</b> (PP) versus a conventional pump (CP), directly after placement and after Day 3 of use. Twenty patients with type 1 diabetes came in for two blocks of visits: one block of two visits while wearing the OmniPod® (Insulet Corp., Bedford, MA) insulin pump (PP) and one block of two visits while wearing the Medtronic Diabetes (Northridge, CA) Paradigm® pump (CP). Patients administered an identical mealtime insulin bolus of at least 6 IU. For PP, maximum glucose levels were 28. 7 % lower on Day 3 (P= 0. 020), when maximum insulin levels were 30. 3 % higher (P= 0. 002). For CP, maximum glucose levels were 26. 5 % lower on Day 3 (P= 0. 015), when maximum insulin levels were 46. 4 % higher (P= 0. 003). Glucose levels (mean [interquartile range]) were significantly lower on Day 3 for PP (168. 2 [145. 8] mg/dL vs. 139. 4 [77. 8] mg/dL; P= 0. 013), but not significantly so for CP (159. 0 [66. 1] mg/dL vs. 139. 5 [57. 9] mg/dL; P= 0. 084). Mean insulin levels were significantly higher on Day 3 for CP (195 [120] pmol/L vs. 230 [90] pmol/L; P= 0. 01), but not significantly so for PP (178 [106] pmol/L vs. 194 [120] pmol/L; P= 0. 099).

50|$|As {{observed}} by Springer Healthcare, The main {{advantage of the}} Omnipod System is the freedom it grants its users. Contrary to previous pump technology, it contains no external tubing. Insulin is pumped directly from the reservoir into the imbedded cannula, removing {{the need for a}} connecting tube. Having a <b>patch</b> style <b>pump</b> eliminates many worries that most pump wearers have to think about. The all-in-one style of the Omnipod allows the user to wear their pump at all times, even without clothing. They don’t have to worry about clipping it onto their belt or pants, so it can be worn at all times. Also, this means that any form of physical activity can also be performed while still wearing the pump; It is even waterproof up to 25 feet. Since the pump user doesn’t have to disconnect their pump for common activities, they will consistently receive insulin and have better control over their blood sugars.|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{has been}} {{recognised}} since antiquity. The first description that resembles {{the features of}} the disease is found in Ebers papyrus (1550 BC). The term ";diabetes"; was first coined by Aretaeus of Cappadocia. Galen described it as a disease specific to the kidneys because of a weakness in their retentive faculties. Word mellitus was added by Thomas Willis in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients (first noticed by the ancient Indians, Chinese and Japanese). He later noticed that some urine samples were sweet (diabetes mellitus) whereas others were tasteless (diabetes insipidus). Later Cullen and John Rollo confirmed these two types. It was only in 1776 that Dobson firstly confirmed the presence of excess sugar in urine and blood as a cause of their sweetness. Claude Bernard discovered in 1857 that liver releases a substance i. e. glycogen which affects blood sugar level. The role of the pancreas in pathogenesis of diabetes was discovered by Mering and Minkowski in 1889. In 1909, Jean De Meyer named glucose lowering hormone as insulin whose existence was hypothetical at that time. Banting and Macleod got Noble prize for isolating insulin in 1923. Discovery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes represents one of the major humanitarian and scientific milestones of the 20 th century. Oral hypoglycemic drugs were introduced later.

The idea of a programmable implantable microchip-based drug delivery device was first demonstrated pre-clinically in 1999 [3] and was recently evaluated in the first human clinical study for delivery of human parathyroid hormone fragment 1 – 34 (hPTH[1 – 34]) [4]. This study showed that micro-chip-based delivery achieved pharmacokinetics similar to multiple injections and produced no significant adverse effects. Methods & results An early clinical study of the microchip-based device by Farra et al. was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and bioequivalence of the microchip for delivering hPTH(1 – 34) [4]. Eight postmenopausal women between 65 and 70 years of age with osteoporosis participated in the study. The titanium micro-chips used in the study stored 20 individual 40 -µg doses of freeze-dried hPTH(1 – 34), individually sealed in tiny reservoirs measuring 600 nl in size, and contained a wireless transmitter that communicated with a small portable computer. Upon activation, an individual reservoir could be opened by electrochemical dissolution of the res-ervoir cover, thereby exposing the hPTH(1 – 34) to bodily fluid for drug dissolution and release.

Her cargoes included food, medical supplies, and vehicles. After the port's capture by the Allies in July, she added Cherbourg to her itinerary and, railroad tracks having been installed in her tank deck, began carrying rolling stock in early September. In the course of these train-ferrying operations, LST-389 struck an underwater obstruction at Grand Rade, Cherbourg, on 12 November. Major leaks in her main engine room resulted. Unable to make any headway against the rising water, the tank landing ship, aided by two tugboats, was beached. Seven hours of shoring, <b>patching,</b> and <b>pumping</b> freed the engine room of unwanted water. With the aid of British tugs, LST-389 then completed her ferry mission before LST-355 towed her back to Devonport, England. Following major repairs in drydock, the ship received an overhaul alongside [...] before resuming active service in mid-January 1945. She again shuttled railroad cars and passengers between England and France. While returning from Le Havre to Portland, Dorset, early on the fog-shrouded morning of 5 February, LST-389 was rammed by the civilian merchantman SS Chapel Hill Victory. The collision ripped a hole 18 ft wide in the tank landing ship from main deck to bottom and killed one member of her crew. LST-389 then proceeded to Portland under her own power. After a week at anchor off Portland, LST-389 put into Plymouth for another drydocking which lasted into late March.

5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be <b>patched,</b> the water <b>pumped</b> out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions.

40|$|Hollow needles of micron {{dimensions}} {{have previously}} been fabricated and envisioned {{for use with}} transdermal <b>patches</b> or infusion <b>pumps</b> to achieve painless delivery of drugs to the skin for local and systemic effects {{without the need for}} hypodermic needles. However, little work has been carried out to identify methods to effectively use hollow microneedles for drug delivery. To address this need, we inserted hollow, glass microneedles into hairless rat skin in vivo and human cadaver skin in vitro and then imaged infusion of dye molecules, insulin, polymer microparticles, and cells into the skin by brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. The depth of needle penetration into skin was controlled by inserting needles with a rotary drilling device, which enabled localized injection within the epidermis or dermis with ± 60 μm resolution. Although small quantities of fluid could be injected after needle insertion into skin, partial retraction of the needle by withdrawing back 100 – 300 μm or vibrating the microneedle array dramatically increased infusion flow rate. We conclude that hollow microneedles can be used for precise microinjection into skin, especially when a single needle is inserted by rotary drilling and then retracted part way before infusion or a microneedle array is inserted by mechanical vibration...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Cardiac myocytes utilize three {{high-capacity}} Na transport processes whose precise function {{can determine}} myocyte fate and the triggering of arrhythmias in pathological settings. We present recent {{results on the}} regulation of all three transporters that may be important for an understanding of cardiac function during ischemia/reperfusion episodes. METHODS AND RESULTS Refined ion selective electrode (ISE) techniques and giant patch methods were {{used to analyze the}} function of cardiac Na/K pumps, Na/Ca exchange (NCX 1), and Na/H exchange (NHE 1) in excised cardiac patches and intact myocytes. To consider results cohesively, simulations were developed that account for electroneutrality of the cytoplasm, ion homeostasis, water homeostasis (i. e., cell volume), and cytoplasmic pH. The Na/K pump determines the average life-time of Na ions (3 - 10 minutes) as well as K ions (> 30 minutes) in the cytoplasm. The long time course of K homeostasis can determine the time course of myocyte volume changes after ion homeostasis is perturbed. In excised <b>patches,</b> cardiac Na/K <b>pumps</b> turn on slowly (- 30 seconds) with millimolar ATP dependence, when activated for the first time. In steady state, however, pumps are fully active with < 0. 2 mM ATP and are nearly unaffected by high ADP (2 mM) and Pi (10 mM) concentrations as may occur in ischemia. NCX 1 s appear to operate with slippage that contributes to background Na influx and inward current in heart. Thus, myocyte Na levels may be regulated by the inactivation reactions of the exchanger which are both Na- and proton-dependent. NHE 1 also undergo strong Na-dependent inactivation, whereby a brief rise of cytoplasmic Na can cause inactivation that persists for many minutes after cytoplasmic Na is removed. This mechanism is blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting involvement of a Na-dependent G-protein. Given that maximal NCX 1 - and NHE 1 -mediated ion fluxes are much greater than maximal Na/K pump-mediated Na extrusion in myocytes, the Na-dependent inactivation mechanisms of NCX 1 and NHE 1 may be important determinants of cardiac Na homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS Na/K pumps appear to be optimized to continue operation when energy reserves are compromised. Both NCX 1 and NHE 1 activities are regulated by accumulation of cytoplasmic Na. These principles may importantly control cardiac cytoplasmic Na and promote myocyte survival during ischemia/reperfusion episodes by preventing Ca overload...|$|R
