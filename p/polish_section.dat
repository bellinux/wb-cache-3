5|$|On 12 August 1921, the League {{was asked}} to settle the matter; the Council created a {{commission}} with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide {{the details of the}} interaction between the two areas – for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas. In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the <b>Polish</b> <b>section</b> containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|With {{the closure}} of the <b>Polish</b> <b>section,</b> Belsen became the only {{exclusively}} Jewish facility in the British sector, something for which the Jewish survivors had struggled with the British. The camp was for a while the largest Jewish DP camp in Germany.

In August 1946, the DP camp still housed more than 11,000 Jews. From then on, the British Army tried to prevent any more Jews from joining the DP camp.|$|E
25|$|While a {{small number}} of Lemkos {{returned}} (some 5,000 Lemko families returned to their home regions in Poland between 1957–1958, (they were officially granted the right to return in 1956), the Lemko population in the <b>Polish</b> <b>section</b> of Lemkivschyna only numbers around 10,000–15,000 today. Some 50,000 Lemkos live in the western and northern parts of Poland, where they were sent to populate former German villages in areas ceded to Poland. Among those, 5,863 people identified themselves as Lemko in the 2002 census. However, 60,000 ethnic Lemkos may reside in Poland today. Within Lemkivshchyna, Lemkos live in the villages of Łosie, Krynica-Zdrój, Nowica, Zdynia, Gładyszów, Hańczowa, Zyndranowa, Uście Gorlickie, Bartne, Binczarowa and Bielanka.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{he joined the}} Polish {{democratic}} opposition.

In 1971–73 {{he worked for the}} Polish Academy of Sciences. In the mid-1970s he began to write for one of the few relatively independent publications in Poland, Tygodnik Powszechny, about intellectual history and literature. In 1974 he became an editor of Poland’s most important literary monthly, Twórczość. In 1975 he signed the Letter of the 59 protesting changes in Poland’s constitution intended to subject Poland fully to the USSR. He then joined Zdzisław Najder in creating the Alliance for Polish Independence—Polish democratic opposition underground think tank. Since 1975 he collaborated with the <b>Polish</b> <b>Section</b> of Radio Free Europe. In 1979, together with Marcin Król, he founded the independent journal Res Publica.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{is home to}} {{more than}} 440,000 people of Polish descent, their {{presence}} felt most strongly in the Greater Cleveland area, where half of Ohio's Polish population resides. The city of Cleveland, Ohio has a large Polish community, especially in historic Slavic Village, as part of its Warszawa Section. Poles from this part of Cleveland migrated to the suburbs, such as Garfield Heights, Parma and Seven Hills. Parma has even recently been designated a Polish Village commercial district. Farther out, other members of Cleveland's Polish community live in Brecksville, Independence and Broadview Heights. Many of these Poles return to their Polish roots, by attending masses at St. Stanislaus Church, on East 65th Street and Baxter Avenue. Poles in Cleveland celebrate the annual Harvest Festival, which is usually held at the end of August. It features polka music, Polish food and all things Polish. Cleveland's other <b>Polish</b> <b>section</b> is in Tremont, located on Cleveland's west side. The home parishes are St. John Cantius and St. John Kanty.

500|$|Through {{the efforts}} {{of his family and}} friends, {{information}} about Siwiec became known to the anti-communist Solidarność opposition in Poland by the 1980s. A brochure about him was published in 1981. After the fall of communism, Siwiec became the subject of the 1991 documentary film Hear My Cry (Usłyszcie mój krzyk), by Polish director Maciej Drygas. The film won several awards including the European Film Awards [...] "Felix" [...] prize for [...] "Best Documentary" [...] that year. Drygas, who is credited with reconstructing and popularizing Siwiec's story, remarked that compared to other similar incidents of that time, such as the self-immolations of Palach or Romas Kalanta, Siwiec death's is unique in how little attention it attracted. Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, the director of the <b>Polish</b> <b>section</b> of Radio Free Europe, expressed a similar sentiment: [...] "This was an unheard of human tragedy... The tragedy lay in that his sacrifice went completely unnoticed." [...] In the same vein, Kavaliauskas interprets Drygas' movie as a critique of contemporary Polish society, saying that witnesses did not want to have this incident spoil their enjoyment of the festival on an otherwise [...] "perfect day".|$|E

A school opened in the summer of 1945, attended by up to 600 children, and two kindergartens cared for 100 children. Many Polish DPs were young adults and they started new families in the camp — there were almost 400 weddings and 200 births in the Polish camp. The Committee published newspapers.

The wedding took place at the St. Michael the Archangel Church and was officiated by Vladas Mironas. This family connection proved instrumental in his future career. From early 1930 to June 1932, Raštikis attended the officer's courses of the General Staff of Reichswehr (...)

In exchange for the financial support during his studies, he had to complete six years of military duty.|$|E

40|$|Earthen {{architectural}} fragments (burned or cemented) {{are often}} {{collected during the}} excavation in Italian prehistoric and protohistoric sites. The technological characterization of these remains is relevant to recognize the existence of local or regional building traditions and to understand the exploitation of raw materials and, more in general, the ancient production strategies. In addition to the current macroscopic analysis (morphology of fragments and classification of pastes) and before the realization of archaeometric analysis, it’s possible to complete the analytical protocol of daub with some observations in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> To realize a <b>polished</b> <b>section,</b> the daub sample is cut and the resulting <b>section</b> is <b>polished</b> with sandpaper. The realization {{of this kind of}} section allows a better description of the arrangement of the constituents, to identify the processes of transformation and deformation of raw materials during the building activity. The aim of these mesoscopic analysis is to characterize the behavioral chain referred to the processing of raw materials and their installation, linking the observed characteristics to specific actions. It’s possible to obtain some functional data about the original function of the earthen structures or the dynamics of entrance in the archaeological record a well. This paper presents some case-studies and some preliminary keys to understand the features observed in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> The use of this analytical technique gives some encouraging results, especially in comparing the number of relevant data to the low cost of production of a <b>polished</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} quantify the ore minerals visible in <b>polished</b> <b>section</b> through OIA and, mainly, to show a detailed description of the methodology implemented. Automated ore identification and determination of geometric parameters predictive of geometallurgical behavior, such as grade, grain size or liberation, have been successfully performed. The results show that automated identification and quantification of ore mineral images are possible through multispectral and color {{image analysis}}. Therefore, the optical image analysis method could be a consistent automated mineralogical alternative to carry on detailed ore petrography...|$|R
