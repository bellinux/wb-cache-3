25|$|Boaters {{approaching}} a lock are usually <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> another boat coming towards them, because this boat will have just exited {{the lock on}} their level and therefore set the lock in their favour – saving about 5 to 10 minutes. However, {{this is not true}} for staircase locks, where it is quicker for boats to go through in convoy.|$|E
25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew {{in their approach}} to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour {{in the autumn of}} that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, <b>Pleased</b> <b>To</b> <b>Meet</b> You, was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E

500|$|Coey's {{request to}} {{transfer}} to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps was granted, and he was accordingly placed in a three-month medical course in Bulawayo, starting in April 1974. On its completion in July, {{he was promoted to}} corporal and posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) heliborne commando battalion, where he was installed as an instructor. He expressed pride in teaching [...] "as we did at Quantico—the Marine way!" [...] He was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> other Americans in the RLI, particularly when they were fellow US Marines. The American expatriates in the Rhodesian forces tended to try to stay together and associate with each other. They were later informally dubbed [...] "the Crippled Eagles" [...] by the American author Robin Moore, who moved to Salisbury in August 1976 and became their unofficial patron. Coey liked and respected his fellow soldiers, who in turn regarded him as strong, capable and brave, but there was mutual animosity concerning their respective lifestyles while off-duty. [...] "They live for pleasure mostly," [...] Coey wrote in his journal, [...] "drinking and whoring. The Christian soldier is sometimes despised and ridiculed." ...|$|E
500|$|A cover {{version of}} [...] "September Gurls" [...] {{appeared}} on the Bangles' 1986 triple platinum album Different Light. [...] "September Gurls", Borack wrote, [...] "was and is {{the sine qua non}} of power pop, a glorious, glittering jewel with every facet cut and shined to absolute perfection.... a peerless, aching distillation of love and longing. 'September Gurls' may not actually be the greatest song ever recorded, but for the duration of its 2:47 running time, you can be forgiven for believing it is." [...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album <b>Pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> Me and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others. Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered [...] "I'm In Love With a Girl" [...] on their 2015 release All a Man Should Do, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.|$|E

The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for <b>Pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> Me (1987), recorded in Memphis with Big Star producer Jim Dickinson. Minneapolis guitarist Slim Dunlap took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, The Bangles {{released}} {{their second}} LP, Different Light, which contained a cover version of Chilton's Big Star song [...] "September Gurls". Royalties from this version allowed Chilton, who had struggled financially since leaving The Box Tops, {{to buy his}} first new car since his Box Top days, {{and a piece of}} rural land near Hohenwald, Tennessee, where he planned to build a small house. The following year, his visibility increased in the alternative rock scene when he was the subject of the song [...] "Alex Chilton" [...] by American rock band The Replacements on their album <b>Pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> Me, on which Chilton was a guest musician playing guitar on the song [...] "Can't Hardly Wait".|$|E
2500|$|Eno co-produced The Unforgettable Fire (1984), The Joshua Tree (1987), Achtung Baby (1991), and All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) for U2 {{with his}} {{frequent}} collaborator Daniel Lanois, and produced 1993's Zooropa with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis. In 1995, U2 and Eno {{joined forces to}} create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers; songs from which included [...] "Your Blue Room" [...] and [...] "Miss Sarajevo". When the album was released, the US charts were dominated by movie soundtrack albums and singles. Even though films are listed for each song, all but three are bogus. Once Eno pointed {{out that it was}} not a real ploy for radio airplay, but a spoof of one, U2 agreed to the concept. Eno also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994) Millionaires (1999) and <b>Pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> You (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for [...] "frequent interference and occasional co-production" [...] on their 1997 album Whiplash.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would have}} been {{manifest}} to a meaner capacity than any present that evening that Mr. Magnet regarded Marjorie with a distinguished significance.

He saluted Daffy courteously, and then allowed himself to retain Marjorie's hand {{for just a second}} longer than was necessary as he said--very simply--"I am very <b>pleased</b> indeed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you again--very." ...|$|R
