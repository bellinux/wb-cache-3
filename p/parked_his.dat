5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other children. The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. Fifty years later, the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people away from him. They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E

Long <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> vehicle behind an adjacent building, got out, and prepared to shoot, but found that the vehicle was empty. He then drove north and noticed a police officer washing his vehicle a short distance away, but the officer left before Long could get close.|$|E

That summer, Serrill Headley, who by then {{had moved to the}} town of Oxford, Pennsylvania with her brother, confided to friends that her son had become a religious fanatic and had been to terrorist {{training camp}}s. While Gilani was on a catering visit to his mother's house, one of her friends, Phyllis Keith, noticed that he <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car behind her residence as if he was trying to hide it. Keith reported Gilani to the FBI office in Philadelphia, which apparently did not follow through with an investigation.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 2005 at 10:30 local time, British Formula One driver David Coulthard {{drove his}} Red Bull racing car {{across the bridge}} from the European side to the Asian side, then, after turning with a powerslide at the toll plaza, back to the European side for show. He <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car {{in the garden of}} Dolmabahçe Palace where his ride had started. While {{crossing}} the bridge with his Formula 1 car, Coulthard was picked up by the automatic surveillance system and charged with a fine of 20 Euros because he passed through the toll booths without payment.

25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when he got to his car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E
25|$|The first murders widely {{attributed}} to the Zodiac Killer were the shootings {{of high school students}} Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday on December 20, 1968, on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits. The couple were on their first date and planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High School about three blocks from Jensen's home. The couple instead visited a friend before stopping at a local restaurant and then driving out on Lake Herman Road. At about 10:15p.m., Faraday <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> mother's Rambler in a gravel turnout, which was a well-known lovers' lane. Shortly after 11:00p.m., their bodies were found by Stella Borges, who lived nearby. The Solano County Sheriff's Department investigated the crime but no leads developed.|$|E
25|$|After {{overnight}} {{track work}} to fix {{problems with the}} track at turn 10, the race started with Hamilton holding his lead and all the cars making it through the first corner. Hamilton built up a lead of over 5 seconds over Robert Kubica before Adrian Sutil had a gearbox failure on the 16th lap and <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car after turn 3. Sutil's car was off the track but after it caught fire the safety car was brought out, {{and there was a}} rush of drivers into the pits as all of the six lead drivers went in for their pit stops. Hamilton led Räikkönen and Kubica into the pitlane but Räikkönen took the lead as they left their garages, with Kubica alongside him and Hamilton behind.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} war, Licavoli was on the defense. Although no {{attempts}} were made on his life, many of Licavoli's men and associates {{were killed in the}} war. This included one of Licavoli's most powerful allies, consigliere Leo Moceri, whose bloodstained car was found in a hotel parking lot in Akron, Ohio. Repeated attempts to kill Nardi and especially Greene failed. However, in 1977, things started turning in his favor. His men were able to kill Nardi with a car bomb. Later the same year, he hired Ray Ferritto to kill Danny Greene. While Greene was visiting the dentist, Ferritto <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car attached with a car bomb next to Greene's. When Greene left the dentist's office and went to his car, the bomb was ignited, killing Greene. Licavoli would go on trial for their murders, but was eventually acquitted.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's {{home until}} {{the last week of}} June 1934; that on some {{occasions}} they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived {{on the north side of}} Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{accident}} was attributed to {{the driver of the}} automobile, Juan Manuel Álvarez of Compton, California, who deliberately drove and left his vehicle onto the tracks while allegedly attempting to commit suicide. Having slashed his wrists and stabbed himself repeatedly in the chest, he <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car on the tracks to finish the attempt. However, Álvarez changed his mind and attempted to leave the railroad tracks. Because he was unable to dislodge his vehicle from the rain-soaked gravel and slick rails, he abandoned the vehicle moments before the crowded southbound train approached. However, there has been some speculation that Álvarez may have inflicted the wounds on himself after the crash, based on some early reports by witnesses. Both this causation and the end result have many similarities to that of the Ufton Nervet rail crash in the United Kingdom, which occurred only three months previously, although in that case the driver of the car stayed in the vehicle and was killed.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, King {{was another}} retiree as he <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car two laps after the restart with a {{punctured}} tyre, while Serrallés drove {{slowly to the}} pit lane to replace a dislodged front wing. Further back, Verstappen was moving through the field and up to eleventh position and was drawing closer to Calderón ahead of him for a top-ten placing. At {{the front of the}} race, Rosenqvist was maintaining a lead of over four seconds from Cassidy, with Auer pressuring the struggling New Zealand. However Auer could not take advantage of Cassidy's handicap and he pulled clear. At the end, Cassidy glanced the wall with the rear-end of his car, and lost time in the track's final sector. Auer slipstreamed up to the rear of Cassidy and temporarily moved into second on lap thirteen. He ran wide at Lisboa corner {{for the third time in}} the event, allowing Cassidy back through to second position. Auer was later able to retake the position later in the lap. Cassidy opted not to challenge Auer and refocused himself on the closing Merhi.|$|E
500|$|Kovalainen {{suffered}} a [...] on lap35. The McLaren limped {{around the track}} back to the pit lane on the disintegrating tyre, rejoining in 17th on a replacement. Alonso, Massa, Hamilton and Räikkönen all pitted for the final time over laps36 to 38. Coming out of {{the second round of}} pit stops, Hamilton led Räikkönen by 13seconds, Räikkönen more than 2.5seconds ahead of Massa. The gap between the Ferraris began to close, and Massa eased past Räikkönen on the back straight on lap49, to take second place on the track. Meanwhile, Kovalainen <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> car in the McLaren garage and retired from the race, his team not taking any chances with a problem which had developed with the engine's hydraulics.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 29, Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, and then Allen drove him past the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in Parkland, Washington, a suburb of Tacoma. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen drove back past the coffee shop and parked nearby. Some reports from {{witnesses}} said Clemmons <b>parked</b> <b>his</b> truck in a car wash north of the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on. Around 8 a.m, Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop, where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift. Clemmons opened fire on the officers, shooting them to death.|$|E
