5|$|Cyathus striatus can {{reproduce}} both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis), {{typical of}} taxa in the basidiomycetes that contain both haploid and diploid stages.

5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called <b>plasmogamy.</b> Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plasmogamy</b> is a {{stage in}} the sexual {{reproduction}} of fungi, in which the cytoplasm of two parent cells (usually from the mycelia) fuses together without the fusion of nuclei, effectively bringing two haploid nuclei close {{together in the same}} cell. This state is followed by karyogamy, where the two nuclei fuse together and then undergo meiosis to produce spores.The dikaryotic state that comes after <b>plasmogamy</b> will often persist for many generations before the fungi undergoes karyogamy. In lower fungi however, <b>plasmogamy</b> is usually immediately followed by karyogamy.|$|E

50|$|Fungi are {{classified}} by {{the methods of}} sexual reproduction they employ. The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of resting spores {{that are used to}} survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: <b>plasmogamy,</b> karyogamy and meiosis. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during <b>plasmogamy</b> and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores.|$|E
50|$|In other {{varieties}} of multicellular life (e.g. the fungi division, Basidiomycota) sexual characteristics {{can be much}} more complex, and may involve many more than two sexes. For details on the sexual characteristics of fungi, see: Hypha and <b>Plasmogamy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mortierella forms zygospores {{that are}} the {{developmental}} consequence of <b>plasmogamy</b> between gametangia belonging to complementary mating types. The zygospores of Mortierella spp. may be naked (Fig 2 A) or surrounded by sterile hyphae (Fig 2 B) that form a nest-like structure, which may be interpreted as evolutionary early fruiting bodies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plasmodium}} often {{appears as}} white frost-like growth or thin watery layers on wood. Pillar or wall-like sporangia bud from the plasmodium and develop spores that undergo multiple divisions before they release flagellated zoospores. The zoospores will then pair off, undergo <b>plasmogamy,</b> and form zygotes that will later form new plasmodia.|$|E
50|$|Zygospores {{are formed}} in certain fungi (zygomycota, for example Rhizopus) and some algae (for example Chlamydomonas). The zygospore forms through the isogamic fusion of two cells (motile single cells in Chlamydomonas) or sexual {{conjugation}} between two hyphae (in zygomycota). <b>Plasmogamy</b> {{is followed by}} karyogamy, therefore zygospores are diploid (zygotes). They will undergo zygotic meiosis upon germinating.|$|E
50|$|Microtubule {{movement}} is mediated {{by a family}} of motor proteins known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast. Accessory proteins, such as Spc72 in yeast, act as a glue, connecting the motor protein, spindle pole body and microtubule in a structure known as the half-bridge. Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which is the site of initial cell fusion in <b>plasmogamy.</b> After <b>plasmogamy,</b> the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite pronucleus. It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite pronucleus, triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction.|$|E
50|$|In many fungi (except chytrids), as in some protists, {{fertilisation}} is a {{two step}} process. First, the cytoplasms {{of the two}} gamete cells fuse (called <b>plasmogamy),</b> producing a dikaryotic or heterokaryotic cell with multiple nuclei. This cell may then divide to produce dikaryotic or heterokaryotic hyphae. The second step of fertilisation is karyogamy, the fusion of the nuclei to form a diploid zygote.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of slime moulds {{is very similar to}} that of fungi. Haploid spores {{germinate}} to form swarm cells or myxamoebae. These fuse in a process referred to as <b>plasmogamy</b> and karyogamy to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into a plasmodium, and the mature plasmodium produces, depending on the species, one to many fruiting bodies containing haploid spores.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasexual cycle}} resembles sexual reproduction. In both cases, unlike hyphae (or {{modifications}} thereof) may fuse (<b>plasmogamy)</b> and their nuclei will occupy the same cell. The unlike nuclei fuse (karyogamy) {{to form a}} diploid (zygote) nucleus. In contrast to the sexual cycle, in the parasexual cycle recombination takes place during mitosis followed by haploidization (but without meiosis). The recombined haploid nuclei appear among vegetative cells, which differ genetically {{from those of the}} parent mycelium.|$|E
50|$|A zygomycete hypha grows {{towards a}} {{compatible}} mate {{and they both}} form a bridge, called a progametangia, by joining at the hyphal tips via <b>plasmogamy.</b> A pair of septa forms around the merged tips, enclosing nuclei from both isolates. A second pair of septa forms two adjacent cells, one on each side. These adjacent cells, called suspensors provide structural support. The central cell is destined to become a spore. The nuclei join in a process called karyogamy to form a zygote.|$|E
50|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and <b>plasmogamy</b> of fungal cells.

It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5000|$|Fungal mycelia are {{typically}} haploid. When mycelia of different mating types meet, they produce two multinucleate ball-shaped cells, which join via a [...] "mating bridge". Nuclei {{move from one}} mycelium into the other, forming a heterokaryon (meaning [...] "different nuclei"). This process is called <b>plasmogamy.</b> Actual fusion to form diploid nuclei is called karyogamy, and may not occur until sporangia are formed. Karogamy produces a diploid zygote, which is a short-lived sporophyte that soon undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. When the spores germinate, they develop into new mycelia.|$|E
50|$|In summary, meiosis {{takes place}} in a diploid basidium. Each one of the four haploid nuclei migrates into its own basidiospore. The basidiospores are ballistically {{discharged}} and start new haploid mycelia called monokaryons. There are no males or females, rather there are compatible thalli with multiple compatibility factors. <b>Plasmogamy</b> between compatible individuals leads to delayed karyogamy leading to establishment of a dikaryon. The dikaryon is long lasting but ultimately gives rise to either fruitbodies with basidia or directly to basidia without fruitbodies. The paired dikaryon in the basidium fuse (i.e. karyogamy takes place). The diploid basidium begins the cycle again.|$|E
50|$|As in most zygomycetes, asexual {{reproduction}} {{is the most}} common form of reproduction. Sexual reproduction in Rhizopus stolonifer, as in other zygomycetes, occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other. Growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact, and <b>plasmogamy,</b> or the fusion of the cytoplasm, occurs. Karyogamy, which is the fusion of the nuclei, follows closely after. The zygosporangia are then diploid. Zygosporangia are typically thick-walled, highly resilient to environmental hardships, and metabolically inert. When conditions improve, however, they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae. Meiosis occurs during germination of the zygosporagium so the resulting spores or hyphae are haploid. Grows in warm and damp conditions.|$|E
50|$|The dikaryon is {{a nuclear}} feature which {{is unique to}} some fungi. The green alga Derbesia has been long {{considered}} an exception, until the heterokaryotic hypothesis was challenged by later studies. Compatible cell-types can fuse cytoplasms (<b>plasmogamy).</b> When this occurs, the two nuclei of two cells pair off and cohabit without fusing (karyogamy). This can be maintained for all {{the cells of the}} hyphae by synchronously dividing so that pairs are passed to newer cells. In the Ascomycota this attribute is most often found in the ascogenous hyphae and ascocarp while the bulk of the mycelia remains monokaryotic. In the Basidiomycota this is the dominant phase with most Basidiomycota monokaryons weakly growing and short-lived.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of the Zygomycota, sexual {{reproduction}} in C. bertholletiae is through the formation of zygospores. Specifically, in the case of C. bertholletiae, heterothallic mating occurs when hyphae of opposite mating types are stimulated by mutually-secreted pheromones to grow toward each other and differentiate into gametangia. When they meet, these gametangia fuse (<b>plasmogamy)</b> and form a multinucleate, dikaryotic zygosporangium flanked by suspensor cells derived from the contributing hyphae. Each zygosporangium produces one zygospore, which, after a dormant period of weeks to months, undergoes nuclear fusion (karyogamy) to produce a diploid nucleus. The diploid nucleus then undergoes meiosis and chromosomes recombine to produce recombinant progeny genomes. A germosporangium forms, containing haploid spores, which are released into the environment to initiate the growth of a new mycelium.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{membranes}} and cytoplasm of these haploid cells then fuse {{together in a}} process known as <b>plasmogamy.</b> This results in a single cell with two nuclei, known as pronuclei. The pronuclei then fuse together in a well regulated process known as karyogamy. This creates a diploid cell known as a zygote, or a zygospore, which can then enter meiosis, a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and cell division, to create four new haploid gamete cells. The advantage of sexual reproduction is the same as in any organism: more genetic variability results, providing the opportunity for adaption through natural selection. Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together a variety of genetic material in order to ensure recombination in meiosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of karyogamy is fusion of the two haploid nuclei. The first step in this process is {{the movement of the}} two pronuclei toward each other, which occurs directly after <b>plasmogamy.</b> Each pronucleus has a spindle pole body that is embedded in the nuclear envelope and serves as an attachment point for microtubules. Microtubules, an important fiber-like component of the cytoskeleton, emerge at the spindle pole body. The attachment point to the spindle pole body marks the minus end, and the plus end extends into the cytoplasm. The plus end has normal roles in mitotic division, but during nuclear congression, the plus ends are redirected. The microtubule plus ends attach to the opposite pronucleus, resulting in the pulling of the two pronuclei toward each other.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Cyathus helenae {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called <b>plasmogamy.</b> After {{a period of time}} and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruit bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruit bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.|$|E
50|$|Karyogamy is {{the final}} {{step in the process}} of fusing {{together}} two haploid eukaryotic cells, and refers specifically to the fusion of the two nuclei. Before karyogamy, each haploid cell has one complete copy of the organism's genome. In order for karyogamy to occur, the cell membrane and cytoplasm of each cell must fuse with the other in a process known as <b>plasmogamy.</b> Once within the joined cell membrane, the nuclei are referred to as pronuclei. Once the cell membranes, cytoplasm, and pronuclei fuse together, the resulting single cell is diploid, containing two copies of the genome. This diploid cell, called a zygote or zygospore can then enter meiosis (a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and division, to produce four new haploid cells), or continue to divide by mitosis. Mammalian fertilization uses a comparable process to combine haploid sperm and egg cells (gametes) to create a diploid fertilized egg.|$|E
50|$|Cyathus striatus can {{reproduce}} both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis), {{typical of}} taxa in the basidiomycetes that contain both haploid and diploid stages. Basidiospores {{produced in the}} peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After the spores have been dispersed into a suitable growing environment, they germinate and develop into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each cell compartment.

50|$|In zygomycetes fungi, two hyphae of {{opposing}} mating types form special structures called gametangia where the hyphae touch. The gametangia then fuse into a zygosporangium. In other fungi, cells from two hyphae with opposing mating types fuse, but only cytoplasmic (<b>plasmogamy).</b> The two nuclei do not fuse, {{leading to the}} formation of a dikaryon cell that gives rise to a mycelium consisting of dikaryons. Karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) occurs in sporangia and leads {{to the formation of}} diploid cells (zygotes) that immediately undergo meiosis to form spores.In many cases, isogamous fertilization is used by organisms that can also reproduce asexually through binary fission, budding, or asexual spore formation. The switch to sexual reproduction mode is often triggered by a change from favorable to unfavorable growing conditions. Fertilization often leads to the formation of a thick-walled zygotic resting spore that can withstand harsh environments and will germinate once growing conditions turn favorable again.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Cyathus olla, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment.

These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores. Meiosis in C. olla {{has been found to be}} similar to that of higher organisms.|$|E
50|$|Some Mortierella {{species are}} {{homothallic}} (M. epigama, M. parvispora, M. nigrescens,M. rostafinskii, M. polycephala, M.renispora), {{but most are}} heterothallic (M. elongata, M. marburgensis, M. umbelata, M. capitata, M. indohi). The species Mortierella alpina {{was found to be}} homothallic and to form zygospores with a hyphal coat. Most Mortierella species {{have been found to be}} heterothallic and to produce naked zygospores with unequal suspensors. Very often sexual structures differ in size between mating types. The smaller suspensor, progametangium or gametangium does not enlarge during sexual development and may disappear soon after <b>plasmogamy.</b> The early development of such heterogametangic zygospores is illustrated in the heterothallic species, M. umbellata. In this species, hyphal coiling occurs at the contact site of sexually compatible mycelia. This is followed by development of progametangia which grow in parallel and close to each other. At the end of this development, one partner, the macroprogametangium will be larger than the other, the microprogametangium.|$|E
50|$|The parasexual cycle, {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and <b>plasmogamy).</b> Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving mitotic crossing-over and haploidization. Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while haploidization probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called <b>plasmogamy.</b> Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
50|$|Gametangia are sexual {{structures}} {{formed from}} hyphae, {{and are the}} generative cells. A very fine hypha, called trichogyne emerges from one gametangium, the ascogonium, and merges with a gametangium (the antheridium) of the other fungal isolate. The nuclei in the antheridium then migrate into the ascogonium, and plasmogamy—the mixing of the cytoplasm—occurs. Unlike in animals and plants, <b>plasmogamy</b> is not immediately followed by the merging of the nuclei (called karyogamy). Instead, the nuclei from the two hyphae form pairs, initiating the dikaryophase of the sexual cycle, during which time the pairs of nuclei synchronously divide. Fusion of the paired nuclei leads to mixing of the genetic material and recombination and is followed by meiosis. A similar sexual cycle {{is present in the}} blue green algae (Rhodophyta). A discarded hypothesis held that a second karyogamy event occurred in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny, resulting in a tetraploid nucleus which divided into four diploid nuclei by meiosis and then into eight haploid nuclei by a supposed process called brachymeiosis, but this hypothesis was disproven in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|U. agropyri {{produces}} teliospores, {{which may}} be wind dispersed or distributed through soils via machinery or animals. In soil, a dikaryotic teliospore germinates, meiosis occurs, then mitosis, and this gives rise to up to four basidiospores, each containing a single nucleus. Basidiospores germinate on seedlings, and each hypha undergoes <b>plasmogamy</b> with a compatible hypha. In this, one nucleus transfers to the other hypha, reestablishing the dikaryotic state of the fungus. The hyphae form appressoria which penetrate the coleoptile of an emerging seeds' shoot through the epidermal tissue, then hyphae grow between vascular bundles of the leaves. Some hyphal cells give rise to smut sori, bearing teliospores, which emerge through the leaf tissue for wind dispersal. Teliospores come to rest in soils, and when conditions are right, they give rise to more basidiospores, further spreading the infection. Alternatively, teliospores can form in seeds when the mycelia grows throughout the plant, in which case they germinate within the seed to give rise to new infection, again via basidiospore production. Teliospores overwinter in the soil, senescent plant tissues, and in seeds. These spores maintain germination viability for 3-7 years.|$|E
