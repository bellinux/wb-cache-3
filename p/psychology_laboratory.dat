25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratory</b> at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, {{fourteen}} years after Wilhelm Wundt founded the first <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratory</b> in the world, a <b>Psychology</b> <b>Laboratory</b> {{was built in}} Nassau Hall, the oldest building in the university, {{under the leadership of}} J. Mark Baldwin. In 1915, psychology received recognition in the title when the department was renamed Department of Philosophy and Psychology. It was not until 1920, however, that the Department of Psychology was established with Howard Warren as its first chairman. In 1924, Eno Hall was constructed to house the department. The building was named in honor of Henry Eno, the principal donor and research associate in psychology. Warren was also a donor, but he chose to keep his donation anonymous at the time. He commented that it was [...] "the first laboratory in this country, if not in the world, dedicated solely to the teaching and investigation of scientific psychology." [...] According to university president John Hibben, the laboratory was the realization of a dream that Warren had cherished for a long time.|$|E

50|$|Benjamin's {{research}} {{as a historian}} of American psychology {{has focused on the}} metamorphosis of psychology from philosophical discourse to laboratory science. He has written about the establishment of the earliest of the <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratories,</b> about the development of the early psychological organizations and how those fostered the agenda of the new experimental psychology, about the initial applications of experimental psychology to education, business, and clinical practice, and {{about the ways in which}} psychologists sought to inform the American public about their science. Benjamin's biography of Harry Kirke Wolfe (1858-1918), the second of Wundt's American graduates, documented the struggles of the early <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratories</b> in battling the more established sciences in American universities. That book was nominated for both of the top prizes awarded by the History of Science Society. Benjamin has also written on other Wundt doctorates in America. His research, based on archival records at the University of Leipzig, produced the first comprehensive treatment of Wundt's American students and their subsequent careers.|$|R

2500|$|Wittgenstein's platonic {{relationship}} with David Pinsent (1891–1918) occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent {{in the summer}} of 1912. A mathematics undergraduate and descendant of David Hume, Pinsent soon became Wittgenstein's closest friend. The men worked together on experiments in the <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratory</b> about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the British Psychological Association in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912—the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including first class travel, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. Upon determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search for a location that would fulfill the following criteria – small village located on a Fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law. Suggesting Øystese, Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. With their vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his idea to leave Cambridge and return to Norway to continue his work on logic. Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality – sensitive, nervous and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent. [...] Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being [...] "absolutely sulky and snappish" [...] at times, as well. In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity; most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics: [...] "I went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: he is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [...] ejaculating [...] "No—Beastly!" [...] to 90 percent of what he shewed [...] us!" ...|$|E

50|$|An {{olfactometer}} is any {{device that}} is used to measure the sense of smell. The most basic type in early studies was placing a subject in a room containing a specific measured amount of an odorous substance. More intricate devices involve some form of sniffing device, such as the neck of a bottle. The most common olfactometer found in <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratories</b> at one point was the Zwaardemker olfactometer. It had two glass nasal tubes projecting through a screen. One end would be inserted into a stimulus chamber, the other end is inserted directly into the nostrils.|$|R

50|$|Hyman {{was also}} {{interested}} in the transference of laboratory methods of testing autobiographical information to real life situations, and in 1998 Ira Hyman along with Carol Wilkinson published an article that looked at how memory had been tested in <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratories.</b> They hypothesized that the methods psychology researcher were using, mainly word lists, did not explain how normal autobiographical memory worked, and the results gathered using this type of research may not generalize to real world situations. They found that errors made in autobiographical memories did not relate {{to the complexity of}} an additional task, that called for the participant to remember word lists. No matter how many words the participant was asked to remember, it had no effect on how well they remembered autobiographical memory. Thus, this finding shows evidence that autobiographical memory cannot be tested in the traditional lab setting.|$|R

40|$|In Constructing the Subject, Kurt Danziger(1990) {{traces the}} history of psychology’sresearch {{methodology}} from the nineteenth century {{to the emergence of}} modern rules of experimentation; the changes are striking. In today’s <b>psychology</b> <b>laboratories,</b> there is a strict division of labor. One is either an experimenter or a participant, but never both—at least, not in the same laboratory. Not so in Wilhelm Wundt’s laboratory at the University of Leipzig, the dedication of which in 1879 is generally recognized as the birth of modern experimental <b>psychology.</b> In Wundt’s <b>laboratory,</b> the roles of participant and experimenter were fluid, and laboratory members took on both roles. Wundt himself participated regularly as a subject in the experiments published by his students; he also contributed much of the underlying the-ory. That this giant himself served as a data source and rarely, if ever, as an experimenter suggests that the role of subject was thought to require greater psychological sophistica-tion than that of experimenter. Retracing {{the history of}} one’s discipline helps demonstrate that its practices of exper-imentation are also a product of its times, notwithstanding often deeply entrenched beliefs to the contrary. Deception of partici-pants is an experimental tool about which many currently harbor strong beliefs; some, for instance, deem it indispensable (e. g. ...|$|R
