The filling gas was 1. 5 – 3 torr of hydrogen (60 %) deuterium (40 %) mixture. The target was solid nuclear grade graphite with 5 mm thick, 9 cm width and 13 in length. The activations of the exogenous target on average of 20 shots (only one-third acceptable) through 10 – 13 kV produced the 511 keV gamma rays.

50|$|Conté {{invented the}} modern pencil lead {{at the request}} of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot. The French Republic was at that time under {{economic}} blockade and unable to import graphite from Great Britain, the main source of the material.

After several days of research, Conté had the idea of mixing <b>powdered</b> <b>graphite</b> with clay and pressing the material between two half-cylinders of wood. Thus was formed the modern pencil.

50|$|English and German pencils {{were not}} {{available}} to the French during the Napoleonic Wars; France, under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain, was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines - the only known source in the world. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon's army to change this. In 1795, Nicolas-Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing <b>powdered</b> <b>graphite</b> with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth, {{the founder of the}} Koh-I-Noor in 1790, remains in use. In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna.|$|E

5000|$|Ursula von Rydingsvard born in Deensen, Lower Saxony, then Nazi Germany, is a {{sculptor}} {{who has been}} working in Brooklyn, New York for the past 30 years. She received her MFA from Columbia University in 1975 after which time she started to work with cedar, a material through which she has explored a wide range of images. Von Rydingsvard is best known for creating large-scale, often monumental sculpture from the cedar beams which she painstakingly cuts, assembles, and laminates, finally rubbing <b>powdered</b> <b>graphite</b> into the work's textured, faceted surfaces. She deliberately uses cedar boards milled into 4" [...] by 4" [...] widths with varied lengths which create a neutrality or [...] "blank canvas" [...] which enables her to dip into many different possibilities often within the arena of the psychological and emotional. As von Rydingsvard explains this approach: [...] "If I were to say how it is that I break the convention of sculpture (and I'm not sure that's what I do or even if that's what I want to do), it would be by climbing into the work in a way that’s highly personal, that I can claim as being mine. The more mine it is, the more I’m able to break the convention." [...] Her signature abstract shapes refer to things in the real world, each revealing the mark of the human hand while also summoning natural forms and forces. These forms typically include simple vessels and bowls; many suggest tools or other artifacts such as shovels, spoons and fences, or allude to primitive dwellings, geological formations, the landscape, or the body.|$|E
