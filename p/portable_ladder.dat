40|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{falls from}} <b>portable</b> <b>ladders</b> occur {{at a rate}} of forty per week in the construction industry. Ladders are so common that they are taken for granted and the perceived risks are often under-estimated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse the risk perception of operatives using <b>portable</b> <b>ladders,</b> and to develop and test a ladder-use training aid. The research used a quantitative, within-subjects survey, consisting of three structured questionnaires administered to four hundred respondents attending construction related training programmes. The surveys used images of actual ladder-use situations, and were carried out in two stages; the first stage measured the level of risk perception and sensation seeking before any training had taken place, and the second measured any change in the level of risk perception following the use of the ladder training-aid. Initial pre-training results revealed that operatives over-estimated the risks from high-level ladder use situations, and underestimated the risks from low-level ladder use situations. Post-training results showed an improvement in risk perception, especially for low-level situations. It was concluded that risk perception varies both with the individual and their level of experience, and that the training-aid had a positive impact on the improvement of ladder-use risk perception.

50|$|The {{tower is}} a {{defensive}} structure, with a quadrangular base and five levels which {{date back to}} the end of the 9th century AD, in the period governed by the first Banu Tujibi, Muhammad Alanqur, who was named after Muhammad I of Córdoba, independent Emir of Cordoba. According to Cabañero Subiza (1998) the Tower was built in the second half of the 10th century. In its lower part, the tower contains vestiges of the beginning of the heavy walls of alabaster ashlar bond masonry, and continues upwards with plank lining of simple plaster and lime concrete, which is a thinner substance for reaching greater heights. The exterior does not reflect the division of the five internal floors and appears as an enormous prism, broken by narrow embrasures. Access to the interior was gained through a small door at such height that it was only possible to enter by means of a <b>portable</b> <b>ladder.</b> Its initial function was, by all indications, military.|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday morning, October 19, 1920, a {{year and}} ten months after Williams had entered the Department, he was walking with his father on St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem {{on his way to}} work. As the two men passed 187 St. Nicholas Avenue they noticed Ladder Company 40 had responded to a fire and had already placed a <b>portable</b> <b>ladder</b> against the front of the fire building. As he and his father {{approached}} the building, flames could be seen licking out of the front windows and smoke was partially covering the front of the building. Ladder Company-40's wooden hand-operated aerial ladder was being maneuvered into position against the building so that 19-year-old William Thomas, trapped at a window, could be rescued. In After sizing up the situation, Williams ascended the ladder in an effort to assist. As the tip of the aerial ladder approached the panic stricken youth, he made a desperate lunge for it and was successful in grasping the ladder but his grip faltered. As he was beginning to fall, Fireman Williams leaped from the ladder he was standing on, caught the aerial ladder with one hand and the falling Thomas with the other, thus preventing his fall to the street. After carrying the young man to the street and safety, Williams re-ascended the ladder and assisted in the rescue of five other children. The rescue was witnessed by two reporters, and became the subject of an article entitled, [...] "NY's Only Colored Fireman Saves Six From Burning Building". When Fireman Williams reported to duty and recounted the rescue to his Captain, the latter told him that it was {{in the line of duty}} and that he would not write it up for submission for a Department citation. On another occasion, he and another fireman discovered a fire in a loft building at Spring and Lafayette Streets. Working together, they were able to rescue people from the burning building.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the evacuation of}} apartment buildings {{with or without the}} help of emergency services. A pre-study has been made by Brandforsk; where, among other things, the emergency service as an alternative escape route has been analyzed. The purpose of the pre-study was to investigate the emergency services different rescue opportunities and to investigate the human behavior in case of fire and what kind of rules apply on how a building should be designed. The issue of emergency services as the alternative escape route have been raised by different people. Among other things by pointing out the difficulties regarding staffing. This was also mentioned during the interviews with the four different emergency services. The different fire appliances that are used by the emergency services are fire engines, <b>portable</b> <b>ladders</b> and extension ladders. The issues regarding these are that a height vehicle must align almost exactly with a building and people have a tendency to jump towards the basket and the fireman maneuvering it, instead of waiting until they can safely be evacuated. <b>Portable</b> <b>ladders</b> and the extension ladders {{take a lot of time}} and staff, dependent on the weather conditions and time of day. In order to facilitate accessibility to buildings, the property owners should keep the roads properly cleared and have a good accessibility towards the building. If it is too cramped and narrow for height vehicles to access to the houses or navigate narrow alleys, it might be an idea to introduce a similar mini-height vehicle as that of the emergency service in Östermalm. The emergency services sometimes encounter problems such as individuals whom have been evacuated from a building wanting to go back for their relatives. People however behave calmly and quietly when evacuating. It is important for the emergency services to know how people behave in case of fire, in order to perform effective evacuations.

40|$|We {{propose a}} dynamic biomechanical {{simulation}} method that uses motion capture {{to evaluate the}} risk of Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). Statistics show that WMSDs accounted for 33 % of all non-fatal occupational injuries and illness in construction in 2009, and were {{a leading cause of}} temporary and permanent disability. Present methods rely largely on self-reports from workers, observational techniques, and direct measurements of motion and muscle activity to assess awkward postures, physical loads, repetitiveness, and the duration of exposure. While these methods have helped to prevent WMSDs in construction work, they may not be suitable for estimating the internal tissue loads associated with WMSDs. We propose a dynamic biomechanical simulation method to estimate internal forces and moments at each body joint of construction workers with motion capture data. Particularly, we explore the biomechanical loads by simulating active 3 D musculoskeletal models based on measured postures and movements. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we studied a ladder climbing task using a <b>portable</b> <b>ladder</b> under controlled laboratory conditions.

40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the {{physiological}} demands and air requirements during simulated firefighting tasks while wearing full personal protective ensemble (PPE) and positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) has been a difficult process based on undeveloped technology. The capability of integrating a portable Cosmed K 4 b 2 breath by breath gas collection system with a standard SCBA has permitted a novel approach to investigate metabolic demands and ventilatory requirements while breathing through the same system {{that would be used}} in an actual fire scene. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the physiological demands and air requirements during three large structure firefighting scenarios: (1) maximal high rise stair climb, (2) 5 th floor high rise scenario, and (3) subway system scenario. The hypotheses were that (a) the 5 th floor high rise scenario would be the most physically demanding and that (b) the years of service as a firefighter would result in decreased total air consumption during the three scenarios. Thirty-three male and three female healthy firefighters performed each of the three tasks at an equivalent pace similar to what would be expected at a fire scene. Scenario (1) consisted of stair climbing until consuming 55 % of a typical SCBA air cylinder and then descending to a safe exit. Scenario (2) comprised a 5 floor stair climb, hose drag and room search, forcible entry, victim rescue drag, and 5 floor descent. Scenario (3) involved a stair descent, tunnel walk, <b>portable</b> <b>ladder</b> walk, ladder setup, victim rescue drag, tunnel walk, and stair ascent. Average maximum floors climbed for scenario (1) and mean completion times for scenarios (2) and (3) were 20 ± 2. 5 floors, 5 min 3 s ± 57 s, and 12 min 5 s ± 1 min 10 s, respectively. Mean VO 2 during each of the scenarios were 3168 ± 878 ml/min, 2947 ± 461 ml/min, 2217 ± 371 ml/min, corresponding to a relative VO 2 of 35. 5 ± 9. 1 ml/kg/min, 33. 1 ± 4. 6 ml/kg/min, and 25. 2 ± 4. 6 ml/kg/min. In relation to the peak treadmill oxygen uptake, the three scenarios revealed that firefighters were working at 70 ± 10 %, 65 ± 10 %, and 49 ± 8 % of VO 2 peak, respectively. Average heart rate values for the three scenarios were 170 ± 13 bpm, 160 ± 14 bpm, and 139 ± 17 bpm, corresponding to 88 ± 4 %, 88 ± 6 %, and 76 ± 7 % of HRpeak, respectively. These results indicate that the most physiologically demanding scenario was the maximal stair climb, followed by the 5 th floor high rise and subway system scenarios. Respiratory exchange ratio was consistently greater than 1. 0 during the maximal stair climb and 5 th floor high rise scenarios indicating that a considerable amount of energy was derived from anaerobic metabolism. With regards to the air requirements for each of the scenarios, total air consumption revealed averaged values of 74. 9 ± 6 %, 48. 0 ± 7. 0 %, and 59. 9 ± 5. 6 %, of the air in a typical 30 -min cylinder, respectively. These data also revealed that increasing age of the firefighter as well as increasing years of experience as a firefighter result in significant correlations with greater air consumption to complete the given task (p < 0. 05). Contrary to the hypotheses, the maximal stair climb scenario appeared to be the most physically demanding while increased years of service as a firefighter resulted in greater air consumption. Furthermore, it appears that firefighters who are able to produce more power per kg of body mass have greater performance times and more efficient air consumption. These data are instrumental in quantifying the physiological demands and air requirements during simulated firefighting tasks while breathing on a positive pressure SCBA...|$|E
40|$|Workers risk {{electrocution}} {{when using}} metal ladders around energized, overhead power lines. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed recommendations to prevent injuries and deaths while working with metal ladders. A NIOSH {{review of the}} Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data from 1992 - 2005 identified at least 154 electrocution deaths that resulted from contacting overhead power lines with <b>portable</b> metal <b>ladders</b> (excluding truck-mounted and aerial ladders) [NIOSH 2007 a]. Of these 154 deaths, 36 involved a person of Hispanic origin (CFOI data for all years exclude New York City; the data for 2005 are preliminary). Although Hispanic workers accounted for 23 %) of these electrocution deaths due to ladders contacting power lines, {{it is estimated that}} they made up only 11 % of the workforce during this period [NIOSH 2007 b]. The NIOSH Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program is designed to identify, study, and prevent fatal occupational injuries [www. cdc. gov/niosh/face]. A review of NIOSH FACE cases between 1987 and 2007 identified 11 investigations involving the deaths of 12 workers that occurred while working around overhead power lines and using metal ladders. Ladder contacts with power lines usually occurred during erection, lowering, or relocation of the ladder. The surveillance data indicate a disproportionate rate of deaths among Hispanic workers involved in incidents related to metal ladders making contact with over-head power lines. Recent investigations of Hispanic worker deaths have also highlighted the need for worksite surveys and hazard controls and identified additional safety measures for workers whose primary language is not English.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} cavers in Europe and North America {{were limited}} in their explorations {{by a lack of}} suitable equipment. Explorers of the early 1800s, when caving began to become more common, caved in tweed suits and used candles for illumination. Exploration was usually limited to drier caves as there was little to protect cavers from the cold once they became wet. Later, cavers began to adopt miners lamps, which were designed for underground use and were reasonably reliable, though their light was not especially powerful. Lighting magnesium strips was a popular way of illuminating large chambers. E.A. Martel, a French caver, created a collapsible canvas canoe which he used to explore several caves containing long flooded sections, such as the Marble Arch Cave in Northern Ireland. His expeditionary equipment was describe in 1895 as: [...] "a canvas boat, some hundreds of feet of rope - <b>ladders,</b> a light <b>portable</b> folding wooden <b>ladder,</b> ropes, axes, compass, barometer, telephone, map etc.'". Acetylene lamps, powered by carbide, {{was one of the main}} light sources used by cavers during the 20th century.
