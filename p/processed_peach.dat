40|$|Recently, kaolin {{sprayable}} {{materials are}} studied and used with many crops to control insects and diseases, alleviate heat stress and reduce sunburn damage. Furthermore, kaolin {{has been found}} to positively affect fruit external and internal quality with various fruit species. We investigated the effect of kaolin particle film application on fresh and canned clingstone peach fruit quality and inorganic element composition. Kaolin was applied periodically from early July to early August 2010 on 'Andross' peach trees. Fresh peach fruit treated with kaolin and harvested at commercial maturity (middle of August) had increased flesh firmness (FF), soluble solids content (SSC) and acidity and lower water content (WC) compared to control fruit. Kaolin presence on fresh peach fruit skin did not affect L∗, but decreased a∗ compared to control fruit even after kaolin removal with water. In addition, kaolintreated fresh peach fruit had similar P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, Cd, and Ni and slightly lower Pb contents compared to control peach fruit, while Co and Cr were not detected. Canned peach fruit had modified quality compared to fresh fruit, but most of the differences in quality attributes between kaolin-treated and control fruit remained after canning. Peach fruit color was similar in the two treatments after peeling and canning. Finally, the <b>processed</b> <b>peach</b> fruit treated with kaolin had decreased P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni and similar Ca, Na, Cd, Pb contents compared to processed control fruit, while Co and Cr were not detected. It seemed that certain nutrients leaked from the kaolin-treated <b>processed</b> <b>peach</b> fruit to the syrup resulting in decreased SSC and inorganic element content in the <b>processed</b> <b>peach</b> halves compared to the fresh kaolintreated fruit. © 2015 ISHS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Chilling injury (CI) {{is a major}} physiolog-ical problem {{limiting}} {{consumption and}} export of peach and nectarine (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch). To clarify the genetic basis for chilling injury, inheritance of the major CI symptoms mealiness, flesh browning, flesh bleeding, and flesh leatheriness were examined over three years in two related peach progenies. In addition, genetic relationships among traits and the year-to-year variation in trait performance in these progenies were tracked. Both populations also segregated for Free-stone-Melting flesh (F-M) and yellow flesh. There were significant differences in CI symptoms among years. The major gene endoPG, which controls the F-M locus, provides resistance to mealiness in non-melting flesh fruit. Only fruit with melting flesh can develop mealiness if the tree possesses other genetic susceptibility factors and/or experiences inducing conditions. The F-M locus also greatly influences susceptibility to flesh bleeding, although the physio-logical mechanism for this disorder is unclear and may be controlled by a different gene closely linked to endoPG. Unlike mealiness, flesh bleeding occurred primarily in non-melting flesh fruit, particularly when the fruit is white-fleshed. Flesh browning incidence was greater in mealy fruit and {{was not associated with}} flesh bleeding. Breeding for CI resistance is thus a viable long-term strategy to reduce losses in the fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>peach</b> and nectarine industries.

40|$|Peach is a {{fruit with}} high content of {{phytochemical}} compounds with antioxidant activity, namely polyphenols and carotenes {{that make them}} a healthy fruit for consumers. Peach (Prunus persica (L.)), is an important commercial Mediterranean fruit during summer season {{not only for its}} high water content, fibre and minerals, but also for its high content in antioxidant molecules such as procyanidins, anthocyanins, catechins, phenolic acids and carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene). These compounds in peach fruit vary strongly in relation to different environmental and agricultural factors, such as cultivar, rootstock, water and ripening stage at harvest. Besides the regular peach consumption as fresh fruit, processed products such as juices, jams, jellies, smoothies, canned fruit and others, are usually produced from fruit fresh market. Information about nutrient content of processed fruits is of interest to consumers as they are becoming more aware and interested about their related health benefits. Fruit processing and storage may lead to negative or positive effects concerning their nutritional value according the processing steps they are exposed to. There are occurrences during fruit processing where chemical reactions could release bound components leading to a promotion of nutritional quality. Among the phytochemicals, phenols, have received {{a great deal of attention}} because of their antioxidant activity, which help to neutralise free radicals. Thermal treatment is one of the most important factors affecting their stability. Previous studies have shown that concentrations of carotenoids often increase during heat treatment, probably because cell walls are softened, making the extraction of carotenoids easier during analysis. Extreme or prolonged heat treatment, however, enhances loss of carotenoids. Factors such as light, metals, oxygen, organic acids and heat can promote carotenoid isomerization and degradation. The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to review the impact of different industrial processing techniques of sterilization and associated storage conditions (e. g., time and temperature) on nutritional and functional characteristics of <b>processed</b> <b>peach,</b> and to establish their role on the nutritional and functional quality of fruit. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Clingstone peaches {{contain a}} wide array of complex {{secondary}} plant metabolites and polyphenolics, and increasing evidence indicates that many of these components are important in human health. Oligomeric flavan- 3 -ol metabolites (procyanidins) are particularly interesting owing to their potent antioxidant activity and protective cardiovascular effects. To date, little information is available on how postharvest and processing conditions impact levels of phenolics and procyanidins in fruit. This research addresses the impact of lye peeling, freezing, storage temperature (4 and 30 °C) and three different time–temperature sterilisation combinations on levels of total phenolics (TPs) in Ross clingstone peaches. Additionally, we describe the profile of procyanidin oligomers (monomers through heptamers) in clingstone and freestone peaches and demonstrate a dramatic decrease in procyanidins in thermally <b>processed</b> <b>peaches.</b> TP levels ranged between 316 and 397 mg kg 1 in peeled peaches and between 376 and 609 mg kg 1 in unpeeled peaches. Cold storage at 4 °C for 14 days or freezing and storing at 12 °C for 3 months produced no loss in TPs. Peaches stored at 30 °C for 24 h resulted in a 1. 7 -fold increase in TPs. Studies of TPs in <b>peaches</b> <b>processed</b> at temperatures of 213 °F for 40 min, 220 °F for 10 min and 230 °F for 2. 4 min indicate that processing above 213 °F decreases levels of both TPs (up to 21 %) and procyanidins (up to 100 %). Processing at 213 °F for 40 min produced no significant loss in TPs. Furthermore, studies reveal that a 30 – 43 % loss in phenolic levels occurs during the first 3 months in storage after canning. It is clear that both storage and thermal processing conditions profoundly impact the levels of polyphenolics in peaches. More interestingly, these studies indicate that peaches are a rich source of procyanidins, having profiles similar to those found in cocoa, apples, wine and tea...|$|R

40|$|Brown rot {{caused by}} the fungi Monilinia laxa (Aderhold and Ruhland) Honey, M. fructicola (Winter) Honey, or M. fructigena (Aderhold and Ruhland) is a serious fungal disease of peaches. The fungal {{infection}} process begins when fungal conidia germinate on the fruit surface to produce germtubes and/or appressoria, and the incidence of brown rot increases as fruit approaches maturity. The interaction between the fungal infection <b>process,</b> <b>peach</b> maturity, and the environmental conditions is not well understood. Accordingly, the objectives of this investigation were to investigate germ tube and appressorial formation by M. laxa and M. fructicola when they were exposed to peach skin from mature and immature fruit at various temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). The greatest number of germ tubes was found when M. laxa or M. fructicola was incubated in culture medium which contained a skin extract of mature peaches. In contrast, {{the greatest number of}} appressoria was found when M. laxa or M. fructicola was incubated in culture medium which contained a skin extract of immature peaches. Although M. fructicola produced the same number of germ tubes and appressoria at 4 °C, M. fructicola produced more germ tubes than appressoria at temperatures higher than 10 °C. M. laxa produced more germ tubes than appressoria at any temperature, except when it was incubated for 48 h on culture medium which contained a skin extract of immature peaches at 10 °C at 80 % or 100 % RH, or at 25 °C at 60 % RH. M. laxa conidia germinated better than M. fructicola conidia at low temperatures. Germ tube and appressorial formation by Monilinia spp. were influenced by fruit postharvest handling. The number of germ tubes that were formed by M. laxa conidia was significantly greater than that for M. fructicola when the conidia were incubated at 100 % RH, and this number increased after 3 days of refrigeration. The number of appressoria that were formed by both Monilinia spp. also increased after 3 consecutive days of refrigeration. Negligible or no germination of M. fructicola and M. laxa conidia occurred when the RH was 60 %. We concluded that the dissimilar abilities of M. laxa and M. fructicola to germinate and form appressoria at low temperatures conferred a competitive advantage to M. laxa to survive during fruit postharvest refrigeration and cold storage at 4 °C...|$|R

40|$|Peach {{production}} in the Rhône-Alps region is increasingly challenged by mediterranean European regions.

How such labels relate with quality attributes at field level ? Can polyphenols be considered as an asset in a re-qualification <b>process</b> of <b>peach</b> production? To contribute to these issues, we present preliminary results derived from field work in Rhône-Alps. The study was conducted on 12 orchards of yellow peach (cv Spring Lady) in farms. 10 orchards were managed according to the above mentioned specifications while 2 were cultivated without specifications. Farmers practices were characterised in 2004; their consequences on orchards conditions and performances were measured. Polyphenols analyses was conducted on 12 fruit samples. Organic peaches could be differentiated with usual qualitative attributes (firmness, refractometric index, calibre). Their polyphenol content appeared as 3 times higher than other fruits from our sample (147 mg/ 100 g EAG versus 95, 5 in Red Label; 55, 5 in CCP and 62, 5 for the others). Polyphenol contents from standard production were consistent with reference levels, whereas Red Labelled peaches were intermediate. Tree vigour and environmental conditions apparently play a key-role in the synthesis of total polyphenols. These results open perspectives for integrating production processes in quality construction, since polyphenol content could be an additional asset in organic fruit production and not simply a stress indicator, and for relating production with marketing initiatives. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} RNAs (sRNAs) {{approximately}} 21 nucleotides in length that negatively control gene expression by cleaving or inhibiting {{the translation of}} target gene transcripts. Within this context, miRNAs and siRNAs {{are coming to the}} forefront as molecular mediators of gene regulation in plant responses to annual temperature cycling and cold stress. For this reason, we chose to identify and characterize the conserved and non-conserved miRNA component of peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) focusing our efforts on both the recently released whole genome sequence of peach and sRNA transcriptome sequences from two tissues representing non-dormant leaves and dormant leaf buds. Conserved and non-conserved miRNAs, and their targets were identified. These sRNA resources were used to identify cold-responsive miRNAs whose gene targets co-localize with previously described QTLs for chilling requirement (CR). Results Analysis of 21 million peach sRNA reads allowed us to identify 157 and 230 conserved and non-conserved miRNA sequences. Among the non-conserved miRNAs, we identified 205 that seem to be specific to peach. Comparative genome analysis between peach and Arabidopsis showed that conserved miRNA families, with the exception of miR 5021, are similar in size. Sixteen of these conserved miRNA families are deeply rooted in land plant phylogeny as they are present in mosses and/or lycophytes. Within the other conserved miRNA families, five families (miR 1446, miR 473, miR 479, miR 3629, and miR 3627) were reported only in tree species (Populus trichocarpa, Citrus trifolia, and Prunus persica). Expression analysis identified several up-regulated or down-regulated miRNAs in winter buds versus young leaves. A search of the peach proteome allowed the prediction of target genes for most of the conserved miRNAs and a large fraction of non-conserved miRNAs. A fraction of predicted targets in peach have not been previously reported in other species. Several conserved and non-conserved miRNAs and miRNA-regulated genes co-localize with Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for chilling requirement (CR-QTL) and bloom date (BD-QTL). Conclusions In this work, we identified a large set of conserved and non-conserved miRNAs and describe their evolutionary footprint in angiosperm lineages. Several of these miRNAs were induced in winter buds and co-localized with QTLs for chilling requirement and bloom date thus making their gene targets potential candidates for mediating plant responses to cold stress. Several peach homologs of genes participating in the regulation of vernalization in Arabidopsis were identified as differentially expressed miRNAs targets, potentially linking these gene activities to cold responses in peach dormant buds. The non-conserved miRNAs may regulate cellular, physiological or developmental <b>processes</b> specific to <b>peach</b> and/or other tree species. </p...|$|R
