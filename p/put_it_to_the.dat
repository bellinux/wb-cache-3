5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and {{into the back of}} the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E

25|$|Grace was 50 {{years and}} 320 days old {{on the last}} day of the first Test. It says a lot about The Champion that he was still worth his place as a batsman. But he could no longer bend down, so his fielding was poor, and the Nottinghamshire crowd jeered and heckled him for it every time a ball went past him at point. Grace himself <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{selection}} committee that he should be dropped for the second Test, and after some debate this is what happened.

2500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the first}} season of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi was generally negative, though the show eventually garnered a large viewership and recorded large target rating points. A major criticism was in the questions asked to players, that {{were thought to be}} of lower-than-usual difficulty. K. Sriram later noted, [...] "the questions were not silly, the options were mocking. The feedback we got was: Don't mock your own questions. We've taken it as constructive feedback and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Big Synergy team". Difficulty level of questions became more accepted among public in later episodes.

2500|$|In November 1992, Symington ended {{a six-month}} {{standoff}} with the Yavapai-Apache Nation by signing a compact {{that allowed the}} tribe to operate 250 video gambling machines. Prior to this, the tribe was acting in defiance of federal agents who had seized their gambling machines {{the year before the}} agreement. The Yavapai-Apache Nation settled for a quarter of the machines that had been seized, and also agreed to allow state supervision of the gambling operation. In return, the state conceded to allowing the operation of a 24-hour bingo hall and casino by the tribe. Former Arizona Attorney General Jack LaSota criticized the decision at the time, due to Arizona's state laws against gambling. Symington later signed legislation in 1993 that reversed this decision, however, outlawing gambling and casinos, including for fundraising purposes for churches and charities. Also in November 1992, Symington was a supporter of a ballot proposal that reinstated Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in Arizona. The day had been removed as a federal holiday several years prior, under the administration of Governor Evan Mecham, who disagreed with its manner of implementation. Symington boasted that Arizona had become [...] "the only state in the union to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people," [...] and felt the vote in approval of the holiday made [...] "a wonderful statement about Arizona." ...|$|E

After [...] "stubbing his toe {{on the way to the}} gallows", as he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> executioner, Guiteau read [...] and announced that he would now read a prayer of his own composition. After paraphrasing , Guiteau proceeded to read the poem from a piece of paper in a style described as both [...] "sad and doleful" [...] as well as [...] "high pitched" [...] and [...] "childlike". Guiteau had requested an orchestra to play behind him as he recited his poem, but his request was denied. After completing the first verse in song, Guiteau stopped singing and chanted the rest. Multiple times during the reading, Guiteau's voice would fail and he would begin sobbing, even stopping to lay his head on the shoulder of a man standing by him. Right before the completion of the poem, Guiteau raised his voice even higher into falsetto to deliver the final two lines. As {{the execution}}er fitted the hood over Guiteau's head and put the rope around his neck, he held onto the piece of paper on which he had written his poem. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper.|$|E
