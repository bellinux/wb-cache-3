40|$|This Article {{demonstrates}} that modern authoritative jurists {{working within the}} Shi’i tradition have developed their rules respecting sex regulation in order to serve three <b>primary</b> <b>commitments.</b> The first commitment is less a normative expectation and more a presumption of reality. It {{is that there is}} an intense and near debilitating desire on the part of human beings generally, though mostly men, for a great deal of sex. This desire must be satisfied, but it also must be tightly controlled. This is because of the second commitment, which is that excessive licentiousness is a form of secular distraction from a believer’s central obligation to worship God. The final, and perhaps most interesting, commitment concerns maintaining and upholding gender differentiation in order to ensure the preservation of traditional gender roles within an established gendered hierarchy. That is, there must be clear delineations between men, on the one hand, and women, on the other, if hierarchies relating to the proper roles of men and women are to be maintained. This explains the rather curious discrepancy within Shi’i Islam, discussed toward the end of this Article, wherein change of gender is tolerated, to some extent, and homosexuality is not, to any extent...|$|R

40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to analyse how {{development}} partnerships influence government ownership in education policy processes. Ownership has been emphasised as an important partnership commitment during the last decades. It has, however, often been understood as a mechanism for increasing aid effectiveness rather than a target of its own. In this study, the education partnership between funding agencies and the Government of Uganda, during 1997 - 2009, was selected as a case. Three education sector plans were developed during this period. The study was based particularly on the analysis of the related processes of setting the education priorities. To guide the analysis, world systems theory was chosen as the analytical framework because of the complexity of development partnerships, including both international and national actors as well as international and national commitments. The study relied on a qualitative research design. The data was gathered during a 6 weeks’ fieldwork, including interviews with 12 purposefully sampled participants and a document analysis. The main findings {{of this study}} are related to the enhancement of partner roles. The leadership role of the central Government has been strengthened by capacity development. At the same time, the donor harmonisation process and the inclusion of funding agencies in governmental policy processes have both strengthened government ownership in formulating education priorities as well as resulted in new channels of influence for the funding agencies. The study provides three perspectives on the current use of the concepts of partnership and ownership. Firstly, it is the dilemma between the equality of partners implied in the concept of partnership and the emphasis on government leadership implied in the concept of ownership. Secondly, it is the weakness of the ownership definition used in international normative frameworks, which fail to include capacity issues. Thirdly, concerns the different <b>primary</b> <b>commitments</b> of funding agencies and governments, and how this influences policy dialogue...|$|R
25|$|No {{official}} statement {{has been made}} on the reasons behind the choice of F/A-18 fighters as Australia's <b>primary</b> combat <b>commitment,</b> but it is commonly assumed that the obvious alternative of sending a substantial land force instead was considered to involve an unacceptably high risk of casualties, particularly given the possibility of house-to-house fighting in Iraqi cities. Iraq is largely landlocked, and Australia no longer has a fixed-wing naval aviation component; thus, a larger naval commitment could not be considered particularly helpful. The choice of the F/A-18 deployment rather than of the F-111 tactical bomber {{may have been due}} to the higher cost of operation of the F-111, and its use being limited to more politically contentious ground attack missions rather than more uncontentious tasks like combat air patrols.|$|R

40|$|My primary aim in this {{investigation}} is to trace {{the history of the}} invention of the Marxist historian’s persona in the Communist Party Historians’ Group, and thereby reveal its specific configuration. This is to be an exercise in the recently emerging research program of what I have termed the empirical philosophy of history, as developed by Herman Paul. I supplemented this framework with certain Bourdieusian insights, adopting analytic tools — concepts like forms of capital and fields — that were specifically constructed to reveal more clearly the social elements and forces at play {{in the development of the}} dispositions or embodied commitments to goods that constitute personae. After elaborating my methodological framework, I move to outlining the basic elements that went into the making of the Marxist historian’s persona; the <b>primary</b> <b>commitments</b> to epistemic, moral and political goods that were embodied by the Historians’ Group’s founders — Dona Torr, A. L. Morton, Maurice Dobb and Christopher Hill — who played a primary role in its making. These consisted of the epistemic commitments to obtaining a dialectical and historical view or understanding of history, the moral commitment to the emancipation of the proletariat and the political commitment to Communism of the Soviet variety as espoused by the Communist Party of Great Britain. The obtaining of these commitments required the exercising of the appropriate virtues like employing the dialectical and historical materialist methods, engaging in class analysis and maintaining loyalty to the Communist Party. These virtues in turn implied an opposition to vices that consisted of their lack in other historians’ scholarly personae, pejoratively referred to as ‘bourgeois’. However, there was also a struggle internally regarding the proper interpretation of these commitments and virtues, one that played out both within the Historians’ Group itself and the wider Party. The contours of this struggle and the practices of contestation it involved —abounding in virtue and vice language — is clarified through the prism of dispositional variations that existed among the Group’s members, which I distinguish as the academic and non-academic. However, these are not presented as discreetly definable entities, but rather as consisting of a common network of commonalities (as in a family resemblance concept), thereby allowing for consideration of the variations that existed among members of each, while also allowing for the role of contingency that had a major effect on the making of the Marxist historian’s persona...|$|R

40|$|A central {{challenge}} in embryonic stem (ES) cell biology {{is to understand}} how to impose direction on <b>primary</b> lineage <b>commitment.</b> In basal culture conditions, the majority of ES cells convert asynchronously into neural cells. However, many cells resist differentiation and others adopt nonneural fates. Mosaic activation of the neural reporter 					Sox-green fluorescent protein suggests regulation by cell-cell interactions. We detected expression of Notch receptors and ligands in mouse ES cells and investigated the role of this pathway. Genetic manipulation to activate Notch constitutively does not alter the stem cell phenotype. However, upon withdrawal of self-renewal stimuli, differentiation is directed rapidly and exclusively into the neural lineage. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic interference with Notch signalling suppresses the neural fate choice. Notch promotion of neural commitment requires parallel signalling through the fibroblast growth factor receptor. Stromal cells expressing Notch ligand stimulate neural specification of human ES cells, indicating that this is a conserved pathway in pluripotent stem cells. These findings define an unexpected and decisive role for Notch in ES cell fate determination. Limiting activation of endogenous Notch results in heterogeneous lineage commitment. Manipulation of Notch signalling is therefore likely to be a key factor in taking command of ES cell lineage choice...|$|R
