2500|$|As the rider's whole weight must {{be carried}} {{at one side}} when mounting, on an English saddle, one stirrup leather often becomes {{stretched}} longer than the other, usually the left one, because most mounting occurs on that side. [...] While a simple adjustment of the leather can even up the stirrups, to preserve the integrity and longevity of the leathers, they should be switched to the opposite sides from time to time. [...] On a western saddle, with a heavier, permanently installed fender and stirrup leather that cannot be switched, stretching is slower and less extreme, though it also occurs {{in this type of}} saddle. [...] Any unevenness in the leathers can be managed by adjusting the stirrup length, and if necessary, by adding extra holes in the leathers to allow them to be buckled at an intermediate point between the existing <b>prepunched</b> holes provided by the saddle manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|In data centers, larger PDUs {{are needed}} to power {{multiple}} server cabinets. Each server cabinet or rows of cabinets may require multiple high current circuits possibly from different phases of incoming power or different UPSs. Standalone cabinet PDUs are self-contained units that include main breakers, individual circuit breakers, and power monitoring panels. The cabinet provides internal bus bars for neutral and grounding. <b>Prepunched</b> top and bottom panels allow for safe cable entry.|$|E
50|$|Needle {{cards are}} index cards with text, written by hand or typewriter, {{that have a}} line of <b>prepunched</b> holes along one or more sides. By cutting or {{punching}} away (notching out) the paper between a hole and {{the edge of the}} card, the card is associated with a category. By putting long (knitting) needles through certain holes in a deck of such cards, lifting and shaking gently, cards that belong to a combination of categories can be selected. This tool is less useful for data sets larger than 10,000 records.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{response}} to the amended complaint of the plaintiffs, Blackwell answered by denying allegations that he violated the securities of the Civil Rights Act as enumerated in Paragraph 1 of the amended complaint, that he operated with other parties in Paragraph 2, that he participated in [...] "election fraud, vote dilution, vote suppression, recount fraud and other violations...", that he [...] "arranged {{for the use of}} tens of thousands of ballots in high-performance Democratic precincts that were <b>prepunches</b> for a third-party presidential candidate so as to create an overvote and disqualification of such a vote when cast for Kerry" [...] and that he participated in these in an [...] "ongoing conspiracy" ...|$|R
50|$|The tub file was a {{technique}} {{used in the}} punched card era to speed generation of data files. Multiple copies of frequently used cards were <b>prepunched</b> and stored in trays with index tabs between card sets, arranged so that cards {{would be easy to}} find. For example, a wholesaler might have a tub file with cards for frequent customers and for each inventory item. Instead of keypunching a set of cards for each purchase order, a clerk would pull out a customer card and then a card for each item that customer ordered. The resulting deck could then be run through a tabulating machine to produce an invoice. This technique was an early form of random access memory and was the initial inspiration for the invention of the hard disk at IBM's San Jose Laboratory, what eventually became the IBM 305 RAMAC.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{corporate}} {{or university}} computer installation {{would have a}} suite of rooms, with a large, access-restricted, air conditioned room for the computer (similar to a modern server room) and a smaller adjacent room for submitting jobs. Nearby would be {{a room full of}} keypunch machines for programmer use. An IBM 407 Accounting Machine might be set up to allow newly created or edited programs to be listed (printed out on fan-fold paper) for proof reading. An IBM 519 might be provided to reproduce program decks for backup or to punch sequential numbers in columns 73-80. In such mainframe installations, known as closed shops, programmers submitted the program decks, often followed by data cards to be read by the program, to a person working behind a counter in the computer room. Many computer installations used cards with the opposite corner cut (sometimes no corner cut) as [...] "job separators", so that an operator could stack several job decks in the card reader {{at the same time and}} be able to quickly separate the decks manually when he removed them from the stacker. These cards (e.g., a JCL [...] "JOB" [...] card to start a new job) were often <b>prepunched</b> in large quantities in advance. This was especially useful when the main computer did not read the cards directly, but instead read their images from magnetic tape that was prepared offline by smaller computers such as the IBM 1401. After running a program, the computer operator would return the card deck and any hardcopy printed or punched output, typically to one of a set of alphabetically labelled cubby holes, based on the programmer's last initial. This was all batch-mode processing, as opposed to interactive processing.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for producing}} a structure {{in outer space}} from rolls of <b>prepunched</b> ribbon or sheet material that are transported from the earth to the apparatus located in outer space is described. The apparatus spins the space structure similar to a spider spinning a web utilizing the <b>prepunched</b> ribbon material. The <b>prepunched</b> ribbon material is fed through the apparatus and is shaped into a predetermined channel-shaped configuration. Trusses are punched out of the ribbon and are bent downwardly and attached to a track which normally is a previously laid sheet of material. The size of the overall space structure may be increased by merely attaching an additional roll of sheet material to the apparatus...|$|E
