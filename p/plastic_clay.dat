500|$|The geology of Southcote {{includes}} the Reading Formation—rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay, silt and sand {{formed in the}} Palaeogene period. Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk, with geological surveys also finding flint samples. A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly <b>Plastic</b> <b>Clay</b> (now known as the Lambeth Group) and chalk north of the river, with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet. More specifically, the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel, including Winter Hill (variably clayey and sandy), Lynch Hill (sand and gravel with lenses of silt, clay or peat), and head (a polymict deposit usually formed by periglacial solifluction or gelifluction). The survey also identified {{that much of the}} land south of the Kennet is [...] "infilled" [...] or [...] "worked" [...] ground; this area was formerly gravel pits and now used for leisure. The British Geological Survey defines infilled ground as [...] "areas where the ground has been cut away then wholly or partially backfilled" [...] and worked ground as [...] "areas where the ground has been cut away such as quarries and road cuttings".|$|E

The liquid limit and plastic limit of samples were established according to ASTM D- 4318 [17]. Samples were classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) by using the index properties. Eight samples were classified as lean clay/low <b>plastic</b> <b>clays</b> (CL), and 22 samples were classified as fat clays/high <b>plastic</b> <b>clays</b> (CH).

60|$|But again--and {{this is a}} {{very curious}} fact--between the time of the Plastic clays and sands, with their oyster-beds and black pebbles, and that of the London clay, great changes had taken place. The <b>Plastic</b> <b>clay</b> and sands were {{deposited}} during a period of earthquake, of upheaval and subsidence of ancient lands; and therefore of violent currents and flood waves, seemingly rushing down from, or round the shores of that Wealden island to the south of us, on the shore of which island Odiham once stood. We know this from the great irregularity of the beds: while the absence of that irregularity proves to us that the London clay was deposited in a quiet sea.|$|E
60|$|Such {{a copper}} hatchet, {{cast in a}} mould formed by a {{polished}} neolithic stone celt, was found in an early Etruscan tomb, and is still preserved in the Museum at Berlin. See how natural this process would be. For, in the first place, the primitive workman, knowing already only one form of axe, the stone tomahawk, would naturally reproduce it in the new material, without thinking what improvements in shape and design the malleability and fusibility of the metal would render possible or easy. But, more than that, the idea of coating the polished stone axe with <b>plastic</b> <b>clay,</b> and thereby making a mould for the molten metal, would be so very simple that even the neolithic savage, already accustomed to the manufacture of coarse pottery upon natural shapes, could hardly fail to think of it. As a matter of fact, he did think of it: for celts of bronze or copper, cast in moulds made from stone hatchets, {{have been found in}} Cyprus by General di Cesnola, on the site of Troy by Dr. Schliemann, and in many other assorted localities by less distinguished but equally trustworthy archæologists.|$|E

[47] [...] "Some idea may {{be formed}} {{of the nature}} of these incurvations by [...] supposing the gneiss beds to have been in a plastic state, either [...] from the action of heat or of some other unknown cause, and, while [...] in this state, to have been {{subjected}} to pressure at the two [...] extremities, or in some other parts, according {{to the nature of the}} [...] curvatures.

30|$|The σy-value is {{decreased}} {{with an increase}} in wL and IP values, as shown in Fig.  6 a, b. Average values of wL and IP are 35 % and 15.8 % respectively at 582.5  kPa of σy, whereas, values of wL and IP are 106.8 % and 90.2 % respectively at 293  kPa of σy-value; this renders that wL and IP increased 67 % and 82.5 % respectively with a decrease of 49.7 % in yield stress. It is also observed that wL and IP {{have a significant effect on}} σy up to 65.8 % and 45.8 % of their values respectively, beyond these values effect of Atterberg’s limits on σy become insignificant. These findings render that for the similar compaction effort, the compaction induced yield stress is higher for low <b>plastic</b> <b>clays,</b> because of the fact that it is easier to achieve tighter grain matrix for low <b>plastic</b> <b>clays</b> due to low moisture and less void ratio induced by diffused double layer and clay mineral interaction.|$|R

6000|$|Our {{young man}} had not in any recent year failed to see the Salon, which the general voice this season {{pronounced}} not particularly good. None the less it was the present exhibition that, for some cause connected with his [...] "crisis," [...] made him think fast, produced that effect he had spoken of to his mother as a sense of artistic life. The precinct of the marbles and bronzes spoke to him especially to-day; the glazed garden, not florally rich, with its new productions alternating with perfunctory plants and its queer, damp smell, partly the odour of <b>plastic</b> <b>clay,</b> of the studios of sculptors, put forth the voice of old associations, of other visits, of companionships now ended--an insinuating eloquence which was {{at the same time}} somehow identical with the general sharp contagion of Paris. There was youth in the air, and a multitudinous newness, for ever reviving, and the diffusion of a hundred talents, ingenuities, experiments. The summer clouds made shadows {{on the roof of the}} great building; the white images, hard in their crudity, spotted the place with provocations; the rattle of plates at the restaurant sounded sociable in the distance, and our young man congratulated himself more than ever that he had not missed his chance. He felt how it would help him to settle something. At the moment he made this reflexion his eye fell upon a person who appeared--just in the first glimpse--to carry out the idea of help. He uttered a lively ejaculation, which, however, in its want of finish, Biddy failed to understand; so pertinent, so relevant and congruous, was the other party to this encounter.|$|E

Besides, it was pleasant to be with him. He did not repel her. That first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep. Though she did not know it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right. Also, he had a tonic effect upon her. She was studying hard at the university, and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh sea-breeze of his personality blow upon her. Strength! Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in generous measure. To come into the same room with him, or to meet him at the door, was to take heart of life. And when he had gone, she would return to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.|$|E

40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{settlement of}} a structure {{founded on a}} normally consolidated soil can be calculated from {{the knowledge of the}} compression index C-c. The value of C-c is usually obtained from the laboratory oedometer test {{on the assumption that the}} void ratio (e) -logarithm of pressure (log sigma'(nu)) plot is linear. While the literature reveals that in the case of highly <b>plastic</b> <b>clays</b> the plots are concave upwards with their C-c (computed between successive load increments) decreasing with an increase in sigma'(nu), little is known regarding soils that are less plastic, in particular, silty soils. This paper reports the e-log sigma'(nu) plots of clays and silts. It was found that the e-log sigma'(nu) curves of the silts are not linear but are convex upwards. This results in an increase in C-c with an increase in sigma'(nu). Convex curves are to be regarded as a normal feature in such soils and can be explained from consideration of the mechanical and physicochemical factors that govern the compressibility of clays. These factors establish that C-c increases with sigma'(nu) for those soils whose compressibility behavior is governed by mechanical factors, in contrast to soils like very <b>plastic</b> <b>clays</b> whose compressibility behavior is governed by physicochemical factors. In the latter, C-c decreases with an increase in the consolidation pressure...|$|R

5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in <b>plastic,</b> <b>clay</b> and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. The nose blows air into the instrument's open nosepiece, from where it is channeled through an airduct, towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites the acoustic field into the player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible.

The jigger tool shapes one face while the mould shapes the other. Jiggering is used only in the production of flat wares, such as plates, but a similar operation, jolleying, is used in the production of hollow-wares such as cups. Jiggering and jolleying have been used in the production of pottery since at least the 18th century. In large-scale factory production, jiggering and jolleying are usually automated, which allows the operations to be carried out by semi-skilled labour.|$|E
50|$|Initial design {{considerations}} include wall layout (wall height and length), soil nail {{vertical and horizontal}} spacing, soil nail pattern on wall face, soil nail inclination, soil nail length and distribution, soil nail material and relevant ground properties. With all these variables {{in the mind of}} the design engineer the next step is to use simplified charts to preliminarily evaluate nail length and maximum nail force. Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met. After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the soil nail wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities. Drainage, frost penetration and external loads such as wind and hydrostatic forces also have to be determined and included in the final examination of the design. Soil nail walls are not ideal in locations with highly <b>plastic</b> <b>clay</b> soils. Soils with high plasticity, a high liquid limit and low undrained shear strengths are at risk of long-term deformation (creep).|$|E
