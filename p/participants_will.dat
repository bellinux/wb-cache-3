25|$|The mating {{habits of}} Limax maximus are {{considered}} unusual among slugs: the hermaphrodite slugs court, usually for hours, by circling and licking each other. After this, the slugs will climb {{into a tree}} or other high area and then, entwined together, lower themselves on a thick string of mucus, evert their white translucent mating organs (penises) from their gonopores (openings {{on the right side}} of the head), entwine these organs, and exchange sperm. Both <b>participants</b> <b>will</b> later lay hundreds of eggs.|$|E

25|$|Kamen {{has stated}} that FIRST is the {{invention}} he feels most proud of, and predicts that <b>participants</b> <b>will</b> be responsible for significant technological advances in years to come. The first FRC season was in 1992 and had one event {{at a high school}} gymnasium in New Hampshire. That first competition was relatively small-scale, similar in size to today's FIRST Tech Challenge and Vex Robotics Competition games. Robots relied on a wired connection to receive data from drivers; in the following year, it quickly transitioned to a wireless system.|$|E

25|$|Empirical {{tests of}} the ego-depletion effect {{typically}} adopt dual-task paradigm. Participants assigned to an experimental ego-depletion group are required to engage in two consecutive tasks requiring self-control. Control participants are also required to engage in two consecutive tasks, but only the second task requires self-control. The strength model predicts that {{the performance of the}} experimental-group on the second self-control task will be impaired relative to that of the control group. This is because the finite self-control resources of the experimental <b>participants</b> <b>will</b> be diminished after the initial self-control task, leaving little to draw on for the second task.|$|E

He revealed the plan at a conference on Sino-U.S. AIDS vaccine research and development held on the 17 December 2006 without indicating how many <b>participants</b> <b>will</b> be involved in the trial. The vaccine was approved for clinical trials by Chinese drug authorities in November 2006.

500|$|Context is {{one other}} element to framing that is essential. [...] "The <b>participants</b> <b>will</b> be bound by norms of good manners: through {{frequency}} and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through circumspection in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due." [...] Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social framings is critical, just as is {{an awareness of the}} audience. Depending on who you’re speaking with (a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc.) you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting.|$|E
500|$|The NZ ETS {{is highly}} linked to {{international}} carbon markets as {{it allows the}} importing {{of most of the}} Kyoto Protocol emission units. It also creates a specific domestic unit; the 'New Zealand Unit' (NZU), which will be issued by free allocation to emitters, with no auctions intended in the short term. Free allocation of NZUs will vary by sector. The commercial fishery sector (who are not <b>participants)</b> <b>will</b> receive a free allocation of units on a historic basis. Owners of pre-1990 forests will receive a fixed free allocation of units. [...] Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry, will be provided on an output-intensity basis. For this sector, there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated. The number of units allocated to eligible emitters will be based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined 'activity'. [...] Bertram and Terry (2010, p 16) state that as the NZ ETS does not 'cap' emissions, the NZ ETS is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{consists of}} two phases. In Phase 1, participants propose to each other, {{in a manner similar}} to that of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem. Each participant orders the other members by preference, resulting in a preference list [...] - [...] an ordered set of the other participants. Participants then propose to each person on their list, in order, continuing to the next person if and when their current proposal is rejected. A <b>participant</b> <b>will</b> reject a proposal if they already hold a proposal from someone they prefer. A <b>participant</b> <b>will</b> also reject a previously-accepted proposal if they later receive a proposal that they prefer. In this case, the rejected <b>participant</b> <b>will</b> then propose to the next person on their list, continuing until a proposal is again accepted. If any participant is eventually rejected by all other participants, this indicates that no stable matching is possible. Otherwise, Phase 1 will end with each person holding a proposal from one of the others.|$|R
