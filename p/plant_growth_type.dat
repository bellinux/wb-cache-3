40|$|Oil pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) {{belongs to}} {{alternative}} crops grown for seeds and high quality seed oil. One {{of the basic}} prerequisites of successful production of oil pumpkin is the proper choice of cultivar. The genetics of different traits of oil pumpkin represents the basis for breeding of new cultivars of oil pumpkin. Of special interest for oil pumpkin breeding are the genetics of seed- coat, <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>type,</b> resistance to diseases and genetic basis of male sterility. For practical breeding of oil pumpkin the theory of monogenic inheritance of seed coat is quite satisfactory. In light {{of the theory of}} developmental reversal of dominance, it may be concluded for C. pepo that the bush type of growth is almost completely dominant over the vine habit at the beginning of plant growth, be- coming incompletely dominant {{in the second part of}} the season. In C. moshata several resistance genes of interest in oil pumpkin breeding for virus resistance were discovered. Male sterility, which was transferred to different genotypes of naked seeded oil pumpkin has potential for production of F 1 hybrid seed. In addition to traits mention above, other genes of interest for genetics and breeding of oil pumpkin are also mentioned in this paper...|$|E

The objective {{of the study was}} to characterize eighteen soybean cultivars from three different breeding programs for agro-morphological traits and to reveal genetic diversity using molecular markers. Morphological description was performed with 13 qualitative and 9 quantitative traits. The genetic relationships were estimated using 21 RAPD markers. PIC was calculated for RAPD data, while the diversity of qualitative traits was described by Shannon genetic diversity index. Cluster analysis based on qualitative morphological characters showed clear separation of genotypes on the basis of their <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>type.</b> PC analysis performed for quantitative traits divided genotypes according to their maturity group. Grouping pattern based on molecular marker data was in agreement with pedigree of cultivars.

Therefore, a set of ten pigeonpea genotypes from a diverse array of plant growth types and maturity groups including two appropriate commercial checks, was evaluated for resistance to pod fly under field conditions, and characterized for physico-chemical pod traits. The non-determinate type GP 75 (extra early maturing) and GP 118 (early maturing), and determinate type GP 233 (extra early maturing) and GP 253 (early maturing) genotypes had significantly lower pod and seed damage as compared to determinate (Prabhat) and non-determinate (Manak) early maturing checks, suggesting that resistance to pod fly is not linked to <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>type</b> and maturity period of the genotype in pigeonpea.

40|$|Abstract Earthworms {{are known}} to {{generally}} increase <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> However, because plant-earthworm inter-actions are potentially mediated by soil characteristics the response of plants to earthworms should depend on the soil type. In a greenhousemicrocosm experiment, the responsiveness of plants (Veronica persica, Trifolium dubium and Poa annua) to two earthworm species (in combination or not) belonging to different functional groups (Aporrectodea. caliginosa an endogeic species, Lumbricus terrestris an anecic species) was measured in term of biomass accumulation. This responsiveness was compared in two soils (nutrient rich and nutrient poor) and two mineral fertilization treatments (with and without). The main significant effects on <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> were due to the anecic earthworm species. L. terrestris increased the shoot biomass and the total biomass of T. dubium only in the rich soil. It increased also the total biomass of P. annua without mineral fertilization but had the opposite effect with fertilization. Mineral fertilization, {{in the presence of}} L. terrestris, also reduced the total biomass of V. persica. L. terrestris did not only affect <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> In P. annua and V. persica A. caliginosa and L. terrestris also affected the shoot/root ratio and this effect depended on soil type. Finally, few significant interactions were found between the anecic and the endogeic earthworms and these interactions did not depend on the soil type. A general idea would be that earthworms mostly increase <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> through the enhancement of mineralization and that earthworm effects should decrease in nutrient-rich soils or with mineral fertilization.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>types</b> of the {{determinate}} and {{indeterminate growth}} forms are commonly distinguished in many legume species. However, there {{do not appear}} to be many studies where direct comparisons have been made of the two <b>growth</b> <b>types</b> in relation to nitrogen fixation and nitrogen distribution. Furthermore, there are disagreements in the literature about the yield advantage of these two <b>growth</b> <b>types.</b> This study was initiated to identify the influence of different <b>growth</b> <b>types</b> of selected grain legumes on seed yield, nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen distribution. In addition, the emphasis was also put on finding amongst the measured parameters, one that had the greatest influence on the differences observed. Initially determinate and indeterminate <b>growth</b> <b>types</b> of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and soybean (Glycinemax), were studied in glasshouse conditions. The indeterminate cultivar of both species had higher leaf area and nodule dry weight, more root growth, accumulated more total dry weight and had higher yield than that of the determinate cultivar. In both species, the indeterminate cultivar accumulated more total plant nitrogen than the determinate cultivar. However, only the indeterminate soybean cultivar showed significantly more nitrogen fixation (Acetylene reduction) than that of the determinate cultivar. Subsequently the same soybean cultivars ('Matara' =determinate and 'Amsoy' =indeterminate) were studied in controlled environment conditions. The indeterminate cultivar produced higher vegetative dry-matter and seed yield than that of the determinate cultivar. The higher acetylene reduction activity of the indeterminate cultivar came primarily from a greater nodule mass. About 30 - 40 % of seed nitrogen of both cultivar came from redistribution from vegetative parts, but the stem of the indeterminate cultivar re-distributed a higher proportion of nitrogen to the seed than that of the determinate cultivar. Among several plant characters measured (viz. the dry-weights of the roots, nodules, stems, leaves, and pods, the leaf area, acetylene reduction activity and the total plant nitrogen) leaf area was identified as the key factor in determining the difference between the two <b>growth</b> <b>types.</b> In order to determine the relative importance of leaf area as a factor influencing seed yield, nitrogen fixation and nitrogen distribution the leaf area of the indeterminate cultivar 'Amsoy' was manipulated by imposing different levels of partial leaf removal starting at the flowering stage. For one treatment, partial pod removal was also applied to induce a reduced demand of assimilate. Partial defoliation of the indeterminate cultivar reduced markedly the root growth and the number of branches, but nodule growth, acetylene reduction activity and nitrogen distribution was reduced to a lesser extent. Partial pod removal did not change the overall pattern of response. When about 6 0 % o f the leaves o f t he indeterminate cultivar were removed, seed yield was reduced by about 1 7 % and it was still significantly higher than the undefoliated determinate cultivar. There was no significant difference between the rates o f nitrogen accumulation in the pods under each treatment. The final seed nitrogen concentration was not affected by defoliation treatments nor was the partitioning of nitrogen to seed. I t was concluded that there were differences between the two <b>growth</b> <b>types</b> o f soybean for seed yield, nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen distribution. Leaf area was the most important parameter in determining these difference [sic]. The greater overlapping of vegetative and reproductive growth in the indeterminate cultivar seemed to be advantageous rather than disadvantageous. This longer period of vegetative growth enabled the indeterminate cultivar to produce a bigger source capacity which consequently supported more nitrogen fixation activity and produced higher seed yield.

40|$|As {{non-point source}} pollution, storm water runoff {{is one of}} the main {{contributors}} to stream impairment in the United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requires Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS 4 s) to obtain a permit under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to manage this pollution. Many municipalities and non-traditional MS 4 s such as the Nebraska Department of Roads are under federal regulations that require new developments or redevelopments of a certain size to capture (and treat) runoff from all new impervious surfaces (roofs, driveways, sidewalks, and so forth) onsite, instead of allowing it to run into the sewers or nearby waterways. To do this structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) are often used to treat the first half-inch of runoff which is commonly considered to contain the majority of pollutants from those sites. The objectives of this research were to: a) develop and test the feasibility of roadside BMPs that rely on bioretention, infiltration, and slow conveyance of storm water, b) test combinations of plants and soil media that will be sustainable in varied regions of Nebraska, and c) test the feasibility of using rubber chips as an alternative BMP medium. Four roadside field-scale BMPs were tested: 1) check dam filters, 2) bioretention, iii 3) infiltration trench, and 4) filter trench. Clogging was experienced by all BMPs except the bioretention; little hard data was collected due to a dry summer.

Soil infested with high population densities ofR. solani (3 ml /kg of soil) and M. javanica (2000 eggs/pot) resulted in complete mortality of tomato seedlings in sterilized soil, whereas some plants were found to survive in non-stenlized soil. There seems to be a correlation between population density of M. javanica and root colonization by R. solani. Root colonization by other three root-infecting fungi including Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani was also lower in the presence of P. aeruginosa in non-sterilized soil. P. aeruginosa enhanced <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> in both <b>types</b> of soil...|$|R

40|$|Free-living soil {{bacteria}} beneficial to <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> are usually {{referred to as}} <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), capable of promoting <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> by colonizing the plant root. Application of PGPR to increase the yield is limited by variability among the results obtained in the laboratory, in greenhouse and field. Rhizobacteria that promote <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> (PGPR) participate in interactions with plants (rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, sugar beet, cotton) and significantly increase their vegetative growth and yield. Apart from Azotobacter and Azospirillum, PGPR also include Acetobacter, Azoarcus and several species of Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Pseudomonas).

Here, {{we describe}} our present {{understanding of how}} gibberellin regulates <b>plant</b> <b>growth,</b> using recent results gained from studies of gibberellin-signalling mutants of Arabidopsis. These results show that a signalling pathway represses <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> and that gibberellin releases this repression. In consequence, the well-known growth-promoting properties of gibberellin are due to its activity as an "inhibitor of an inhibitor" [Brian Pw. Sym Soc.

40|$|In vitro {{tissue culture}} {{represents}} a useful {{support for the}} advancement of Citrus breeding and propagation. Haploidy technology, that is the single-step development of complete homozygous genotypes from heterozygous parents through gametic embryogenesis, has already a huge impact on many relevant crops, representing an integral part in their breeding programmes (Germanà 2011 a; 2011 b). In order {{to increase the number of}} genotypes responding to gametic embryogenesis, in vitro isolated microspore culture of Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck cv. Moro, has been carried out, investigating the influence of the culture medium composition, and, particularly, of the <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> regulator <b>types</b> and concentrations. Meta-topolin, a naturally occurring aromatic cytokinin, is considered an alternative to benzyladenine (BA), zeatin (ZEA) and kinetin (KIN) in plant tissue culture (Aremu et al., 2012), and it is used, mainly, to increase the efficiency of in vitro plant propagation of several species, among them also Citrus (Niedz and Evens, 2011). In this study, metatopolin has been added to the culture medium in substitution of BA and ZEA. After seven months of culture, for all the media tested, different structural features have been observed and registered: microspores uninucleated with no development, binucleated with two asymmetrical nuclei (normal gametophytic pathway: one vegetative and one generative nucleus), binucleated with two equal-size vegetativetype nuclei that had just started their sporophytic pathway, trinucleated, tetranucleated, multinucleated, and, for the first time, calli and embryos at different stages have been obtained. These results indicate an advancement in the knowledge of pollen embryogenesis in Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck cv. Moro. Actually, this is the first time that embryo regeneration from isolated microspore cultures has been reported in sweet orange, a genotype markedly recalcitrant to pollen embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Trophic cascades are {{important}} drivers {{of plant and}} animal abundances in aquatic and aboveground systems, but in soils trophic cascades have been thought to be of limited importance due to omnivory and other factors. Here we use a meta-analysis of 215 studies with 1526 experiments that measured <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> responses to additions or removals of soil organisms to test how different soil trophic levels affect <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> Consistent with the trophic cascade hypothesis, we found that herbivores and plant pathogens (henceforth pests) decreased <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> and that predators of pests increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> The magnitude of this trophic cascade was similar to that reported for aboveground systems. In contrast, we did not find evidence for trophic cascades in decomposer- and symbiont-based (henceforth mutualist) food chains. In these food chains, mutualists increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> and predators of mutualists also increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth,</b> presumably by increasing nutrient cycling rates. Therefore, mutualists, predators of mutualists and predators of pests all increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> Further, experiments that added multiple organisms from different trophic levels also increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> As a result, across the dataset, soil organisms increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> 29 % and non-pest soil organisms increased <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> 46 %. Omnivory has traditionally been thought to confound soil trophic dynamics, but here we suggest that omnivory allows for a simplified perspective of soil food webs – one in which most soil organisms increase <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> by preying on pests or increasing nutrient cycling rates. An implication of this perspective is that processes that decrease soil organism abundance (e. g. soil tillage) are likely to decrease aboveground productivity. Synthesis Soil foodwebs have resisted generalizations due to their diversity and interconnectedness. Here we use results from a meta-analysis to inform a simplified perspective of soil foodwebs: one in which most soil trophic guilds increase <b>plant</b> <b>growth.</b> Our review also includes the first widespread support for the presence of trophic cascades in soils...|$|R

Generally, <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> promoting rhizobacteria facilitate the <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> directly by either assisting in resource acquisition (nitrogen, phosphorus and essential minerals) or modulating plant hormone levels, or indirectly by decreasing the inhibitory effects of various pathogens on <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> and development in the forms of biocontrol agents.
