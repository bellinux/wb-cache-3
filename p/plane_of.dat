5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the contact patch.|$|E

In the article [...] "Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&D", Gary Gygax mentions that there are 16 Outer Planes and describes the Seven Heavens, the Twin Paradises, and Elysium as [...] "Typical higher planes", Nirvana as the [...] "plane of ultimate Law" [...] and Limbo as the [...] "plane of ultimate Chaos (entropy)", and the Nine Hells, Hades' three glooms, and the 666 layers of the Abyss as [...] "Typical lower planes". Other Outer Planes mentioned by name in the article include the Happy Hunting Grounds, Olympus, Gladsheim, Pandemonium, Tarterus, Gehenna, Acheron, and Arcadia. The Outer Planes {{were presented}} again in an appendix <b>of</b> the known <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> existence in the original (1st edition) AD&D Players Handbook, published in June 1978.

5|$|In 1998 the {{discovery}} of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced.

5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
