25|$|If {{an insect}} wing is rigid, for example, a Drosophila wing is {{approximately}} so, its motion {{relative to a}} fixed body can be described by three variables: {{the position of the}} tip in spherical coordinates, (Θ(t),Φ(t)), and the <b>pitching</b> <b>angle</b> ψ(t), about the axis connecting the root and the tip. To estimate the aerodynamic forces based on blade-element analysis, it is also necessary to determine the angle of attack (α). The typical angle of attack at 70% wingspan ranges from 25° to 45° in hovering insects (15° in hummingbirds). Despite the wealth of data available for many insects, relatively few experiments report the time variation of α during a stroke. They include wind tunnel experiments of a tethered locust and a tethered fly, and free hovering flight of a fruit fly.|$|E

Drift shell splitting separates the high and low <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> particles in nightside injections as they move to the dayside magnetosphere, so that the higher <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> particles move radially away from earth.

It is found that the radiation belt anisotropy is systematically greater dawnward of plumes (before the electrons cross the plumes) than it is duskward of plumes (after the electrons have crossed the plumes).

Testing undirectly orbital self-consistency, we search for the main periodic orbits and studied the density response. For <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> up to approximately ∼ 20, the response supports closely the potential permitting readily the presence of long lasting spiral structures. The density response tends to "avoid" larger <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> in the potential, by keeping smaller <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> in the corresponding response.

40|$|The Fluidic thrust {{vectoring}} (FTV) {{is emerging}} as a significant technology for high-performance air vehicles. The technology can improve aircraft maneuverability by manipulating the nozzle flow to deflect from its axial direction. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the effect of a secondary jet on the primary flow in a converging-diverging nozzle, to discuss the effect of FTV parameters, and to evaluate the FTV performance. Numerical and experimental studies of FTV were carried out first with a preliminary nozzle, and then a series of investigations were carried out with an improved nozzle model. The experiments are performed with a nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) of 3 – 10, a secondary pressure ratio (SPR) of 1, 2 or 3, and two different secondary jet locations. Numerical simulations of the ozzle flow are done with solving the Navier-Stokes equations, and the input parameters are set to match the experimental conditions. Computations are performed with and without the secondary jet injection for different combinations of NPR, SPR, econdary jet location, and secondary angular injection. In the preliminary experiments, the slot for the secondary jet injection was so large that the flow deflection by an oblique shock is concealed by complex wave interactions. As a result, it was found difficult to evaluate the FTV performance quantitatively. The improved experimental model with a relatively small secondary jet slot was constructed to study the details of the FTV mechanism and its performance. The effects of FTV parameters, such as NPR, SPR, secondary jet location and inclination are discussed. The results show that the FTV arameters have direct effects on the FTV performance. The thrust pitching moment and the thrust <b>pitching</b> <b>angle</b> are determined to evaluate the FTV performance. A method using force-moment balance and a common procedure for utilizing the ratio of the radial to the axial momentums of exhaust gas is discussed in detail. The numerical results clearly indicate that the sign of the thrust pitching moment with the preliminary nozzle is opposite to that with the new nozzle. The pitching moment of the improved nozzle is positive as expected for oblique shock wave FTV. The relation between the thrust pitching moment and the thrust <b>pitching</b> <b>angle</b> shows the positive inter-relation etween them.

The fluid-structure interaction is realized by coupling a Navier-Stokes solver to a geometrically nonlinear co-rotational structural solver. In the coupled fluid-structure interaction interface the aerodynamic loading and deformed wing surface are shared by two solvers within each time step. A remeshing method based on radial basis function is implemented to handle large deformations, preserve grid quality, and execute economically. Flexible flapping wing operating in both vacuum and air is considered {{to shed light on}} inertial and aerodynamic loading-induced shape deformation.

In order to find <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> we used a new method based on the window Fourier analysis of their images. This method allows us not only to infer the average <b>pitch</b> <b>angle,</b> but to obtain its value {{as a function of}} galactocentric radius as well. Our main results are as follows: (1) Spiral arms of most galaxies cannot be described by a single value of the <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> About 2 / 3 of galaxies demonstrate <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> variations exceeding 20 %. In most galaxies in the sample their <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> decreases by increasing the distance from the centre. (2) <b>Pitch</b> <b>angle</b> variations correlate with the properties of galaxies - with the shape of the surface brightness distribution (envelope-type or truncated disc), and with the sign of stellar disc colour gradient. (3) More luminous and bright bulges produce more tightly wound spiral arms, that is in agreement with current models for spiral arms formation.
