40|$|Magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> {{was invented}} in 1953 and has {{undergone}} intensive development ever since. As {{a result of this}} 38 years of development, the cost per byte and the areal density has halved and doubled, respectively every 2 to 2 1 / 2 years. Today, the cost per byte is lower than 10 (exp - 6) dollars per byte and area densities exceed 100 x 10 (exp 6) bits per square inch. The recent achievements in magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> will first be surveyed briefly. Then the principal areas of current technical development will be outlined.

50|$|As {{hard disk}} {{capacities}} and computer CPU speeds increased {{at the end}} of the 1990s, hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> became more popular. As of early 2005 hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> takes two forms. One is the use of standard desktop or laptop computers, with adapters for encoding audio into two or many tracks of digital audio. These adapters can either be in-the-box soundcards or external devices, either connecting to in-box interface cards or connecting to the computer via USB or Firewire cables. The other common form of hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> uses a dedicated recorder which contains analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as one or two removable hard drives for data storage. Such recorders, packing 24 tracks in a few units of rack space, are actually single-purpose computers, which can in turn be connected to standard computers for editing.|$|R

50|$|A {{hard disk}} {{recorder}} (HDR) {{is a system}} that uses a high-capacity hard <b>disk</b> to <b>record</b> digital audio or digital video. Hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> systems represent an alternative to reel-to-reel audio tape recording and video tape recorders, and provide editing capabilities unavailable to tape recorders. The systems, which can be standalone or computer-based, typically include provisions for digital mixing and processing of the audio signal.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 {{the first}} version of Samplitude, written for the Amiga platform, was completed. It was mainly a sample editor with 24-bit audio processing. One year later, Samplitude Pro II came with hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording.</b>|$|R
50|$|OctaMED was {{developed}} on the Amiga until 1996. The last version, called OctaMED Soundstudio, had features like MIDI file support, ARexx support, support for 16-bit and stereo samples, hard <b>disk</b> <b>recording,</b> {{and support for}} up to 64 channels.|$|R

5000|$|Recording is to a {{professional}} medium like some variant of Betacam or DVCPRO or Direct to <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> or flash memory. If as in the latter two, it's a data recording, much higher data rates (or less video compression) are used than in consumer devices.|$|R

50|$|Together with Betacam SX, Sony {{introduced}} {{a generation of}} hybrid recorder, allowing use of both tape and <b>disk</b> <b>recording</b> on the same deck, and high speed dubbing from one to another. This was intended to save wear on the video heads for television studio applications, as well to speed up online editing.|$|R

Additional releases of note were the Z4 and Z8 24-bit 96 kHz samplers.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic {{recording}} media: VHS tapes {{contain a}} reel of magnetic tape. The information {{that makes up}} the video and sound is encoded on the magnetic coating on the tape. Common audio cassettes also rely on magnetic tape. Similarly, in computers, floppy disks and hard <b>disks</b> <b>record</b> data on a thin magnetic coating.|$|R

Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera <b>disk</b> to <b>record</b> the moment, or perhaps [...] "to assess the threat" [...] due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroys the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera <b>disk</b> <b>records</b> the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away.|$|R

Many still use the ADAT as a simple I/O (in/out) for transfer of analog to digital signals.|$|R
