The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or <b>physical</b> <b>exchange</b> on the ice.

This is attested by at least three authors: Strabo (64/ 63 BC–c. 24 AD), Seneca the Younger (c. 3 BC–AD 65), and Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). The aforementioned Strabo and Plutarch (c. 45–125 AD) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king Menander, confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.|$|E

50|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} {{occurs at}} two separate stages during meiosis called prophase I and prophase II (see meiosis diagram). In a diploid cell {{there are two}} sets of homologous chromosomes of different parental origin (e.g. a paternal and a maternal set). During the phase of meiosis labeled “interphase s” in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so {{that each of the}} chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis (see Synapsis). During synapsis, genetic recombination usually occurs. Some of the recombination events occur by crossing over (involving <b>physical</b> <b>exchange</b> between two chromatids), but most recombination events involve information exchange but not <b>physical</b> <b>exchange</b> between two chromatids (see Synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA)). Following recombination, chromosome segregation occurs as indicated by the stages metaphase I and anaphase I in the meiosis diagram.|$|E
