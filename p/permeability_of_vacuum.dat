Although force on a diamagnetic object from an ordinary magnet is far too weak to be felt, using extremely strong superconducting magnets, diamagnetic objects such as pieces of lead and even mice can be levitated, so they float in mid-air. Superconductors repel magnetic fields from their interior and are strongly diamagnetic.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{believed}} that variability of the fine-structure constant alpha would imply detectable violations of the weak equivalence principle. This belief is not justified in general. It is put to rest here {{in the context of}} the general framework for alpha variability [J. D. Bekenstein, Phys. Rev. D 25, 1527 (1982) ] in which the exponent of a scalar field plays the role of the permittivity and inverse <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vacuum.</b> The coupling <b>of</b> particles to the scalar field is necessarily such that the anomalous force acting on a charged particle by virtue of its mass's dependence on the scalar field is cancelled by terms modifying the usual Coulomb force. As a consequence a particle's acceleration in external fields depends only on its charge to mass ratio, in accordance with the principle. And the center of mass acceleration of a composite object can be proved to be independent of the object's internal constitution, as the weak equivalence principle requires. Likewise the widely employed assumption that the Coulomb energy of matter is the principal source of the scalar field proves wrong; Coulomb energy effectively cancels out in the continuum description of the scalar field's dynamics. This cancellation resolves a cosmological conundrum: with Coulomb energy as source of the scalar field, the framework would predict a decrease of alpha with cosmological expansion, whereas an increase is claimed to be observed. Because of the said cancellation, magnetic energy of cosmological baryonic matter is the main source of the scalar field. Consequently the expansion is accompanied by an increase in alpha; for reasonable values of the framework's sole parameter, this occurs at a rate consistent with the observers' claims.

40|$|Four {{tests for}} {{measuring}} the surface properties of concrete have been studied: (1) The initial surface absorption test; (2) Figg's air permeation index (Figg) test; (3) the covercrete absorption test (CAT); and (4) the air <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the near surface test. Analytical models are presented {{for each of the}} tests to relate the results to fundamental properties of the concrete. Experimental results are presented for the application <b>of</b> a <b>vacuum</b> technique for preconditioning concrete in situ prior to the Figg test and CAT. The application <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> using the initial surface absorption test cap did not lead to satisfactory results with these tests.

50|$|Diamagnetic {{materials}} are repelled by a magnetic field; an {{applied magnetic field}} creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic {{materials are}} attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when {{it is the only}} contribution to the magnetism the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than μ0, the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>vacuum.</b> In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.Diamagnetism was first discovered when Sebald Justinus Brugmans observed in 1778 that bismuth and antimony were repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845, Michael Faraday demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded that every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by William Whewell, Faraday first referred to the phenomenon as diamagnetic (the prefix dia- meaning through or across), then later changed it to diamagnetism.|$|E
40|$|A {{system of}} {{vertical}} drains combined with vacuum preloading to accelerate soil consolidation by promoting radial flow {{is an effective}} method. In this paper, the analytical modelling of vertical drains incorporating vacuum preloading in an axisymmetric condition is proposed.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is developed to evaluate airtightness, {{which is one}} of the most important requirements <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube transportation systems. The main objective of the model is to anticipate the pressure inside a closed structure, which initially decreases and then rises with time owing to the inflow of the air outside. The model is formulated by using Darcy’s law and by solving the differential equations that consider the air <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the material and physical configuration of the tube. Equations are derived for a tube section in two cases: one with constant thickness and another with variable thickness. Although the developed model must be verified experimentally, results simulated by using the model with several assumed sections were consistent with the findings of a previous study. The mathematical model developed here to predict the behavior of the pressure inside a vacuum tube structure could be effectively used to evaluate the airtightness <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube transportation systems.

On one hand, due to fascinating accuracy of atomic clocks, the traditional macroscopic standards of metrology (second, metre, kilogram) are giving way to standards based on fundamental units of nature: velocity of light c and quantum of action h. On the other hand, the poor precision of gravitational constant G, which is widely believed to define the “cube of theories ” and the units of the future “theory of everything”, does not allow to use G as a fundamental dimensional constant in metrology.
