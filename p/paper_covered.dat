25|$|Under Wilkes, the Spirit began {{covering}} football more extensively {{than any}} previous publication. Football coverage in the Spirit quickly outstripped {{the same in the}} paper's main rivals, the New York Clipper and the National Police Gazette. The <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> college games first; in 1882, football got its own section. This coverage expanded again in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} room (called {{the dining}} room or the palladian room), was public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable rococo design. The fireplace wall has an ornate chimney breast. On {{either side of the}} fireplace are beaufats, these ones with shallower shelves than in the little parlour, and no doors. Classical broken pediments top the chimney breast and the beaufats. The floor was made of carefully matched blind-doweled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut entry doors. During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> the thin pine paneling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.|$|E
25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E

6000|$|So it {{was only}} a deception; he had seen no one. And yet he remembered the turn of the head, the line of the neck, the colour of the hair, the {{movement}} of the passing figure.

6000|$|Crawshay {{broke the}} seal, thrust {{his hand into}} the {{envelope}} and drew out a pile of closely folded papers. One by one he laid them upon the table and smoothed them out. Even before he had glanced at the first one, a queer presentiment seemed suddenly to chill the blood in his veins. His eyes became a trifle distended. They were all there now, a score or more of sheets of thin foreign note <b>paper,</b> <b>covered</b> with hand-writing of a distinctly feminine type.

6000|$|From {{philology}} {{we turn to}} {{the examination}} of literary fragments, which will necessarily establish our already secured position (that Gladstone is the sun), or so much the worse for the fragments. These have reached us in the shape of burned and torn scraps of <b>paper,</b> <b>covered</b> with printed texts, which resolve themselves into hymns, and imprecations or curses. It appears to have been the custom of the worshippers of Gladstone to salute his rising, at each dawn, with printed outcries of adoration and delight, resembling in character the Osirian hymns. These are sometimes couched in rhythmical language, as when we read-- ...|$|E
60|$|Stevie, {{accustomed}} {{to move about}} disregarded, had {{got up from the}} kitchen table, carrying off his drawing to bed with him. He had reached the parlour door in time to receive in full the shock of Karl Yundt’s eloquent imagery. The sheet of <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> with circles dropped out of his fingers, and he remained staring at the old terrorist, as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain. Stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one’s skin hurt very much. His scared eyes blazed with indignation: it would hurt terribly. His mouth dropped open.|$|E

"I rose (for I had seated myself {{during his}} narrative), {{my heart was}} stirred with pity; I took down the Cicero, and lit {{on a sheet of}} yellow <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> with faded manuscript, which, of course, I did not read. I turned to the hearth, tossed on the fire the sere old paper, which blazed at once, and then, hearing the words pax vobiscum, I looked round. But I was alone.

I {{have not}} {{time to make}} the calculation, but I suppose that the daily {{literature}} by which we now are principally nourished, is so large in issue that though St. John's [...] "even the world itself could not contain the books which should be written" [...] may be still hyperbole, it is nevertheless literally true that the world might be wrapped in the books which are written; and that the sheets of <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> with type on any given subject, interesting to the modern mind, (say the prospects of the Claimant,) issued in the form of English morning papers during a single year, would be enough literally to pack the world in.|$|E

Her work-box flew open, and as they stooped {{to pick up the}} articles, Arthur again wept without control as he took up a little frock, half made, with the needle hanging to it. The table-drawer had fallen out, and with it the large account-book, the weekly bills, and a sheet of <b>paper</b> <b>covered</b> with figures, and blotted and blistered with tears.
