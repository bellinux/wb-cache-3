40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop {{rational}} design methods for <b>panel</b> and <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame constructions used in bookshelves and cabinets, and to investigate the stiffness of four types of construction including frameless, front framed and <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookcases, and <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame wall cabinets. ^ In the case of frameless and front framed constructions, {{the contribution of the}} front frame and individual shelves to overall bookshelf stiffness were investigated along with the effect of material type and thickness on stiffness. Results of performance testing were compared with the results of the structural theories. ^ In the case of <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame construction, elastic and creep deflection of <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookshelves at mid-span were investigated first, followed by a study of the stiffness of <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame constructions. Contributions of both the panels and the frame and the effect of type of the wood frame properties to overall case rigidity were investigated. Creep deflections of <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame wall cabinets were also investigated. The stiffnesses of these cases were compared with the frameless and front framed cases. Actual test results were compared with the results of finite element analyses. ^ Results indicated that for frameless bookcases, panel thickness and inclusion of a front frame significantly increased structural stiffness. Also, each individual shelf contributed about the same amount to overall bookcase stiffness. Classical analysis and finite element results supported the experimental findings. ^ In the case of <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookcases, round mortise and tenon joints provided relatively good end rigidity. Creep deflection of the shelves averaged 49 to 54 percent of initial elastic deflection; overall creep recovery reached 87 percent of the total shelf deflection. In both <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookcases and wall cabinets, panels have significant effect on the stiffness of the structure. ^ <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookcases are much stiffer than the frameless and front framed bookcases and are not only stiffer but also much lighter. ^ Finally, results of the studies lead us to conclude that strong and durable <b>panel</b> <b>on</b> frame bookcases and wall cabinets can be produced by means of simple techniques. ...|$|R

5|$|On September 10, 2013, a Deep Impact mission {{status report}} {{explained}} that mission controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves {{and so are}} unable to issue any commands to the vehicle's thrusters.

Additionally, the solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> the vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power.|$|E
5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux.

Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E

It will be funded by a temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building's working life by at least 50 years. In March 2017, the House of Commons backed funding for the project by 464 votes to 56.|$|E

5|$|The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 {{megawatt}} (MW) {{solar photovoltaic}} {{power plant in}} Boulder City, Nevada. Sempra Generation began construction of the plant in January 2010 and the facility began generating electricity on December 1, 2010. At its construction peak more than 350 workers were installing the 775,000 First Solar <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> the 380 acre site. The power from Copper Mountain Solar Facility (and the adjacent 10 MW El Dorado Solar Power Plant) is being sold to Pacific Gas & Electric under separate 20-year contracts.

5|$|The main sonar array is a Thomson Sintra Scylla active/passive bow sonar, {{linked to}} a passive {{intercept}} and ranging array distributed along the flanks of the submarine; three <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> each side. Collins and Farncomb were originally fitted with Thales Karriwarra passive towed sonar arrays, while the other four boats could be fitted with the Karriwarra or Thales' Namara array. These were later replaced across the class with the Thales SHOR-TAS towed passive array, deployed through the horizontal 'pipe' at the stern. When surfaced or at periscope depth, the Collins-class boats can use a Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 surface search radar, which is situated in a retractable mast on the fin.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10 - sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by Mayne and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of natural lighting designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to have an open feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, like all the others in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble <b>panels</b> <b>on</b> the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E
