500|$|After {{delivering}} more forces {{during the}} next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal, led by Hyakutake, in late October 1942 at the Battle for Henderson Field, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese. Vandegrift later stated that Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge in September {{was the only time}} during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, [...] "we would have been in a <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> condition." [...] Historian Richard B. Frank adds, [...] "The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942, on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they also agree {{that it was not}} one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E

The Nick Knight-directed music video was released on November 19, 2013. The video features his then-fiancée Kim Kardashian, topless, riding atop West's motorbike through Monument Valley and other landscapes. Eric Diep of XXL described it as, [...] "a confident display of love and passion with little to no narrative." [...] Spin felt that [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> idea seen through so completely that it stops being a bad idea". Tom Breihan from Stereogum found the video confusing, saying [...] "it'll take a little bit to figure out what all's going on there". Lanre Bakare of The Guardian described it as [...] "self-indulgent, idiosyncratic and a bit weird".|$|E

[...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting <b>pretty</b> <b>bad.</b> I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it."

500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having been a <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Walter Skinner had {{evolved over the}} course of The X-Files sixth season. At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt that Skinner's character was becoming [...] "expendable". With their transfer away from the X-Files division, Mulder and Scully saw less and less of their former boss. Originally, John Shiban, the writer of the episode, wanted to infect Mulder with nanobots. However, he decided that since the audience knew Mulder would not be killed, this plot would not be very effective. In order to compensate for this loss, Shiban decided to re-work Skinner back into the series mythology by putting him in Mulder's place. Shiban, inspired by the 1950 noir film D.O.A. and its 1988 remake which he jokingly called [...] " [...] <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> movies", decided to craft an episode of The X-Files around the conceit of [...] "a guy who's been poisoned [...] has only a short time to live and has to use that time to find out why and by whom he's being murdered".|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was <b>pretty</b> <b>bad.</b> I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{details of}} Angelou's life {{described}} in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles {{tended to be}} inconsistent. [...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong.' They can’t forgive themselves and go on with their lives".|$|E

In an interview with Carlos in 2012 for Punkglobe, he spoke of the album and stated [...] "The production in the 80's the drums got really gimmicky, and we weren't getting along great with the record company. Jon was playing bass, so that made Cheap Trick not sound like they used to, as much. And, they aren't great records. [...] "The Doctor" [...] is just <b>pretty</b> much a <b>bad</b> 80's album. The record company would call us up and say [...] "we gotta have keyboards on it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Happily I had no arms of {{any kind}} with me, so {{that there could be}} no [...] complication. I am rather a quick hand myself when there is any [...] {{shooting}} to be done. However, there was no trouble here, but the [...] contrary; the Blue Mountaineers--it sounds like a new sort of Bond [...] Street band, doesn't it?--treated me in quite a different way than [...] they did when I first met them. They were amazingly civil, almost [...] deferential. But, all time same, they were more distant than ever, [...] and all the time I was there I could get not a whit closer to them. [...] They seemed in a sort of way to be afraid or in awe of me. No doubt [...] that will soon pass away, and when we know one another better we [...] shall become close friends.

In the [...] "good old times," [...] on the contrary, a cavalier jogged on through bog and mire, {{from town to town}} and hamlet to hamlet, conversing with friars and franklins, and all other chance companions of the road; beguiling the way with travellers' tales, which then were truly wonderful, for every thing beyond one's neighbourhood was full of marvel and romance; stopping at night at some [...] "hostel," [...] where the bush over the door proclaimed good wine, or a <b>pretty</b> hostess made <b>bad</b> wine palatable; meeting at supper with travellers, or listening to the song or merry story of the host, who was generally a boon companion, and presided at his own board; for, according to old Tusser's [...] "Innholder's Posie," ...|$|R
500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds <b>pretty</b> <b>bad.</b> With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E
500|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansbury's performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singer's delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disney's first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during 'Be Our Guest'... looked <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "'Be Our Guest'... is the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman's review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, 'Be Our Guest,'... sorry to say, is no 'Under the Sea'." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrum's Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, 'Be Our Guest,' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, 'Under the Sea.' But it's just under par." ...|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

At this moment Providence sent great relief to Miss Robarts {{in the shape of}} Mrs. Crawley's red-armed maid-of-all-work, who, walking up to her master, whispered into his ear that he was wanted. It was the time of day at which his {{attendance}} was always required in his parish school; and that attendance being so punctually given, those who wanted him looked for him there at this hour, and if he were absent, did not scruple to send for him. [...] "Miss Robarts, I am afraid you must excuse me," [...] said he, getting up and taking his hat and stick. Lucy begged that she might not be at all in the way, and already began to speculate how she might best unload her treasures. [...] "Will you make my compliments to Mrs. Robarts, and say that I am sorry to miss the pleasure of wishing her good-bye? But I shall probably see her as she passes the school-house." [...] And then, stick in hand, he walked forth, and Lucy fancied that Bobby's eyes immediately rested on the bag of gingerbread-nuts.|$|R

It kept me all cross and cantankerous and I saw I'd have to get out or I'd never have any peace. I concluded I'd come to the Island. I'd been here when I was a boy and I liked it; but Emily had always said she wouldn't live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after dark for fear they'd fall off the edge. So, just to be contrary, I moved over here. And that's all there is to it. I hadn't ever heard a word from or about Emily till I come home from the back field Saturday and found her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner I'd had since she left me all ready on the table. She told me to eat it first and then we'd talk [...] . by which I concluded that Emily had learned some lessons about getting along with a man. So she's here and she's going to stay [...] . seeing that Ginger's dead and the Island's some bigger than she thought. There's Mrs. Lynde and her now. No, don't go, Anne.

60|$|Then {{comes the}} tug of war. The young wife becomes a mother, and while she is retired to her chamber, blundering Biddy rusts the elegant knives, or takes off the ivory handles by soaking in hot water; the silver is washed in greasy soapsuds, and {{refreshed}} now {{and then with a}} thump, which cocks the nose of the teapot awry, or makes the handle assume an air of drunken defiance. The fragile china is chipped here and there around its edges with those minute gaps so vexatious to a woman's soul; the handles fly hither and thither in the wild confusion of Biddy's washing-day hurry, when cook wants her to help hang out the clothes. Meanwhile Bridget sweeps the parlor with a hard broom, and shakes out showers of ashes from the grate, forgetting to cover the damask lounges, and they directly look as rusty and time-worn as if they had come from an auction-store; and all together unite in making such havoc of the delicate ruffles and laces of the bridal outfit and baby layette that, when the poor young wife comes out of her chamber after her nurse has left her, and, weakened and embarrassed with the demands of the newcomer, begins to look once more into the affairs of her little world, she is ready to sink with vexation and discouragement. Poor little princess! Her clothes are made as princesses wear them, her baby's clothes like a young duke's, her house furnished like a lord's, and only Bridget and Biddy and Polly to do the work of cook, scullery-maid, butler, footman, laundress, nursery-maid, housemaid, and lady's maid. Such is the array that in the Old Country would be deemed necessary to take care of an establishment got up like hers. Everything in it is too fine,--not too fine to be <b>pretty,</b> not in <b>bad</b> taste in itself, but too fine for the situation, too fine for comfort or liberty.|$|R
500|$|The year 1947 {{became a}} career {{year for the}} now-sober Black. There was {{optimism}} in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent, with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was [...] "a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs." [...] In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers, a tough 53 victory, someone in the press box said, [...] "I wonder what he’d give for a slug of bourbon", to which he replied, [...] "All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum. Bourbon doesn’t even tempt me." [...] He followed this with a 10 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox. A game against his former team, the Philadelphia Athletics, became the highlight of his career. On July 10, 1947, Black no-hit the Athletics 3-0 at Cleveland Stadium, allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill McCahan—himself a no-hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season. Only Eddie Joost came close to getting a hit on Black, hitting a ball {{in the eighth inning}} that just barely went foul. On top of his no-hit performance, Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day. He was modest about his performance afterwards, saying [...] "My control was <b>pretty</b> <b>bad.</b> I got behind on a lot of hitters, but they didn't seem to hit me." [...] Black finished the season with ten wins, 12 losses, a 3.92 ERA, eight complete games, and three shutouts. At the end of the season, he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al López, though this did not eventuate. During the off-season, Black returned to his hometown of Salix, where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day.|$|E
500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>bad</b> actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
