5|$|Despite {{being the}} sixth {{episode in the}} series, Aliens is not clearly stated to take place after {{the events of the}} pair of episodes in Galaxy. In the game's introduction, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze is working on his wrist {{computer}} in his backyard clubhouse when his babysitter, Molly McMire, calls him in for dinner. Upon hearing a loud noise he rushes out, only to discover her missing and a note burnt into the grass stating that the Bloogs of Fribbulus Xax have taken Molly and plan to eat her; donning his helmet as Commander Keen, Billy rushes off to save her before his <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> home. During the game, Keen journeys through the various outposts, factories, and installations of the alien Bloogs on the planet of Fribbulus Xax as well as a space station above it.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments {{in the mind of}} the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
25|$|Being a mini/youth rugby club {{membership}} {{is through the}} youth players themselves; parents {{are not required to}} obtain a membership before their child can participate in rugby Although there are no adult memberships, unlike the social norm practised by a number of prominent social clubs which offer mini/youth rugby, <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> involved by taking up the role as a team manager or coach – usually in one group in which their own child plays. In other cases, these parents join the club council/committee and administer the club. Membership application is relatively straightforward. There are few formalities apart from annual membership renewal at the start of each season in August/September.|$|E

500|$|... "Snuffy's <b>Parents</b> <b>Get</b> a Divorce" [...] is {{a popular}} divorce episode of the children's {{television}} program Sesame Street. Produced in 1992, it never aired because tests showed several unintended negative effects. Sesame Street has {{had a history of}} presenting difficult topics as part of its affective curriculum goals, including death, marriage, childbirth, and disaster. Extensive research was done before these episodes were written and produced, to ascertain their focus, and after they aired, to analyze the effect they had on viewers, and that was the case for [...] "Snuffy's <b>Parents</b> <b>Get</b> a Divorce". The show's producers had expressed a desire to produce the episode as early as 1989, and they were convinced that it was a topic they should address after the US Census Bureau reported that 40% of American children had experienced divorce.|$|E
500|$|... "Callie and Her Sister" [...] is {{the second}} episode of the [...] of the American {{animated}} television series Ugly Americans, and the sixteenth overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 7, 2011. In the episode, half-demon Callie Maggotbone repeatedly refuses {{to go through with}} her arranged marriage to Twayne Boneraper. To convince her father she is serious with her boyfriend Mark Lilly, she asks him to move in with her. Following a therapy session held by Mark, Callie's divorced <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> back together and produce a second daughter, Lilith, who will replace Callie as Twayne's bride. Callie and Mark later take on the job to raise Lilith, who develops evil plans for the wedding.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street did {{not address}} the subject of divorce until November 2012, when its {{producers}} created, as part of their resiliency initiative, Little Children, Big Challenges: Divorce. It was made available to military families and to the general public through family courts, counseling services, and parenting and child care programs. It included a 22-minute DVD, a caregiver guide, a storybook, a tip sheet for extended families and friends, mobile apps and social networking sites, and an online toolkit. Like in [...] "Snuffy's <b>Parents</b> <b>Get</b> a Divorce", the Little Children, Big Challenges production also used a Muppet, Abby Cadabby, to represent the child experiencing divorce. Whereas Snuffy was shown going through it in real time, Abby's parents' divorce was in the past, which gave her time to adjust.|$|E

500|$|After turning {{ten years}} old, Stan was {{diagnosed}} with [...] "cynicism", which in the series is treated as a serious medical disorder where the sufferer sees nothing but feces instead of people and animals and hear flatulence noises during music and voices. Stan's friendships with the other main characters ended, his parents divorced and he moved out of his home. This episode formed a cliffhanger and set off widespread speculation that the series {{was coming to an}} end, but the premiere of {{the second half of the}} season resolved the arc as Stan was erroneously diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and discovers Jameson Irish Whiskey cures cynicism. After struggling to repair his life, he finally explains he doesn't want things to go back to normal, when his <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> back together and his life is repaired, although the end of the episode implies Stan may be permanently bound to whiskey to continue an everyday life.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Mr. Hooper episode, [...] "Snuffy's <b>Parents</b> <b>Get</b> a Divorce" [...] was studied {{extensively}} for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "it bombed". Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children {{believed that their}} parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents loved them despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived (especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before). Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, [...] "The kids came away with negative messages... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away even though we said just the opposite. A number said the parents {{would no longer be}} in love with them".|$|E
500|$|... "Callie and Her Sister" [...] {{was written}} by Mick Kelly, in his second writing credit for the series, {{following}} the [...] finale [...] "The Manbirds". The episode was directed by series creator Devin Clark and Richard Ferguson-Hull. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] marked Ferguson-Hull's first directing credit for the series; he previously served as a director for the Adult Swim animated series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (2000–07). In addition to the main cast, [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. Klausner provided the voices of Lilith and Rosie, and main cast member Larry Murphy returned to voice Callie's father Aldermach. [...] "Callie and Her Sister" [...] was first hinted at in June 2011 during an interview by Clark on what to expect in the series' second season, where he revealed the episode's main plot and its references: [...] "Callie's <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> back together in one episode and {{give birth to a}} sister for Callie who because of being a supernatural creature, ends up aging one year, every day, and we have an homage to The Omen in there. Mark and Callie end up taking over the responsibilities of her parenting dealing with this demonic child." ...|$|E

500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's <b>Parents</b> <b>Get</b> a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're talking about! That song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of <b>parents</b> <b>get</b> divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don’t agree with what their parents have done," [...] said DeLonge. [...] "Stay Together" [...] was the final song completed during the recording sessions; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is certain}} that {{associated}} animals have a feeling of {{love for each other}} which is not felt by adult and non-social animals. How far in most cases they actually sympathise with each other’s pains and pleasures is more doubtful, especially with respect to the latter. Mr. Buxton, however, who had excellent means of observation,[109] states that his macaws, which lived free in Norfolk, took “an extravagant interest” in a pair with a nest, and whenever the female left it, she was surrounded by a troop “screaming horrible acclamations in her honour.” It is often difficult to judge whether animals have any feeling for each other’s sufferings. Who can say what cows feel, when they surround and stare intently on a dying or dead companion? That animals sometimes are far from feeling any sympathy is too certain; for they will expel a wounded animal from the herd, or gore or worry it to death. This is almost the blackest fact in natural history, unless indeed the explanation which has been suggested is true, that their instinct or reason leads them to expel an injured companion, lest beasts of prey, including man, should be tempted to follow the troop.
