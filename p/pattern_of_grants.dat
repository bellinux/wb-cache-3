30|$|There is an ideologically charged {{atmosphere}} in the USA surrounding scientific explorations {{of the relationships between}} innate variation and athletic performance (Hoberman 1992, 1997; Entine 2000). The origins of this intellectual climate can be traced from a past history of slavery and its consequent explicit and implicit racism to a post-World War II academic and intellectual milieu that favored the hypothesis that variations in social and cultural environments during development are most responsible for individual differences in performance (i.e., the environmentalist paradigm) (Segerstråle 2000). Consequently, scientists and government funding agencies may avoid pursuing scientific questions about the potential role of innate variation in performance because of this intellectual and political environment. If a pervasive environmentalist sentiment in the USA has inhibited USA based investigators from pursing questions about the role of innate variation in athletic performance (i.e., self-censorship, sensu Loury (1994)), then we predict that USA based investigators will be underrepresented as authors on scientific papers about the role of innate variation in athletic performance compared to their representation on papers about the same factors independent of their role in athletic performance. Moreover, we predict that USA government funding agencies (e.g., National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF)) will not solicit or fund grant proposals designed to directly pursue questions about the role of innate variation in performance but will solicit or grant proposals to study innate variation independent of performance. We tested these predictions two ways. First, we first compared the proportions of authors that listed USA addresses on papers published in peer-reviewed journals that examined the role of innate variation in athletic performance with the proportion of authors with USA addresses listed on papers that examined the same factors independent of their role in athletic performance. Second, we examined the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> solicitation <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> proposals and the funding for these topics by NIH and NSF.|$|R

In its simplest and archetypal form—on which we shall focus—a federation comprises a single central “federal ” authority superimposed on a set of lowerlevel “states. ” It is thus surprising to find that until recently almost all of the formal literature on fiscal federalism dealt with just one level of government, the federal government being notable by its absence. * Michael Keen is Professor of Economics at the University of Essex, England, and currently on leave as a Technical Assistance Advisor in the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department.

40|$|The first essay applies four {{standard}} {{models of}} fiscal equalization to simulate {{a set of}} alternative allocations of equalizing subsidies across states in Mexico. Equalization of per capita outlays, fiscal capacity and fiscal potentials are considered. Then a methodology is developed to adjust actual, observed federal subsidies distributed to the state governments as revenue-sharing grants in order to compare these subsidies to the equalizing subsidies obtained from the simulation. The results reveal that the actual <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> from the General Fund of Revenue-Sharing resembles the patterns which would result from implementing fiscal equalization of either fiscal capacity or fiscal potentials. The second essay uses household income data to evaluate the potential redistributive effects of alternative tax/subsidy policies related to the financing of public education in Mexico. The incidence of educational subsidies are analyzed by looking at variations of per student educational subsidies across households grouped by level of income. I find that middle-income households benefit the most from subsidies to basic educational levels, while high-income households capture the highest per student educational subsidies in upper secondary and higher education. The concept of welfare dominance is then applied to assess the effect that changes in the allocation of educational subsidies across school levels will have on overall measures of income inequality and social welfare. The results suggest that a marginal increase in subsidies for basic education, upper secondary and other (non-higher) educational services {{at the expense of}} a marginal decrease in subsidies for higher education will yield a marginal welfare improvement. Finally, in the third essay a sample of pooled cross-sectional data for state governments in Mexico, from 1996 to 1999, is used to show that federal non-matching grants for basic education appear to have a large stimulative effect on state public expenditures in education, a result consistent with the "flypaper" effect literature. A model of local fiscal response is used to further analyze the impact <b>of</b> educational <b>grants</b> on state educational expenditures by decomposing the overall effect <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> into income and price components. The results suggest that non-matching educational grants are effectively perceived by local bureaucrats as a pure price reduction for state expenditures on education...|$|R

Its purpose first of all, is to explore the background of public finance issues, giving the overall context of social welfare finance in our federal system. Second it examines the methods used by the Commonwealth Grants Commission {{and the implications of}} these methods in determining relativities among the States in the distribution process of federal funds. Third it examines methods of assessing social welfare need and social welfare expenditures in the States. Fourth it shows how the structure and <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> federal <b>grants</b> has changed over the past decade. (1973 – 1983) The data reported here allow comparison between the States on a reasonably standard basis, and show some interesting results in the levels of distribution of social service and social welfare expenditures. Social services (broadly defined) involve a major cash flow in Australian society. Annual social welfare expenditure, (a small part only of the States' social services expenditures, but a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditures) for 1982 - 83 alone, would buy BHP, CRA, MIM, Westpac, CSR, Comalco and the ANZ Banking Group, and there would still be some change. In this paper we are certainly not dealing with trifling matters. We have attempted to look at broad issues of public finance, and relate these to social welfare. Chapter 1 outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and State governments in providing and funding social welfare. Chapter 2 deals with the role and methods <b>of</b> the Commonwealth <b>Grants</b> Commission review <b>of</b> tax sharing and its analysis of relative needs and costs in social welfare. Chapter 3 uses the standard budgets worked out by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to shed light on the relative levels and structures of social welfare expenditure in the States.

The concept of "fundamental pairs" was introduced in our TACCLE methodology for testing object-oriented software. It was proved that, although the set of fundamental pairs is only a proper subset of equivalent ground terms, the use of fundamental pairs as test cases covers the use of equivalent ground terms. Recently, we found that any normal form consists of only a creator, or a creator followed only by constructors but not transformers; and yet the reverse is not necessarily true. Thus, the generation <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> normal forms is non-trivial and warrants further study. Motivated by this finding and based on further <b>pattern</b> analyses <b>of</b> normal forms and tree models with pruning techniques, we propose an algorithm to generate representative normal forms according to patterns and develop a corresponding automatic tool.

40|$|In the {{agricultural}} sector, unlike {{in any other}} economic area, agricultural agreements (contracts) should reflect their social character since {{they are used to}} put in order and reconcile varied interests. However the agreements used in the Polish agricultural transactions are of an extremely varied character (sale, exchange, donation, life usufruct, succession agreement, the agreement of farm conveyance for structural pension, lease, renting, contract deliveries of agricultural produce). In practice they are concluded in order to create, enlarge or arrange a farm from a subject matter point of view. With the Act of 7 March 2007 on the support for rural areas with the participation of means from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development there was introduced a new type of contracts constructed in order to acquire payments from the European means within support schemes for rural development, with contracts on granting payments constituting this type of agreement. The agreement on <b>granting</b> payments is <b>of</b> civil-legal nature which can be included into agricultural agreements.
