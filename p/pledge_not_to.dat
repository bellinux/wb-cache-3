5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> represent their national interest, but rather took {{an oath to}} defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> run for re-election, retired {{to his home}} in Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|The events {{started on}} 30 August 1942 after the Japanese recaptured four POWs {{escaped from the}} Selarang Barracks camps, and {{required}} that the other prisoners sign a <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> escape. After they refused, {{they were forced to}} crowd in the areas around the barracks square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation. The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men started to fall ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were allowed to return to the barracks buildings.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845.

In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's {{legal adviser}} William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now {{attained}} a dominant {{position in the}} Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.|$|E

25|$|In council {{elections}} held on 3 May 2012, the Lib Dems {{lost more}} than three hundred councillors, leaving them with fewer than three thousand {{for the first time in}} the party's history.

25|$|On May 18, 2004, Provincial Finance Minister Greg Sorbara {{released}} the McGuinty government's first budget. The centrepiece was a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> raise taxes, {{and gave the}} government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium by pointing to the previous government's hidden deficit of $5.6 billion, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, the Klan openly criticized Truman for {{his efforts}} to promote civil rights.

When a Klan officer demanded that Truman <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hire any Catholics if he were re-elected as county judge, Truman refused. He personally knew their worth from his World War I experience. His membership fee was returned and he never joined the Klan.|$|E
25|$|An unpopular provincial {{budget by}} Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty, who broke a <b>pledge</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> raise taxes, hurt the federal party's numbers in Ontario, as did a weak {{performance}} from Martin in the leaders' debates.

Martin was successful in winning a plurality of seats to continue as the government, though they were now in a minority situation, the first since Joe Clark's tenure in 1979–80.|$|E
