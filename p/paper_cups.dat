5|$|Paper cup {{and paper}} napkin: <b>Paper</b> <b>cups</b> have been {{documented}} in imperial China, alongside paper napkins. <b>Paper</b> <b>cups</b> were known as chih pei and {{were used for the}} serving of tea. They were constructed in different sizes and colors, and were adorned with decorative designs. Paper napkins, or chih pha, accompanied tea cups and were folded into squares. Textual evidence of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> and napkins appears in a description of the possessions of the Yu family, from the city of Hangzhou.|$|E

Products included sets of trading cards from Topps and Baker's bread, <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> from Coca-Cola, beach towels, a souvenir program, shark tooth necklaces, coloring and activity books, and a model kit of Brody's truck. A novelization by Hank Searls, based on an earlier draft of the screenplay by Sackler and Tristan, was released, as well as Ray Loynd's The Jaws 2 Log, {{an account of the}} film's production. Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Rick Marschall and artists Gene Colan and Tom Palmer in Marvel Super Special #6 (also based on the earlier script).|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from <b>paper</b> <b>cups.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{inverted}} <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> of 0. 26 mm thickness {{was subjected}} to deformation under a freely falling steel ball at a velocity of 2. 77 m/sec. The deformed features of the <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> were measured. The dynamic loading event was simulated using piecewise linear plasticity material model in LSDYNA. Deformed shape of the <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> in finite element model matched closely with experimental results with ignorable small discrepancies. The <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> was able to absorb all the kinetic energy of the falling steel ball for the above mentioned falling speed and the ball did not bounce out of the cavity generated by the impact. In LSDYNA a similar size steel cup was also subjected to a freely falling ball with same speed and the energy absorbed was compared to the energy absorbed by the <b>paper</b> <b>cup.</b> It was found that under similar conditions a <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> would undergo a significant progressive failure and absorb all {{the energy of the}} falling object...|$|R

5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in <b>paper</b> <b>cups.</b> Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} in 1936 of the Paper Container Manufacturing Company (later to become Solo) by Leo Hulseman in Chicago was {{the catalyst for}} the future development of the <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> industry. In addition to the <b>Paper</b> <b>Cup</b> Company, {{a number of other}} organisations have been providing disposable consumer products for several years, including the Dickenson Robinson Group, Key Catering Disposables and Benders in the United Kingdom, the Italian manufacturer Seda and the Finland-based company Huhtamaki.|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{telephone}} {{dates back to the}} string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor {{to the development of the}} electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.|$|E
25|$|Each February, Tim Hortons holds a {{marketing}} campaign called Roll Up the Rim to Win. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year, including vehicles, televisions, and store products. Customers {{determine if they}} have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company's distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds. The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons' supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with a new idea to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost {{no more than the}} current one and could enable a promotion, like a contest. Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snackbox of Timbits. In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.|$|E

All were unidentifiable, but one partial torso {{was that}} of a Caucasian woman as indicated by auburn hair on a partial skull, and one partial body was of an Asian child (with glass embedded). There was no luggage recovered. Of the non-human remains that the Japanese recovered were various items including dentures, newspapers, seats, books, eight KAL <b>paper</b> <b>cups,</b> shoes, sandals, and sneakers, a camera case, a [...] "please fasten seat belt" [...] sign, an oxygen mask, a handbag, a bottle of dish washing fluid, several blouses, an identity card belonging to 25-year-old passenger Mary Jane Hendrie of Sault Ste.

500|$|Very {{little of}} the design from Freelance Police was carried over into Save the World; LucasArts still held onto the assets created for use in Freelance Police, and Telltale was wary of using similar design patterns. While Ferguson and Purcell had both been {{involved}} with the canceled LucasArts project, Grossman had not. The team decided to just start from fresh, and pursue a different treatment of the game's subject. Purcell himself wanted to ensure that the game conveyed the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the original comicsâsomething he felt was lacking from the LucasArts renditions of the franchise. Grossman stated that [...] "we wanted {{to get a little bit}} more of that dirt on the streets, and the <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> and people being mean and nasty". This [...] "gritty" [...] feeling also influenced artistic design. For instance, on Purcell's suggestion, the sky was changed from blue to yellow in the street outside Sam and Max's office, instantly making the environment feel [...] "filthy and disgusting".|$|E
500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never {{had to worry about}} work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals that he was an alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek seriesâsomething that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they signed}} McBride, {{who had spent}} the 1934 season playing on a semi-pro team, before the game, the Western Division {{champion}} Bears were still 2Â½â1 favorites. The Giants defeated the previously unbeaten Bears, however, 30â13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy field with temperatures peaking at 25degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and captain Ray Flaherty about the frozen field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers on the frozen field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga and the sneakers proved to be effective. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen {{to get as many}} sneakers as he could get. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started and New York, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10â3 {{at the end of the}} first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan Collegeâwhere he had a key to the equipment and locker roomsâand returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that [...] "nine pairs was all I could get." [...] Players donned the sneakers and the Giants, after allowing the Bears another field goal late in the third period, responded with 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. When they took the lead 17â13 on a touchdown run by Strong, the game had to be stopped because hundreds of fans ran onto the field to celebrate. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the fourth quarter set a single-quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. Fans converged on the field after the game, tearing down one of the goal posts. After the game offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his gratitude, saying [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." [...] Oddly, the team's performance was also aided by the consumption of alcohol. The team's trainer felt that whiskey could warm the players up, and he put some into their <b>paper</b> <b>cups.</b> Strong scored a touchdown on the next play, and the trainer did the same thing on the next drive, which again ended in a touchdown. Fearing drunkenness, water was returned to their cups once the team had the lead,.|$|E

2500|$|At Bash at the Beach, Hall and Nash were {{scheduled}} to team with their mystery partner against Lex Luger, Randy Savage and Sting. At {{the onset of the}} match, Hall and Nash came out without a third man, telling [...] "Mean Gene" [...] Okerlund that he was [...] "in the building," [...] but that they did not need him yet. Shortly into the match, a Stinger Splash resulted in Luger being crushed behind Kevin Nash, and being taken away on a stretcher, reducing the match to The Outsiders vs. Sting and Savage. Hall and Nash took control of the match when Hulk Hogan came to the ring. After standing off with The Outsiders for a moment, he suddenly leg dropped Savage, showing himself to be the Outsiders' mysterious third man. Giving an interview with Okerlund directly after the match, Hogan claimed the reason for the turn was that he was tired of fans that had turned on him. Hogan labeled the new faction [...] "the new world order of wrestling", beginning a feud between wrestlers loyal to WCW and the nWo. The fans in attendance were so outraged at Hogan's betrayal that they pelted the ring with debris, such as <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> and plastic bottles, for the duration of his interview. One fan even jumped the security railing and tried to attack Hogan in the ring, but was swiftly subdued by Hall, Nash, and arena security.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> are {{designed}} for a single use and then disposal.
