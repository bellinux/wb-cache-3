40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a process planning methodology for a rapid injection mold tool manufacturing system that involves additive and subtractive techniques, whereby slabs are sequentially bonded and milled using layered tool paths. Mold tools are grown in a bottom up fashion, {{eliminating the need}} <b>for</b> multi-axis <b>machining</b> operations (beyond three axes) and allowing small features in deep cavities. In this research, a new layer bonding method using friction stir welding of aluminum plates is presented. In this manner, one can create seam-free laminated aluminum injection mold tooling using a unique combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to initially secure the slab, then continuous friction stir welding of layer perimeters that are sequentially machined in a layer wise process. The original research {{is presented as a}} journal article. This research includes three areas of interest that will enable highly automated process planning. The first research area focuses on determining the process plan for applying adhesives on the laminated plates that will be sufficient to resist the forces acting on the plate due to subsequent friction stir spot welding. The use of fixtures and clamps <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> in rapid manufacturing create a potential problem for collision of the tool/spindle and the workpiece setup. Therefore, the process proposed in this thesis uses a combination of industrial adhesives and friction stir spot welding to secure the aluminum <b>plates</b> <b>for</b> <b>machining.</b> The second area focuses on determining the number, location and sequence of friction stir spot welds sufficient to secure the plate prior to continuous friction stir welding. The use of adhesive alone is assumed to be not sufficient to withstand the high forces involved in the friction stir welding process. Therefore, there is need to friction stir spot weld the plates to hold them against the previously formed stack. The location and the number depend on the geometry of that particular layer. The final research area focuses on creating a toolpath planning method for the friction stir welding and CNC machining of each laminated plate. The FSW toolpath is generated based on a predetermined offset distance from the boundary of the polygon representing each cross sectional slice of the mold, while the CNC machining uses a basic waterline toolpath strategy. The impact of this research is that it will provide a completely automated process planning approach for rapid tool manufacturing that is currently not possible using existing additive- or subtractive- only approaches...|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of digital printing technology, production of small numbers of publications had many limitations. Large print jobs were not a problem, but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine. These produced printed pages of inferior quality to a book, cheaply and reasonably fast. By about 1950, electrostatic copiers were available to make paper master <b>plates</b> <b>for</b> offset duplicating <b>machines.</b> From about 1960 copying onto plain paper became possible <b>for</b> photocopy <b>machines</b> to make multiple good-quality copies of a monochrome original. As technology advanced it became possible to store text in digital form—- paper tape, punched cards readable by digital computer, magnetic mass storage, etc.—- and to print on a teletypewriter, line printer or other computer printer, but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable.|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} CMC materials, {{originally developed}} for the thermal protection of reusable spacecrafts, offer a great applicability for extreme lightweight and thin walled structures combining an excellent strength to density ratio with a close to zero thermal expansion behaviour.

This paper deals with principal correlations between the thermal expansion of different C/C-SiC materials as well as their microstructural characterisation. Additionally, two special applications designed, manufactured and tested successfully in collaboration with industrial partners will be described exemplarily. One is a telescope structure for the data link between satellites based on an optical concept.

40|$|The Timesaver belt {{grinding}} machine {{has been selected}} by the Atlas collaboration for deburring the master and spacer plates after die stamping and laser cutting, respectively. However, the question has been raised {{as to whether or}} not the plates are sufficiently clean after going through the Timesaver machine to immediately be glued into a submodule assembly. This would greatly enhance the production of submodules because the task of cleaning individual master and spacer plates is labor intensive and time consuming as well as raises environmental issues with the detergent that is used. In order to investigate the possibility of using the Timesaver process to clean the plates as well as debur them, several plates were run through the machine and their cleanliness inspected before and after. In addition, several glue samples were subjected to the same process, glued, and then pulled apart in an attempt to gauge the cleanliness of the plates. From this series of tests it can be concluded that the wet Timesaver machine can adequately prepare the surface of the master and spacer plates as well as clean the <b>plates</b> <b>for</b> gluing. The <b>machine</b> was able to adequately remove all of the oil and grime from the test plates. Also, from the single test on the dry machine it appears that significant cleaning will be required to adequately clean the plates before gluing in order to remove the remaining grit...|$|R

40|$|The {{fast growing}} {{packaging}} industry in South-East Asia {{has provided a}} great potential {{for the use of}} cylinder copper <b>plating</b> <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> printing. The purpose of this project is to design and develop a prototype of an automated fully immersion cylinder copper plating machine capable of functioning at optimum parameters automatically and thus achive enhanced print quality. The development also includes minimising the set-up process and facilitates maintenance by designing leakage blocks and built-in module respectively. Complexity of the plating parameters needed in the gravure industry could have significant influence on the plating process and quality of end product. In this research work the effect of linear cylinder speed and cathode-anode distance on the copper plating efficiency, deposit structure, and hardness has been investigated. The results showed that maximum plating efficiency is affected by both cylinder linear speed and cathode-anode distance. Within the low range of linear speed covered (40 to 105 m/min), the maximum efficiency is achieved for small cathode-anode distance (2 cm). At high linear speeds (106 to 133 m/min), however, the maximum efficiency was observed to occur at higher cathode-anode distance (4 cm). This increase in efficinecy appears to be triggered by agitation in the electrolyte solution. Metallurgical examination revealed that the maximum plating efficiency is associated with finer structures and higher hardness valu...|$|R

For instance, Shyjith et al. (2008) used crisp TOPSIS to rank maintenance strategies that can improve the availability of ring-spinning components in the textile industry by considering machine indicators and environmental and economic effects. Ilangkumaran and Kumanan (2009) also conducted a similar approach with the integration of the fuzzy concept to increase input data accuracy. The application of crisp TOPSIS can also be found in Thor et al. (2013), who presented a study on the identification of the optimal maintenance strategy <b>for</b> <b>plating</b> <b>machines</b> in electronic circuit production. In this study, the evaluation was performed from different aspects including the safety, reliability, and feasibility of the maintenance policy from an organizational perspective. The TOPSIS had also been applied by Pourjavad et al. (2013) to rank the maintenance strategy in the mining industry. Ding et al. (2014 a) had applied TOPSIS to determine the maintenance strategy that could reduce the failure risk for stripping system in the palm oil industry. While the application of TOPSIS has also been found in Ding et al. (2014 b) where a TOPSIS-based decision-making approach has been presented to determine the optimal maintenance strategy for a press system.|$|R
