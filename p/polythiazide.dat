40|$|Abstract A second-derivative spectroscopic {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} determination of <b>polythiazide</b> and prazosin in tablets was developed. Solutions of these tablets in 0. 2 N methanolic hydrochloric acid {{were analyzed by}} measurement of the amplitudes of the positive peak at 356 nm {{with respect to the}} negative peak at 346 nm for prazosin, and the amplitude of the positive peak at 236 nm with respect to the baseline for <b>polythiazide.</b> Confirmation of the technique was established using HPLC. The use of derivative spectroscopy in this manner provides a specific, rapid and accurate determination of the binary mixture in the tested concentration range of 1 – 10 μg/ml for <b>polythiazide</b> and 1 – 20 μg/ml prazosin.

Methanol solutions of the tables werw analyzed by measurement of the amlitudes of the positive peak at 282 nm {{with respect to the}} negative peat at 270 nm for <b>polythiazide</b> ant apmlitude of the negative peak at 218 nm with respect to the base line for vanillin...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{effectiveness}} ofprazosin hydrochloride combined with poly-thiazide {{for the treatment of}} hypertension was studied in four European countries by ten investigators. One-hundred and seventy-sevenadult male and female patients. 91 % with essential hypertension, were treatedfor an average of 7 months. Reductions from placebo-controlled baseline blood pressure exceeded 15 % over the 8 -week short-term phase of the study with further reductions ofup to 22 % observed at the end ofthe study. Ninety-six per cent of all patients completed therapy with a diastolic blood presssure of 90 mm Hg or less. Most patients were adequately controlled on 2 tablets or less once daily. Each tablet contained 0 · 5 mg prazosin hydrochloride and 0 · 25 mg <b>polythiazide.</b> Long-term toleration was excellent. Side-effects were typical of those expected with antihypertensive medication and nearly all were reported during the first 8 weeks of treatment with no interruption or discontinuation ofdrug. Nearly all patients werefollowed throughout for laboratory changes. There were minimal changes consistent with the therapy and there was no pattern indicative oftoxic potential. It is concluded that the drug combination, Minizide, is effective and well tolerated as initial and long-term therapy in hypertension and that the convenient dosage regimen will lead to enhanced treatment compliance for this chronic condition...|$|E
