A methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer was prepared by precipitation polymerisation using <b>propazine</b> as template and toluene as porogen. After removal of the template by Soxhlet extraction, the optimum loading, washing, and elution conditions for MISPE of the selected triazines were established. The optimised MISPE procedure {{was applied to the}} extraction of the selected triazines in pea, potato, and corn sample extracts and a high degree of clean-up was obtained. However, some remaining interferences, non-specifically and strongly bound to the polymeric matrix, appeared in the chromatogram, preventing quantification of DIA in potatoes and DIA, DEA, and <b>propazine</b> in corn samples. Thus, a new clean-up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer for removal of these interferences prior to the MISPE step was developed. By following the new two-step MISPE procedure, the matrix compounds were almost completely removed, allowing the determination of all the triazines selected at concentration levels below the established maximum residue limits, making the developed procedure suitable for monitoring these analytes in vegetable samples.

40|$|The role of {{chemical}} components of cork in the sorption of several pesticides has been investigated. For this purpose raw cork and three cork extracted fractions (i. e. cork free of aliphatic extractives, cork free of all extractives and cork free of all extractives and suberin) {{were used as}} sorbent of three ionic pesticides (<b>propazine,</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D) and alachlor) and five non-ionic pesticides (chlor-pyrifos, isoproturon, metamitron, methomyl and oxamyl) with a logK(ow) within the range - 0. 47 to 4. 92. The effect of cations on the ionic pesticides, <b>propazine</b> and 2, 4 -D sorption was also analyzed. Results indicated that the highest yields were obtained for chlorpyrifos and alachlor sorption onto raw cork (> 55 %). After removal of aliphatic extractives sorption of all pesticides increased that ranged from 3 % for <b>propazine</b> to 31 % for alachlor. In contrast, removal of phenolic extractives caused a sorption decrease. Low sorption yields were obtained for hydrophobic pesticides such as metamitron, oxamyl and methomyl (< 11 %) by using all cork fractions and extremely low when using raw cork (< 1 %). FTIR analysis was useful to indicate that lignin moieties were the main components involved on the sorption process. Modelling calculations evidenced that pi-stacking interactions with the aromatic groups of lignin {{play a major role}} in determining the adsorption properties of cork toward aromatic pesticides.

40|$|Silica {{particles}} {{have been}} used as supports for the preparation of three different propazine-imprinted polymer formats. First format refers to grafting of thin films of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) using an immobilised iniferter-type initiator (inif-MIP). The other two new formats were obtained by complete filling of the silica pores with the appropriate polymerisation mixture leading to a silica–MIP composite material (c-MIP) followed by the dissolution of the silica matrix resulting in spherical MIP beads (dis-MIP). These techniques offer a mean of fine-tuning the particle morphology of the resulting MIP particles leading to enhanced capacity in chromatographic applications. Porous silica (specific surface area S = 380 m 2 g− 1, particle size ps = 10 μm, pore volume Vp = 1. 083 ml g− 1 and pore diameter dp = 10. 5 nm), methacrylic acid and ethylenglycol dimethacrylate were used for the preparation of the materials. All the MIP formats imprinted with <b>propazine</b> have been characterised by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption and scanning electron microscopy. Further, the materials were assessed as stationary phases in HPLC. Capacity factors, imprinting factors and theoretical plate numbers were calculated for <b>propazine</b> and other related triazines in order to compare the chromatographic properties of the three different stationary phases. For the inif-MIPs the column efficiency depended strongly on the amount of grafted polymer. Thus, only the polymers grafted as thin films of ca. 1. 3 nm average thickness show imprinting effects and the highest column efficiency giving plate numbers (N) of 1600 m− 1 for the imprinted <b>propazine.</b> The performance of the c-MIP stationary phase decreases as result of the complete pore filling after polymerisation and increases again after the removal of the silica matrix due to a better mass transfer in the porous mirror-image resulting polymer. From this study can be concluded that the inif-MIP shows the best efficiency for use as stationary phase in HPLC for the separation of triazinic herbicides.

To assess the concentrations {{of each of these}} species in drinking water and their treatability in conventional water treatment, a comprehensive, full-scale studywas conducted that included frequent monitoring at 33 and 47 water utilities during 2003 and 2004, respectively. Approximately 900 paired raw and treated water samples were analyzed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method with preconcentration using a mixed-mode, solid-phase extraction that allowed quantitation of each species including didealkylatrazine. The results showed that atrazine concentrations were generally well within the 3 microg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) and that simazine and <b>propazine</b> concentrations were generally negligible. Ninety-fifth-percentile values for the ratio of TCT/atrazine were 4. 8 and 4. 7, respectively.

40|$|Following a {{monitoring}} programme of private shallow boreholes {{a total of}} 22 different pesticides were detected in 14 shallow boreholes in the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer of South Yorkshire between January 2002 and November 2003. Of the 294 positive detections made, 34 % were detected {{in excess of the}} prescribed concentration or value (PCV) (drinking water standard) for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in 11 (78 %) of the boreholes, and in 8 (57 %) at concentrations exceeding the PCV on at least one occasion. These findings were complemented by data from deeper boreholes in which concentrations exceeding the PCV were also detected. Pesticide occurrence could be related to landuse; mecoprop and isoproturon were frequently detected at several locations reflecting the arable landuse, dicamba at a golf course, and atrazine, <b>propazine</b> and terbutryn near a railway. Temporal variations have emerged at individual sites and across the study area as the results of extended and frequent monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the Langmuir-Freundlich {{isotherm}} is used {{to model}} the interaction of several triazines (desethylatrazine, desisopropylatrazine, simazine, atrazine, <b>propazine</b> and prometryn) with a propazine-imprinted polymer and to explain the observed cross-reactivity. Different rebinding experiments (each herbicide alone or all together in a mixture) were carried out and the experimental binding isotherms were fitted to the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. The fitting coefficients obtained (total number of binding sites, mean binding affinity and heterogeneity index) allowed {{the description of the}} kind of binding sites present in the imprinted polymer under study. It was concluded that the recognition mechanism was mainly governed by the molecular size although slight differences in the molecular structure may also play an important role. The obtained results suggest that the use of this new methodology can open new pathways for understanding how molecular recognition in imprinted polymers takes place.

40|$|In this study, {{the aim is}} {{to remove}} micropollutants (pesticides) from water {{completely}} while removing {{only a small fraction of}} salts. To achieve the latter, loose commercial nanofiltration (NF) membranes were selected (Desal 51 HL, N 30 F and NF 270). To realize a high removal of organic compounds, combined with a low salt rejection, cascades of NF stages are proposed. Experiments with pesticides (aldrin, atrazine, bentazone, dieldrin, and <b>propazine)</b> and NaCl confirmed that a nearly complete rejection of pesticides is possible, depending on specific properties of the solutes such as molecular size and chemical structure (e. g. hydrophobicity). Salt rejection was highly dependent on the specifications of the membrane and on the ion charge, and ranged from low to high values. Through modeling based on transport equations and mass balances, it was shown that the separation was significantly improved by adopting the principle of an integrated cascade of NF membranes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of atrazine (AT), <b>propazine</b> (PROP), deethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA) and hydroxyatrazine (HAT) was studied with the clay mineral vermiculite saturated with K+ (VTK), {{and with the}} mineral modified by insertion of hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium (HDTMA-VT) in the interlayer of VTK. The crude VTK exhibited negligible interaction with AT, PROP and DEA, moderate interaction with DIA and strong interaction with HAT. For the HDTMA-VT materials, removal percentages from aqueous medium for initial concentrations between 0. 05 and 1. 00 mg L- 1 were 56 to 63 % for AT, 43 to 45 % for DEA, 12 to 19 % for HAT and 77 to 78 % for PROP. Sorption of AT, DEA and PROP onto HDTMA-VT was significantly enhanced in comparison to VTK. Ionic strength and pH had no significant influence on the sorption process. Desorption of all compounds from HDTMA-VT after 24 h of contact time was between 20 and 30 % of the amount initially adsorbed...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the quality of ground water beneath {{irrigated}} cropland was completed for the northern and southern High Plains aquifer. Ground-water samples were collected from 30 water-table monitoring wells in the northern agricultural land-use (NAL) study area in Nebraska in 2004 and 29 water-table monitoring wells in the southern agricultural land-use (SAL) study area in Texas in 2003. The two study areas represented different agricultural and hydrogeologic settings. The primary crops grown in the NAL study area were corn and soybeans, and the primary crop in the SAL study area was cotton. Overall, pesticide and fertilizer application rates were larger in the NAL study area. Also, precipitation and recharge rates were greater in the NAL study area, and depths to water and evapotranspiration rates were greater in the SAL study area. Ground-water quality beneath irrigated cropland was different in the two study areas. Nitrate concentrations were larger and pesticide detections were more frequent in the NAL study area. Nitrate concentrations in NAL samples ranged from 1. 96 to 106 mg/L (milligrams per liter) as nitrogen, with a median concentration of 10. 6 mg/L. Water in 73 percent of NAL samples had at least one pesticide or pesticide degradate detected. Most of the pesticide compounds detected (atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, simazine, and degradates of those pesticides) are applied to corn and soybean fields. Nitrate concentrations in SAL samples ranged from 0. 96 to 21. 6 mg/L, with a median of 4. 12 mg/L. Water in 24 percent of SAL samples had at least one pesticide or pesticide degradate detected. The pesticide compounds detected were deethylatrazine (a degradate of atrazine and <b>propazine),</b> <b>propazine,</b> fluometuron, and tebuthiuron. Most of the pesticides detected are applied to cotton fields. Dissolved-solids concentrations were larger in the SAL area and were positively correlated with both nitrate and chloride concentrations, suggesting a combination of human and natural sources. Dissolved-solids concentrations in NAL samples ranged from 272 to 2, 160 mg/L, with a median of 442 mg/L, and dissolved solids in SAL samples ranged from 416 to 3, 580 mg/L, with a median of 814 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|A direct injection, liquid {{chromatography}} tandemmass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} the chloro-s-triazine herbicides and their degradates in finished drinking water. The target compounds in the method were selected based on their inclusion in a common mechanism group (CMG) because of their ability to induce a similar toxic effect through a common mechanism of toxicity. The target list includes the chloro-s-triazines (atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, and <b>propazine)</b> and their dealkylated degradates (desethylatrazine, desisopropylatrazine, and diaminochlorotriazine). Potential matrix effects are minimized by the use of individual isotopically enriched internal standards. Analyte stability in finished chlorinated drinking water samples is ensured through careful selection of proper dechlorinating and antimicrobial reagents and through buffering sample pH. In the absence of proper dechlorination, the target analytes were found to degrade over a short period of time, even under refrigerated storage conditions. The final method has adequate sensitivity to accurately detect all target analytes at or below 0. 1 µg/L and displays sufficient precision and robustness towarrant publication as EPA Method 536...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} based on {{solid-phase}} extraction combined with liquid chromatography for simultaneous determination of nine triazine herbicides (ametryn, atrazine, cyanazine, prometryn, <b>propazine,</b> simazine, simetryn, terbuthylazine, and terbutryn) in surface water samples {{was developed and}} validated. Under optimized conditions, 50 [*]mL of water sample was pumped through the Oasis HLB cartridge, and triazines were eluted with 3 [*]mL acetone. Finally the extract was concentrated to dryness, reconstituted with 1 [*]mL methanol[*]:[*]water (1 [*]:[*] 1) and injected into the HPLC-DAD system. The stability of the herbicides on the cartridges at − 18 and 4 °C was also evaluated, and the recoveries obtained after three weeks of storage were satisfactory for all compounds. The analytical features of the proposed method were satisfactory: repeatability and intermediate precision were < 10 % and recoveries in spiked river water and seawater samples were higher than 93 % for all compounds studied. Limits of quantification (varied from 0. 46 to 0. 98 [*]µg[*]L− 1) were adequately allowing the determination of these compounds at the levels requested by the 2008 / 105 /EC Directive. Finally, this method {{was applied to the}} analysis of 50 seawater samples from Galicia (northwest Spain) ...|$|E
