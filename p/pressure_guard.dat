40|$|Thyroid hormone {{concentrations}} {{only become}} sufficient {{to maintain a}} euthyroid state through appropriate stimulation by pituitary TSH. In such a dynamic system under constant high <b>pressure,</b> <b>guarding</b> against overstimulation becomes vital. Therefore, several defensive mechanisms protect against accidental overstimulation, such as plasma protein binding, conversion of T 4 into the more active T 3, active transmembrane transport, counter-regulatory activities of reverse T 3 and thyronamines and negative hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback control of TSH. TSH has gained a dominant but misguided role in interpreting thyroid function testing in assuming that its exceptional sensitivity thereby translates into superior diagnostic performance. However, TSH-dependent thyroid disease classification is heavily influenced by statistical analytic techniques such as uni- or multivariate-defined normality. This demands a separation of its conjoint roles as a sensitive screening test and accurate diagnostic tool. Homeostatic equilibria (set points) in healthy subjects are less variable, and do not follow a pattern of random variation, rather indicating signs of early and progressive homeostatic control across the euthyroid range. In the event of imminent thyroid failure with a reduced FT 4 output per unit TSH, conversion efficiency increases {{in order to maintain}} FT 3 stability. In such situations, T 3 stability takes priority over set point maintenance. This suggests a concept of relational stability. These findings have important implications for both TSH reference limits and treatment targets for patients on levothyroxine.

25|$|Opening and {{closure of}} the stomatal pore is {{mediated}} by changes in the turgor pressure of the two <b>guard</b> cells.The turgor <b>pressure</b> of <b>guard</b> cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars {{into and out of}} the guard cells.

The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions and chloride (Cl−) ions. In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.|$|R

40|$|Given that stomatal {{movement}} is ultimately a mechanical process and that stomata are morphologically and mechanically diverse, we explored {{the influence of}} stomatal mechanical diversity on leaf gas exchange and considered some of the constraints. Mechanical measurements were conducted on the guard cells of four different species exhibiting different stomatal morphologies, including three variants on the classical "kidney" form and one "dumb-bell" type; this information, together with gas-exchange measurements, was used to model and compare their respective operational characteristics. Based on evidence from scanning electron microscope images of cryo-sectioned leaves that were sampled under full sun and high humidity and from pressure probe measurements of the stomatal aperture versus guard cell turgor relationship at maximum and zero epidermal turgor, {{it was concluded that}} maximum stomatal apertures (and maximum leaf diffusive conductance) could not be obtained in {{at least one of the}} species (the grass Triticum aestivum) without a substantial reduction in subsidiary cell osmotic (and hence turgor) pressure during stomatal opening to overcome the large mechanical advantage of subsidiary cells. A mechanism for this is proposed, with a corollary being greatly accelerated stomatal opening and closure. Gas-exchange measurements on T. aestivum revealed the capability of very rapid stomatal movements, which may be explained by the unique morphology and mechanics of its dumb-bell-shaped stomata coupled with "see-sawing" of osmotic and turgor <b>pressure</b> between <b>guard</b> and subsidiary cells during stomatal opening or closure.

Contrary to earlier views, it is becoming evident that ROS production {{is not necessarily a}} symptom of cellular dysfunction but it might represent a necessary signal in adjusting the cellular machinery according to the altered conditions. Stomatal movement is controlled by multifaceted signaling network in response to endogenous and environmental signals. Furthermore, the stomatal aperture is regulated by a coordinated action of signaling proteins, ROS-generating enzymes, and downstream executors like transporters, ion pumps, plasma membrane channels, which control the turgor <b>pressure</b> of the <b>guard</b> cell. The earliest hallmarks of stomatal closure are ROS accumulation in the apoplast and chloroplasts and thereafter, there is a successive increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + level which rules the multiple kinases activity that in turn regulates the activity of ROS-generating enzymes and various ion channels. In addition, ROS also regulate the action of multiple proteins directly by oxidative post translational modifications to adjust guard cell signaling. Notwithstanding, an active progress has been made with ROS signaling mechanism but the regulatory action for ROS signaling processes in stomatal movement is still fragmentary.

40|$|Analysis of hepatic hemodynamic {{adjustments}} is made peculiarly difficult by {{the complexity}} of the splanchnic circulation. Blood flow through the liver appears to be controlled by the interactions between four sets of vascular resistances: (a) those imposed between the aorta and the portal vein including the splenic, gastric, mesenteric, and colic arterioles; (b) those between the aorta and the sinusoids, the hepatic arterioles; (c) those be-tween the portal vein and the sinusoids, the portal venules; and (d) those between the sinusoids and the hepatic veins. During the development of cir-rhotic disease of the liver a fifth set of resistances between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava, i. e., the collateral circulation, becomes important in determining blood flow. The portal venous pressure and the sinusoidal pressure are, likewise, resultants of the interaction of these resistances and arterial pressure. A change in any one resist-ance alone will induce various changes in the rate of blood flow through all the others and will affect the pressures in both the portal vein and sinusoids.

40|$|SummaryStomatal {{opening and}} closure depends {{on changes in}} turgor <b>pressure</b> acting within <b>guard</b> cells to alter cell shape [1]. The extent of these shape changes {{is limited by the}} {{mechanical}} properties of the cells, which will be largely dependent on the structure of the cell walls. Although it has long been observed that guard cells are anisotropic due to differential thickening and the orientation of cellulose microfibrils [2], our understanding of the composition of the cell wall that allows them to undergo repeated swelling and deflation remains surprisingly poor. Here, we show that the walls of guard cells are rich in un-esterified pectins. We identify a pectin methylesterase gene, PME 6, which is highly expressed in guard cells and required for stomatal function. pme 6 - 1 mutant guard cells have walls enriched in methyl-esterified pectin and show a decreased dynamic range in response to triggers of stomatal opening/closure, including elevated osmoticum, suggesting that abrogation of stomatal function reflects a mechanical change in the guard cell wall. Altered stomatal function leads to increased conductance and evaporative cooling, as well as decreased plant growth. The growth defect of the pme 6 - 1 mutant is rescued by maintaining the plants in elevated CO 2, substantiating gas exchange analyses, indicating that the mutant stomata can bestow an improved assimilation rate. Restoration of PME 6 rescues guard cell wall pectin methyl-esterification status, stomatal function, and plant growth. Our results establish a link between gene expression in guard cells and their cell wall properties, with a corresponding effect on stomatal function and plant physiology...|$|R

40|$|Stomata are pores on {{the leaf}} surface, which are formed {{by a pair}} of curved, tubular guard cells; an {{increase}} in turgor <b>pressure</b> deforms the <b>guard</b> cells, resulting in the opening of the stomata. Recent studies employed numerical simulations, based on experimental data, to analyze the effects of various structural, chemical, and mechanical features of the guard cells on the stomatal opening characteristics; these studies all support the well-known qualitative observation that the mechanical anisotropy of the guard cells plays a critical role in stomatal opening. Here, we propose a computationally based analytical model that quantitatively establishes the relations between the degree of anisotropy of the guard cell, the bio-composite constituents of the cell wall, and the aperture and area of stomatal opening. The model introduces two non-dimensional key parameters that dominate the guard cell deformations—the inflation driving force and the anisotropy ratio—and it serves as a generic framework that is not limited to specific plant species. The modeling predictions are in line {{with a wide range of}} previous experimental studies, and its analytical formulation sheds new light on the relations between the structure, mechanics, and function of stomata. Moreover, the model provides an analytical tool to back-calculate the elastic characteristics of the matrix that composes the guard cell walls, which, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be probed by direct nano-mechanical experiments; indeed, the estimations of our model are in good agreement with recently published results of independent numerical optimization schemes.

40|$|When {{plant is}} {{subjected}} to drought stress (low water potential caused by drying soil and/or low humidity), stomata are closed mainly {{by the action of}} a phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) which is synthesized in the mesophyll cells or root cells and transported to the stomata. This stomatal closure causes a delay of wilting. Under drought stress,stomatal guard cells are possible to be exposed to low water potential in the substomatal cavity. However, the protective mechanism of guard cells from drought stress is unknown yet. To clarify this mechanism,I examined the effect of low water potential around guard cells on the metabolism in guard cells. In the present experiments, epidermal strips were peeled from Vicia faba L. leaflets and sonicated. The strips were incubated in either the light or dark in 0. 4 M mannitol solution(osmotic stress) to subject guard cells to low water potential. In the first chapter, I examined the effect of osmotic stress on the levels of malate, sucrose, and K^+, which are known to act as osmotica in guard cells during stomatal movement. The levels of both malate and sucrose were increased to 1. 2 - 1. 3 times by osmotic stress. This malate increase was light-dependent, whereas the sucrose increase was light-independent. The level of K^+ in guard cells increased slightly under osmotic stress in the light. On the other hand,ABA treatment decreased all these solute levels in guard cells. These results suggest that osmotic stress affects carbon metabolism in guard cells and this metabolic change is different from that caused by ABA. Radioactivity incorporated from ^ 14 C-glucose into low molecular weight compounds which include malate and sucrose were increased by osmotic stress, while that into high molecular weight compounds such as starch and carbohydrates in cell walls were decreased. This result indicates that accumulation of malate and sucrose by osmotic stress might result from changes in the whole carbon metabolism in guard cells. Osmotic stress resulted in decrease of respiratory activity in guard cells. Since accumulation of sucrose by osmotic stress was lighy-independent,decreased respiratory activity might cause sucrose accumulation under osmotic stress. On the other hand, the accumulation of malate by osmotic stress was light-dependent. Therefore, malate accumulation by osmotic stress might not be caused by decreased respiratory catabolism alone. In the second chapter, I examined whether malate synthesis was activated by osmotic stress or not, which step is affected by osmotic stress, and {{what is the role of}} malate accumulation under osmotic stress. Malate synthesis is catalyzed by NADP- or NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). This pathway is known to be activated by light in guard cells. When epidermal strips were treated with 3, 3 -dichloro- 2 dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl- 2 propenoate (DCDP),a specific inhibitor of PEPC, malate level was decreased in the light. The extent of the decrease was larger under osmotic-stressed condition than under non-stressed condition. Moreover, the amount of ^ 14 CO_ 2 incorporated into malate in guard cells 60 s in the light under stressed condition was twice as large as that under non-stress condition. In the dark, little CO_ 2 was incorporated into malate under both conditions. These results suggest that osmotic stress may enhance the activity of this pathway of malate synthesis which is induced by light. Western blot analysis showed that the level of PEPC proteins in guard cells subjected to osmotic stress in the light was twice as large as the non-stressed control level. From these results, enhanced malate accumulation by osmotic stress might result from increased level of PEPC proteins. Furthermore,inhibition of malate synthesis by treatment with DCDP decreased stomatal aperutre under both stressed and non-stressed conditions, suggesting that malate synthesis plays a role in increasing osmotic <b>pressure</b> in <b>guard</b> cells and preventing excessive water loss from guard cells caused by osmotic stress. In conclusion, light-dependent malate accumulation and light-independent sucrose accumulation were induced by osmotic stress in guard cells. The malate accumulation might be caused by increased level of PEPC proteins by osmotic stress. These metabolic changes may contribute to protection of guard cells from drought stress. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Pelargonium sidoides DC. {{is one of}} many {{medicinal}} plant species that are harvested in the wild. The current trade in these {{medicinal plant}}s has negatively affected their distribution in the wild due to unsustainable harvesting. The demand for medicinal plants is unlikely to decrease, but sustainability of the supply is questionable. This is because commercial exploitation threatens to deplete their populations, resulting in many species being considered vulnerable to extinction and being lost from their natural habitat. Increased demand, which is already too high to be met by sustainable harvesting, and price increases presents potential opportunities for cultivating indigenous medicinal plants at a commercial scale. A need for basic information on how to grow the plants and other related matters necessitates that field trials be conducted, before farmers could be expected to venture into cultivating medicinal plants and this study aimed at developing such information. The specific objectives of the study were to investigate 1) the physiological and morphological, 2) the yield components and 3) chemical composition of P. sidoides in response to soil water and nitrogen levels. The study was conducted under a rainshelter as a randomized complete block design with three irrigation levels, four nitrogen levels and three replicates. The irrigation treatments were 30 % allowable depletion level (ADL) (well watered treatment), 50 % ADL (moderately stressed treatment) and 70 % ADL (severely stressed treatment), while the nitrogen levels were 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg · N · ha- 1. Dried root samples were analyzed for the presence of two standard compounds, scopoletin and esculin, using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and for metabolite profiling using the nuclear magnetic resonance technique (NMR). Nitrogen and water level had no significant interaction effect on all measured parameters. Water stress significantly reduced stomatal conductance, while nitrogen had no significant effect on it. The well watered control had a significantly higher leaf area index, plant height and leaf area compared to the water stressed treatments. Nitrogen had a significant effect on the number of leaves, where 100 kg · N · ha- 1 had a significantly higher number of leaves compared to other nitrogen treatments. The well watered treatment again had a significantly higher total biomass, fresh and dry root yield; and nitrogen use efficiency compared to the water stressed treatments. The water use efficiency was significantly decreased in the well watered treatment. Water stress significantly increased nitrogen content and chlorophyll content of P. sidoides plants and leaves, respectively. Nitrogen levels of 50 and 100 kg · N · ha- 1 resulted in a significantly higher total biomass compared to the control. TLC analysis showed the presence of the two standard compounds in all treatment samples analyzed. The orthogonal partial least square discriminatory analysis (OPLS-DA), which was performed on the NMR spectral data, showed separation between the irrigation treatments, resulting in two clusters representing the well watered treatment and the water stressed treatments. Asparagine, arginine, sucrose, xylose, glucose and citric acid were found to be the compounds associated with the separation. There was no separation of the samples regarding the nitrogen treatments which is indicative of the small effect of nitrogen on the metabolite content of the treatments. The results from this study showed a relationship between physiological, morphological and yield response as well as chemical composition of P. sidoides. The observed stomatal closure under water stress conditions, due to low turgor <b>pressure</b> in the <b>guard</b> cells, had a significant negative effect on leaf area, leaf area index, total biomass and root yield. Also the increases in total biomass and root yield under well watered conditions could be attributed to the increased primary metabolite content, under such conditions. The recommendation from the study is that P. sidoides plants should be grown under well watered conditions {{for a year or two}} to increase growth and root yield. Thereafter plants can be exposed to water stress in the second season, which is expected to increase the concentration of important secondary metabolites.
