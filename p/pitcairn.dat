5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at <b>Pitcairn</b> Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} <b>Pitcairn</b> settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the <b>Pitcairn</b> Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands' tiny {{population}} (currently 50 to 60 people) {{would appear}} to prevent this British overseas territory from competing.|$|E
5|$|The British regulars, around 700 {{infantry}}, {{were drawn}} from 11 of Gage's 13 occupying infantry regiments. Major <b>Pitcairn</b> commanded ten elite light infantry companies, and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 grenadier companies, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith.|$|E
5|$|At about 3 am, Colonel Smith sent Major <b>Pitcairn</b> {{ahead with}} six {{companies}} of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord. At about 4 am Smith made the wise but belated {{decision to send}} a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Bligh reached England in April 1790, whereupon the Admiralty {{despatched}} HMS Pandora {{to apprehend}} the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board Pandora, which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on <b>Pitcairn</b> Island. After turning back toward England, Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, {{with the loss of}} 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty. The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled; 4 were acquitted, 3 were pardoned, and 3 were hanged.|$|E
5|$|Christian's group {{remained}} undiscovered on <b>Pitcairn</b> until 1808, {{by which}} time only one mutineer, John Adams, remained alive. Almost all his fellow mutineers (including Christian), and their male Polynesian companions, had killed each other over time in varying conflicts. The only survivors of these conflicts were Adams and Ned Young, who had subsequently died of asthma in 1800. No action was taken against Adams.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on <b>Pitcairn</b> into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Developed during 1939 from an earlier, {{unsuccessful}} design, the PL-1, the Platt-LePage Model PL-3 was {{the winner}} of a 1940 design competition, held {{under the terms of}} the Dorsey-Logan Act, for the supply of a helicopter design to the United States Army Air Corps. Platt-LePage's submission was judged by the Army to be superior to its competitors, which included a helicopter submitted by Vought-Sikorsky, and autogyros developed by Kellett and <b>Pitcairn.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Harrisville, NY812 travels north {{through an}} area of <b>Pitcairn</b> and Fowler. This area {{contains}} numerous small lakes and rivers and is predominantly rural in nature. Within Fowler, the route serves the hamlet of Balmat (located on {{the eastern edge of}} Sylvia Lake) before intersecting NY58 in the hamlet of Fowler. Here, NY812 joins NY58 northeast along the southern bank of the now-unified Oswegatchie River to the village of Gouverneur, located in the town of the same name, where NY812 leaves NY58 but joins U.S. Route11 (US11) {{at the heart of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Natural Bridge and Harrisville, NY3 intersects NY812. NY812 turns east onto NY3, {{following}} NY3 northeast into St. Lawrence County before splitting to {{the northwest}} between Harrisville and <b>Pitcairn.</b> Shortly after departing NY812, NY3 enters Adirondack Park. The route follows a largely eastwest routing from its entry point to Tupper Lake, where it merges with NY30. Near Upper Saranac Lake, NY30 heads north toward Malone as NY3 continues northeast through nearby Saranac Lake toward Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties {{at the hands of}} a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of <b>Pitcairn</b> and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major <b>Pitcairn</b> arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the Bounty mutineers. Edwards named it in honour of Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, under whom he had served earlier in his career. HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached <b>Pitcairn</b> Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E
5|$|When NY812 {{was first}} assigned, it was locally {{maintained}} from NY126 in Croghan to NY3 in Diana and from NY3 in <b>Pitcairn</b> to NY58 in Fowler. The {{section of the}} route between NY126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village of Croghan; however, {{the rest of the}} two locally maintained sections were maintained by Lewis and St. Lawrence counties. Most of the Lewis County-owned section was co-designated as CR11; however, the short piece between the Croghan village line and Belfort Road was part of CR10. In St. Lawrence County, NY812 was overlaid on the existing CR73 from NY3 to Stone Road, CR99 between Stone Road and Balmat, and CR56 from Balmat to Fowler. The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of NY812 between Croghan and Diana on April1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Lewis County that transferred NY194 to the county. Ownership of NY812 from <b>Pitcairn</b> to Fowler was transferred to the state on September1, 1982, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and St. Lawrence County.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Canton Bulldogs {{season was}} the franchise's sixteenth and its {{first in the}} American Professional Football Association (APFA), which became the National Football League two years later. Jim Thorpe, the APFA's president, was Canton's coach and a back who played on the team. The Bulldogs entered the season coming off a 9–0–1 {{performance}} as Ohio League champions in 1919. The team opened {{the season with a}} 48–0 victory over the <b>Pitcairn</b> Quakers, and finished with a 7–4–2 record, taking eighth place in the 14-team APFA. A then-record crowd of 17,000 fans watched Canton's week 12 game against Union AA of Phoenixville.|$|E
5|$|The Bulldogs {{opened the}} 1920 season against the <b>Pitcairn</b> Quakers. The team {{got out to}} a quick lead and was never in danger, scoring 34 {{points in the first}} quarter as back Joe Guyon rushed for three {{touchdown}}s, tackle Pete Henry caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from back Tex Grigg, and back Johnny Hendren returned an interception for a touchdown. The Bulldogs were only forced to punt once in the game, and did not attempt to score {{in the second and third}} quarters because of the large lead. In the fourth quarter, however, end Bunny Corcoran caught a 35-yard touchdown pass from Guyon, and back Ike Martin ran for a one-yard touchdown. The final score was 48–0, and Guyon was the offensive star.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} is {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to India, {{including}} Madagascar and nearby islands, the Red Sea, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China to northern Australia and New Zealand, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This species has also been reported from numerous Pacific islands, including American Samoa, the Chagos Archipelago, Easter Island, Christmas Island, the Cook Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, the Marianas Islands, Palau, the <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Hawaiian Islands, and Vanuatu.|$|E
5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during {{the next day it}} started to gradually weaken. Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17, before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of the}} <b>Pitcairn</b> islands.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{what is now}} NY812 between Lowville and Croghan became the southern leg of NY26A, an alternate route of NY26 between Lowville and Carthage. Farther north, the portion of modern NY812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg became part of NY87, a route extending from Harrisville to Ogdensburg via Edwards, Russell and De Kalb. From Harrisville to Fowler, NY87 followed a parallel alignment to modern NY812 along Hands Flats, Stone, and <b>Pitcairn</b> roads, and CR24. Between Fowler and De Kalb, NY87 used what is now NY58, CR24, and CR17 before following current NY812 north to Ogdensburg. The portion of NY87 between De Kalb Junction and De Kalb was concurrent with US11. Both US11 and NY87 were shifted south onto a new highway , at which time the former routing of US11 between the new road and De Kalb became part of NY87.|$|E
5|$|Lizards that {{inhabit the}} island include the white-bellied skink (Emoia cyanura), photographed by E. H. Quayle during an {{expedition}} in 1922, and a lizard {{reported in the}} journal of an expedition in 1935 by James Chapin. The species of the latter was uncertain, but it was thought to be a gecko, possibly either an oceanic gecko (Gehyra oceanica) or a mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris). The 1991–92 <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands Scientific Expedition found specimens of both the mourning gecko and the white-bellied skink. The only mammal known to inhabit Ducie is the Polynesian rat; In 1997 there was a successful project to eradicate these by Brian Bell (WMIL) and Graham Wragg (S/V Te Manu), to aid the conservation of bird species threatened by the rat population. Green sea turtles feed on Ducie, but have not been seen to breed there.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Croghan, NY812 {{traverses}} the Beaver River {{just north}} of the village line. The route and the river continue northward along parallel routings for a brief distance before the two separate near the hamlet of High Falls. While the river curves east toward the hamlet, NY812 presses northward through the rural hamlets of Indian River and Dutton Corners into the town of Diana, where NY812 starts to parallel the west branch of the Oswegatchie River as both continue north through the town. At Tylers Corners, NY812 intersects NY3 and joins the route eastward into Harrisville, where the conjoined routes cross over the Oswegatchie. Northeast of Harrisville in extreme southwestern St. Lawrence County, NY812 breaks from NY3 and heads northwest through <b>Pitcairn</b> (crossing over the Oswegatchie once more in the process).|$|E
5|$|The Whitetip reef shark is {{distributed}} widely {{across the entire}} Indo-Pacific region. It was once thought to have formerly existed in the Atlantic Ocean, based on fossil teeth found in North Carolina dating to the Miocene epoch. However, more recent research indicates that the teeth belonged to a mackerel shark, and that this species has never colonized the Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to the Red Sea and the Indian subcontinent, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Comoros, the Aldabra Group, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western and central Pacific, it occurs from off southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to northern Australia, and is also found around numerous islands in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as far as Hawaii {{to the north and}} the <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands to the southeast. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from Costa Rica to Panama, and off the Galápagos Islands.|$|E
5|$|There are 31 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. The UNESCO list {{contains}} one designated site in both England and Scotland (the Frontiers of the Roman Empire) plus seventeen {{exclusively in}} England, five in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland, {{and one in}} each of the overseas territories of Bermuda, Gibraltar, the <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands, and Saint Helena. The first sites in the UK to be inscribed on the World Heritage List were Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast; Durham Castle and Cathedral; Ironbridge Gorge; Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey; Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites; and the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd in 1986. The latest site to be inscribed was the Lake District in England in July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at <b>Pitcairn</b> Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression {{prevented}} Bär from {{gaining a}} civil pilot license. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr and {{was assigned to the}} 3. Kompanie of Kraftfahrabteilung 4 (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, Bär attended the flight school at Oldenburg and was then transferred to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at Ludwigslust where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. Bär then attended the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./Jagdgeschwader 135, the core of the future Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader (Staffelkapitän) Douglas <b>Pitcairn</b> noticed Bär's flying talents and tried to convince Bär to become a fighter pilot. Initially Bär refused, but after he illegally conducted some aerobatics in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pitcairn</b> was {{the brother}} of Pennsylvania {{railroad}} magnate Robert <b>Pitcairn</b> and consul-general Hugh <b>Pitcairn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Harold Frederick <b>Pitcairn</b> (1897–1960). Harold, {{a lifelong}} {{aviation}} enthusiast, started <b>Pitcairn</b> Aviation, an {{air mail service}} that ultimately grew into Eastern Airlines. He founded the <b>Pitcairn</b> Aircraft Company, which designed and built under license pioneering airmail aircraft and autogyros. He {{played a key role}} in promoting rotary wing flight leading to development of the helicopter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pitcairn</b> {{began his}} {{professional}} life {{at the age of}} 14, working as an office boy for the general superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona. He soon learned telegraphy, and through that became friends with Andrew Carnegie. <b>Pitcairn</b> rapidly worked his way up through the railroad industry; first as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, and next as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Philadelphia Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On February 22, 1861, during his tenure at the latter, <b>Pitcairn</b> {{was in charge of the}} train which carried President-elect Abraham Lincoln from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, en route to the inauguration in Washington, DC. Later, when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania before the Battle of Antietam, <b>Pitcairn</b> and his brother Robert <b>Pitcairn</b> were dispatched by Colonel Thomas A. Scott, then Assistant Secretary of War, to Chambersburg, to head the train service for the government. <b>Pitcairn</b> next served as Assistant Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and followed this with a stint as the Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. Finally, in 1869, he was appointed General Manager of the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway Company.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pitcairn</b> {{was born}} on January 10, 1841 in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland to parents John <b>Pitcairn,</b> Sr. (1803 – 1884), a machinist, and Agnes McEwan (1803 - 1891), a housekeeper. He was one of six {{children}} resulting from the marriage, and also had two older half-siblings from his father's first marriage.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{industrialist}} Harold Frederick <b>Pitcairn,</b> {{on learning}} of the successful flights of the autogyro, visited De la Cierva in Spain. In 1928, he visited him again, in England, after taking a C.8 L.IV test flight piloted by Arthur H.C.A. Rawson. Being particularly impressed with the autogyro's safe vertical descent capability, <b>Pitcairn</b> purchased a C.8 L.IV with a Wright Whirlwind engine. Arriving in the United States on 11 December 1928 accompanied by Rawson, this autogyro was redesignated C.8W. Subsequently, production of autogyros was licensed {{to a number of}} manufacturers, including the <b>Pitcairn</b> Autogiro Company in the U.S. and Focke-Wulf of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The ship is {{the subject}} of a 2011 $1.80 <b>Pitcairn</b> Islands stamp.|$|E
25|$|Alexander <b>Pitcairn</b> (1750 – 17 November 1814) was an English cricketer {{who played}} for Hampshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club from 1791 to 1792. He also played for the Gentlemen of Kent, Gentlemen of England and Thomas Assheton Smith II's XI. <b>Pitcairn,</b> a batsman, played nine first class matches in his career, scoring 143 runs at 8.93.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{forming a}} {{partnership}} with J. J. Vandergrift of Pittsburgh and George V. Forman of Buffalo, <b>Pitcairn</b> resigned from his position of general manager to focus exclusively on the oil business. During this period, <b>Pitcairn</b> built the Imperial Refinery at Oil City, Pennsylvania, and was heavily involved with the production, refining, and pipeline transportation of oil. With Vandergrift, he built and controlled the first natural gas pipeline for manufacturing purposes, and had a controlling stake in the Natural Gas Company, Ltd., founded {{in the summer of}} 1875, and later to become the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. Through these and other successful investments in energy, mining, and banking, <b>Pitcairn</b> substantially expanded his wealth.|$|E
25|$|He later {{sponsored}} the National Anti-Vaccination Conference, which, held in Philadelphia on October, 1908, {{led to the}} creation of the Anti-Vaccination League of America. When the League was organized later that month, <b>Pitcairn</b> was chosen to be its first president. In May, 1910, an article by <b>Pitcairn</b> entitled '' was published in the Ladies Home Journal, a periodical with a readership of several million. On December 1, 1911, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor John K. Tener to the Pennsylvania State Vaccination Commission, which in accordance with the law mandating it, was to include as members two anti-vaccinationists as well as two pro-vaccinationists. <b>Pitcairn</b> subsequently authored a detailed report strongly opposing the Commission's pro-vaccination conclusions.|$|E
