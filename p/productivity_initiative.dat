40|$|This article {{contrasts}} {{trends in}} addressing work productivity in severe mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia and in affective disorders. Citations from searches of 8 reference databases were reviewed. The {{negative impact of}} SMI on employment is indisputable, as {{is the fact that}} people with these disorders could be employed more frequently than is the case. For those with SMI, work rehabilitation treatment models have been developed, but their implementation in disease management programs has lagged behind those of other diseases. In contrast to the situation with SMI, treatment outcomes in affective and anxiety disorders have been defined primarily in terms of symptom relief and interpersonal functioning. Attention to work productivity has emerged more recently as employers have become important stakeholders in healthcare decision making. Since most patients with affective disorders are already in the work force, some work <b>productivity</b> <b>initiatives</b> and outcomes developed for SMI may not be appropriate for patients with affective disorders. Attention to work productivity has not been systematically incorporated into treatment planning for affective disorders, and specific work-related psychiatric interventions are not yet available.

40|$|As {{productivity}} is {{accepted as a}} prime determinant of macro economic growth and as the macro economy constitutes an aggregation of micro economic components, the link between productivity and growth at the micro economic (or firm) level warrants further investigation. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate this relationship between productivity and micro economic growth and to simultaneously address the specific concerns of both management and labour with regard to <b>productivity</b> <b>initiatives.</b> After presenting a conceptual framework for productivity accounting and introducing the strategic implications of productivity related information, the paper progresses onto an empirical study into the relationship between productivity and firm specific growth. This empirical study uses various correlation models applied to a sample of companies to statistically test the relationship between productivity and various measures of firm specific growth. Of particular relevance to this study is the use of appropriate growth measures based on the firms' strategic objectives and on factors directly related to the specific issues being addressed, as opposed to a single growth measure applied indiscriminately across the entire sample of companies. After investigating the relationship between productivity and micro economic growth (as appropriately defined), the empirical study concludes that the concerns cited by both management and labour as reasons for their respective aversions to <b>productivity</b> <b>initiatives</b> are unfounded The empirical study also offers preliminary evidence to support the use of the price recovery term as an indication of strategic objective.

Information and management tools exist that will assist managers in improving conditions, but {{what is needed is}} a framework for integrating the available models and information. Steps in developing such a framework include: establishing goals consistent across scales, assessing current conditions and risks, developing management options, describing outcomes of options, selecting an option, establishing priorities for action, implementing those priority activities, and monitoring and evaluating the results of actions. Research projects undertaken by the Forest Health and <b>Productivity</b> <b>Initiative</b> of the Pacific Northwest Research Station include collaboration with managers to develop options for managing insect, disease, and fire disturbances in order to improve ecosystem integrity, to integrate biophysical and socioeconomic considerations, to identify linkages across scales, and to fill significant knowledge gaps at the mid or broad scale.

40|$|In {{search of}} higher {{productivity}} of work more {{attention should be}} paid to organization of work, which in our country is still very neglected. Its improvement is the cheapest {{and at the same}} time efficient way of attaining the growth of productivity. Nowadays, work should be organized so as to stimulate active and enterprising behaviours, to make it possible to utilize growing skills of employees and to encourage their cooperation and strive to success. The above requirements are to a considerable degree met by team forms of organization of work, used in many countries to achieve higher productivity and quality of work and quality of life at a workplace. Team forms of organization of work strengthen ties between people and create better conditions of their cooperation, based on the strive of individuals to achieve a comon aim and on their integration with the aims and activity of their enterprise. The countries which use the above method, especially capitalistic countries, treat it as an important source of growth of <b>productivity,</b> <b>initiative</b> and invention of employees and the source of their satisfaction from work. Considerable experience as well as significant economic and humanistic effects result from the use of that method in the USSR. In Poland, its application is in the stage of experiments; thus our experience is very limited and our results have little diagnostic value. Organizing team work requires that certain conditions be met. In particular, it is necessary to determine the size and composition of a team, to determine the scope and evaluation of its work, to work out just methods of distribution of remuneration, to verify the system of norms applicable in an enterprise, to organize the cost evaluation system, to define the rules of cooperation, and to improve the supply system. A failure to meet such conditions would distort the idea of team work and would increase the employees' reluctance to implement it.

A setback in achieving this {{is a lack of}} commitment and participation in <b>productivity</b> <b>initiatives</b> at shop floor level in South Africa and companies are faced with competitive challenges of promoting innovativeness relating to productivity improvement amongst employees. It has increasingly been recognized that by introducing a carefully crafted incentive scheme, {{it may be possible to}} induce workers to work both harder and smarter and use existing technologies in new and better ways that enhance their productivity. The purpose of the study is to evaluate to what extend gainsharing can be a solution to the predicament. The empirical data used during the study was based on questionnaires that were administered amongst managers of Eskort Ltd. The research established that gainsharing would induce employees to effectively participate in problem solving or <b>productivity</b> improvement <b>initiatives</b> in the company. The majority of participants feel that gainsharing will benefit the company to deliver on client requirements; help enhance teamwork; create a feeling of ownership; share a portion of saved-cost for productivity improvement purposes; stimulate organization learning; improve communication between management and employees; stimulate employees to make suggestions on ways to improve productivity; and increase profit and reduce costs. The study clearly illustrates that money can be the primary drive for motivation to certain employees within the company.

Data was collected from on farm experiment that involved mono cropping crop rotation and intercropping and application of organic inputs. Survey was used to collect data on farmers costs of production yields and commodity prices from a sample of 140 households in Yatta Kenya. Both plot and survey data showed that significantly greater revenues were attained with the application of the AEI practices. Using legumes in intercrop system with application of farmyard manure had the highest profit while crop rotation without application of organic input had the least. At least 28 percent of farmers that adopt all components of the AEI technique attained significantly higher profits than farmers without any organic inputs. The study concludes AEI is a profitable soil fertility management technique. Thus policy should recognize and promote its uptake...|$|R
