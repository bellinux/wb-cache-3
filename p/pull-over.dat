During the inquiry, when asked about the sweater, Ranucci denied being its owner. In his book, Perrault took on board Ranucci's final defence, arguing that a concussion he allegedly suffered {{as a result of the}} accident, right at the bottom of the crime scene, caused Ranucci to become victim to manipulation and impersonation by the [...] "real murderer". In this theory, the man is supposed to have carried the unconscious Ranucci, drove his car to the mushroom bed where he then hid his red sweater.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis thesis work is {{performed}} {{to study and}} understand the pipeline global response {{as a result of}} trawl gears <b>pull-over</b> loads triggering lateral buckling on high temperature/high pressure subsea pipeline. The external interference from trawl gears <b>pull-over</b> loads may create substantial imperfection or out-of-straightness on the pipeline to trigger lateral buckling. The <b>pull-over</b> loads also may induce excessive bending moments and strains in the buckle region. To be able to understand the global response of the pipeline under <b>pull-over</b> loading condition, a finite element analysis is carried out based on DNV OS F 101 [1], DNV RP F 110 [2] and DNV RP F 111 [1]. The analysis is carried out using general finite element analysis software ANSYS v 13. Nonlinear-transient analysis is used to incorporate the non-linear effects, such as the nonlinearities of pipeline material, and the response of a structure under the action of <b>pull-over</b> time-dependent loads. The finite element analysis covers two period of duration i. e. during <b>pull-over</b> loads duration and after <b>pull-over</b> loads duration. The analysis during <b>pull-over</b> loads duration deals with the pipeline global response as a result of trawl gears <b>pull-over</b> loads. The pipeline is subjected to substantial horizontal and vertical <b>pull-over</b> forces from the trawl gears. The <b>pull-over</b> forces are applied based on force-time history as recommended in DNV RP F 111 [3]. This thesis work also study the pipeline post buckling condition. After <b>pull-over</b> loads duration, the pipeline global response may be different. The analysis is carried out for additional 5 seconds from the end of <b>pull-over</b> loads duration. In this period, the <b>pull-over</b> loads are no longer applied. The pipeline may expand further more caused by temperature and pressure loads on pipeline. There are four (4) types of trawl gear considered in the analysis i. e. polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear, industrial v-board, beam trawl and clump weight. All the trawl gears data are taken from DNV RP F 111 [3]. The thesis work calculates the <b>pull-over</b> loads and durations from all type of trawl gears. In the finite element analysis, only the <b>pull-over</b> loads from polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear are used as this is considered to adequately represent the cases. The finite element analysis of trawl gear <b>pull-over</b> shows the trawl gears <b>pull-over</b> loads induces lateral buckling on pipeline. The pipeline deform laterally at the <b>pull-over</b> loads location. High bending moments and strain occur at the apex of the buckle. The DNV displacement condition code check shows that the integrity of the pipeline is not satisfy the safety level hence the pipeline cannot withstand the trawl gears <b>pull-over</b> loads. The analysis with variation of operating temperature and pressure should be carried out as further works. The further works shall also take into account a full comparison of lateral and axial soil friction combination.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{in this thesis}} {{was to investigate the}} effect of oblique trawl board crossings, increased trawl board added mass due to seabed proximity and the effect of a more rectangular trawl board geometry. In addition a new hydrodynamic load model which handles the seabed proximity and forward speed in a more consistent way was examined. All simulations in this thesis are performed by means of the computer software SIMLA. A brief description of methods applied in SIMLA and nonlinear finite element analysis is therefore included. The thesis contains also a chapter which describes trawling concepts and trawl boards used in Norwegian waters. Design loads from trawl gears on subsea pipelines are nowadays based on recommendations from the DNV-RPF 111 code. Simulation models with a 4500 kg polyvalent trawl board were established to verify the DNV recommendations for free spans of height 0 m and 1 m. The simulations demonstrated that increasing trawl board added mass due to seabed proximity did not have any influence on neither <b>pull-over</b> loading nor pipeline response. The effect of a rectangular trawl board geometry was most pronounced for a span height of 0 m because the duration increased by 0. 5 s and the horizontal <b>pull-over</b> force was kept constant throughout the <b>pull-over.</b> A slighty larger <b>pull-over</b> loading compared to the polyvalent board was observed for a span height of 1 m. Oblique trawl board crossings were examined for 6 different hit angles. The major finding was that a perpendicular crossing did not predict the largest <b>pull-over</b> load. On a general basis the simulations for a span height of 1 m underpredicted maximum <b>pull-over</b> force, duration and pipeline displacement compared to the DNV-RP-F 111 recommendations. The 0 m span height simulations indicate that DNV predicts a different shape of the load time history and is slightly nonconservative in terms of maximum <b>pull-over</b> load. The new hydrodynamic load model which includes the effect of forward speed and seabed proximity was used to simulate a perpendicular trawl board crossing. Here the span height of 0 m indicated that the DNV-RP-F 111 code is nonconservative in terms of the <b>pull-over</b> load. The simulation for a span height of 1 m was however in very good agreement with the DNV-RP-F 111 code in terms of duration and horizontal <b>pull-over</b> load. Therefore it is recommended that future simulations are based on the new hydrodynamic load model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Subsea {{pipelines}} {{are likely}} to be exposed to fishing activity, which may results in trawl gear interacting with a pipeline. The interaction is classified into impact, <b>pull-over</b> and a special case called hooking. The trawl load is considered to be an important design load in pipeline design. In the recent developments of the subsea pipelines, the pipe-in-pipe (PIP) system is a solution for high-pressure/high-temperature requirements. Previous research and findings mainly focus on trawl gear interaction with a single pipe wall pipeline. There is limited research on trawl gear-PIP interaction. The main objective of this thesis work is to simulate and investigate the impact and <b>pull-over</b> responses of a pipe-in-pipe system during the interference with an otter trawl board. The numerical study were carried out based on nonlinear finite element (FE) method by means of the computer software SIMLA. Based on the previous models for the single pipe wall pipe, modifications on the models were made to account for PIP. An advanced impact model was enabled to study the impact response of PIP. Later, a detailed clump weight pullover model was modified and studied by using the new contact element (cont 153) in SIMLA. Finally, a detailed trawl board <b>pull-over</b> model (with simplified geometry) was modified with the cont 153 element to study the PIP response under <b>pull-over</b> loads. More details are described as follows. Firstly, a study was carried out to investigate the impact response of a single pipe wall pipe and a PIP system. The impact model was established according to the Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F 111 (RP) by using an advanced impact calculation method. Various pipeline parameters like pipe wall thickness, content density, concrete coating, specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), different trawl gears, and position of centralisers for PIP were considered. The purpose is to check how these parameters influence the impact response. For <b>pull-over</b> analysis, to gain more understanding of the cont 153 element, the clump weight model from Maalø’s work was tested. As a result of this study, a contact stiffness with good contact behaviour was obtained and then used in further study. It is also found that the ii friction coefficient has important influence on the results. The new contact element was then used in a trawl board model with the stiffness defined in the clump weight case. The warp line tension results are compared with previous model test results. The comparisons show that for lower span heights (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m), good agreements were achieved, but noticeable deviations were found for higher span heights (5. 0 m). Finally, the detailed trawl board model was used to investigate the <b>pull-over</b> responses (displacement, bending moment, strain, etc.) of a PIP at low span height (up to 1. 0 m). The <b>pull-over</b> responses from the detailed model were compared with those from RP load. The main finding is that the responses increases as the span height increases, and the responses from the detailed model are in general lower than the RP case. This finding indicates the possibility to further optimise PIP design in the view point of trawl board <b>pull-over</b> loads at low span heights...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{integrity}} of production pipelines with small diameter is analyzed considering large lateral displacements due to interaction loads from trawl <b>pull-over.</b> The offshore standard provided by Det Norske Veritas, DNV-OS-F 101, dictates the design practice and allows limited {{utilization of the}} cross section due to the load controlled condition criterion. Thick walled pipelines with D/t ratio less than 20 can sustain large plastic strains prior to onset of local buckling. In addition, introduction of membrane forces is assumed to carry an increasing part of the <b>pull-over</b> load for increasing lateral displacements. Use of a strain based criterion is therefore desired. Typical global response of a 12 -inch production pipeline subjected to trawl <b>pull-over</b> is obtained by using pipe elements in non-linear Finite Element analyses {{in accordance with the}} recommended practice DNV-RPF 111. Parametric studies regarding friction between pipe and sea bed, operational conditions i. e. internal pressure and temperature, and material model are performed. Local response of the cross section due to acombined loading of bending moment and internal pressure is investigated using a shell model. Results from the global analyses of the pipeline indicate that typical structural response is dominated by a combination of plastic bending and membrane forces. This is based on observations where the cross sectionwas partly penetrated by plasticity and where the growth in membrane forces increased due to increasingdisplacement. The cross section with D/t ratio of 15 was observed to develop a full plastic mechanism prior tolocal buckling in the local analyses. Maximum moment capacity occurred at minimum 5 % tensile strain andeven larger compressive strain. This is over five times higher than the typical strain values obtained from theglobal analyses. Based on these results it is suggested that use of a strain based criterion should be takeninto consideration regarding design of pipelines subjected to trawl <b>pull-over.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{development}} in bottom trawling {{is the use}} of twin trawl equipment, where two trawl nets are towed side by side from a single vessel. This increases the catch rate and efficiently of the trawler. Governed by cost and catch optimization, the use of twin trawl systems are expected to become more popular in the future. Using two trawl nets will, in addition to trawl doors on each side, require a heavy clump weight in the middle to prevent the trawl nets lifting from the seabed. The largest clump weights can have a mass up to 9000 kg and can cause substantial load towed across subsea pipelines, and may in many cases be the governing design load with respect to external loads in pipeline design. The main objective in this thesis work was to simulate and investigate <b>pull-over</b> forces from clump weights on free spanning pipelines. All simulations were carried out in the computer software SIMLA. Six different small scale tests were simulated in order to verify the finite element model, a very good agreement was obtained. Design loads from trawl gear are generally implemented according to DNV-RP-F 111. The calculation methods provided in this recommended practice are based on the same small scale tests which was made available to this thesis work for verification purposes. The validity range of DNV-RP-F 111 reflects the range of the small scale tests i. e. only valid for rigid pipelines. The effect of increasing pipeline flexibility was investigated. Simulations were carried out for span heights 0. 25 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 75 m for a 12 ” pipeline. Two different pipeline models was applied, a 25 m rigid pipeline model with spring representing the lateral pipeline stiffness, and a 1000 m pipeline model including realistic soil resistance. The major finding was that <b>pull-over</b> forces decrease for increasing pipeline flexibility. Compared to DNV-RP-F 111 the obtained <b>pull-over</b> loads was found considerably lower, both in magnitude and duration. To avoid over-conservatism it is thus recommended that a design method accounting for pipeline flexibility should be developed and used in future pipeline designs. The effect of warp angle was simulated varying the warp line length from 2. 5 to 3. 5 times the water depth. The horizontal <b>pull-over</b> force was found to increase for increasing warp line length. Regarding clump weight design and towing configuration, simulations have shown that a forward clump weight center of gravity will reduce the <b>pull-over</b> loads. Applying a lower warp line attachment point resulted in a more uniform sliding motion of the clump weight during interference and <b>pull-over</b> loads was almost complete reduced to a case of initial impact. It is thus suggested that future clump weight design should reflect this to reduce interference loads on both trawl gear and subsea pipelines. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{formulate}} and apply new computational strategies for two contact-governed problems where existing finite element software suffer from poor efficiency and lack of robustness. The first problem is concerned with trawl board <b>pull-over</b> interaction of subsea pipelines while the second deals with reeling analysis of history-dependent flexible pipes. Previous numerical models for trawl-pipe interaction based on simplified geometry modeling has struggled with contact-related convergence problems. A contact element with a continuous description of the trawl board contact geometry and the pipe geometry was therefore developed. The assumption of a rigid contact geometry for the trawl board {{and the use of}} line-line and line-point contact kinematics resulted in good numerical efficiency properties. The ability to predict the <b>pull-over</b> responses depends heavily on the modeling of the trawl board hydrodynamic loads. A fairly advanced six degree of freedom load model with precomputed hydrodynamic coefficients was therefore established. An extensive simulation work was carried out to validate the trawl-pipe computational strategy and to identify sensitive model parameters. Regarding the former, the proposed numerical model was demonstrated to predict <b>pull-over</b> load impulses within a 10 % margin of model test measurements and was thus concluded to be capable of describing the relevant effects of the <b>pull-over.</b> The sensitivity study revealed that the interaction behavior was greatly influenced by the board-pipe friction coefficient, the tension level in the wire between board and trawl net, the towing line drag properties and the direction of over-trawling. Due to the sensitivity of the input parameters, it was concluded that a proper validation against experimental tests is necessary for future work of similar kind. Further studies should aim to quantify the degree of non-conservatism present for nonperpendicular crossings and attempt to improve current design load recommendations by including more model parameters. Reeling operations with history-dependent material behavior and extensive contact interactions along the material transport route are often not feasible to simulate with conventional finite element software. This relates to contact-related convergence problems and the need for long meshes with small and equal-sized elements giving poor numerical efficiency. These issues were successfully solved by developing a Lagrangian-Eulerian beam formulation that enabled for a virtually fixed mesh in space. The proposed formulation was subjected to various benchmark tests where it was demonstrated to provide similar accuracy as the conventional Lagrangian method. In recent years, subsea contractors have experienced torsional failures in spoolbasevessel load-out operations of flexible pipes. An idealized finite element model was therefore established to gain insight into such operations and to identify the mechanisms responsible for the generated torque. Torsional failures were identified for three different mechanisms and strategies to avoid them were proposed. A comparison study against a physical load-out operation should be conducted in future work to quantify the ability to predict the torque and to reveal possible model deficiencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} determine the effectiveness of orthogonal variants of teaching 5 th- 7 th graders physical exercises. Materials and methods. The participants in the research were boys of the 5 th grade (n =  32), 6 th grade (n =  40), 7 th grade (n =  52). To achieve the tasks set, the research used the following methods: analysis of scientific and methodological literature; pedagogical testing, pedagogical observation, timing of educational tasks; pedagogical experiment, medical and biological research methods; methods of mathematical statistics, methods of mathematical experiment planning. In order to achieve the objective set, the research has studied the effect of different variants of the educational process structure, namely: the number of repetitions (х 1) and rest intervals (х 2) when learning the technique of performing physical exercises. The research has conducted a complete factor experiment of type 22. According to the experiment plan, the 5 th- 7 th graders were divided into training groups. In total, there were 12 experimental groups organized. Research results. The analysis of the regression equations shows that the teaching of physical exercises to the 5 th- 7 th-grade boys is mostly influenced by rest intervals between repetitions (х 2). The number of repetitions (х 1) has somewhat less influence. The interaction of these factors is insignificant when teaching physical exercises and becomes much more influential only when teaching a switch leg <b>pull-over</b> exercise (х 1 х 2). Conclusions. To increase the effectiveness of teaching 5 th- 7 th graders physical exercises, it is necessary to shorten rest intervals between repetition to 60 s and {{to reduce the number of}} repetitions to six. When teaching boys the switch leg <b>pull-over</b> exercise, rest intervals should be increased to 120 s and the number of repetitions — to twelve...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that upper-body {{strength}} and power are associated with work economy or efficiency in various types of locomotion. However, isolated upper-body work has not yet been investigated, and the mechanisms related to these relationships have not been studied in detail. Therefore, the present study investigated gross efficiency (GE) during isolated upper-body poling, and the influence of technique, maximal strength and power on GE. Eleven male elite cross-country skiers performed three stages of 4 -min submaximal poling at low, moderate and high intensity (submaximal 1, submaximal 2 and submaximal 3), and an 8 -second maximal sprint using a modified poling ergometer. GE was calculated by external workrate divided by metabolic rate in submaximal stages. Poling forces were measured with a force cell, and poling displacement and velocity were measured using a motion capture system. During the submaximal tests, power per stroke (PPS) was calculated as total work produced per stroke, cycle rate (CR) as the reciprocal of the time used per cycle and poling length (PL) as the displacement of the arms during the poling movement. During the 8 -sec maximal poling test, specific power was measured as the product of force and velocity averaged over the period of 8 -s. Mean rate of force development (RFD mean) and rate of force development peak (RFD peak) was measured as delta force divided by delta time (dF/dT). Furthermore 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) pull-down and <b>pull-over</b> was measured in a pull-down apparatus. There was a linear relationship between metabolic rate and workrate, and an positive effect of workrate on GE. Specific power showed low non-significant correlations with GE, but a significant correlation with workrate in submaximal 3 (r = 0. 63, p = 0. 04). Furthermore, PPS during submaximal poling correlated significantly with all workrates, and GE on the submaximal 3 (all P < 0. 05). 1 RM pull-down and <b>pull-over</b> did not correlate significantly with gross efficiency in submaximal poling, but correlated significantly with workrate in submaximal 3. In conclusion, it seems like upper-body poling shows linear metabolic workrate relationships, and that most of the differences in GE can be explained by workrate differences. Furthermore, a high power per stroke seems important to obtain high workrates and high gross efficiency, whereas maximal strength and sprint power are related to the conversion of forces into power per stroke.
