5|$|Cup duties {{were the}} main {{priority}} in March as United <b>played</b> <b>only</b> two league fixtures: away to Newcastle and at home to Everton.

5|$|The Senators {{struggled}} {{late in the}} 2007–08 season, leading {{general manager}} Bryan Murray to make changes to the team. Both Emery and McGrattan were sent from Ottawa in separate transactions. McGrattan, a pending free agent, {{was traded to the}} Phoenix Coyotes on June 25, 2008, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. The Coyotes subsequently signed him to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. However, he <b>played</b> <b>only</b> three games with Phoenix before he voluntarily entered the league's substance abuse program. McGrattan's struggles with alcohol abuse reached its lowest point and he spent over two months at an Arizona rehab centre as he worked toward changing his life. He returned to the Coyotes late in the season but <b>played</b> <b>only</b> two additional games before he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.|$|E

5|$|Boyd <b>played</b> <b>only</b> {{one more}} {{match for the}} club, {{two weeks after the}} Cup Final. Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a hard pitch in the San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia. Following a {{favourable}} specialist's report during the close season, Boyd took part in pre-season training, but his back still troubled him. On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated at his own request.|$|E

5|$|Crawford {{established}} {{a reputation as}} an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played Test cricket for England before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1907–08. He <b>played</b> <b>only</b> 12 matches for England, although critics believed {{he had a great}} future in the sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class games.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity <b>played</b> <b>only</b> one of {{the three}} Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–74 season, {{the team}} was {{hampered}} {{by the loss of}} West, who <b>played</b> <b>only</b> 31 games before his legs gave out. Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge. Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.|$|E

5|$|Gill {{played in}} almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the {{following}} October, but lost his place soon afterwards through injury. Though he did then receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare one back, which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he <b>played</b> <b>only</b> one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, {{it became clear that}} his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|HMS Cambrian was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during World War I. She was the name ship of her sub-class of four ships. Assigned to the Grand Fleet, the ship <b>played</b> <b>only</b> a small role during the war. Cambrian was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets during the 1920s and was sent to support British interests in Turkey during the Chanak Crisis of 1922–23. The ship was placed in reserve in late 1929. She was sold for scrap in 1934.|$|E

He made his second debut as a late substitute in the Championship match at home to Reading on 13 December, with Birmingham already 6–1 ahead. He <b>played</b> <b>only</b> infrequently– nine substitute appearances in the league and two FA Cup matches– and the club confirmed he would be released when his contract expired.|$|E
