5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration <b>Programme</b> <b>Manager,</b> working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E

On 14 March of that year the Friars reached an agreement with the Ministry of Social Services, housed at Palazzo Ferreria, to receive financial social services from the Government of Malta and other sources. An agreement was reached under notary Eugene Montanaro with the condition that the home works hand in hand with Aġenzija Appoġġ. Soon after the agreement, the house was restructured and upgraded with modern facilities at a financial cost of Lm 50,000, of which Lm 31,148 were allocated from Appoġġ with finance paid by the government of Malta. The home was then still run by the Friars, but also assisted by <b>Programme</b> <b>Manager</b> Anna Maria Laurenti, who received her studies in London. The part of the property used for religious services was kept and restructured, and was this time open as Blessed Nazju Falzon Chapel. Falzon is a beatified Maltese and this house-church is the first and only place of worship dedicated to him. The chapel within the property has its own entrance and was inaugurated to the public on 30 May 2001 by provincial Bernard Bartolo.|$|E

National and provincial tuberculosis <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> {{play an important role}} in effective implementation of the Stop TB strategy. Design A qualitative interview study was conducted with 10 national and provincial tuberculosis <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> to {{understand how}} they perceive and engage with the Stop TB strategy, its strengths, weaknesses and their experience in its implementation. Managers were selected purposively; 10 managers were interviewed (six national staff and four from provincial level). Participants National and provincial tuberculosis <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> in Pakistan. Managers were selected purposively; 10 managers were interviewed (six national staff and four from provincial level). Setting National and provincial tuberculosis programmes in Pakistan Main outcome measures 1. Knowledge and perceptions of national and provincial tuberculosis <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> about the Stop TB strategy 2. Progress in implementing the strategy in Pakistan 3. Significant success factors 4. Significant implementation challenges 5. Lessons learnt to scale up successful implementation. Results The managers reported that most progress had been made in extending DOTS, health systems strengthening, public -private mixed interventions, MDR-TB care and TB/HIV care. The four factors that contributed significantly to progress were the availability of DOTS services, the public-private partnership approach, comprehensive guidance for TB control and government and donor commitment to TB control. Conclusion This study identified three main challenges as perceived by national and provincial tuberculosis <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> in terms of implementing the Stop TB strategy: 1. Inadequate political commitment, 2. Issue pertaining to prioritisation of certain components in the TB strategy over others due to external influences and 3. Limitations in the overall health system. To improve the tuberculosis control programme in the country political commitment needs to be enhanced and public -private partnerships increased. This can be done through government prioritisation of TB control at both national and provincial levels; donor-funded components should not receive undue attention; and partnerships with the private health sector, health institutions not yet covered by DOTS services, non-governmental organisations and patient coalitions should be increased...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Since 1994, {{a number}} of higher {{education}} policy documents detailing the scope for transformation and restructuring of education have been published. Diminishing financial support from government, coupled with greater public demand for improved services necessitate technikons to become innovative higher education institutions. The marketing concept, the underlying platform of market orientation, was developed for commercial organisations. It is proposed that this marketing philosophy could be extended to technikons. Technikons {{can learn from the}} private sector about improving their service delivery by using market orientation principles and concepts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to theoretically and empirically examine and evaluate the applicability of market orientation to business studies degree programmes at technikons in KwaZulu-Natal. The study examined the opinions and perceptions of <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> and graduates of business studies degrees from technikons in KwaZulu-Natal. The literature evaluated the developments in market orientation theory and practice, described the types and other relevant issues pertaining to higher education institutions in South Africa, and the intluence of the marketing environment on technikons in KwaZulu-Natal. The research was conducted using a stratified random sample for graduates, and due to the relatively small size of sampling frame for programmemanagers, it was decided to send out questionnaires to all <b>programme</b> <b>managers.</b> The data for this study has been obtained by the analysis of the responses to questionnaires that were administered among graduates and <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> of business studies degrees from technikons in KwaZulu-Natal. Questionnaires were grouped into four constructs of market orientation, viz. intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination, response design and response implementation for both categories of respondents. The analysis of the results revealed important findings. The perceptions of <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> and graduates on levels of market orientation for business studies degrees are reported. The diierence in the constructs between males and females for both <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> and graduates are analysed. The discrepancies between <b>programme</b> <b>managers</b> and graduates expectations of service quahty are reported. Specific recommendations have been made which can improve the levels of market orientation at technikons for business studies degrees. Doctora...|$|R

2500|$|This {{investigation}} identifies {{a definition}} of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers {{use a combination of}} creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C+++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a <b>programme</b> <b>manager,</b> as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.|$|E
