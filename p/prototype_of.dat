5|$|A <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the {{automatic}} strobe unit {{was produced in}} October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{his initial}} <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the late 1860s, Roper {{built a new}} and revised version in 1884, based on the then {{state of the art}} safety bicycle frame type. Sylvester Roper died of an {{apparent}} heart attack while riding this machine in 1896.|$|E

5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
5|$|Arp 220 {{hosts the}} first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy, {{and has been}} studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used {{as a guide for}} interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.|$|E
5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In June 1941, he {{was again}} {{transferred}} to Quantico, {{to command the}} 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, which was redesignated the 1st Separate Battalion in January 1942. The training exercises which he conducted in the succeeding months with Navy high speed transports (APDs) led to {{the organization of the}} 1st Marine Raider Battalion in early 1942. This unit was the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> every Marine Raider battalion formed throughout the war. He was promoted to colonel on May 21, 1942.|$|E
5|$|It succeeded the GameCube, {{and early}} models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first {{spoke of the}} console at the E3 2004 press conference and later {{unveiled}} it at E3 2005. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata revealed a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the controller at the September 2005 Tokyo Game Show. At E3 2006, the console won {{the first of several}} awards. By December 8, 2006, it had completed its launch in the four key markets.|$|E

5|$|SMRT first {{attempted}} {{to install a}} passenger information system SMRTime on trains using LCD displays in 1999; these have since been removed. In November 2006 the doors of three cars (carriage number 3006, 1006 and 2006) were installed with a dynamic, in-train system displaying station information for testing; these are similar to ones used by Hong Kong's MTR. An initial <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> STARIS based upon the existing Automatic Transit Info System was developed in-house; this was removed {{before the end of}} the year without entering service.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were {{developed}} in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about 746kW (1,000hp). Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose. The first <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E
