25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a <b>podiatrist,</b> a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E

40|$|Background Rheumatic {{conditions}} {{can have a}} significant impact on the feet and requires effective management. Podiatric involvement in the management of rheumatic conditions has previously been found to be inadequate in a hospital-setting and no study has examined current trends across New Zealand. The aim was to evaluate the perceived barriers of New Zealand <b>podiatrists</b> in the management of rheumatic conditions. Methods A cross-sectional observational design using a web-based survey. The self-administered survey, comprising of thirteen questions, was made available to <b>podiatrists</b> currently practicing in New Zealand. Results Fifty-six <b>podiatrists</b> responded and the results demonstrated poor integration of <b>podiatrists</b> into multidisciplinary teams caring for patients with arthritic conditions in New Zealand. Dedicated clinical sessions were seldom offered (16 %) and few <b>podiatrists</b> reported being part of an established multidisciplinary team (16 %). A poor uptake of clinical guidelines was reported (27 %) with limited use of patient reported outcome measures (39 %). The majority of <b>podiatrists</b> expressed an interest in professional development for the podiatric management of arthritic conditions (95 %). All surveyed <b>podiatrists</b> (100 %) agreed that there should be nationally developed clinical guidelines for foot care relating to arthritis. Conclusions The results suggest that there are barriers in the involvement of <b>podiatrists</b> in the management of people with rheumatic conditions in New Zealand. Future studies may provide an in-depth exploration into these findings to identify and provide solutions to overcome potential barriers...|$|R

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, she got a lucky break {{because of}} {{a visit to a}} <b>podiatrist.</b> The doctor had an office at Broadway and 42nd Street, in what had been a fashionable Knickerbocker Hotel suite in the early 1900s, the New York {{residence}} of opera singer Enrico Caruso (1873–1921). So the doctor would often entertain visitors who were there to see the Caruso memorabilia. While she herself was at the office, November met another patient who had contacts in the music industry, and she sang an impromptu audition. The patient was impressed, and put her in touch with one of his contacts, manager Gus Schirmer (of the Schirmer Music publishing family), who was looking for [...] "pretty sopranos" [...] for his summer musicals. Schirmer introduced her to Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, who became her mentor, and through Schirmer, November also auditioned for other producers such as Lawrence Kasha. She obtained work as a performer in the 1963 summer musical season in Dallas, Texas, but despite many auditions, could never land a job in Broadway theatre (according to November, this was because she never had the exact look that a particular show was looking for). [...] Then Schirmer got her a job singing at an industrial musical for Ford Motor Company, where she met many other successful musicians, singers, and composers such as Ray Charles. He began incorporating her into sessions with the Ray Charles Singers, a group of performers with a rotating membership that would sing in close harmonies, often on productions with singer and television personality Perry Como, or as backup singers for other recordings. This launched November's career as a studio singer, as she worked on a contract basis for many different productions. From 1962 to 1967 November would rotate in and out as part of the Ray Charles Singers, sometimes seen on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall variety program. She can also be heard as a backup singer on some Frank Sinatra recordings, such as the soprano voice in the background of the 1967 song, [...] "The World We Knew".|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{significant}} expansion in the body of knowledge on the effects of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the foot and the management of these problems.

In order to inform non-specialist <b>podiatrists</b> of the appropriate interventions for these foot problems, management guidelines have been developed and disseminated by a group of specialist <b>podiatrists.</b> The aim of this survey was to investigate the use of these guidelines in clinical practice. Method: Following ethical approval an online questionnaire survey was carried out. The questions were formulated from a focus group and comprised fixed response and open response questions.

2500|$|The {{most common}} digit to become ingrown {{is the big}} toe, but {{ingrowth}} can occur on any nail. Ingrown nails can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow of a [...] "toe box", will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves {{the leading edge of}} the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a <b>podiatrist.</b> Ingrown toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} burnout is {{receiving}} increasing research attention.

No statistical difference was found between the overall mean burnout scores for Maltese <b>podiatrists</b> employed in the public health service and those working in private practice (p = 0. 067, mean = 48. 89 vs 31. 84). Although the level of burnout did not differ between <b>podiatrists</b> working within the two different settings, <b>podiatrists</b> working in the public sector in general reported higher mean scores for each subscale of the CBI than <b>podiatrists</b> working in private practice.
