50|$|On August 18, 2011, the CRTC {{issued a}} {{decision}} that allowed CBC's mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analogue to remain on-air until August 31, 2012. When the CRTC made this announcement, the CBC communicated that it planned on requesting an extension to remain broadcasting in analog past the August 31, 2012 deadline. Although the CRTC allowed the CBC the extension to remain in analogue, the corporation's full <b>power</b> <b>transmitters</b> occupying channels 52 to 69 were still required to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low <b>power</b> <b>transmitters.</b> In some cases, CBC has opted reduce the <b>power</b> of existing <b>transmitters</b> to low <b>power</b> <b>transmitters,</b> which will result in signal loss for some viewers.|$|R

2500|$|The campus {{radio station}} was WMHD-FM 90.7 FM, [...] "The Monkey."

The station was operated entirely by student volunteers, and all disc jockeys choose their own format and playlists. In August 2014, the station was sold to Indiana State University.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ionosphere}} is a {{layer of}} partially ionized gases high above {{the majority of the}} Earth's atmosphere; these gases are ionized by cosmic rays originating on the sun. [...] When radio waves travel into this zone, which commences about 80 kilometers above the earth, they experience diffraction {{in a manner similar to}} the visible light phenomenon described above. In this case some of the electromagnetic energy is bent in a large arc, such that it can return to the Earth's surface at a very distant point (on the order of hundreds of kilometers from the broadcast source. [...] More remarkably some of this radio wave energy bounces off the Earth's surface and reaches the ionosphere for a second time, at a distance even farther away than the first time. [...] Consequently, a high powered transmitter can effectively broadcast over 1000 kilometers by using multiple [...] "skips" [...] off of the ionosphere. [...] And, at times of favorable atmospheric conditions good [...] "skip" [...] occurs, then even a low <b>power</b> <b>transmitter</b> can be heard halfway around th world. [...] This often occurs for [...] "novice" [...] radio amateurs [...] "hams" [...] who are limited by law to transmitters with no more than 65 watts. [...] The Kon-Tiki expedition communicated regularly with a 6 watt transmitter from the middle of the Pacific. For more details see the [...] "communications" [...] part of the [...] "Kon-Tiki expedition" [...] entry in Wikipedia.|$|E
