40|$|Stenodiplosis sorghicola (Coquilett) ] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of grain sorghum in Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas (Harris 1976, Sharma 1993). The larvae of sorghum midge feed on the developing ovary resulting in the production of chaffy spikelets. The damaged <b>panicles</b> present a <b>blasted</b> appearance. Midge damaged spikelets have a pupal case attached to the glumes or have a small exit hole of the midge parasite on the upper glume. Females lay 30 – 100 eggs singly in the spikelets at flowering during the morning hours, and die by the afternoon. Eggs hatch in 1 – 4 days. The larvae suck the contents of developing ovaries and complete development in 7 – 12 days. Larvae pupate inside the glumes, and the pupal period lasts for 3 – 8 days. Adults live for 2 – 48 h. Maximum midge abundance occurs during September-October. A small proportion of the larvae enter diapause in the spikelets in each generation, which may last as long as 3 to 4 years. It is difficult to control sorghum midge with conventional insecticides, as the larvae remain hidden inside the spikelets. Therefore, it is important to develop midge-resistant cultivars to minimize the extent of losses due to this pest (Sharma 1993). Substantial progress has been made in identification and utilization of resistance to sorghum midge (Sharma et al. 1993). The accession...|$|R

Host resistance {{is the most}} economical and effective means of combating this disease as finger millet is predominantly grown by resource-poor and marginal farmers. At the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), we evaluated a finger millet mini-core collection of 80 germplasm accessions (about 1 % of the total germplasm collection representing major trait variability) for blast resistance both {{in the field and}} greenhouse. Field evaluation was done using a refined screening technique that included new improved rating scales for leaf, neck and finger infection. Sixty six of the 80 accessions showed combined resistance to leaf, neck and finger blast in two seasons (2009 and 2010) of field screening. A highly significant and positive correlation was found between neck and finger blast ratings (r[*]=[*] 0. 92), whereas small but significant correlations were found between leaf blast and neck blast (r[*]=[*] 0. 25) and between leaf blast and finger blast (r[*]=[*] 0. 30).

30|$|To {{evaluate}} broad-spectrum resistance under realistic agronomic setting, it {{is important}} to have mutants without severe pleiotropic effects. The Bsdr 1 mutation renders the plant shorter with fewer tillers, but not severely abnormal as is common with many gain-of-resistance mutants in Arabidopsis (Shirano et al. 2002; Vogel and Somerville 2000). The minor pleiotropic effect makes this mutant a good candidate for more detailed phenotypic characterization. We were able to grow G 978 to maturity under field conditions to determine that the Bsdr 1 mutation conferred resistance to <b>panicle</b> <b>blast.</b> This result helps clarify the uncertainty of whether genes controlling leaf blast resistance are effective against <b>panicle</b> <b>blast.</b> Under our experimental conditions, resistance to leaf and neck blast was expressed in the field, indicating that resistance in different tissue types can be conferred by the same genetic mechanism.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Statistical {{analyses}} {{were used to}} develop predictive models of rice blast and to relate the favorability of environment to disease incidence and severity on different rice cultivars at five sites in Asia. The WINDOW PANE program was used to search for weather factors highly correlated with blast. Stepwise and r-square linear regression procedures were then applied to generate the predictive models at each site. Models developed at Icheon, South Korea included relative humidity and rainfall factors {{as the most important}} predictors of disease. Temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and relative humidity factors were components of models at Cavinti and the IRRI blast nursery in the Philippines. Rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation factors were important at Gunung Medan and Sitiung, Indonesia. Model validation was done to verify accuracy of models for predictions. Model predictions were also used to determine the effects on blast of sowing time, nitrogen amount, and increase in temperature. Limitations of the models are discussed. Path coefficient analysis was used to identify direct and indirect influences exerted by weather factors on blast. The largest direct influence on disease was exerted by humidity factors at Icheon; temperature, rainfall, and wind speed factors at Cavinti; temperature and humidity factors at IRRI; rainfall factors at Gunung Medan; and temperature factors at Sitiung. Although path coefficient values (Py) were estimated from the decomposition of correlation coefficients, factors that had a high correlation with disease parameters did not always give high Py. Multivariate analysis was used {{to determine the effects of}} sowing times on proneness of tropical rice to blast. Cluster analysis of 24 hypothetical sowing months at Cavinti, the IRRI blast nursery, and Sitiung sites revealed three blast proneness groups. Principal component analysis showed that IR 50 cultivar would be susceptible at Cavinti at any time of the year. Sowing C 22 cultivar at Cavinti in Group I and III months would make it prone to <b>panicle</b> and leaf <b>blast,</b> respectively. At the IRRI blast nursery, leaf and panicle infections on IR 50 would be probable only in Group I and II months.

40|$|International audienceCropping {{system is}} an {{essential}} aspect {{to take into account}} to manage blast disease (caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae). In addition to the selection of resistant cultivars, studies report opportunities to limit blast incidence by managing mineral amendment (N, Si, P, etc.), cultivar mixtures or other cropping system adaptations. In Madagascar, rice is the staple crop and food. Farmers traditionally grow irrigated or rainfed lowland rice wherever possible. In the mid- 1980 s, CIRAD and FOFIFA launched a research program for the highlands to extend upland rice growing areas in high elevation areas of the tropics. This program was consolidated with research on cropping practices that ensure the sustainability of upland rice based cropping systems in this poor and fragile environment. New varieties where obtained, adapted for rainfed cropping up to 1800 m altitude (Dzido et al., 2004). However, farmers had to face attacks of blast disease. Due to the small genetic basis of these varieties, the fungus quickly overcame resistant or tolerant lines selected by breeders. The ways of management of blast disease are very limited in a country like Madagascar where efficient solutions are often not suitable for farmers. Observations of blast epidemics in different regions made us consider the soil as a key factor for rice susceptibility. In a first experiment, we measured the potential of our very susceptible varieties to tolerate blast when cropped in different soil conditions. During two years, we transported volcanic soil from a very fertile area close to the experimentation site and where blast pressure is much lower. We observed a decrease of blast symptoms on rice cropped on that soil compared to the soil of the experimental site, both on leaves and panicles. That decrease was bound to a significant yield increase, demonstrating the importance of plant nutrition on blast incidence. Such results confirm those obtained in 1981 by Seguy et al. Our aim was then to develop cropping systems that could influence blast incidence through an improvement of soil functions. Direct seeded mulch based (DSMB) cropping systems were first used in Madagascar to limit erosion in upland areas. During 4 years, we compared blast epidemics between a traditional cropping system with ploughing each year and a DSMB cropping system, on a midsusceptible variety specific of the highlands conditions. Two fertilisation levels were also tested in these systems: zebu manure only and manure plus additional mineral fertiliser. A significant difference between the two systems was observed, both at leaf and <b>panicle</b> stage. <b>Blast</b> incidence was reduced in DSMB cropping system and, on the contrary to the traditional cropping system, the mineral fertilisation had no effect on blast in DSMB. N fertilisation is {{known for a long time}} as an essential factor in blast management. The fact that DSMB cropping system reduced the effect of N-fertilisation made us consider N as the determinant factor of the interaction between cropping system and blast incidence. The determinants of this interaction must then be explained to enable new and durable cropping systems to be developed to manage blast epidemics, in addition to cultivar improvement. This is the objectives of the starting project GARP (ANR-Systerra) which is conducted in Bolivia, Brazil, France, and Madagascar. Its aim is to quantify the interactions between cropping system, N-nutrition and blast resistance in upland rice. Hypotheses and preliminary results of the project will be presented...|$|R

For <b>panicle</b> <b>blast,</b> Carajás and Progresso, exhibited lower disease severities {{than the rest of the}} cultivars in the first two years. The grain yields during three years ranged from 83 kg/ha for IAC 201 to 3, 617 kg/ha for Rio Paraguai, and the variation was explained by blast severity, in the panicles, as the correlations were negative. The races IB- 9, IB- 41, IB- 13 and IC- 27 of Pyricularia grisea obtained from 13 cultivars showed differential interaction. These results permitted to conclude that the degree of resistance of some of the cultivars was inadequate and other measures of disease control are necessary...|$|E

30|$|Kanto 209 (K 209) {{cultivar}} {{is one of}} the cultivars harboring Pb 1; {{however, the}} resistance of the cultivar is weak in comparison with other Pb 1 cultivars. In the K 209 cultivar of rice, the expression of WRKY 45 is lower than that of Koshihikari Aichi SBL (KASBL). The lower expression of the gene might be due to the genotype of the cultivar. To identify the mechanism of this rice blast resistance, we crossed the K 209 and KASBL cultivars. Genomic DNA of their F 3 progeny was subjected to SNP-based Golden Gate assay and we found at least four quantitative trail loci (QTL) to the panicle rice blast resistance. Among the four QTLs, we focused on QTL 7, which was located on chromosome 7 and showed Pb 1 -dependent defense against <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> in field tests, and performed a map-based cloning.|$|E

Over one decade broad- and narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to simulate Landsat ETM+ with in situ hyperspectral reflectance. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to obtain the front two principal components (PCs). Probabilistic neural network (PNN) was employed to classify the lodged and normal rice with VIs and PCs as the input vectors. PCs had 100 % of overall accuracy and 1 of Kappa coefficient for the training dataset. While PCs had the greatest average overall accuracy (97. 8 %) and Kappa coefficient (0. 955) for the two testing datasets than VIs consisting of broad- and narrow-bands. The results indicated that hyperspectral remote sensing with PCA and artificial neural networks could potentially be applied to discriminate lodged crops from normal ones at regional and large spatial scales...|$|E
30|$|Pb 1 {{is known}} as a durable blast-resistance gene {{consisting}} of a single dominant locus. Introduction of Pb 1 gene into rice plants by marker selection breeding has been actively carried out. As a result, there are several Pb 1 cultivars to <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> resistance of rice in Japan. Among them, K 209 and its progeny cultivar Hoshijirushi have been found to exhibit weak resistance to rice <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> despite harboring Pb 1. The loss of Pb 1 -mediated resistance over time has generated a negative impact for rice breeders for a long time. To this end, we attempted to identify the mechanism of the loss of Pb 1 -mediated blast resistance of Pb 1 in K 209. Traditionally, a functional gene region is introduced into a genomic fragment, so the gene can have a large additive effect in breeding. However, interactions with the genes in the background have been known to cause differential effects with respect to rice bacterial blight resistance (Sun et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2007; Iyer-Pascuzzi et al. 2008). In this study, we attempted to solve the conundrum of the absence of resistance to rice blast despite the presence of the resistance gene Pb 1 in the K 209 line. Our studies revealed the exact locus in the gene responsible for rice blast resistance, underscoring the importance of this research in blast resistance breeding. Genetic analysis of KASBL and K 209 revealed that the regions Chr 8, Chr 9, Chr 7, and Chr 11 were involved in rice blast resistance in at least four rice genomes (Fig. 4). Among them, three QTLs (Chr 9, Chr 7 and Chr 11) negatively affected the resistance despite the presence of Pb 1. Chr 8, on the other hand, had a positive influence on signal transduction, so it is expected that these QTLs will specifically change Pb 1 -mediated resistance single handedly or in combination with others (Fig. 4). This paves the way for creating a line in future containing just the positively acting QTL and excluding the negatively affecting QTLs {{in order to make a}} more effective Pb 1 -mediated resistance. Therefore, this result is important in developing highly persistent blast resistance disease varieties by selection of markers.|$|E

30|$|The {{resistance}} {{mechanism of}} Pb 1 {{is attributed to}} its interaction with WRKY 45 (Inoue et al. 2013), which {{plays a crucial role}} in the salicylic acid (SA) pathway in rice immunity (Shimono et al. 2007). WRKY 45 is regulated by a ubiquitin-proteasome system in the rice nucleus (Matsushita et al. 2012). The Pb 1 coiled-coil domain interacts with the nuclear-localized WRKY 45 (Inoue et al. 2013), resulting in a Pb 1 -WKRY 45 complex is a weaker target than WRKY 45 for protein degradation. WRKY 45 overexpressed transgenic rice plants have strong resistance not only to the leaf rice blast but also to the <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> (SHIMONO et al. 2011). The genes in the downstream pathway of WRKY 45, including OsNAC 4, OsHSF 1, OsOPR 4 (Nakayama et al. 2013), and diterpenoid phytoalexin (DP), a bHLH transcription factor (Yamamura et al. 2015), play a crucial role in disease resistance. Cytokinins (CKs) play a role in mediating the signal of Pyricularia oryzae infection to trigger the induction of DP biosynthetic genes in benzothiadiazole- (BTH) primed plants (AKAGI et al. 2014).|$|E

Foram realizados dois experimentos no campo, um no plantio direto (PD) e outro no plantio convencional (PC), nos anos agrícolas 1998 / 1999 e 1999 / 2000. Os tratamentos, num total de 16, em esquema fatorial 2 (4), consistiram de duas cultivares, Carajás e Primavera, duas doses de N, 30 e 60 kg ha- 1, sementes não tratadas e tratadas com fungicida pyroquilon e parcelas sem pulverização e com duas pulverizações, na parte aérea das plantas, da mistura dos fungicidas benomyl e difenoconazole. A incidência e a severidade da brusone nas folhas e nas panículas foram significativamente menores no PD em relação ao PC. A cultivar Primavera apresentou maior suscetibilidade à brusone nas folhas, independentemente do sistema de plantio. A dose de 60 kg ha- 1 de N contribuiu para aumento da brusone nas folhas, no PD e no PC, no segundo ano. As pulverizações com a mistura de fungicidas reduziram a severidade da brusone nas panículas nos dois sistemas de plantio. A produtividade foi maior no PC do que no PD e a cultivar Carajás foi superior à Primavera.

30|$|Since this {{successful}} QTL pyramiding, many {{trials of}} pinpoint improvement of Koshihikari {{have been reported}} (category A in Additional file  1 : Table S 1). Though the target QTLs were not cloned, their phenotypic effects in the Koshihikari genetic background have been evaluated and incorporated in actual breeding programs (categories B and C in Additional file 1 : Table S 1). In addition to successful trials of a Koshihikari BL series (Ishizaki et al. 2005) described earlier in this paper, improvement of <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> resistance (Sugiura et al. 2004) and development of a semi-dwarf phenotype (Wang et al. 2005) were also achieved by using DNA markers. However, pinpoint improvement of other agronomic traits, especially yield-related traits, is still in progress or under evaluation. This work has not encountered significant technical problems, but the improved cultivars have not always proven to be acceptable to Japanese farmers or consumers. Some problems, such as tight linkage, pleiotropy or introgression out of the target region, need to be overcome. The incredibly strong power of the Koshihikari brand {{has been a major}} barrier to dissemination of these new cultivars, even though they are NILs of Koshihikari.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, Koshihikari has disadvantages. Its lodging {{resistance}} was rated as ‘very weak’ (Takaya and Miyasaka 1981, Terashima et al. 1992) owing to its long culm and its low breaking strength (Ookawa and Ishihara 1992). Its blast {{resistance in the}} field was rated as ‘weak’ for leaf blast and ‘slightly weak’ for <b>panicle</b> <b>blast</b> (Ishizaka et al. 1989); although Koshihikari has some resistance genes, including Pish and Pik-s, blast races virulent against Pish and Pik-s are distributed widely in Japan (Kawasaki-Tanaka and Fukuta 2014, Kawasaki-Tanaka et al. 2016). It is susceptible to the leaf stripe virus and shows slightly strong resistance to bacterial leaf blight (Ishizaka et al. 1989, Ogawa et al. 1998). Koshihikari has medium incidence of bacterial brown stripe disease (Kadota and Ohuchi 1989). In addition, with global warming, average dairy minimum temperature from June to August has increased by about 1.1  °C from 1966 to 2001 (Kawatsu et al. 2007), and temperature during ripening period has also increased by 1.1  °C above that in past years (Sugiura et al. 2013). Therefore, a heat-induced decline {{in the quality of}} Koshihikari has been observed in many prefectures (Sugiura et al. 2013, Inoue 2012).|$|E
