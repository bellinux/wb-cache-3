50|$|Extended {{producer}} responsibility (EPR) {{is defined}} as an environmental protection strategy that makes the manufacturer of the appliance responsible for its entire life cycle and especially for the “take-back”, recycling and final disposal of the product. Essentially, manufacturers must now finance <b>product</b> <b>treatment</b> and recycling. Countries where this strategy has been adopted for waste appliances are: Switzerland (1998), Denmark (1999), Netherlands (1999), Norway (1999), Belgium (2001), Japan (2001), Sweden (2001) and Germany (2005), {{but it has also}} been expanded through legislation among certain South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Countries in which EPR has long been established, demonstrate that the combination of government legislation and sound company practices can produce a higher take-back and recycling rate. An example of this is the Sony Corporation in Japan, achieving a 53% recycling rate. Other ways countries approach the issue of waste appliances is either by offering recycling facilities or banning importation. Almost all countries, at least offer facilities that aid in appliance recycling. Many implement extended producer responsibility, in addition to recycling facilities.|$|E
40|$|The natural {{variance}} of agricultural product parameters complicates recipe planning for <b>product</b> <b>treatment,</b> i. e. {{the process of}} transforming a product batch from its initial state to a prespecified final state. For a specific product P, recipes are currently composed by human experts {{on the basis of}} heuristic matches between product state and recipe features. This approach makes use of standard recipes, that do not sufficiently reflect inherent differences between batches. Improvement of the recipe design process requires three problems to be solved: (1) assessment of the initial product state, (2) fixation of the recipe requirements and (3) design of a treatment recipe. To objectively assess the initial product state, additional measurement of a specific parameter is required. This parameter varies substantially between batches, requiring large measurement samples. Without objective assessment, however, automated determination of the recipe requirements and recipe design is not possible. This paper describes a procedure to get an objective initial state assessment, and presents a <b>Product</b> <b>Treatment</b> Support System that takes an initial state assessment, and performs the process of recipe design. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied at three points in the process. Induction of decision trees is used to determine rules that are understandable to experts and that select products most suitable for state assessment. Neural networks are applied to transform the assessment of the initial state into the overall requirements of the recipe. Finally, the actual recipe is derived by means of constraint satisfaction...|$|E

In {{the presence of}} dog pancreas membranes the translated α 1 -antitrypsin appeared as a larger <b>product.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with endo-β-N-glucosaminidase yielded a protein smaller than the reticulocyte translated product, presumably due to removal of the N-terminal signal sequence by membranes and sugar residues by endo-β-N-glucosaminidase.

The lipids were extracted from the nacre with methanol/chloroform mixture at room temperature and the extract composition was determined according to TLC and densitometry measures. Relative to the dry nacre material, a yield of extraction in lipids of 0. 54 % (w/w) was determined. Fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol and ceramides were in low abundance.
