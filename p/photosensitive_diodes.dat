25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single <b>photosensitive</b> <b>diodes,</b> resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for high {{resolution}} and wide field digital imaging using a micro-elctro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirror. Our {{solution is to}} introduce a micro-mirror into the image sensor optics that scans the object plane and makes correspondences between the image sensor and the image plane. In this letter, we present our first proof of concept prototype that generates images of higher resolution with wider field of view than the image sensor employed in the system. c © 2005 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 110. 0110, 350. 3950, 999. 9999 (MEMS Devices). Unlike traditional cameras that use film to capture and store images, digital cameras use electronic solid-state devices called image sensors (e. g. CCD, CMOS). 5, 3 These image sensors are pixilated metal oxide semicon-ductors that contain {{a large number of}} <b>photosensitive</b> <b>diodes</b> to capture light intensity when the camera shut-ter opens. The design goal of these images sensors is to maximize the resolution of the captured image. This can be achieved by reducing the size of the photo-sensors i...|$|E
40|$|The {{intercommunication}} of the {{defects and}} additions induced during ion implantation and following thermic annealing in the indium arsenide and antimonide has been considered. The diffusion {{parameters of the}} magnesium in the indium antimonide and arsenide have been made accurate. The self-gettering process of the beryllium in the indium arsenide has been discovered. It has been determined that the beryllium in the indium antimonide and sulphur in the indium arsenide don't diffuse at post-implantation annealing. The <b>photosensitive</b> <b>diode</b> structures having the record parameters have been created with use of the layers in the indium arsenide alloyed by a sulphur.

40|$|A linear position-sensitive x-ray {{detector}} for x-ray spectroscopy and diffraction applications {{has been tested}} which can provide excellent spatial resolution, wide dynamic range and good sensitivity. The heart {{of the system is}} a self-scanning, <b>photosensitive</b> silicon <b>diode</b> array. It is interfaced via fiber optics to a thin layer of ZnS which fluoresces visible light upon absorption of x-radiation. The conversion to visible light and optical coupling provide several-fold gain in the efficiency of detection as compared to the direct detection of x-ray by the diode array. Equally important is that the array is protected from irreversible damage by high energy radiation, a limitation which previously hindered this application of silicon diode technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the electrical and spectral characteristics of different layers to construct photosensitive elements in standard 1. 2 mu m CMOS technology. The use of commercial CMOS processes guarantees good reproduceability of the integrated sensors and optimized cointegration with sensor signal conditioning circuits. Deep and shallow <b>photosensitive</b> PN <b>diodes</b> and a vertical PNP phototransistor are investigated. Electrical on-wafer measurements with optical stimulation are performed and parameter extraction algorithms are established to create SPICE models. These models {{are suitable for}} the development of opto-ASICs. The validity of the model is tested using a 0. 3 mm 2 photodiode together with a two-stage transimpedance amplifier with a transimpedance of 5 MOhm at a 3 dB bandwidth of 90 kHz. the whole circuit is packaged using an optically transparent window in a plastic package...|$|R
40|$|In this work, main {{characteristics}} are considered of <b>photosensitive</b> Schottky <b>diode</b> structures – n-type ZnSe(Te,X) /Ni, where Х = O or Al, which are promising as ultraviolet radiation detectors in the 200 – 480 nm range. The Schottky barrier-based sensors show good sensitivity in the short-wave {{regions of the}} ultraviolet range, are practically insensitive to solar radiation at wavelengths above ∼ 460 nm, have rather short response time (∼ 1 ns) and quantum efficiency of up to 70 %. Typical values of the monochromatic current sensitivity Sλ in the 420 – 440 nm range is 0. 1 – 0. 15 А/W. Characteristics were studied of detectors using glass and interference light filters for singling out biologically active regions of A, B and C of ultraviolet spectrum.

40|$|An {{optocoupler}} is a {{semiconductor device}} {{that is used}} to transfer a signal between different parts of a circuit that need to be electrically isolated from one another - for example, where a high voltage is to be switched with a low voltage control signal. Optocouplers often can be used in place of relays. These optocouplers utilize an infrared LED (light emitting diode) and a photodetector such as a silicon controlled rectifier or <b>photosensitive</b> silicon <b>diode</b> for the transfer of the electronic signal between components of a circuit by means of a short optical transmission channel. For maximum coupling, the wave-length responses of the LED and the detector should be very similar. In switch-mode power supply applications, optocouplers offer advantages over transformers by virtue of simpler circuit design, reduced weight, and DC coupling capability. The effects of extreme temperature exposure and thermal cycling on the performance of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) optocoupler, Fairchild FOD 3150, were evaluated in this work. This 1. 0 A output current, high noise immunity gate drive optocoupler utilizes an aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) LED, is capable of driving most 800 V/ 20 A IGBT/MOSFETs, and is suited for fast switching in motor control inverter applications and high performance power systems. Some of the specifications of the isolator chip are listed. The device was evaluated in terms of output response, output rise (t(sub r)) and fall times (t(sub f)), and propagation delays (using a 50 % level between input and output during low to high (t(sub PLH)) and high to low (t(sub PLH)) transitions). The output supply current was also obtained. These parameters were recorded at various test temperatures between - 190 C and + 110 C...|$|R
