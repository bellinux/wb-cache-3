5|$|After the war, {{under the}} Polish People's Republic, the {{intellectual}} and academic community of Kraków was put under complete <b>political</b> <b>control.</b> The universities were soon deprived of printing rights and autonomy. The Stalinist government ordered {{the construction of the}} country's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta. The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks (now Sendzimir Steelworks owned by Mittal) sealed Kraków's transformation from a university city, into an industrial centre. The new working-class, drawn by the industrialisation of Kraków, contributed to rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} left of the Bastille except some remains of its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated to the side of Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and <b>political</b> <b>control</b> during the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Cornelius had no {{luck with}} the MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population of Rùm does appear to have become Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained <b>political</b> <b>control.</b> Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E

5|$|Having {{previously}} gained <b>political</b> <b>control</b> of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, {{who were}} based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} communist movement and tighten <b>political</b> <b>control</b> over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin Split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of <b>political</b> <b>control</b> whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{relaxation}} of authoritarian <b>political</b> <b>controls</b> in 1946, {{large numbers of}} people began to call openly for a return to traditional religious practice.

5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater <b>political</b> <b>control</b> {{at the expense of}} independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E
5|$|Locating new bodies is {{also not}} without {{political}} disputes. The European Central Bank's (ECB) seat had to symbolise its independence from <b>political</b> <b>control,</b> and was located in a city which did not already host a national government or European institution. New agencies are also being based in eastern Europe since 2004 to balance the distribution of agencies across the EU.|$|E

The Capitol, a highly {{advanced}} metropolis, exercises <b>political</b> <b>control</b> over the rest of the nation.

25|$|Besides the {{political}} officers, Party members and Party candidates also enforced <b>political</b> <b>controls</b> within the ranks.

5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her <b>political</b> <b>control</b> as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} cleared of its {{indigenous}} population {{prior to being}} mapped by the Ordnance Survey, so {{it is possible that}} many place names are speculative. Nonetheless, the significant number of Norse-derived names that exist eight centuries after Viking <b>political</b> <b>control</b> ended indicate the importance of their presence on the island. Of the nine hamlets that were mapped in 1801, seven of the names are of Norse origin.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four claimants to {{jurisdiction}} over Honduras. González Dávila held royal {{authority over the}} province. Pedrarias claimed jurisdiction by right of the expeditions he had sent under Soto and Hernández de Córdoba. Hernán Cortés claimed jurisdiciton by right of the expedition he had sent under Olid, and Olid himself. A fifth claimant would eventually appear {{in the form of}} the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, which would attempt to establish its own direct <b>political</b> <b>control</b> over the province. These rival claimants inevitably produced treachery, conflict, and outright civil war among the Spanish factions.|$|E

5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the <b>political</b> <b>control</b> of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{supported}} Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in {{an unsuccessful}} {{effort to prevent}} the Protestant majority from gaining <b>political</b> <b>control</b> over Maryland. Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His <b>political</b> <b>control</b> remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the <b>political</b> <b>control</b> of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|In the {{official}} records of another Bronze Age empire, {{that of the}} Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, {{as well as on}} recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean <b>political</b> <b>control.</b> Another similar ethnonym Ekwesh in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the <b>political</b> <b>control</b> of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E

50|$|Another {{means by}} which the Husák regime {{maintained}} control was to offer considerable consumer gains as a substitute for the loss of personal freedom.

The widespread availability of material goods placated the general populace and promoted overall acceptance of Husák's stringent <b>political</b> <b>controls.</b> During the late 1970s, however, Czechoslovakia's economy began to stagnate, and the regime's ability to appease the population by providing material benefits diminished.|$|R
