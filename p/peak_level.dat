Approximately 13,000–17,000vehicles use this section from Ishpeming eastward through Negaunee.

25|$|Many {{areas in}} Texas have wind {{conditions}} allowing {{for development of}} wind power generation. The number of commercially attractive sites has expanded as wind turbine technology has improved and development costs continue to drop.

40|$|The Internet is {{witnessing}} {{explosive growth}} in traffic due to bulk content transfers, such as multimedia and software downloads, and online sharing and backups of personal, commercial, and scientific data. Wide-area network bandwidth is expensive and this cost is forcing many ISPs to deploy middle boxes to contain bulk traffic. As a result, many Internet bottlenecks today are economic rather than physical. That is, for many links interconnecting distinct organizations, {{there is often}} plenty of available physical capacity. However, the cost of actually transmitting across these link is based on <b>peak</b> <b>levels</b> of utilization, for instance {{as measured by the}} 95 % link utilization.

25|$|Flucytosine is well absorbed (75 to 90%) {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, {{but does not}} decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to <b>peak</b> <b>level</b> decreases with continued therapy.

In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to accumulate. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100µg/ml.

40|$|Although {{studies with}} interleukin- 1 {{receptor}} antagonist (IL- 1 ra) in animal models {{have shown that}} IL- 1 contributes to mortality in sepsis, the mechanisms whereby IL- 1 mediates lethal effects are not well established. A possible mechanism is that IL- 1 enhances the activation and release of other inflammatory mediator systems such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, neutrophils, and secretory-type phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2). We investigated this possibility by assessing the effect of intravenously injected recombinant human IL- 1 alpha (rhIL- 1 alpha) on these plasma parameters in baboons. In addition, we examined the course of these inflammatory parameters in baboons after a challenge with a lethal dose of Escherichia coli and while receiving a 24 -hour constant infusion of IL- 1 ra or placebo. Intravenous administration of IL- 1 alpha (10 micrograms/kg) induced the formation of thrombin, {{as evidenced by the}} appearance of thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes into the circulation (<b>peak</b> <b>levels,</b> 188 +/- 92 ng/mL at 2 hours), as well as the activation of fibrinolysis, assessed by circulating plasmin-alpha 2 -antiplasmin complexes (PAP complexes; <b>peak</b> <b>levels,</b> 0. 4 % +/- 0. 03 % of fully activated plasma at 1 hour), the release of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA; <b>peak</b> <b>levels,</b> 6 +/- 2 ng/mL at 2 hours), and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI; <b>peak</b> <b>levels,</b> 724 +/- 246 ng/mL at 4 hours). Il- 1 alpha administration also induced the release of sPLA 2 (maximal levels, 336 +/- 185 ng/mL at 8 hours), but not degranulation of neutrophils. In the septic baboons, a significant reduction of the formation of thrombin (<b>peak</b> TAT <b>levels</b> decreased from 582 +/- 78 ng/mL to 219 +/- 106 ng/mL; P <. 005), the release of t-PA (<b>peak</b> <b>levels</b> decreased from 37 +/- 11 ng/mL to 17 +/- 2 ng/mL; P <. 001), and its inhibitor, PAI (<b>peak</b> <b>levels</b> decreased from 2, 639 +/- 974 ng/mL to 1, 110 +/- 153 ng/mL; P <. 001), was observed in the group receiving IL- 1 ra compared to that receiving placebo. The release of neutrophilic elastase was also significantly attenuated in IL- 1 a-treated animals (<b>peak</b> <b>levels,</b> 1, 024 +/- 393 and 655 +/- 104 ng/mL in control and treatment groups, respectively; P <. 05). The difference between sPLA 2 levels in both groups, although higher in the controls (maximal levels, 3, 140 +/- 1, 435 ng/mL in control v 2, 217 +/- 1, 375 ng/mL in IL- 1 ra-treated group), was not significant. Thus, IL- 1 contributes to activation of various other mediator systems in severe sepsis in nonhuman primates. We propose that these effects may explain the lethal actions of IL- 1 in this sepsis model and suggest a similar role for IL- 1 in severe human sepsi...|$|R
