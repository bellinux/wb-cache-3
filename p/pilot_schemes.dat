5|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> (designated as identification, {{referral}} {{and tracking}} (IRT) schemes) began with Bolton council in 2003 {{and was used}} by eleven other local authorities.

On 8 December 2005, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Ruth Kelly, made the official announcement of the introduction of the database, confirmed by the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, Beverley Hughes.|$|E

50|$|The general {{response}} to the DNH’s proposals was that the recording of all archaeological finds was important and that a consistent voluntary scheme to record finds should be established. As a result, in December 1996, the DNH announced that funding would be provided for two years for a programme of six <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes,</b> starting in September 1997. The main aim of the <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> was “to enable an accurate estimate {{to be made of}} the resources that would be needed to extend the scheme across the whole of England” (DNH 1997). The essential aim was to advance knowledge of history and archaeology.|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a low {{complexity}} MU-MIMO scheduling algorithm with BD and a reduced <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme.</b> A key contribution {{of this paper}} is that the user selection algorithm uses the determinant of a matrix composed of users' channel matrices so that the orthogonality as well as the channel quality of the selected users are measured. Its performance is close to the optimal scheduling algorithm, and has advantage over the other low complexity scheduling algorithms in terms of both sum-capacity and computational complexity. Another key contribution of the paper is a new <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> which reduces <b>pilot</b> overhead by using only one set of pilots called dedicated pilots. The simulations show that the performance of the new single <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> is comparable to the conventional two <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme.</b> It appears that the proposed methods of new scheduling and pilot reduction are promising for practical implementation of next generation wireless systems such as 3 GPP LTE Advanced.|$|R

30|$|In a {{multiuser}} multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) {{cellular system}} {{where there are}} many candidate users, {{it is critical to}} select a user group which maximizes the overall throughput of the system. However, the optimal scheduling strategy (exhaustive user selection) is computationally prohibitive when the total number of users is large. In this article, we propose a determinant-based user selection algorithm which reduces the search complexity without much performance degradation. A key contribution {{of this article is to}} use a matrix determinant as a measure of orthogonality as well as channel quality in user selection. Linear precoding schemes (zero-forcing beamforming or block diagonalization) widely used in MU-MIMO systems require two sets of pilots to estimate both raw and effective channels, which results in increased pilot overhead. In order to reduce the overhead, we also propose a new <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> with only one set of pilot, which is another key contribution of this article. The new <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> is combined with the proposed scheduling algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm with a new <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> reduces computational complexity and pilot overhead with negligible performance degradation compared to the exhaustive scheduling with a conventional <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|R
