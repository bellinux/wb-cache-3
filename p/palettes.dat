5|$|Since October 2002, Critchlow has {{continued}} to develop his new artistic style in several different 2000 AD stories, contributing {{to the success of}} Lobster Random in particular. While Critchlow's use of muted <b>palettes</b> has been criticised, his style has received praise for being highly recognisable and unique.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including <b>palettes</b> and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} {{utilized}} two color <b>palettes</b> {{prior to its}} current color scheme. The original colors, used from 1978 to 1998, consisted of red, white, and blue. From 1998 to 2014, the Sounds used a black and red palette similar to the club's current colors. Both color schemes {{were used in the}} 1998 season during the transition from one to the other.|$|E
50|$|The Libyan <b>Palette</b> (also {{variously}} {{known as}} the City <b>Palette,</b> the Libyan Booty <b>Palette,</b> the Libyan Tribute <b>Palette,</b> the Siege <b>Palette,</b> the Tehenu- or Tjehenu <b>Palette)</b> is the surviving lower portion of a stone cosmetic <b>palette</b> bearing carved decoration and hieroglyphic writing. It dates from the Naqada III or Protodynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3200 to 3000 BC). The <b>palette</b> was found at Abydos, Egypt.|$|R

5000|$|Depending on the context, {{the term}} <b>palette</b> and related {{terms such as}} Web <b>palette</b> and RGB <b>palette</b> can have {{somewhat}} different meanings. The following {{are some of the}} widely used meanings for <b>palette</b> in computer graphics: ...|$|R
5|$|The Naqada culture {{manufactured}} {{a diverse}} selection of material goods, {{reflective of the}} increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic <b>palettes,</b> and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines. During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{were based on}} real people: Aleph's mentor Okamoto was named after {{the owner of the}} building Atlus occupied during the game's development; Matsumoto was named after Ito's first landlord in Tokyo; and Mekata was named after an NHK reporter. Additionally, Red Bear was named after the evil organization from the superhero film Aikoku Sentai Dainippon. Some character designs were created with the Super Famicom hardware limitations in mind: Kaneko designed three different poses for the Twelve Heavenly Generals, which were combined in various ways with graphics for different heads and held items, along with different color <b>palettes,</b> resulting in twelve different combinations. He thought this acceptable as the generals were a group, and were meant to look cohesive.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color <b>palettes</b> and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E
50|$|Académie de La <b>Palette,</b> {{also called}} Académie La <b>Palette</b> and La <b>Palette,</b> (English: <b>Palette</b> Academy), {{was a private}} art school in Paris, France, active between 1888 and 1914, aimed at {{promoting}} 'conciliation entre la liberté et le respect de la tradition'.|$|R
2500|$|With indexed color images, the <b>palette</b> always stores {{trichromatic}} colors at a {{depth of}} 8 bits per channel (24 bits per <b>palette</b> entry). Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the <b>palette</b> entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the <b>palette,</b> the remaining <b>palette</b> entries are assumed to be opaque. The <b>palette</b> must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need <b>palette</b> entries for all 256 colors). [...] The <b>palette</b> must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image.|$|R
50|$|The Hunters <b>Palette</b> or Lion Hunt <b>Palette</b> is a circa 3100 BCE {{cosmetic}} <b>palette</b> {{from the}} Naqada III period of late prehistoric Egypt. The <b>palette</b> is broken: part {{is held by}} the British Museum and part is {{in the collection of}} the Louvre.|$|R
25|$|Numerous stone <b>palettes</b> {{found in}} Gandhara are {{considered}} as good representatives of Indo-Scythian art. These <b>palettes</b> combine Greek and Iranian influences, {{and are often}} realized in a simple, archaic style. Stone <b>palettes</b> have only been found in archaeological layers corresponding to Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian rule, and are essentially unknown the preceding Mauryan layers or the succeeding Kushan layers.|$|E
25|$|In Design mode, {{players can}} edit color <b>palettes</b> for {{existing}} commanding officers (after the player has unlocked the <b>palettes)</b> or {{create their own}} maps. In the map editor, {{the size of the}} map is fixed and the player cannot choose to use any of the new Black Hole buildings introduced in Black Hole Rising. There are also certain rules the player must adhere to in order for the map to be considered playable. Maps created in this mode can be saved on the game cartridge and can be played in multiplayer modes or sent and received to other game cartridges using multiple consoles with a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.|$|E
25|$|The Graphics Device Interface is {{responsible}} for tasks such as drawing lines and curves, rendering fonts and handling <b>palettes.</b> The Windows NT 3.x series of releases had placed the GDI component in the user-mode Client/Server Runtime Subsystem, but this was moved into kernel mode with Windows NT 4.0 to improve graphics performance.|$|E

25|$|Egyptian stone tools, {{while still}} in use, moved from bifacial {{construction}} to ripple-flaked construction. Copper was used {{for all kinds of}} tools, and the first copper weaponry appears here. Silver, gold, lapis, and faience were used ornamentally, and the grinding <b>palettes</b> used for eye-paint since the Badarian period began to be adorned with relief carvings.|$|E
25|$|Battle Maps {{remains as}} the game's shop, {{allowing}} players to purchase new {{content for the}} game by spending points earned in the other game modes. New content becomes available for purchase as the player progresses in the game. Available content for purchase includes new commanding officers, maps, and <b>palettes</b> to allow players to recolor commanding officers in Design mode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of {{graphical}} web browsers, graphics cards with 8-bit buffers (allowing only 256 colors) were common and it was fairly common to make GIF images using the websafe palette. This ensured predictable display, but severely limited the choice of colors. When 24-bit color became the norm <b>palettes</b> could instead be populated with the optimum colors for individual images.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} <b>palette</b> (invented by David Kassan) is a <b>palette</b> for oil painting, mounted vertically {{adjacent to}} the painting, so that the paints on the <b>palette</b> {{are in the same}} lighting as on the canvas, and so that the artist can look directly back and forth between subject, canvas, and <b>palette.</b>|$|R
50|$|The system <b>palette</b> is a copy in RAM of {{the color}} display's {{hardware}} registers, primarily a physical <b>palette,</b> {{and it is a}} unique, shared common resource of the system. At boot, it is loaded with the default system <b>palette</b> (mainly a master <b>palette</b> which works well enough with most programs).|$|R

25|$|Interiors {{are very}} simple, {{highlighting}} minimal and natural decoration. Traditional Japanese interiors, {{as well as}} modern, incorporate mainly natural materials including fine woods, bamboo, silk, rice straw mats, and paper shōji screens. Natural materials are used to keep simplicity in the space that connects to nature. Natural color schemes are used and neutral <b>palettes</b> including black, white, off-white, gray, and brown.|$|E
25|$|New {{innovations}} {{appeared in}} Amratian settlements as precursors to later cultural periods. For example, the mud-brick buildings {{for which the}} Gerzean period is known were first seen in Amratian times, but only in small numbers. Additionally, oval and theriomorphic cosmetic <b>palettes</b> appear in this period, but the workmanship is very rudimentary and the relief artwork {{for which they were}} later known is not yet present.|$|E
25|$|Very {{often these}} <b>palettes</b> {{represent}} people in Greek dress in mythological scenes, {{a few in}} Parthian dress (head-bands over bushy hair, crossed-over jacket on a bare chest, jewelry, belt, baggy trousers), and even fewer in Indo-Scythian dress (Phrygian hat, tunic and comparatively straight trousers). A palette found in Sirkap and now in the New Delhi Museum shows a winged Indo-Scythian horseman riding winged deer, and being attacked by a lion.|$|E

50|$|Like EGA {{uses the}} CGA color value {{to address a}} <b>palette</b> entry, the VGA {{hardware}} will also use the <b>palette</b> entries not directly as signal levels but as indexes to the color registers. Therefore, in the 16-color-modes, the color value from the RAM will reference a <b>palette</b> register and that <b>palette</b> register will select a color register. E.g. the default <b>palette</b> entry for brown (on CGA: 4 (red) + 2 (green)), contains 0x14 (dark green + normal red) on the EGA <b>palette.</b> The corresponding VGA color register 0x14 is preset to (42,21,0, or #aa5500, also and off cause brown).|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to think about and {{implement}} histogram equalization, either as image change or as <b>palette</b> change. The operation can be expressed as P(M(I)) where I is the original image, M is histogram equalization mapping operation and P is a <b>palette.</b> If we define a new <b>palette</b> as P'=P(M) and leave image I unchanged then histogram equalization is implemented as <b>palette</b> change. On the other hand, if <b>palette</b> P remains unchanged and image is modified to I'=M(I) then the implementation is by image change. In most cases <b>palette</b> change is better as it preserves the original data.|$|R
25|$|Vermilion, a toxic mercury {{compound}} favored for its deep red-orange color by old master painters such as Titian, {{has been replaced}} in painters' <b>palettes</b> by various modern pigments, including cadmium reds. Although genuine Vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications, few manufacturers make it, because of legal liability issues. Few artists buy it, {{because it has been}} superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic, as well as less reactive with other pigments. As a result, genuine Vermilion is almost unavailable. Modern vermilion colors are properly designated as Vermilion Hue to distinguish them from genuine Vermilion.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the art of}} the Indo-Greeks {{is poorly}} documented, and few works of art (apart from their coins and a few stone <b>palettes)</b> are {{directly}} attributed to them. The coinage of the Indo-Greeks however is generally considered as some of the most artistically brilliant of Antiquity. The Hellenistic heritage (Ai-Khanoum) and artistic proficiency of the Indo-Greek world would suggest a rich sculptural tradition as well, but traditionally very few sculptural remains have been attributed to them. On the contrary, most Gandharan Hellenistic works of art are usually attributed to the direct successors of the Indo-Greeks in India in the 1st century AD, such as the nomadic Indo-Scythians, the Indo-Parthians and, in an already decadent state, the Kushans In general, Gandharan sculpture cannot be dated exactly, leaving the exact chronology open to interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} known for its artistic use of cel-shading visuals {{together}} with its rich color <b>palettes,</b> stylized ambience, and crisp and strong real-time shadows. Developer Realtime Worlds was heavily influenced by comic books in creating the first Crackdown game and they used highlighted ink-like outlines to give it a comic feel. The game was also praised for its use of large draw distances that was seldom seen in other open-world games of its time. Crackdown 2 improved upon the visuals set upon by the first game. While using the same engine and the black outlining system, Ruffian Games used a more advanced crowd system, which allows more NPCs to be in the game while not affecting its play flow. Ruffian further tweaked Crackdown's draw distances by rendering the engine to allow the display of a larger vista of Pacific City.|$|E
