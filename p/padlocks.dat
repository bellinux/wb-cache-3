5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked <b>padlocks</b> on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E

25|$|The fence was not {{continuous}} {{and could be}} crossed {{at a number of}} points other than the official border crossings. Gates were installed to enable border guards to patrol up to the border line and to give engineers maintenance access to the outward-facing side of the barrier. Like the fence itself, the gates were designed to be escape-proof. They were hinged from the outside but opened inwards and the pivot pins were welded to prevent their removal. They were chained and locked with heavy-duty <b>padlocks,</b> and a sharp saw-toothed steel strip was bolted {{to the top of the}} gates to prevent them from being climbed.|$|E
5000|$|A love lock or love <b>padlock</b> is a <b>padlock</b> which sweethearts lock to a bridge, fence, gate, {{monument}} {{or similar}} public fixture to symbolize their love.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{molecular}} inversion probes (MIP) originated from <b>padlock</b> probes, a molecular biology technique first reported by Nilsson et al. in 1994 [...] [...] Similar to MIP, <b>padlock</b> probes are single stranded DNA molecules with two 20-nucleotide long segments complementary to the target connected by a 40-nucleotide long linker sequence. When the target complementary regions are hybridized to the DNA target, the <b>padlock</b> probes also become circularized. However, unlike MIP, <b>padlock</b> probes are designed such that the target complementary regions span the entire target region upon hybridization, leaving no gaps. Thus, <b>padlock</b> probes are only useful for detecting DNA molecules with known sequences.|$|R

He began to dam the river leading to his camp to keep boats away, and installed fences and <b>padlocks</b> to discourage land travelers. He put up signs around his land reading [...] "Danger: Land Mines". As added discouragement, he kept a 12-gauge shotgun with him at all times.|$|E
500|$|Fairbanks {{described}} Kingsley as [...] "an unusually permissive slave owner" [...] {{who wrote}} about the physical superiority of Africans to Europeans, armed his slaves for protection, and gave them <b>padlocks</b> for their cabins. Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's hands-off approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and [...] "encouraged {{as much as possible}} dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they were perfectly honest and obedient, and appeared quite happy, having no fear but that of offending me; and I hardly ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them." ...|$|E

This had increased by 1940 to 79,847 coins, all silver as gold coins were no longer being struck, and by 1941, many reserved coins could not be kept in the pyx, instead being placed in packing boxes, overflowing with sealed envelopes. By the late 1940s, more than ten million coins were being struck each day at Philadelphia alone; in 1947, Congress {{reduced the number of}} silver coins required to be put aside for assay from one in 2,000 to one in 10,000. This was done at the urging of the Department of the Treasury, as having to store so many assay coins was a burden to the Mint, and it felt that the number of coins available to the commission [...] would still be sufficient.|$|E

5000|$|In 1877 Yale & Towne {{was granted}} a patent for a <b>padlock</b> that housed a stack of levers and had a shackle that swung away when unlocked. It was a notable design because the levers were sub-assembled into a [...] "cartridge" [...] that could be slid into a cast brass body shell. The {{assembly}} would remain together by means of two taper pins passed through the shell and cartridge. This design gave the commercial <b>padlock</b> market a serviceable, rekeyable <b>padlock.</b> About twenty years later Yale made another [...] "cartridge" [...] style <b>padlock</b> that employed their famous pin tumbler mechanism and a shackle that slid out of the body instead of swinging away.|$|R
2500|$|When James Miln {{studied the}} stones in the 1860s, he {{reported}} that fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing, and subsequent work during the 1930s and 1980s (using bulldozers) rearranged the stones, re-erecting some, {{to make way for}} roads or other structures. In 2002, protesters invaded the site, opening the <b>padlocks</b> and allowing tourists free entry. In particular, the group Collectif Holl a gevred (French and Breton for [...] "the everyone-together collective") occupied the visitor centre for the Kermario alignment, demanding an immediate stop to current management plans and local input into further plans.|$|E

50|$|Nilsson et al. {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} <b>padlock</b> probes to detect numerous DNA targets, including a synthetic oligonucleotide and a circular genomic clone. <b>Padlock</b> probes have high specificity towards their target and can distinguish target molecules that closely resemble one another. Nilsson et al. also {{demonstrated the}} use of <b>padlock</b> probes to differentiate between a normal and a mutant cystic fibrosis conductance receptor (CFCR) where the CFCR mutant had a 3bp deletion corresponding {{to one of the}} ends of the probe. Since ligation requires the ends of the probe to be immediately adjacent to one another when hybridized to the target, the 3bp deletion in the mutant prevented successful ligation. <b>Padlock</b> probes were also successfully used for in situ hybridization to detect alphoid repeats specific to chromosome 12 in a sample of chromosomes in metastasis state. Here, traditional, linear oligonucleotide probes failed to yield results. Thus, <b>padlock</b> probes possess sufficient specificity to detect single copy elements in the genome.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} perform SNP genotyping, Hardenbol et al. {{modified}} <b>padlock</b> probes such {{that when the}} probe is hybridized to the genomic target, there is a gap at the SNP position. Gap filling using a nucleotide that is complementary to the nucleotide at the SNP location determines {{the identity of the}} polymorphism. This design brings numerous benefits over the more traditional <b>padlock</b> probe technique. Using multiple <b>padlock</b> probes specific to a plausible SNP requires careful balancing of the concentration of these allele specific probes to ensure SNP counts at a given locus are properly normalized. In addition, with this design, bad probes affect all genotypes at a given locus equally. For instance, since MIP probes can assay multiple genotypes at a particular genomic locus, if the probe for a given locus does not work (e.g. fails to properly hybridize to the genomic target), none of the genotypes at this locus will be detected. In contrast, for <b>padlock</b> probes, one needs to design a distinct <b>padlock</b> probe to detect each plausible genotype a given locus (e.g. one <b>padlock</b> probe is needed for detecting [...] "A" [...] at a given SNP locus and another <b>padlock</b> probe is needed for detecting [...] "T" [...] at the locus). Thus, a bad <b>padlock</b> probe will only affect the detection of the specific genotype that the probe is designed to detect whereas a bad MIP probe will affect all genotypes at the locus. Using MIP, one avoids potential incorrect SNP calling since if the probe designed to assay a given locus does not work, no data is generated for this locus and no SNP calling is performed.|$|R

[...] Two days before the expiration of the lease, Adina engaged three guards for the property and had a telephone installed in the rat-infested warehouse. [...] New <b>padlocks</b> were also installed. [...] On the evening of February 10, 1908, Sheriff John W. Tobin arrived with deputies in tow, an injunction barring De Zavala from interference, and assorted stakeholders of the outcome. [...] The guards were served with the injunction and removed from the property. [...] De Zavala refused {{to listen to the}} injunction and shut herself away in an upstairs area, without any provisions to sustain herself. [...] While not trying to physically evict her, the sheriff [...] had the electricity and telephone cut and threatened to send anyone to jail who brought her food. Nevertheless, both food and extra clothing were smuggled in, and law enforcement allowed water and coffee. [...] Sheriff Tobin eventually had the electricity restored for lighting to keep the rats at bay. [...] The 46-year-old Adina stated she was willing to die [...] for the cause. [...] The siege lasted three days and attracted spectators and newspaper coverage from around the country.
