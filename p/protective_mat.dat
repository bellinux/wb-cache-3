50|$|Forensic {{examination}} {{has determined}} that the paper of the Composition Draft and the paper of the Rough Draft {{were made by the}} same manufacturer. In 1995, conservators at the Library of Congress undid some previous restoration work on the fragment and placed it in a <b>protective</b> <b>mat.</b> The document is stored in a cold storage vault. When it is exhibited, the fragment is placed in a temperature and humidity controlled display case.|$|E
50|$|Erosion {{control and}} land {{rehabilitation}} are uses also. It establishes quickly {{to form a}} <b>protective</b> <b>mat</b> of roots and rhizomes, even when planted on soils degraded by earth moving or mining. Within five years, stands have produced up to 7000 pounds of dry root mass per acre in the top 8 inches of soil. Heavy root production holds the soil in place and restores its natural fertility by increasing the soil carbon.|$|E
50|$|In an {{undisturbed}} forest, {{the mineral}} soil {{is protected by}} a layer of leaf litter and an humus that cover the forest floor. These two layers form a <b>protective</b> <b>mat</b> over the soil that absorbs the impact of rain drops. They are porous and highly permeable to rainfall, and allow rainwater to slow percolate into the soil below, instead of flowing over the surface as runoff. The roots {{of the trees and}} plants hold together soil particles, preventing them from being washed away. The vegetative cover acts to reduce the velocity of the raindrops that strike the foliage and stems before hitting the ground, reducing their kinetic energy. However it is the forest floor, more than the canopy, that prevents surface erosion. The terminal velocity of rain drops is reached in about 8 m. Because forest canopies are usually higher than this, rain drops can often regain terminal velocity even after striking the canopy. However, the intact forest floor, with its layers of leaf litter and organic matter, is still able to absorb the impact of the rainfall.|$|E
5000|$|Diets low in roughage: produce {{less of a}} <b>protective</b> fibrous <b>mat</b> of {{material}} in the stomach, and requires less chewing and therefore results in less buffering saliva.|$|R

It included rust-proof chrome-nickel steel at the gaps and borders of the synthetic fibre mats, optional shatter protection element at underbody, aramid mats at roof, body columns, and front wall to the footwell and back wall, polyethylene <b>protective</b> <b>mats</b> {{in the areas of}} the doors, 22mm thick polycarbonate coating and multi-layered glass compound window, an electronics box in the engine compartment protected by aramid, optional xenon headlamps and Adaptive Headlight, optional Night Vision with 300 metres range, optional rear view camera, an intercom system and an attack alarm.|$|R
25|$|Cactus Jack {{wrestled}} Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, {{but being}} severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot {{to sell a}} storyline injury. Vader removed the <b>protective</b> <b>mats</b> at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in Have a Nice Day {{that they were the}} brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.|$|R
50|$|Forest {{fires in}} the boreal forests and tundra fires alter the {{landscape}} and release large quantities of stored organic carbon into the atmosphere through combustion. As these fires burn, they remove organic matter from the surface. Removal of the <b>protective</b> organic <b>mat</b> that insulates the soil exposes the underlying soil and permafrost to increased solar radiation, which in turn increases the soil temperature, active layer thickness, and changes soil moisture. Changes in the soil moisture and saturation alter the ratio of oxic to anoxic decomposition within the soil.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Lost in Cleveland" [...] storyline {{began when}} Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) first {{wrestled}} Vader on April 6, 1993. Foley and Vader wanted an intense match, so {{they agreed that}} Vader would hit Cactus {{with a series of}} heavy blows to the face. WCW edited the match heavily because it was against their policies to show the heavy bleeding that resulted. Foley suffered a broken nose, a dislocated jaw and needed twenty-seven stitches, but won the match via countout. Because the title did not change hands on a countout, WCW booked a rematch. Foley, however, wanted some time off to be with his newborn daughter and get surgery to repair a knee injury. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 23, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Vader removed the <b>protective</b> <b>mats</b> at ringside and power-bombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot and hand.

5000|$|After {{a victory}} over Hercules Hernandez at the Los Angeles portion of WrestleMania 2, Steamboat began his next feud with Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts. Their feud began when Roberts {{attacked}} him before their match on the May 3 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, which did not occur due to Roberts assaulting Steamboat. Roberts was initially reluctant to deliver the DDT on the concrete floor due to his fear that Steamboat {{would not be able}} to stop his head from hitting the floor, which, on this particular occasion, was not covered with <b>protective</b> <b>mats.</b> Vince McMahon and booker George Scott were adamant that the spot take place outside the ring. Only after assurances by Steamboat that he would protect himself did Roberts agree to it. Unfortunately, Roberts' fears came true and Steamboat was legitimately knocked out when his forehead hit the concrete. Roberts later described the sound as like a watermelon bursting. They later battled each other in a Snake Pit match (no DQ) in front of 74,000 fans at The Big Event in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which Steamboat won with a small package despite Roberts dominating virtually the entire match to that point. Their feud finally ended on the October 4 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, when Steamboat defeated Roberts in their Snake Pit rematch. Following the match, Roberts continued to attack Steamboat and was about to place his snake Damien on him, but Steamboat took his crocodile out of his bag and scared Roberts from the ring.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, however, Atler had {{significant}} struggles. Early in the year, at the American Cup, {{she became the}} first American woman to successfully complete a Rudi vault in competition, and won the gold medal on the event, as well as on beam and on floor. However, she once again fell off the bars during both days of competition [...] and placed third overall. Shortly thereafter, at the Paris-Bercy meet in France, she placed second in the all-around and won another vault gold medal, but severely injured her ankle during the floor exercise final when she landed out-of-bounds, in an area without <b>protective</b> safety <b>mats,</b> after her first tumbling pass. Atler recovered in time to compete at the 1999 U.S. Nationals, where she won the event titles on the vault and the balance beam. However, in the all-around, she once again fell from bars and finished second to Kristen Maloney.|$|R
5000|$|The next match pitted The Undertaker against Shawn Michaels. Michaels {{made his}} {{entrance}} descending {{on a platform}} to symbolize the light; in sharp contrast, The Undertaker entered second, ascending from the floor with fire shooting up from the stage. The match started with a fast pace by both men going for strikes to have them countered before Michaels feigned a knee injury to gain the advantage, and the pace slowed. This led to an exchange of signature moves and submission holds, which saw Michaels escape The Undertaker's Hell's Gate and dodge multiple attempts at the choke-slam while Undertaker blocked attempts at Michaels' Sweet Chin Music. The action went {{to the outside of}} the ring with Michaels attempting a moonsault, only to have The Undertaker avoid the attempt. This was followed by The Undertaker attempting a suicide dive over the top rope, only to have Michaels pull the nearby cameraman (played by Sim Snuka) into Undertaker. The spot, however, did not go as intended. The idea was for Michaels to push the referee out of the way, and pull Snuka into the path of Undertaker and for Snuka to catch Undertaker before he hit the ground. However, Snuka was standing too far back and Undertaker landed almost head first on the <b>protective</b> <b>mats</b> surrounding the ring. He remained {{on the floor of the}} arena for some time, while Michaels revived the referee, rolling him back into the ring and having the referee start to count out the Undertaker. The official started to count as the Undertaker started to revive, and when the official got to the count of 9, Undertaker rolled into the ring, managing to beat the count of 10. The match continued with both men performing all of their respective finishing moves. The Undertaker executed The Last Ride and Chokeslam, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music twice and Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver on Michaels - all of which scored near-falls. Undertaker won the match after Michaels attempted another moonsault only to be caught in mid-air by The Undertaker, who executed another Tombstone Piledriver for the win. As a result of this victory, The Undertaker remained undefeated at WrestleMania, extending his record to 17-0. Throughout the match, fans were split, chanting for both Undertaker and Michaels, and at one point chanted [...] "This is awesome", referring to the match itself. This match won the Match of the Year Award at the 2009 WWE Slammy Awards which took place live on WWE Raw. It also won the Match of the Year award from Pro Wrestling Illustrated and Wrestling Observer Newsletter.|$|R
