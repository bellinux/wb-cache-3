50|$|The fabric {{was first}} {{stretched}} on a <b>tenter</b> <b>frame</b> and sized with animal gelatine. The oil was then applied {{and allowed to}} cure between coats. As the cure relies on oxidation by the air, thin coats and long cure times between are required.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{craft of}} the Clothworkers was the finishing of woven woollen cloth: fulling it to mat the fibres {{and remove the}} grease, drying it on <b>tenter</b> <b>frames</b> (from which derives the expression 'to be on tenterhooks'), raising the nap with teasels (Dipsacus) and shearing it to a uniform finish. The Ordinances of The Clothworkers' Company, first issued in 1532 and signed by Sir Thomas More, sought to regulate clothworking, to maintain standards and to protect approved practices.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the textile}} industry's largest {{consumers}} of energy is the <b>tenter</b> <b>frame</b> dryer. To as-sist {{the industry in}} operating these dryers efficiently, a mathematical model which simu-lates the drying process and a scheme to solve for the parameters in the differential equa-tions of the model have been developed and are presented in this paper. Temperature pro-files predicted from the model are compared with profiles measured on commercial dryers. Also dryer simulation studies to elucidate optimal operating conditions are dis-cussed...|$|R
50|$|This {{shows the}} water wheel and fulling stocks and clay pots {{used to collect}} urine from the local cottages, that {{produced}} the ammonia needed for fulling. It goes on to show the later box system. There is a <b>tenter</b> <b>frame,</b> with the tenterhooks {{to show how the}} cloth was dried without shrinking and how teasles were used to lift up the nap. This was of course later mechanised and there is a teasle holding frame known as the Teasel Raising gig.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of biaxially oriented films {{can be performed}} with two techniques: the <b>tenter</b> <b>frame</b> and the double bubble process. The most important {{difference between the two}} processes is that in tubular orientation the MD and TD stretching are simultaneous. This event is very important specially in the case of biaxially oriented polyamide films to avoid hydrogen bonding which occur during the first stretching stage of <b>tenter</b> <b>frame</b> process and cause resistance to subsequent transverse direction orientation (1 - 4). Double bubble process consists in the stretching of a tubular film where the stretching ratios in the machine and transverse directions are determined by inside bubble pressure and the difference in roll speeds between the two sets of nips rolls that contain the bubble. The work presented here reports some results about double bubble polyamide films realised with a laboratory scale system. The study concerns the processability (5 - 6) of two different polyamides: a nylon 6 (PA 6) and a copolymer of the nylon 6 with isophthalic acid and isophorondiamine (PA 6 - IPA. IPD) at 5 % w/w of comonomer. Two main process arrangements where adopted differing for first bubble cooling technique: a water cooling and a air cooling. The films produced in both conditions were then characterised with a particular regard to mechanical and barrier performances. Morphological analyses were also carried out in order to correlate the process conditions to structure and properties of films...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} aspects on the {{processing}} of PMDA-ODA polyimides have been investigated. These aspects included the effects of curing procedure on residual stress development in polyimide films, characterization of stresses arising in films during processing on <b>tenter</b> <b>frames</b> {{and the effects of}} stress history on irreversible shrinkage behavior. ^ Chemical curing using a gel technique was found to reduce the development of residual stresses in PMDA-ODA films during cooling. Chemically cured polyimide films made from a gelatin technique possessed consistently lower in-plane thermal expansion coefficients than thermally cured films. This was due to increased in-plane orientation development in the chemically cured films during drying. ^ An analysis of stresses arising during <b>tenter</b> <b>frame</b> processing of polymeric films indicates the presence of large in-plane shear stresses as a result of stress gradients along the machine direction. These shear stresses vary linearly across the width of the line and are responsible for creating orientational anisotropy and non-uniformity profiles across the width as well. The principal directions of stress tend to lie at ± 45 ∘ to the machine direction but may be altered by machine and transverse drawing by the frame. Methods to eliminate or at least reduce in-plane anisotropy were discussed as well. ^ An investigation of strain storage behavior revealed a strong relationship between irreversible shrinkage and stress history in several different polymeric materials. Irreversible shrinkage in polyimide films was found to be largely due to the cooling of the materials under stress. Shrinkage behavior in PMDA-ODA and Upilex-R films could be described in a quantitative manner using linear viscoelasticity. ^ Two forms of highly crystalline PMDA-ODA based polyimide were formed by a high pressure imidization process. Polyimide powder with a density of 1. 46 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3 was formed by curing a polyamic acid solution in dimethylacetamide at 200 ∘C and 1. 38 MPa. Heat treatment of chemically cured gel films under the same conditions resulted in films with a density of 1. 44 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3. ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{he was no}} 'industrial capitalist', a {{term that}} is clearly an anachronism for this era. He was instead principally a wool merchant, dealing in English and {{domestic}} wools, and {{his role as a}} cloth merchant was only secondary ... he owned land, with many properties in Douia itself and a sheep farm outside. As a merchant, he provided wool on credit to industrial drapers, who pledged their cloths, looms and sometimes even their home as security; and some of them also rented their houses from him. But most of his wage-earning employees were those required for the wool trade itself: sorters, beaters, washers and some wool dyers (who worked in his dyehouse). Although Boinebroke did employ a few others in cloth making, chiefly to work some <b>tentering</b> <b>frames</b> that he owned, there is absolutely no evidence that he ever directly supervised the central processes of cloth production.|$|R
50|$|This {{stretch of}} the Goyt, shares much of it history with Stockport whose textile {{tradition}} started with the silk industry in the late 17th Century. By the 18th century the manufacture of silk was dominating the economic life of the town. Large silk mills, such as Carrs Mill, Park Mill and Adlington Square Mill, became the major employers of the town. By 1769 nearly 2,000 people were employed in the town's silk trade. In 1772 the silk industry was in depression and the town turned to cotton. Chadkirk was known for bleaching, where finished cloth was left stretched over <b>tenter</b> <b>frames</b> over the landscape. It was bleached by the sun. Clues to this activity {{can be found in}} the place names; place names such as whitehill or whitefield. Though an important early milltown Stockport was very late in embracing the joint stock limited liability company boom. The first mill to be financed by that method was Vernon Mill. Elder Mill was such a late nineteenth century mill.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation of the mechanical, thermal, and physical properties of polyimide coatings and films. In the electronics industry, polyimide coatings are commonly found as dielectric interlayers for high density multi-chip modules. As a film, polyimides are used as flexible printed circuit boards. Therefore, complete understanding of their properties can be important for material selection and reliability prediction. In addition, better comprehension of their processing can aid in improving the properties of the polyimides. ^ Orthotropic linear elasticity theory has been used to characterize several thin polyimides including novel fluorinated polyimides. Using a commercially available Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) Apparatus, the bulk compressibility and volumetric thermal expansion of the polyimides were measured. In combination with other techniques such as vibrational holographic interferometry, high pressure gas dilatometry, tensile testing, and thermomechanical analyzer, the out-of-plane Young 2 ̆ 7 s Modulus and out-of-plane coefficient of thermal expansion were determined. As a result, knowledge of the in-plane and out-of-plane elasticity coefficients and coefficients of thermal expansion can help in designing finite element models that predict the reliability of complex microelectronic devices. Similar characterization studies were done on poly(ethylene terephthalate) and bisphenol A polycarbonate. ^ From the initial PVT experiments on polyimides, irreversible densification was observed for some thermally cured polyimide films which were subjected to high pressures and temperatures. Using optical microscopy, wide-angle x-ray diffraction, and density measurements, studies were done to probe the changes associated with this densification behavior. The findings suggest that polyimides used as dielectric interlayers in multi-chip modules may crystallize under highly constrained situations and high temperatures. ^ <b>Tenter</b> <b>frame</b> processing is typically used to produce highly oriented polymer films. However, past studies have revealed that better quality polyimide films may be achieved by controlling its stress state during the tentering process. Therefore, the mathematics are detailed for measuring the complete state of stress in a polyimide film using wave propagation theory. Preliminary experimental research has involved a laboratory scale setup consisting of a means for inducing wavefront propagation, non-contact fiber-optic displacement sensors for detecting the wavefront, and an oscilloscope and computer for collecting and interpreting data. ...|$|R
