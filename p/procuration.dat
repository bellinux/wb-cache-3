In 1900 there were also two priests at the mission house at Han-kou and two at the <b>procuration</b> house at Shang-hai (Yang-tsze-poo Road, 10). By 1910 the Augustinian mission had 24 members of the order, two were indigenous Chinese. By 1947 the Augustinian mission counted 24,332 baptised Catholics as well as 3,250 preparing for baptism. They had established 20 major churches and 90 satellite churches. By that time there were 25 Chinese-born priests.|$|E

In Argentina, there were 25 priests and two lay brothers in the six colleges and schools of the order in 1900. In Ecuador, which formed a province by itself, there were 21 members of the order in 1900; being 9 priests and 7 lay brothers in the monastery at Quito; 3 priests in the convent at Latagun and 2 in that at Guayaquil. The province of Chile had 56 members in 1900, including 18 lay brothers; 11 at Santiago, 4 at La Serena, 5 at Concepción, 22 at Talca, 8 at San Fernando, 4 at Melipilla, and 2 in the residence at Picazo. The province of the United States of America increased in the end of the 19th century as the Augustinians were driven out of many European countries, and in 1848 sought refuge in the USA. The province numbered 200 members in 1900. The largest convent was then at Villanova, Pa.; it was also the novitiate for North America, and among the 117 religious then occupying the convent 21 were priests. The other convents contained 60 members by 1900, of whom 5 were lay brothers. The order (from Mexico) arrived in Cuba in 1608. It was suppressed by force in 1842. From 1892 the province of the United States had care of St. Augustine's College at Havana, Cuba, where there were 5 priests and 3 lay brothers in 1900 before they were expelled in 1961 by the government of Fidel Castro.|$|E

40|$|Architectural {{representations}} do {{not merely}} realize {{the transmission of}} intervened information between the architect and his audience. Through the growing importance of representation {{and the use of}} digital means of expression, which is obviously met in contemporary architectural discourse, one can safely suggest that in certain cases the information is created rather than treated or consumed through the procedure of digital representation.   The issue raised is of far greater range than just the replacement of traditional means of representation. One can already trace definite signs of a new communicative entity, profoundly based upon the use of digital means, alongside the classic body of architecture. This new essence is the result of architectural representation, in its autonomous interpretation, when it creates the meaning and the information that initially was assigned only to transmit. All these special conditions are more effectively reflected into a new concept, this of “high code architecture”. “High code architecture” implies and presupposes the existence of an additional inner mechanism that creates it. The procedure of emancipation of the architectural representations is rather incomplete without the validity of an associating mechanism between the representation itself and the represented object. This phenomenon can be studied through a diagram of de-materialization and reinstallation of architecture. This diagram is materialized in three distinctive stages: 1. The architectural object is de-materialized through various representations and <b>procurations</b> via digital, figurative and print media to finally become an image. 2. The images, as representatives and/or substitutes of an architectural object, re-materialize and form a kind of architecture that is of “abstracted perception” and free of theoretic and ideological weights. 3. An array of morphological types, “iconic picturesi is created, that form the base of the so called “high code architecture”...|$|R

In {{this article}} there are {{published}} the regesta of the parchments {{from the family}} archive of the Fanfogna Garagnin family, which are now kept in the City Museum of Trogir. This collection and consequently the division of material in this article are, for greater ease of survey, made in three groups. The first and the greatest group consists of parchments dating from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, which are than divided into subgroups according to the respective century and ordered chronologically. Most of these documents were written in the notarial chanceries of Zadar, {{but many of them}} came from the chanceries of Venice (ducali), Ancona, Split, Šibenik, Trogir, Hvar, Nin, Skradin and Pag, with a few documents from Rome or Padua. The oldest and most numerous are the documents which contain typical notarial documents containing contracts on selling and buying landed property, judicial suits, auctions, last wills, grants, <b>procurations,</b> receipts, contracts on dowries, appointing of executors of wills, contracts on selling salt-pans and so on. All these notarial deeds give a wide spectrum of data regarding everyday life, trade, judicial practice, microtoponymy and social relations, and in them the main actors are usually ordinary people, with only a few famous personalities. However, in a lot of these deeds the main actors were ecclesiastical persons, members of both of the regular and the secular clergy, including members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (bishops and archbishops). The second group consists of only five documents. Three of them, written on paper, are of a completely private character and relate to Anthony Fanfogna and the Garagnin brothers. One document is written in a Cyrillic script of the so-called western type (bosančica) and speaks of the sale of some land in the village of Zastina in Poljica, while the last document is written in German. The third and last group mostly consists of papal bulls issued by different popes from Pope Paul V to Pope Pius VI. These are mostly documents regarding the ecclesiastical career of Archbishop John Lucas Garagnin of Split. They are written in a peculiar type of chancery script, the so-called bollatica, {{and this is one of}} the greatest collections of charters written in that script extant in Croatian archives.
