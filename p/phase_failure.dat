Many systems from a range of industries experience such missions. The methods used for phased mission analysis are dependent upon the repairability of the system during the phases. If the system is non-repairable, fault-tree-based methods offer an efficient solution. For repairable systems, Markov approaches can be used. This paper is concerned with the analysis of non-repairable systems. When the phased mission failure causes are represented using fault trees, it is shown that the binary decision diagram (BDD) method of analysis offers advantages in the solution process.

Mission success is only achieved if each of the phases is successful, and each phase is required to achieve a different objective and use different elements of the system. The reliability analysis of a phased mission system will produce the probability of failure during each of the phases, together with the overall mission failure likelihood. In the event that the system performance does not meet with the acceptance requirement, weaknesses in the design are identified and improvements made to rectify the deficiencies. In conventional system assessments, importance measures can be predicted which provide a numerical indicator of the significance of the role that each component plays in the system failure. Through the development of appropriate importance measures, this paper provides ways of identifying the contribution made by each component failure to each <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> and the overall mission failure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ocular {{motor apraxia}} (OMA) in {{childhood}} is a poorly understood condition involving {{a failure of}} horizontal saccades. OMA {{is thought to be}} rare but the literature indicates wide clinical associations. OMA is often identified by abnormal head movements, but failure of reflexive quick phases has been reported in all but a few patients. The extent of this oculomotor disorder was examined in a large group of children with diverse clinical backgrounds. METHODS: The degree of quick <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> during horizontal vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus was measured using DC electro-oculography and video in 74 affected children, aged 17 days to 14 years. RESULTS: All children showed an intermittent failure of nystagmic quick phases, except for total failure in one case. Other visuomotor abnormalities were common including saccadic hypometria (85 %), low gain smooth pursuit (70 %), neurological nystagmus (28 %), strabismus (22 %), and vertical abnormalities (11 %). Non-ocular abnormalities were common including infantile hypotonia (61 %), motor delay (77 %), and speech delay (87 %). There was a wide range of clinical associations including agenesis of the corpus callosum, Joubert syndrome, Dandy-Walker malformation, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, vermis hypoplasia, porencephalic cyst, megalocephaly, Krabbe leucodystrophy, Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, infantile Gaucher disease, GM 1 gangliosidosis, infantile Refsum's disease, propionic acidaemia, ataxia telangiectasia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, vermis astrocytoma, vermis cyst, carotid fibromuscular hypoplasia, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and microphthalmos. Perinatal and postnatal problems were found in 15 % including perinatal hypoxia, meningitis, periventricular leucomalacia, athetoid cerebral palsy, perinatal septicaemia and anaemia, herpes encephalitis, and epilepsy. Only 27 % were idiopathic. CONCLUSION: Quick <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> is a constant feature of OMA, whereas abnormal head movements were detected in only about half, depending on the underlying diagnosis. This oculomotor sign is better described as an intermittent saccade failure rather than as a true apraxia.
