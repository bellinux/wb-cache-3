5|$|Leaving the building, Jeff finds all the <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{envelope}} to be blank. He {{returns to the}} office of Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|Sue informs Will {{that the}} club {{receiving}} {{payment for the}} commercial revokes their amateur status, and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals. Quinn, who {{has been trying to}} convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy, reminds Sue that as their coach she has often given the cheerleaders perks which would also render them ineligible for competition. She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders' six <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yearbook to the glee club. Sue agrees, and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team, but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader. Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals, as {{he was the one who}} accepted payment, and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement. The glee club then has their group photograph taken for the yearbook, but the copy in the library is subsequently defaced by hockey player Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and football player Azimio (James Earl).|$|E

5|$|The pair's latest book, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The Body Shape Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape. A few <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of PhilipII onward, although more solid evidence dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted {{as a means to}} introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). Although there is little evidence for royal <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Antigonid period, it is known that some of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168BC.|$|E
5|$|There are 48 <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current {{machine-readable}} {{navy blue}} passport. Frequent travelers may request 52-page passports for no additional cost. Extra visa pages {{can be added}} by mail (if the passport holder resides in the Republic of Lebanon) and at most diplomatic missions and consulates of the Republic of Lebanon abroad (if the passport holder resides or visits a country overseas). The addition of visa pages used to be free, but as of July 13, 2010, the non-refundable application fee for 24 or 48 additional pages costs 120,000 Lebanese Pounds or 80 US Dollars.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than half}} the <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript <b>pages</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very {{early stages of the}} series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve <b>pages.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
