5|$|In November 2006 Ofcom {{commissioned}} research among {{residents of}} the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to <b>pirate</b> radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to <b>pirate</b> radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for <b>pirate</b> radio. According to the research both <b>pirate</b> radio listeners and those running <b>pirate</b> radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently {{for the needs of}} the public at large. <b>Pirate</b> radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, <b>pirate</b> radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.|$|E
5|$|Licensed {{broadcasters}} {{may also}} take {{legal action against}} <b>pirate</b> radio stations. In 2000, the Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) {{for the first time}} initiated legal action against a <b>pirate</b> station.

5|$|<b>Pirate</b> radio {{met with}} {{increasing}} opposition, {{especially from the}} authorities {{in the form of}} the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) Radio Regulatory Division (and later the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after it became responsible for radio regulation) which had claimed since the late 1960s that <b>pirate</b> radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of <b>pirate</b> radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point <b>pirate</b> radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. <b>Pirate</b> stations such as Radio Invicta, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly. <b>Pirate</b> radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as reggae, hip hop, jazz, indie rock, indie pop and rhythm and blues. Stations like London Greek Radio, which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also catered to ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|The {{format of}} this wave of <b>pirate</b> radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations.

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 150 <b>pirate</b> {{radio stations in}} the UK. A large proportion of these <b>pirate</b> radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in Harlesden, Crystal Palace, Stoke Newington, Southwark and Lambeth. Set-up costs for <b>pirate</b> radio stations are minimal with a transmitter generally built by the engineer of the station. In days gone by these were powered by car batteries, but when the Pirates moved to tower blocks, the power came directly from the block room. <b>Pirate</b> radio stations may receive income from advertising and publicising events at nightclubs.

5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave <b>pirate</b> stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees.

A surge in <b>pirate</b> radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a <b>pirate</b> radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for <b>pirate</b> radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius.
