The proposed framework developed within the NOVI research and experimentation European collaborative effort, aims at providing a modular data, control, and management plane architecture that includes: an information model capturing the abstractions of virtualized resources residing in different yet interworking experimental platforms; resource mapping algorithms tackling the inter-domain virtual network embedding problem; mechanisms providing interoperability of monitoring tools; policy-based management services for role-based intra and inter-domain management policies; and dataplane stitching mechanisms to enable the composition of user-specific slices (baskets of virtual resources drawn from the federated substrate). The NOVI framework was deployed and validated in a combined testbed consisting of two dissimilar platforms: a private PlanetLab domain with resources interconnected over the public Internet; and FEDERICA, an infrastructure of virtual resources interconnected via dedicated networking facilities of European National Research and Education Networks and GEANT. This <b>pre-normative</b> <b>work</b> is expected to contribute to bridging Future Internet experimental federations with interconnected cloud architectures and interworked public/private data-centers, adding value via its intelligent services, information models, and composite algorithms.

40|$|International audienceThermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) {{data are}} needed for {{dimensioning}} of safety-critical parts, e. g. in power generation and in transportation by air, rail and road, and for designing of components, which operate at higher levels of efficiency and safety {{for longer periods of}} time. However, the current lack of a validated international standard for TMF leads to non-reproducibility of TMF data with negative implications on the design and economy of operation of many components. While a preliminary draft TMF standard has been written {{under the auspices of the}} International Standards Organisation (ISO), the TMF-STANDARD project addresses this issue at the European level, within the GROWTH programme of Framework Programme 5 funded by the European Commission. The R&D work in the TMF-Standard project has been started with the preparation of an inventory of institutions in the EU and the pre-accession states that perform TMF testing, and the testing methods and procedures which they apply. Afterwards, extensive <b>pre-normative</b> testing <b>work</b> has been carried out, the results of which have been considered in the drafting of a preliminary Code-of-Practice (CoP) that forms the base for the current validation round robin testing. The results of the validation tests are going to be subjected to statistical analysis, in order to substantiate the formulation of a validated CoP on strain-controlled TMF testing. The present paper summarizes the main objectives and achievements obtained so far within the TMF-Standard project, and gives an outlook on the further activities of the project...|$|R
